 Mr. President, today, most jobs require some kind of  postsecondary credential, whether a certificate. an associate's or  bachelor's degree. an advanced or professional degree, or an  apprenticeship. Moreover. the workplace is changing with automation,  artificial intelligence, and the so-called gig economy transforming the  nature of work. Yet, postsecondary education seems increasingly risky  or out of reach for too many Americans. That is why I am proud to be  introducing the bipartisan Partnerships for Affordability and Student  Success (PASS) Act with my colleague, Senator Collins.   At a time when we need to equip people with the foundational skills  and knowledge they need to succeed in this changing environment, we see  college costs and student loan debt soaring. We see too many students  who start postsecondary education unable to finish, leaving them in  debt but without a degree or postsecondary credential. As a result, we  see public confidence in our system of higher education declining.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 61 percent of  Americans say that our system of higher education is headed in the  wrong direction.   The federal government cannot solve this crisis on its own. States  are critical partners in making college accessible. affordable, and  accountable. However, state funding for higher education is lower today  than it was before the onset of the Great Recession. According to the  latest State Higher Education Finance report published by the State  Higher Education Executive Officers. public colleges and universities  have become more reliant on tuition dollars for their operations. In  2008, 35.8 percent of general operating costs were supported by tuition  payments. In 2018, that percentage increased to 46.6 percent. Today, in  27 states, tuition accounts for more than half of all higher education  revenue. Moreover, the only federal-state partnership program for need- based financial aid--the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership  (LEAP) program--has not received appropriations since Fiscal Year 2010.   It is time to renew the federal-state partnership for higher  education, first enacted in 1972 on a bipartisan basis. The PASS Act  will revitalize the federal-state partnership through a formula grant  to states with a focus on need-based aid, grants to institutions to  improve student outcomes and reduce college costs, and public  accountability.   In exchange for this new federal investment, states must make a  commitment to maintain their investment in higher education and have a  comprehensive plan for higher education with measurable goals for  access, affordability, and student outcomes. At least half of the  funding must be dedicated to need-based student financial aid. States  also have the option of awarding grants to colleges and universities or  partnerships between institutions of higher education and non-profit  organizations to improve student outcomes, including enrollment,  completion, and employment. and to develop innovative methods for  reducing college costs. I am pleased to have the support of the  National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, the  Center for Law and Social Policy, the Institute for Higher Education  Policy, the Association of Community College Trustees, and the National  Skills Coalition.   This generation is facing a crisis in college affordability and  student loan debt. With the PASS Act, we are providing the resources  and incentives for states to take more responsibility to address  college affordability and student loan debt and improve student  outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and look  forward to working with them to include these and other key reforms in  the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                            ____________________
