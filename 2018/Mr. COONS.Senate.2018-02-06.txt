Without objection, it is so  ordered.                        Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my  colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, in raising the alarm about a  decision I believe represents politicized policymaking at its very  worst. Just a few weeks ago, we were notified that the Trump  administration's Interior Department seeks to open up 90 percent--90  percent--of America's waters to oil and gas drilling.   This was startling news for Americans everywhere but particularly for  those of us who come from States along the Atlantic and Pacific  coastlines who had no expectation that our coastal waters were about to  be subjected to the search for oil and gas. The objections to the Trump  administration's decision came swiftly from elected officials in both  parties, Republicans and Democrats, because protecting America's  fragile coastlines isn't--or shouldn't be--a partisan issue.   This decision by President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Zinke  was not rooted in public input or scientific analysis. This decision  was not based on concerns about community safety or economic  prosperity. This decision was our administration putting their ``energy  dominance'' goals above all else.   I know several of my colleagues have already spoken out to discuss  what this means for their States and how it will impact their  constituents, but I am here today to raise my voice for mine, to fight  for Delaware. In Delaware, our coasts are critical to our local  environment and our robust economy. Delaware has 28 miles of Atlantic  coastline--some of the most pristine, most beautiful beaches in the  entire country.   As you can see in this graphic of our boardwalk at Rehoboth Beach,  DE, our 28 miles of coastline employ 10 percent of our total State  workforce. That is a remarkable amount of economic activity in a very  small space. Our coastline generates $6.9 billion in economic activity  every year and hosts thousands of acres of protected land. It includes  on our bay shore side two national wildlife refuges that serve as  critical  [[Page S628]]  habitat for bald eagles, white-tailed deer, and striped bass. The  future of our coastal economy depends on recreational access, fishing,  and tourism, which are now potentially at risk because of this ill- advised decision to open the coastline off of Delaware and the rest of  the mid-Atlantic to potential oil and gas exploration and production.   My colleagues know that I make an effort to promote pragmatic and  bipartisan ideas. It is one of my top priorities, day in and day out,  to work across the aisle and do what is right for our constituents and  for the United States.   Let me be clear. My view is not based on an anti-oil or anti-natural  gas message. I support an ``all of the above'' energy strategy and have  advanced legislation that will embrace an ``all of the above'' energy  strategy, and I acknowledge there are many places in the United States  where we can, and do, safely produce these resources, both onshore and  offshore. But what if we happen to face a spill of the scale and size  of Deepwater Horizon?   This is an overlay of the footprint of the 2010 oil disaster of the  Deepwater Horizon and how it spread to impact the gulf coastline. It is  perhaps a little hard to see here, but the State of Delaware and New  Jersey and its fragile coastline are underneath that footprint. It  suggests how we might end up facing dramatic impacts, negative impacts  on tourism and fishing that depend on clean coastlines to support tens  of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity in my  home State.   If we are going to think seriously about doing this, we need to think  about the impacts. We need to ask whether the costs outweigh the  benefits. When it comes to the Trump-Zinke plan to drill off the coast  of Delaware, I am here to tell you that the potential costs  dramatically outweigh the benefits. As you can see in this graphic, a  spill the size of the Deepwater Horizon could devastate all of our  beach communities and protected wildlife areas in Delaware and the  region.   Again, protecting our coastlines, an idea supported by scientists and  coastal residents alike, should not be a partisan issue. In Delaware  alone, multiple city councils, all up and down our coast, have openly  opposed offshore drilling through letters and resolutions they have  sent to me and the rest of our congressional delegation.   Coastal lawmakers from both parties have opposed offshore drilling. I  know for a fact the same is happening in virtually every other coastal  State potentially impacted by this unwise decision. These are the  people we should be listening to--the people who don't just visit the  coast for a week in the summer but who live on it, who rely on it, who  have built their lives and their local economy around it.   Instead, as this decision shows, the Trump administration is  prioritizing the oil and gas industry and partisan politics over those  of independent scientists, coastal residents, and the elected officials  who speak for our coastal communities. That was made painfully clear  when the Republican Governor of Florida, a close ally of the President,  petitioned to shield just Florida from potential oil and gas  exploration and production.   Sure enough, Florida promptly got a public promise from Secretary  Zinke that its coastlines would be spared. I am sure Florida's  coastline is beautiful. In fact, I visited Florida's coastline, and I  can tell you it is beautiful. But guess what; so is Delaware's. We  deserve to be able to protect our coastline just as much as Floridians  do. I invite Secretary Zinke to once again come to Delaware but to  instead see the coastline and see these fragile resources and see what  they have to offer for wildlife, for conservation, for fishing, for  hunting, and for tourism.   Secretary Zinke promising to exempt Florida is the Trump  administration deciding which States have to deal with oil and gas  drilling based purely on partisan, political considerations. I think  the state of our coastal communities and local economies shouldn't be  auctioned off to the highest bidder and shouldn't be subject to  partisan politics. Instead, they should be protected based on science  and based on the views of coastal communities.   I am here today to voice my profound disappointment in this blatant  neglect of local voices and the well-being of individual States and  coastal communities. I came to the floor to fight for my State and to  raise the local voices I have heard from our coastal communities. Our  coastlines are just too fragile and too vital and too important to let  partisan politics get in the way of their future.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
