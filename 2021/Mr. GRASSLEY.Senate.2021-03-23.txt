 Madam President, during committee review of Ms. Young's  nomination to be the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and  Budget, important questions were raised about whether she would uphold  and enforce the restrictions of the Hyde amendment if confirmed. I  found her initial response to a question put to her on the subject  troubling as it suggested she may seek to use her position to undermine  Hyde. However, after speaking with Ms. Young and pressing her on the  issue, I am satisfied that she will follow the law as written by  Congress without regard to her own personal views. She has assured me  that she has no intention to revise rules or regulations concerning  Hyde and understands it is not her place to change law. I therefore  have decided to vote in favor of her nomination.
