 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career  and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   Last week, President Trump laid out a plan to expand educational  opportunities for American workers. President Trump's dedication to  workforce development is admirable, and I am glad we have a President  who has made this a priority.   As someone who has worked in the construction industry for my entire  career, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to find skilled  workers. In fact, I spoke at the Associated Builders and Contractors  breakfast this morning, and they reported that there will be over 1  million job openings in the construction industry in the next few  years.   I have met with many industries in my district. The workforce is  aging. There aren't enough people who currently have the skills to take  over, and it can take nearly 2 years for people to be fully trained for  these positions.   First and foremost, it is our responsibility to make sure that young  people today are equipped for the job market of tomorrow. Getting an  education is essential, but it is equally important that our education  efforts are aligned with the in-demand jobs in our communities.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, this bill will bridge the gap between the  business community and education, which is critical to prepare  America's future workforce.   I am happy to cosponsor this important bill, and I hope that my  colleagues will join me in voting for H.R. 2353.
