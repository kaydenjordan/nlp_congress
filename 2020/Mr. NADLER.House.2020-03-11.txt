 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 891, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6172) to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act of 1978 to prohibit the production of certain business records, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA,  authorizes the government to collect foreign intelligence in the United  States under the supervision of a secret court.   It is one of the most complicated, technical statutes we handle, but  the story of FISA and how Congress reacts to its use is really very  simple.   Some measure of surveillance is necessary to keep our country safe.  Left unchecked, however, the executive branch is all too willing to  unleash its considerable surveillance capabilities on the American  people.   Our job as Members of Congress is to make sure that our intelligence  capabilities are robust, but also to provide that critical check, to  claw back authorities that go too far, and to press for changes that  protect our civil liberties to the maximum extent possible.   H.R. 6172, the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act, is one step in that  ongoing project of protecting our civil liberties.   It is by no means a perfect bill. There are many other changes to  FISA that I would have liked to have seen here, but this bill includes  very important reforms.   First and foremost, it ends the NSA's call detail records program,  which  [[Page H1628]]  began as part of a secret and unlawful surveillance project almost 20  years ago. This experiment has run its course, and our responsibility  is to bring it to its formal end. It should never have been permitted  to start, but now at least we can finally end it.   This bill also prohibits the use of section 215 to acquire  information that would otherwise require a warrant in the law  enforcement context. Our understanding of the Fourth Amendment has come  to recognize a privacy interest in our physical location, and this  legislation provides new protections accordingly.   As the law continues to evolve, the public will see how the  government applies these standards in the FISA court. This bill  requires the government to disclose all significant opinions of the  FISA court within 180 days.   The bill also requires a one-time historical review of all  significant opinions issued by the court since its inception. The  Department of Justice may have good cause to classify the details of  any particular case, but there is no reason that important  interpretations of the law should be kept secret. There never was, and  we finally managed to get rid of it.   Now, since we circulated the original draft of this bill, we have  heard from a wide range of stakeholders, from the most progressive  Members of the Democratic Caucus to the staunchest supporters of  President Trump, and they have convinced us to make yet additional  changes.   To address the concerns of those who seek additional guarantees of  privacy, we have added new retention limits, new reports to explain key  legal issues, and an explicit prohibition on the use of section 215 to  obtain GPS and cell site location information.   Other Members asked us to address the deep structural flaws in FISA  identified by the inspector general in the report issued late last  year. We have done just that. Working with our Republican colleagues,  we have mandated additional transparency in FISA applications, created  additional scrutiny for cases that involve elected officials, and  elevated the consequences for misrepresenting information to the FISA  court.   I should also address the Members on both sides of the aisle who  urged opposition to this bill because it does not contain every reform  we might have wanted.   Madam Speaker, I agree. It does not contain every reform that I want.  I am no fan of the underlying authorities.   I represent Lower Manhattan. I was in Congress when the World Trade  Center was hit. Then and now, I resented that the government exploited  9/11 to pass the PATRIOT Act, which was much too restrictive of civil  liberties, and other measures that I find dangerous and overbroad.   For many years, I led the opposition to reauthorization of the  business records provision of FISA, which we are finally doing  something about today.   I am a founding member of what was then called the PATRIOT Act Reform  Caucus to reform the PATRIOT Act. I have voted against every FISA bill  that did not contain significant reform.   But the measure before us today does contain significant reform-- again, not every change we would like to see, certainly not many of the  changes I would like to see, but very decisive steps in the direction  of protecting our civil rights and our civil liberties.   We are taking that step as we should--together, in a bipartisan  fashion, and in complete agreement that when it comes to safeguarding  our civil liberties, we have done what we could do, and we still have a  great deal of work to do.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from  the chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6172, the ``USA Freedom Reauthorization Act.'' There are       certain provisions in the legislation which fall within the       Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name Members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       Committees.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                        Chairwoman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to say that I am in complete agreement with the ranking  minority member that this is a very good bill, that we do a lot of  things that we ought to do, that we don't do a lot of things,  unfortunately, that we should do, but we did what we could.   Undoubtedly, the ranking member and I have different ideas. Some of  the things which he thinks we did not enough I think we did too much  and vice versa, but we did have some of the things he thinks that we  shouldn't have done I wish we had done. But we did manage to reach  agreement.   As I said, I believe it is a very good bill. It is not as protective  of civil liberties as I would like to see it, but we got as far as we  possibly could, and so I urge everyone to vote for this bill.   I know there will be some dissent on our side of the aisle based on  civil liberties concerns. I can only say that, with most of those  concerns that I have heard voiced, I agree with them, but we just  couldn't get them.   Before I close, I want to recognize the staff on both sides of the  aisle who have worked around the clock for the past few weeks to reach  a compromise and bring this bill to the floor.   Although there are too many to name here, I should single out the  following individuals: Aaron Hiller, Sophia Brill, and Sarah Istel from  my staff; Wells Bennett, Nicolas Mitchell, Raffaela Wakeman, and  William Wu from the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  majority; Ryan Breitenbach and Bobby Parmiter from the Judiciary  Republican side; Stephen Castor and Tyler Grimm from Mr. Jordan's  staff; and Laura Casulli, Meghan Green, and Allen Souza for the HPSCI  Republicans.                                time  1545    The country should be proud of what we have all accomplished here,  what they have accomplished here, and I thank each and every one of  them.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I will simply say that it is our  responsibility to work across the aisle and across the branches of the  government to bring our national security in line with our values.   We have done so here, but that work is an ongoing project. It must  not end today, because we have a long way to go yet.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the USA FREEDOM  Reauthorization Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
