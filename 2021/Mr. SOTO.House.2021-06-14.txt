 Madam Speaker, in honor of Caribbean Heritage Month, I  recognize Michelle Allman.   Michelle, otherwise known as Coach Mea Allman, born in Jamaica, comes  from a diverse, mixed cultural heritage: her father, Costa Rican, and  her mother, Jamaican, Arawak Indian, Scot. She was raised in Canada and  now resides in Florida.   She noticed early in her career the bullying of young people with  cultural accents in schools and the general lack of awareness about  their Caribbean heritage. Coach Mea felt a need to be part of educating  her Caribbean-American community by publishing an online publication  called Karibbean Under One Magazine in 2008, along with her son,  Michael Morgan, as cofounder and CFO, to show the richness of diverse  cultures; to be a community liaison for other Caribbean organizations  and businesses to provide resources, outreach, disaster relief; and to  help others to unite and grow our cultural awareness in the larger  community.   As a cultural advocate, she is passionate about building a welcoming  community with her Women of Kulture brand that comes together as  community leaders to educate, empower, and celebrate while keeping  their own sense of cultural identity.   As a certified professional life, health, and nutrition coach, she  encourages others to make, meet, and exceed goals in both their  personal and  [[Page H2742]]  professional lives by using her success as a 21-year breast cancer  survivor as a health advocate to produce and host her monthly virtual  show, ``G.L.O.W. 365 = Greater Level of Wellness 365,'' that brings  awareness of the latest health and wellness information in America and  the Caribbean islands.   She also celebrates and honors individuals who have overcome or  continue to battle chronic illnesses and conditions with her Ribbons of  Survivors 365 brand that launched in 2014.   Additionally, she is an empowering speaker for KweliWorks and host of  several virtual shows. And now, she is the international cultural  ambassador for the Orlando International Film Festival Lions Club. Her  focus this year is to provide a platform to celebrate Caribbean  filmmakers.   For this and more, Michelle Allman, we honor you.                                time  2130                      Honoring Rachelle R.

Originally of Caribbean descent from Jamaica West Indies, Doreen  Edwards-Barker relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, in the early  seventies.   Doreen's philosophy is ``no one is useless in this world who lightens  the burdens of another.'' She has accomplished this by pursuing a  nursing degree and attending Bethel Bible College. While attending  Bethel Bible College, Doreen joined a street outreach ministry team  feeding the homeless on the streets.   Looking at the possibility of a life change and an escape from cold  winters, Doreen and her husband, Aldwin Barker, chose to call  Kissimmee, Florida, their new home in 2002. Immediately, Doreen saw the  same need that she saw in Boston. She realized helping others was the  secret to living a happier, healthier, and more productive, and  meaningful live.   Her passion was in her giving. They founded Clarita's House, Inc.,  and that later changed to Clarita's House Outreach Ministry, Inc., or  CHOM, as a testament to her late mother, Clarity Edwards. The outreach  ministry has covered areas in Orlando for the Coalition For the  Homeless as well as now in Kissimmee.   CHOM consistently serves the unsheltered and homeless by helping to  build trust relationships with those hardest to reach. They also reach  out to people living in the woods and homeless shelters of the  community. This is done by providing groceries, new and gently used  clothing, hygiene supplies, and down-payment assistance when needed.   CHOM also works with the Infinite Scholars Program, facilitating  scholarship fairs for more than 500 students and their families,  resulting in $10 million in scholarship offers.   Doreen has been recognized multiple times within the community, even  though she has never sought recognition for her work.   CHOM was awarded the 2021 Best of Kissimmee award in the category of  charity services. Additionally, CHOM accepted the Second Harvest Food  Bank of Central Florida's selection as the 2020 Osceola County Agency  of the year.
