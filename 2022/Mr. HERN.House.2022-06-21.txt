 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, America is in crisis. Inflation is at its  highest in four decades. Drugs, weapons, and all other manner of  contraband, along with hundreds of thousands of unvetted migrants, are  pouring over our southern border with almost no resistance. Our  national debt is over $30 trillion, a sum of money that most people  cannot even begin to comprehend.   Suffice to say, the past 18 months of Democratic rule have been a  disaster. The American people are sick and tired of their government  recklessly spending their tax dollars while families struggle to put  food on the table and fill up their gas tanks.   Can you blame them? Families across the country are sitting at home  trying to make ends meet while the Federal Government runs around and  spends their money like it is going out of style.   President Biden often likes to tout his understanding of kitchen- table economics. However, the so-called budget that the President  produced a few months ago never balances and adds  [[Page H5721]]  trillions of dollars to our national debt over the next 10 years. There  isn't a single kitchen table in the country where you can spend more  than you make year after year and survive financially.   One of Speaker Pelosi's most famous phrases is: Show me your budget,  and I will show you your values. It is plain to see that Democrats care  little for financial responsibility and a strong American economy. They  won't even draft a budget.   I have been in Congress 4 years, and under Speaker Pelosi's  leadership, the Democrats have not created a single budget in the House  Budget Committee. If Congress continues down this path, we will add  $15.1 trillion to the debt this decade, $24.2 trillion in the 2030s,  and $41.8 trillion in the 2040s. These are incomprehensible numbers.   It is long past time to return to a state of fiscal stability. That  is where the Republican Study Committee's budget comes in. Our  Blueprint to Save America isn't just hyperbole. It is a no-nonsense  plan that slashes spending, reduces deficits, and bolsters our economy,  all things that the President's budget fails to do.   It is the most pro-life budget that the RSC has ever produced. It  ensures the protection of Americans' constitutional rights. It  solidifies our national security and secures our southern border. It  saves Medicare and Social Security from insolvency.   While the President's budget increases spending to $73 trillion and  taxes to $58 trillion, our budget decreases spending by $6.7 trillion,  all while balancing in just 7 years. This is exactly what our country  needs right now.   Tonight, we are going to hear from the hardworking men and women who  helped create this budget and who are committed to putting these  policies into action next year.   I thank all the members of the Budget and Spending Task Force for all  of their extremely hard work over the past months, as well as Chairman    Jim Banks for trusting me with chairing this task force for a second  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller),  my friend from the 12th District, a member of the Education and Labor  Committee, and a member of our task force.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his hard work over  the last 6 months to arrive at this budget. It is not a conservative  budget; it is an all-of-America budget. It is what all Americans have  to do, create a budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany),  another member of the task force and a member of the Committee on  Natural Resources, from Wisconsin's Seventh District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his  words.   What you just heard is what most of America experiences in our  individual families, our businesses, our cities, and our States. They  have to balance their budget. It is hard work. It doesn't know any  partisanship. It is constitutional and has to be done.   One of the first, primary things we should be doing as Members of  Congress is being good stewards of American taxpayer dollars. But what  I fear is that after people have been here for a period of time we lose  sight of that. It is not our money; it is the American people's money.   We need to be accountable to that. We need to not be running up $30  trillion debts and another $15 trillion on the horizon with the  President's budget, the only Democrat budget that has been put out,  that increases the debt to $45 trillion in the next 10 years, assuming  he can get $7 trillion in additional taxes out of small businesses and  individuals in America by allowing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's tax cuts  to expire.   The American people deserve better. We in Congress need to work hard  together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce),  my dear friend from Pennsylvania's 13th District, who is on the Energy  and Commerce Committee and a fellow classmate of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania for his words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a  dear friend of mine, somebody that knows a lot about budgets and  finances in his personal life, a member of the Financial Services  Committee, and a longtime study of what it takes to balance a budget in  America.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his  words and for his personal knowledge of how the budget is so important  to all the American people.   You have heard a lot from my colleagues about pieces of legislation  to be included in this budget. Some 203 pieces of legislation by some  82 Members of the Republican Party have been included in this budget to  design and develop and produce a balanced budget for all Americans. All  Americans sitting at their table, they don't look and see first if they  are Democrat or Republican. They don't care about politics when it  comes to spending.   Members of Congress talk about how they care about the least of us in  our economy across America. If we cared, we would sit down and work  together to produce a balanced budget, one like we haven't seen in over  20 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), my  colleague  [[Page H5723]]  from Utah's First Congressional District, and an outstanding freshman  member on the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague.   Mr. Speaker, as we look at inflation, and we heard one of my  colleagues talk about it earlier, it says it is 8.6 percent inflation  caused by excessive spending. We have heard this from many of the past  treasurers under the Obama administration. We have heard the current  Secretary of the Treasury admit that she got it wrong last year, that  excessive spending drove the inflation that we are seeing today.   The problem is that most Americans don't believe the 8.6 percent. I  mean when you look at gas prices up over 100 percent since Biden took  office. If you look at hot dogs--something as simple as an all-American  hot dog--up 64 percent; milk up 32 percent. And the numbers go on and  on and on.   The American people are struggling. We can do better. We must do  better. We must produce a balanced budget, get it on the floor to have  it voted on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my  dear friend, a member of the Committee on Financial Services, a very  innovative member.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very poignant  words on where America is right now and our ability to, once again,  return to energy dominance if we just get out of the way.   We were there some 16 months ago, 18 months ago, and we saw energy  prices at the pump at $2.39. All of America needs to hear that: $2.39  until policies of the Biden administration came on the scene. Now, we  are over $5 across America, with $6 on the near horizon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York. It is  refreshing for all of America to hear that New York cares about  America. We hear so many times that nobody cares. It is so refreshing  to hear your conservative values about something as simple as a  balanced budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  a member of the Agriculture Committee and the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. He is from another  [[Page H5725]]  State where we always assume that nobody cares about fiscal  responsibility in America.    Mr. Speaker, it is 45 percent of the economy in Oklahoma.  The Biden administration and the Democrats have made--it is very well- known. The President has said time and time again, and he said it just  in the last week, that the high gas prices in America, and that  Americans are suffering, are part of the grand transition plan off of  fossil fuels to electric vehicles and others.   Yet, in polling, when you ask the young Americans today where they  think electricity comes from, the response is the wall, not knowing how  electricity is actually generated in our generation plants around the  country. The fact that our grid can't even supply what they are  proposing to quickly convert our country to, and would destroy  economies throughout our Nation, it is really a tragedy to see what has  happened.    Mr. Speaker, I had the very great fortune of being  introduced to politics by the late Senator Tom Coburn.   When he was running for Senate in 2004, he quickly gained the title  of ``Doctor No'' because he was always pushing for responsible  spending. He wasn't against spending; he said we just should pay for  it. He wasn't against helping people; he said we should just pay for it  like you do at home, like you do in your business, like you do in your  cities or your States.   He was ridiculed by many Members over his time in the Senate because  he always pushed for fiscal conservatism, fiscal responsibility for  American taxpayer dollars.   In 2004, when he ran for Senate, and he spoke about this on the  campaign  [[Page H5726]]  trail, the national debt was $7.3 trillion. Here we are, 18 years  later, and we are approaching $31 trillion. I would say he understood a  little bit about being responsible with taxpayer dollars.   As you just alluded to, there should be no pride in either one of the  parties taking this acknowledgment of having a balanced budget. It  should be just what we do as Congress.   This should be a nonconversation. We should produce a balanced  budget, as we did under Newt Gingrich's leadership. As he just  acknowledged this week, it is time for us to return to the era of the 4  years where we had balanced budgets and a divided government, where the  House and the Senate were Republicans and the White House was the  Democrat.   President Clinton knew it was the right thing to do. He knew that we  had to be more responsible for taxpayer dollars and joined up and  created a bipartisan budget that lasted until the attack on us in 2001.  We have to get back to that.   Our Nation is under attack by the debt load that we are having. The  interest on our debt, much of which we will pay to China because that  is who we are getting our money from, is overtaking us. In the next 4  years, the spending on our mandatory interest on our debt will surpass  what we spend on protecting this great Nation and the support of our  men and women in uniform.   As we look at this, I just want to thank my colleagues from  California, New York, and across this great Nation who have worked on  this issue, not just on this budget and spending task force, but on  this issue. The very core of who they are and why they came to Congress  was to be responsible to the American taxpayers, not just to the ones  who elected them but to all Americans, Democrat, Republican, to be  fiscally responsible for their money, their hard-earned money that they  make back home. They go to work every day and send tax dollars up to  Congress. We have to do better.                                time  2015    The American taxpayers are much more responsible with their dollars  in their pockets than we are here in Washington, D.C. We need to return  the American taxpayers' dollars back to them. We need to be less on the  spending side and more on acknowledging that American taxpayers are  smart. They will spend their money in their communities better than we  will. That is why we need to rebalance our government.   So as I hear from constituents back home, they are worried that no  one in Washington cares about our spending anymore. They are worried  that there is no one left--even Republicans--who care about balancing  the budget.   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you I do. You heard the Members tonight. You  heard my friend from California talk about how he cares. He has cared  since he got here, and all the members on the Republican Study  Committee care.   Balancing the budget isn't a conservative idea. This isn't a budget  just for one party. This budget is our blueprint to save all  Americans--all Americans--not just Republicans. We are not excluding  Democrats. This is all Americans.   When Congress spends less, the American people have more. That is at  the center of what we do, what we are doing, and what we are here to  talk about.   I thank everybody, again, for coming and speaking tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
