 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleague,  Congresswoman Kim, to honor the winners and participants of 2021's  Congressional App Challenge.   Since the competition's inception in 2013, this official initiative  has given middle and high school students from across the country the  ability to participate in a program designed to inspire them to pursue  computer coding and careers in STEM.   Congresswoman Kim and I have had the privilege of shepherding this  year's initiative, which yielded more than 2,100 fully functioning apps  from over 7,000 students across the country.   Mr. Speaker, 340 of our fellow Members held challenges in districts  spanning all 50 States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana  Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C.   As excited as we are about this year's participation in the challenge  in terms of sheer numbers, the program would not be possible without  the students who invest their time and efforts into their passion  projects.   Congresswoman Kim and I are honored to co-chair this effort and offer  our remarks here today as a testament to the dedication of these  students who embody the future of American ingenuity.   To all the winners of this year's competition, we offer our sincere  gratitude and congratulations on your work.                            ____________________
