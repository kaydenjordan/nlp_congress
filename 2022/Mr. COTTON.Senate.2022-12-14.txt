 Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object--and I will--I want to make  a few brief remarks here about why I object to the passage of this  bill, the so-called PRESS Act, which would open a floodgate of leaks  damaging to law enforcement and our Nation's security.   The press, unfortunately, has a long and sordid history of publishing  sensitive information from inside the government that damages our  national security. During the Vietnam war, the New York Times published  the Pentagon Papers in an effort to demoralize the American people and  turn them against the war effort.   During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the press routinely revealed  details about America's efforts to hunt down terrorists, details that  helped our enemies cover their tracks and evade justice.   These leaks were reckless and harmful to our national security. Yet  the PRESS Act would immunize journalists and leakers alike from  scrutiny and consequences for their actions. This bill would prohibit  the government from compelling any individual who calls himself a  journalist from disclosing the source or substance of such damaging  leaks.   This effectively would grant journalists special legal privileges to  disclose sensitive information that no other citizen enjoys. It would  treat the press as a special caste of crusaders for truth who are  somehow set apart from their fellow citizens.   But that is not how the law historically has treated journalists. Our  laws have always made clear that journalists can be held criminally  liable for what they publish. In the Pentagon Papers case itself, a  kind of holy grail for the liberal media, Justice White wrote the press  is on ``full notice of the position of the United States and must face  the consequences if they publish'' material damaging to our national  security.   So while prior restraints were ruled out, consequences for violating  the laws of our country remained necessary, and they remain necessary  today as well because, moreover, if recent history has taught us  anything, it is that too many journalists these days are little more  than leftwing activists who are, at best, ambivalent about America and  who are cavalier about our security and about the truth.   For instance, as the publisher of the New York Times during the  Pentagon Papers case, Arthur ``Punch'' Sulzberger, wrote:         I am not sure that what we offer the Vietnamese peasant or       what their own leaders offer them is any better than what the       communists offer.   [[Page S7161]]     Think about that for a minute. The publisher of the New York Times,  whose family still controls it today, couldn't see a difference between  us--the United States--between Democratic Presidents John F. Kennedy  and Lyndon Baines Johnson and Ho Chi Minh, a murderous, communist  butcher. This is the kind of person we would be giving special legal  privileges to that no other citizen enjoys.   Supporters of this bill insist that it is necessary to grant  journalists this special kind of immunity in order to ``preserve the  free flow of information to the public.'' But, of course, there are  many legal avenues that whistleblowers can use to air their concerns  about potential government misconduct.   In the executive branch, they can go to their Agency's inspector  general. They can also go to the Office of Special Counsel, and, of  course, they can go to the proper oversight committee here in Congress.  Put differently, there is no shortage of legitimate and legal avenues  for whistleblowers to unveil potential government misconduct. But this  bill would allow any disgruntled bureaucrat, totally unaccountable to  democratic processes, to circumvent these legitimate channels and go  straight to the press, relying on the highly questionable judgment and  unaccountable judgment of these bureaucrats and reporters alone to  determine whether America's most sensitive secrets should be revealed.   And, finally, quite aside from all these grave concerns, this bill  hasn't been through the Senate's usual process for debating and  refining legislation. And, as I have explained, it shows. It hasn't  been through regular order. There have been no hearings, no markups, or  even a previous effort to pass the bill on the floor, to my knowledge.   This bill needs to be thoroughly vetted before we take such a drastic  step to ensure that we don't open a floodgate of damaging leaks to our  national security.   Therefore, Mr. President, I object.
