 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the economic  comeback we are seeing in Ohio and across our Nation.   In April of 2020, before the Biden administration took office,  America's unemployment rate was nearly 15 percent. With Democrats in  charge, that rate is down to 3.9 percent, millions of jobs across our  country. Under President Biden's and our Democratic Congress, we passed  the American Rescue Plan to prevent communities, universities,  hospitals from going bankrupt, to keep police officers and firefighters  on the job, and put our people back to work. And indeed, last year,  2021, 6.4 million new jobs were created across our country--an  unprecedented number. That is a wow by any measure. And 100 percent of  Republicans voted ``no'' on the rescue bill.   Now, thanks to the Jobs and Infrastructure Act, Democrats just passed  billions of dollars, and good construction jobs are going out across  this country to rebuild roads, bridges, airports, renewable energy,  next generation manufacturing, and keep the progress moving. And guess  what, 94 percent of Republicans voted ``no.''   I say thank you to the Biden administration. Thank you to the  Democratic party for picking this country up during the worst pandemic  in a century.                            ____________________
