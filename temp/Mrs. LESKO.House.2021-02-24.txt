 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.   The underlying legislation we are considering in this rule is wrought  with concerning provisions. One underlying bill, H.R. 803, is just  another land grab that will kill jobs, make our Nation hostage to  hostile foreign powers, restrict public access and recreation  opportunities on our public lands, and threaten our energy  independence.   Specifically, in my home State of Arizona, this bill has dangerous  implications for our mining industry. These provisions also threaten  our national security by making the United States reliant on foreign  nations for critical minerals.   The other bill in this rule, the so-called Equality Act, is anything  but equal. In fact, it is a threat to women's privacy and safety. This  bill effectively outlaws facilities reserved for biological females.  This includes restrooms, showers, and locker rooms. And outrageously,  this also includes women's domestic violence shelters.   As a survivor myself of domestic violence, I know the importance of  these women's shelters. They are critical for women who are trying to  escape domestic violence and sometimes sexual assault. Under this  Equality Act, a man, a biological man, identifying as a woman cannot  legally be turned away from any of these facilities.   Women will lose all rights to bodily privacy, safety, and security.  Vulnerable women across America deserve better, Mr. Speaker.   In addition, this bill will end girls sports as we know it by  mandating schools accept males into girls sports.   I stand in opposition to both of the underlying bills, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.
