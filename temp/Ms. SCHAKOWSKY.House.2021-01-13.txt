 Madam Speaker, last Friday, I sent a letter to my  constituents telling the story about the violent attack on our Capitol  Building, which is really like the temple of our democracy.   I have now taken the oath of office, the same oath of office that the  President of the United States has taken, that all of us here have  taken, and he has been the orchestrator of this attack.   It is time to hold this President accountable. It is time, and  history demands that we impeach Donald Trump a second time.
