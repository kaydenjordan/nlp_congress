 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  harmful, ridiculous rule because it pushes partisan provisions and does  not address the issues that actually matter to the American people, as  I hear in my district.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  that we can bring legislation like H. Res. 178 to the floor for a vote  to reaffirm our commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare.   These vital programs are lifelines for seniors. They provide our  seniors with the financial support and health coverage they have earned  and rightfully deserve.   In Virginia's Fourth, there are over 150,000 seniors on Social  Security and who are eligible for Medicare.   Virginians and Americans across the Nation need Congress to focus on  the issues that really matter to them, and I know hundreds of thousands  of seniors in my district rely on these programs to keep food on the  table and access the healthcare services and prescription drugs they  need.   For years, extreme Republicans have sought to cut Social Security and  Medicare benefits, privatize these programs, and raise the age of  eligibility for Social Security and Medicare. House Democrats stand  united in our efforts to strengthen and preserve these programs to  ensure our seniors have the support that they need to live with  dignity.   Mr. Speaker, it is past time for House Republicans to stop the  partisan messaging bills and get back to work on the challenges that  face our constituents.
