 Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe it has come to this. It is  astonishing and, frankly, angering that Republicans have chosen to take  Memorial Day weekend off, when they spent the last 3 weeks working  overtime to shortchange our veterans and military members.   Let's be clear about what has happened here. Republicans are walking  away because they can't get their way because President Biden won't  cave to their anti-servicemembers and anti-veteran demands.   Instead, we are teetering on the verge of a default; a default that  would disproportionately harm our Nation's heroes.   When the government runs out of money on June 1, guess whose benefits  are on the chopping block?   Veterans.   It is all because Republicans decided to play with fire without  stopping to think who might get burned. Our servicemembers and their  families deserve so much better. We all do.                            ____________________
