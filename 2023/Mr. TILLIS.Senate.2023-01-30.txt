 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great North  Carolinian, courageous veteran, and the last living survivor of the  Battle of Wake Island: Pearson Riddle, Jr.   Born in Pensacola, NC, on October 15, 1921, Pearson joined the  Civilian Conservation Corps at 18 years old upon completing high  school. After spending time in Oregon and California learning to  operate heavy machinery, he was sent to Hawaii to work for the U.S.  Navy and later joined the Wake Island workforce in August 1941 as a  general laborer, providing essential support services to U.S. Armed  Forces.   On December 8, 1941, Japanese forces commenced a successful siege of  Wake Island despite the valiant efforts of marines, sailors, soldiers,  and civilians. Pearson was among the hundreds of civilian contractors  captured by Japanese forces on December 23, 1941. Forty-four months of  grueling captivity and infamous brutality followed.   Pearson was kept on Wake Island until early 1942, when the Japanese  forced POWs to board the Nitta Maru, which was destined for a prison  camp in Woosun, China. After spending 19 months there in forced labor,  the Japanese shipped Pearson and hundreds of other POWs to Kobe, Japan,  and again to Tokyo where he was imprisoned until a May 1945 Allied  bombing destroyed the prison camp. Sent north to Sendai 7-B Hanaoka  after the successful Allied bombing, Pearson and the remaining POWs  were liberated in September 1945.   Malnourished, ill, and abused, it took Pearson 2 years to make a full  recovery, and despite lifelong medical complications from his  imprisonment, Pearson never stopped serving. After his service, Pearson  went on to build bases around the world, including in north Africa and  Iceland.   In 1987, the Navy administratively awarded Pearson the rank of E-4  and evaluated him as a 100 percent wartime service-connected disabled  veteran. Seventy-seven years after his liberation, Pearson received the  Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, and  American Campaign Medal for his heroic devotion to duty.   Today, we honor Pearson Riddle, Jr.'s valor, service, and commitment  to the values and principles of the United States of America. I ask my  fellow Senators to join me in saluting Pearson Riddle for his service.                            ____________________
