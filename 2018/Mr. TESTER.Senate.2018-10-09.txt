 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of 152,000 of my  constituents in Montana with preexisting conditions. These are folks  who are struggling with things like diabetes and heart disease and  asthma and cancer. Many of them are just one medical bill away from  bankruptcy. Thankfully, their health insurance is there for them when  they need it, whether it be for a joint replacement or to undergo chemo  or to have a baby.   Federal law holds health insurance companies accountable that their  plans cover us when we need it. Unfortunately, those rules are being  tossed out so big insurance can make a quick buck at the expense of  working families.   Just last week, health insurance companies started flooding the  market with junk plans. These plans are marketed as cheap insurance  that will keep you healthy. Fifty bucks a month for full coverage, they  say; $8.95 a week for top-rated coverage, they claim. Now, that is a  heck of a deal.   Well, not so fast. They are total and complete shams. If you read the  fine print, you will discover that dialysis, blood pressure pills, and  x rays aren't covered. In fact, most things are not covered.   Originally, insurance companies designed these plans to provide  stopgap coverage when you changed jobs or needed health insurance for  just a few months. They figured you could get by  [[Page S6714]]  with a bare-bones policy for a month or two. They were never designed  to provide coverage for an entire year, let alone three, but now that  has all changed.   Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to  sell long-term junk plans to Montana's families. What was once a short- term solution is now becoming a long-term problem.   So let's ask ourselves why we buy insurance in the first place. It is  for risk management. Why do we buy auto insurance? It is in case you  get in an auto wreck. You hope you never have to use it, but if you do,  you need that insurance to take care of that automobile to get it back  on the road again.   Why do we buy fire insurance? In case you have a fire. You hope it  never ever happens, but every once in a while it does, and if you are  unfortunate and it happens to you, you have fire insurance to rebuild  your home.   I am a farmer. Why do you have crop insurance? You have crop  insurance in that case where Mother Nature may not be smiling upon you;  you may not get the rain at the appropriate time or you may get a  hailstorm that wipes you out. You hope it never happens, but if it  does, you have that crop insurance you can depend upon to manage your  risk.   So why do you buy health insurance? Is it because you plan on getting  sick? I don't think so. It is because, if you get sick, you will need  the coverage. If you end up with high blood pressure, you have the  coverage to help offset those costs.   Unfortunately, with these junk plans, they are called junk for a  reason--because they don't cover anything. They give you a false sense  of hope and a false sense of coverage and you have no coverage.   I want to take you back to 1965. In 1965, my parents bought an  accident insurance policy. It was supposed to cover accidents. Guess  what happened in 1965. I got in a little accident with a meat grinder,  and that insurance policy covered nothing. My folks had to dig deep and  pay for the cost. When they thought they had insurance, they had  nothing.   I was young, but I can still remember how angry my father was that  they had been sold a bill of goods. That is exactly what it is with  these junk insurance plans.   Montanans are getting grifted. They are being sold a bill of goods.  They are being lied to, deceived, and I will do whatever I can do to  keep the junk out of our healthcare.   We must hold big insurance companies accountable. We cannot let  corporations swindle folks who need health insurance when, in the end,  they have nothing.   The bill before us this week does that. It keeps short-term plans  short term. It stops insurance companies from selling garbage plans  that don't cover preexisting conditions.   That is why I am urging my colleagues to vote for this resolution, to  stand up for Montanans across the State and Americans across this  country. These are folks who work hard to put food on the table, and  they shouldn't have to choose between a doctor's appointment and a  utility bill.   Today I rise for those folks from Miles City, Harlowton, and Libby  and promise to defend them from these shoddy plans.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor my staff director on  the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Anthony McClain.   Tony quietly works behind the scenes, fighting for our Nation's  veterans, Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve servicemembers.   In recognition of his selfless service, the National Guard  Association has awarded him the Patrick Henry Award for his  ``exceptionally strong support for the National Guard.''   This award is presented to civilians who have distinguished  themselves by superior service over an extended period of time in  support of the Armed Forces.   I cannot think of a more deserving individual.   Since Tony began working in the Senate in 2004, he has worked hard to  improve the lives of National guardsmen and their families. He cut his  teeth as legislative assistant to Senator Blanche Lincoln, then I was  lucky enough to personally hire him in 2010.   In my office, he wrote landmark legislation to expand guardsmen's  access to a quality education, and he went to the mat for the Montana  National Guard time and again.  [[Page S6731]]    Tony helped improve mental health services for guardsmen by writing  legislation that strengthens access to counseling at VA facilities.   He has written several bills that break down barriers for guardsmen  to utilize G.I. Bill education benefits.   When the Montana National Guard needs help with keeping their  equipment and resources in fighting shape, Tony is an ally they can  rely on. He helped secure additional aircraft, infrastructure, and  critical upgrades such as firefighting equipment or the recently  authorized C-130 apron expansion.   I could go on and on, but Tony's track record is clear.   Tony's ability to negotiate, compromise, see opportunity, and seize  it is second to none. He manages and motivates his team to excel, and  as a result, the lives of millions of guardsmen, Reservists, airmen,  and veterans are better.   As Senators, we get to stand on the Senate floor and pass  legislation. People like Tony make it look easy, but trust me it is  not.   For that, Tony deserves our heartfelt gratitude. So today, on behalf  of Montana and this Nation, I rise to honor Anthony McClain's service  and to say, ``Job well done, my friend.''                            ____________________
