 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of a great public servant, a mother, a wife, a friend to  many, and the longest serving employee of the Washington County North  Carolina School System, Mrs. Eleanor Patterson Barber. Some refer to  her as ``Mother Barber.''   Mrs. Barber, Mr. Speaker, the daughter of Charles Edgar Patterson, a  West Virginia Pentecostal preacher, and Lucille Patterson, a Georgia  native from the Southlands, was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on  November 13, 1933.   A graduate of the historic Crispus Attucks High School, Mrs. Barber  trained as a concert pianist and graduated from Lain Business College  in Indianapolis. She served in the Civil Air Patrol, where she met her  husband, the Reverend William J. Barber I, a minister, educator, and  activist with deep roots in eastern North Carolina.   With a strong passion and conviction for justice and equality, the  Barber couple, in 1966, relocated to eastern North Carolina to play an  essential role in the integration of the county schools. Though it had  been 12 years since the Brown decision, many Southern schools remained  fully separated by race.   While the decision to move southward from a northern metropolitan  city meant that their only son at the time, William J. Barber, II,  would enter kindergarten at a segregated school, they believed that  this sacrifice would, nonetheless, serve the greater good for their  family, Washington County, and the State.   Her little boy, William, some refer to him as Billy, is now  internationally known as Bishop William J. Barber, II, who was the  architect of the Moral Monday movement and is now the founder and  leader of Repairers of the Breach, or the Poor People's National  Campaign.   In 1966, Mother Barber began working as the office manager at the  Washington County Union Elementary School, while her husband taught  science at the school. In 1971, when Mrs. Barber began her duties at  Plymouth High School, she made history as the first African American  office manager at a desegregated school in that county.   Mrs. Barber's passion and conviction have led her to impact  generations of students over her 53 years of service. She has served 11  principals, and in some cases, she has watched students and their  parents and grandparents matriculate through the school. She also  helped teach countless young people how to play the concert piano,  often when they didn't have the resources to afford the lessons. She  has led choirs and served as the baccalaureate musician for the high  school for many, many years, and she continues.   In her more than half a century of service to North Carolina's public  schools, I, today, applaud Mrs. Barber for her years of dedicated and  committed service to our Nation's most precious resources: our  children.   Mrs. Eleanor Barber is a history maker, barrier breaker, and a  remarkable example of the transformative power of a willing spirit and  a dedicated public servant.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the  people of the First District, including the people of Washington County  and the town of Roper, where she resides, I express appreciation to  Mrs. Eleanor Patterson Barber for 53 years of committed service to the  Washington County, North Carolina, public schools.   Thank you to Mrs. Barber for your perseverance and your willingness  to give and to go the extra mile to pour into the youth all that you  had to offer.   Mrs. Barber, without exception, earned the right to be honored here  today on the floor of the House of Representatives. It is my hope that  God will continue to bless and keep Mrs. Barber and her family for  years to come.   I will say, Mr. Speaker, in closing, that Mrs. Barber has a wonderful  family. She gave birth to two biological children. They were both boys.  The first was Bishop William J. Barber, II.  [[Page H5778]]    Bishop Barber is married to Rebecca Barber, and they have five  children: Sharralle; William, III; Benjamin Joseph; Rebecca Eleanor;  and Andrew Willard--five wonderful, delightful children.   The other sibling deceased earlier this year. He lived in Grifton,  Georgia. His name was Charles Edgar Barber, and he was survived by  three children: Shakile, Malik, and Quentin.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you allowing me time this morning to  celebrate and to recognize a great American who has served well over  these many years.                            ____________________
