 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Honda Manufacturing  of Indiana for reaching the milestone of 2 million vehicles built in  Indiana. This accomplishment is a testament to Honda's commitment to  Indiana, the Sixth District, and to Greensburg. It is also a testament  to the strength and capabilities of our workforce in the Sixth District  and across Indiana.   With employment of more than 2,500 Hoosiers and investment exceeding  $1 billion, Honda Manufacturing of Indiana now has the capacity to  produce 250,000 vehicles a year. In 2018 alone, Honda purchased more  than $2.2 billion in parts from 51 suppliers located in Indiana.   On behalf of the people of Indiana's Sixth Congressional District, I  want to congratulate Honda in Greensburg on achieving this incredible  milestone.          Recognizing Hoosiers Attending Military Service Academies     Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Hoosiers who are  answering the call to serve. The Sixth District of Indiana has an  outstanding history in our Nation's Armed Forces.   Today, we take a minute to recognize a few young men and women from  the Sixth District who are continuing that tradition of service.   This year, the Sixth District of Indiana will be sending 10 students  to the military academies across the country.   Noah Algee of Columbus, Christian Hunt of Yorktown, Zachary Kuhn of  Shelbyville, and Caroline Swenson of Columbus will be attending West  Point Military Academy.   Finn Anderson of Columbus, Nathan Dickman of Richmond, and Sam  Russell of Columbus will be attending the Naval Academy.   Sam Horak of Columbus, Michael McGaha of Hope, and Emma Smith of  Columbus will be attending the Air Force Academy.   Congratulations to these 10 young Hoosiers who make all of us proud.  I thank them for choosing a path of service to our country.                     Biodiesel Tax Credit Helps Hoosiers     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the Biodiesel  Tax Credit Extension Act of 2019 so that Hoosier biodiesel producers  and farmers can operate with some certainty.   Biodiesel is a big market for soybeans in my district. Biodiesel  companies and their employees are facing an uncertain future because  the biodiesel tax incentive has been expired for 15 months.   The economic pressure is threatening the future of the industry,  putting good-paying jobs and production of domestic fuel at stake. It  is adding economic pressure to farmers, especially in our home State of  Indiana, who are already being hit hard by unfavorable weather  conditions.   If enacted, this bill will provide agriculture economy certainty and  relief for 2018 and 2019. The fact that it has expired has put the  brakes on the development of new biodiesel plants, and it has curtailed  biodiesel production.   The biodiesel tax incentive helps Hoosier producers and farmers  continue to invest in our future for growth, creating jobs and economic  opportunity.                        Reinvesting in infrastructure     Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate my commitment to  reinvesting in our infrastructure. As a businessman with experience in  transporting goods, I understand the critical role of infrastructure in  our economy.   We must put our partisan differences aside and explore every avenue  to upgrade America's infrastructure. Of course, we must be transparent  and deliberate. The plan must be cost effective with tangible returns  on our investment.   In Indiana, we have a website where you can see the dollars being  dedicated to infrastructure, and you can track each taxpayer-funded  project, its progress towards completion, and we need to do this at the  Federal level.   As the crossroads of America, the rest of the Nation can look to  Indiana for guidance on how to get something done to upgrade America's  crumbling infrastructure.                            ____________________
