 The last word will be very brief if I am recognized, Mr.  President.    Let me commend the chairman. I don't think we would be here  without Chairman Inhofe's leadership. I have never seen anyone work so  diligently and so constructively.   We want to thank the staff. They do a remarkable amount of work.   Also, we have to recognize our colleagues in the House--Chairman Adam  Smith, who did a good job, and Ranking Member Mac Thornberry, whose  name is on this bill.   I urge passage, and I commend the chairman.   Thank you, Mr. President.
