 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Wicker, I  rise today to recognize and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the  Emergency Nurses Association. Made up of 51,000 members from all across  the globe, the Emergency Nurses Association, or ENA, is the only  professional organization dedicated to advancing excellence in  emergency nursing and is the world's premier organization for emergency  nurses.   Founded in 1970 to set standards for best practices in emergency  nursing care, the ENA has provided continuing education programs for  emergency nurses, as well as a united voice for nurses involved in  emergency care.   Among its accomplishments, ENA has worked successfully to raise  awareness and improve outcomes for the Nation's trauma patients. For  Americans aged 44 years or younger, traumatic injuries--including car  crashes, falls, head injuries, burns, and firearm injuries--are  currently the leading cause of  [[Page S6399]]  death. Working to improve outcomes for those who have suffered a  traumatic injury, ENA offers courses for emergency nurses that provide  them with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on training needed to  deliver high-quality trauma care. ENA's trauma nursing core course is  one such course. Since its inception in 1986, this course has been  taken by more than 1 million emergency nurses and is now considered the  gold standard for the education of nurses in lifesaving trauma care  techniques.   ENA was also at the forefront of supporting the MISSION ZERO Act, or  the Military Injury Surgical Systems Integrated Operationally  Nationwide to Achieve ZERO Preventable Deaths Act. When this  legislation was signed into law last year, it created an innovative  program allowing military trauma teams and professionals to work in  civilian trauma centers to ensure the highest quality trauma care in  both peace and war.   Finally, ENA has been the leader in raising awareness regarding the  issue of workplace violence directed towards emergency nurses and other  emergency department personnel. At the State level, it advocated for  stronger criminal laws to hold those who assault healthcare workers in  hospitals accountable for their actions. At the Federal level, ENA has  fought for tougher workplace standards to ensure that hospitals provide  a safe working environment for their employees.   On the occasion of the Emergency Nurses Association's 50th  anniversary, Senator Wicker and I ask our colleagues to join us in  extending our deepest gratitude to the ENA and all its members for  their commitment to improving the quality of emergency care that has  and will continue to save the lives of millions of Americans across our  country.                            ____________________
