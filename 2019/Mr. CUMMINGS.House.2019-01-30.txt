 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 790.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 790, the  Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019, along with  my fellow colleagues of the local delegation. I pay special thanks to  Chairman Connolly and Majority Leader Hoyer for their leadership on  this very important piece of legislation.   H.R. 790, as amended, would authorize a 2.6 percent pay raise for  Federal civilian workers for 2019, the same raise that our military  servicemembers are receiving this year.   Historically, Congress has tried to ensure parity in pay increases  between Federal civilian employees and military servicemembers. This  bill would continue this longstanding tradition.   The bill would provide the pay raise to Federal employees in the  competitive and excepted services, blue-collar workers, members of the  career Senior Executive Service, and employees in the scientific and  senior-level positions.   The men and women of our civil service deserve this small increase in  pay because they have endured so much during the last several years.  They were subjected, Mr. Chair, to repeated and unrelenting attacks on  their pay and on their benefits.                                time  1045    They have suffered through pay freezes, hiring freezes, higher  pension costs, and furloughs due to sequestration and government  shutdowns.   Since 2011, Federal workers have contributed nearly $200 billion to  help reduce our country's deficit and to fund other government  programs. These hardworking, dedicated Federal workers include the  800,000 employees who were furloughed or forced to work without pay for  35 days during the longest shutdown in our great Nation's history.   The men and women of our civil service were held hostage to a  political dispute over funding for a border wall that the President had  stated over and over again would be paid for by Mexico. There is  something wrong with this picture.   They include members of the Coast Guard, TSA screeners, Department of  Agriculture workers who help farmers and ranchers, FAA air traffic  controllers and safety inspectors, FDA food inspectors, the FBI, EPA  pollution inspectors, Border Patrol agents, and Secret Service agents.   Given all the hardship Federal employees have experienced, they  deserve a modest pay increase to help make up for the years of freezes  and negligible increases and to help offset the cost of inflation.   The pay increase also would help the Federal Government compete  against the private sector to recruit and retain highly qualified  candidates to serve the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, let me be clear that there are many Federal workers who  are suffering and who have suffered. The message that we send to them  is that we care about them, and we know that they give their blood,  sweat, and tears over and over again. That is one of the messages we  send.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Government  Operations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me make it clear, Mr. Chairman: this is not about a border wall.  This is about building people and allowing them to sustain themselves.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), who is the very distinguished leader of our caucus.    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me say this, Mr. Chairman. Yesterday we had our organizational  meeting, and I made it clear that the distinguished gentleman from  North Carolina has been truly a person who has worked very hard in a  bipartisan way trying to come up with commonsense resolutions. So in no  way do I want the gentleman to feel as if that is not being recognized,  and we appreciate it.   It is just that we have a lot of employees who aren't making those  very high salaries. They are the ones who are living from paycheck to  paycheck.   Mr. Chairman, one of the saddest parts is when they go from paycheck  to paycheck it is almost like no check because when they look at their  bills, the bills are so much higher than their net pay. All we are  trying to do is make sure that they keep up with the cost of living.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Lynch), who is the distinguished chairman of our Subcommittee on  National Security.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today we are zeroing in on Federal workers whose average pay is  $60,000. We are zeroing in on folks who are, in many instances, barely  making it.   I don't want us to get it twisted. We have a situation where a lot of  times we discuss a whole lot of other things but don't necessarily  concentrate on the subject matter at hand.   Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, in our committee, we had a lady who came in  and told us that her daughter died. She died because she couldn't get  $333 worth of insulin a month. That happened in America.   What is my point? These dollars mean a lot to these Federal  employees.  [[Page H1302]]  I am not going to pit our military against our civilian employees. They  are all very important. I want them all to be well paid. But right now,  we need to concentrate on, again, building people and making a  difference in their lives.   Speaking of building people, Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton), a cosponsor of  this bill.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I insert in the Record an article from The Washington Post  that reports the Federal Salary Council, the official monitor of  Federal pay, found that Federal workers make an average of 30 percent  less than their private-sector counterparts.                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 14, 2018]     Federal Employee Salaries Lag by Average of 31 Percent, Pay Group                                  Reports                              (By Eric Yoder)         Federal employee salaries on average lag behind those of       the private sector by almost 31 percent, an advisory council       said Tuesday, while splitting between union and non-union       members on whether to recommend potential changes in the way       it arrives at that figure.        The average salary difference of 30.91 percent reported by       the Federal Salary Council is somewhat smaller than the 31.86       percent it reported at a special meeting it held April. The       figures of prior years were in the 34 to 35 percent range.        Those figures, based on two Labor Department surveys       covering some 250 occupations, stand in contrast to       assessments of some conservative and libertarian       organizations that have concluded that the advantage is about       the same or even greater in favor of federal employees.        The Congressional Budget Office last year essentially split       the difference. It found an average advantage for federal       workers of 3 percent, although within that average it said       there is a wide range by educational level: from a 34 percent       advantage for federal workers with a high school education or       less to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a professional       degree or doctorate.        Under a federal pay law, the ``pay gap'' as measured by the       Salary Council is to be used in setting annual raises varying       by locality for federal employees under the General Schedule,       the pay system covering most white-collar employees below the       executive levels. However, that law never has been followed       due to the potential cost of paying such large raises and       disagreements over how the figure is calculated.        In an August message to Congress, President Trump said that       following the law's formula would result in locality-based       raises in January 2019 averaging 25.7 percent plus an across-      the-board raise of 2.1 percent, at a cost of $25 billion.       ``Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,''       Trump's said in backing a pay freeze that he originally       proposed in a budget plan early this year.        A House-Senate conference underway on a spending bill will       decide between a freeze and a Senate provision to pay an       average 1.9 percent raise. Unless Congress passes, and Trump       signs, a bill specifying a raise, salaries will be frozen by       default. If the raise is enacted, it would vary slightly       among 44 city areas and what is called the ``rest of the       U.S.'' locality everywhere else; employees working in the       Washington-Baltimore area would stand to receive one of the       larger raises, probably around 2.3 percent.        The long-running controversy over comparing salaries flared       at Tuesday's meeting of the Salary Council, a group of       federal employee unions and compensation experts whose       decisions typically are unanimous.        A ``working group'' document produced since the April       meeting laid out a series of potential changes for       consideration by a higher-level body called the President's       Pay Agent. Those options included adding more detailed data       on salaries by occupation and level of work, taking into       account other data such as attrition rates, switching to a       ``total compensation'' approach taking benefits into account,       and conducting a very detailed review only once every four or       five years--the latter two of which would require a change in       law.        Council chairman Ron Sanders, a longtime career federal       personnel official who is now a clinical professor at the       University of South Florida School of Public Affairs, argued       in favor of exploring those options. ``I think it's obvious       to all of us that the current methodology is problematic,''       he said.        ``That methodology does not tell the whole story,'' Sanders       said. ``It's nice to say there's a 30 percent gap. If OMB       [the Office of Management and Budget] doesn't believe it, the       White House doesn't believe it, the Congress doesn't believe       it, what good does it do?''        He pointed to the testimony of officials of federal       agencies from several urban and rural areas not now receiving       higher city-based locality pay, who told of their       difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees despite       using special hiring authorities and incentive payments.       However, the current process doesn't support specific salary       rates for them, he said.        Two other members supported exploring the options: Katja       Bullock, associate director of presidential personnel, and       Jill Nelson, who leads an advisory committee on pay for blue-      collar federal employees.        However, members from federal unions argued against       changing the calculations and questioned whether the group       even has the authority to raise new options for       consideration. ``I don't think the methodology is broken,''       said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation       of Government Employees.        ``The elephant in the room is the Congress and the       president over time not funding the  [[Page H1303]]       pay system'' as the law intended, said Randy L. Erwin,       president of the National Federation of Federal Employees.       Anthony M. Reardon, president of the National Treasury       Employees Union, expressed concern that including the value       of federal benefits ``will be used as a justification to       reduce those benefits.''        The council adjourned without voting on whether to       recommend that the Pay Agent consider different approaches.       Afterward, Sanders said that in the annual report to that       higher-level body to be made by year's end, individual       members of the Salary Council could express their own       opinions.     Mr. Chair, it is so important that we do everything in  our power to support our Federal employees, and I want to thank Mr.  Connolly and Mr. Hoyer. They have given their blood and their sweat and  their tears for Federal employees: constantly standing up for them,  trying to make sure that they are treated fairly and given their due.   Just today, I spoke to two people who were telling me about how  Federal employees at NIH basically saved their lives--saved their  lives. One told me that the person who saved their life was making  about $65,000. This is a doctor. Come on now. And the other said it was  about, maybe, $70,000 at best.   These are people who could have been doing other things, could have  been making a lot of money, but they decided to give their efforts to a  greater cause.   Their names will probably never appear on the front page--or any  page--of The Washington Post. They won't be on ABC News. They will not  have the mansion that they could have gotten, but they have done  something that will have fed their souls. They have come to the job  with passion, compassion, and the desire to make things better, and  they are the ones who have determined that they want to put their  fingerprints on the future of generations yet unborn.   Then there are the others, like the TSA workers--you know the ones-- earning $28,000 a year and coming to work, by the way, during the  shutdown when they couldn't even afford the gas to get there. What  about them?   So we can make example after example after example, but one thing is  for sure, and that is that they are working hard and they deserve our  utmost support.   Now, if any message is going to be sent today, I pray, Mr. Chair,  that that message goes to our Federal employees that we care about them  and that they are not unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, and  unapplauded. No.   I hope the message goes out that we are upholding them and we realize  that it is just not about them. We realize, when they don't get their  raise, their family doesn't get their raise. When they don't get their  raise, maybe that little girl they wanted to send to ballet lessons  can't get them. We get that.   Or maybe that little vacation that they wanted to take, they can't  get that. They are not trying to get to Disney World. They are just  trying to get to the nearest amusement park with some tuna fish and  crackers.                                time  1145    Come on now. And that is what this is all about. We can talk about  fences all we want.   Right now, we are talking about the building of people and making  their lives the best that they can be. We only have one life to live.  This is no dress rehearsal, and this is that life.   I applaud the gentleman from North Carolina. I know his heart is  right, but right now, I want to concentrate on those folks, the ones  like people who live on my block, who get up at 5 in the morning, catch  the early bus to get to Social Security and places, and trying to serve  the public. I am talking about them.   Mr. Chair, I pray and I ask the Members to vote in favor of this  great legislation.   I thank Mr. Connolly, Mr. Hoyer, Ms. Wexton, and all of our  cosponsors, and I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Meadows).   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Fletcher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cardenas, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 790) to  provide for a pay increase in 2019 for certain civilian employees of  the Federal Government, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
