 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Conaway for his  leadership and the opportunity to speak today.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User  Relief Act. For the last 2 years, as a member of the Agriculture  Committee, I have worked continuously to improve the operations of the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission.   Through a great deal of bipartisan hearings, members were able to  hear from everyone at the table--the regulators, market participants,  and end users alike. When discussing how to ensure robust markets,  consumer protections, and relief for end users, H.R. 238 truly  represents a true agreement. After all, the end users are our  customers. They are the whole reason for this legislation and this  entity to begin with.   Another important provision included in this bill is language I had  previously introduced, the Public Power Risk Management Act, which  ensures that 47 million Americans who rely on public power for  electricity will not see their rates increase due to unintended  consequences of Dodd-Frank.                                time  1315    There are 2,000 publicly owned utilities across this country,  including one in my own district in the city of Redding, who have used  swaps to manage their risk for years, and this bill safeguards their  ability to do so while protecting taxpayers from high, unnecessary  costs.   Our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers--again, the end users--and other  businesses who pose no systemic risk to our financial system and did  not cause the financial crisis should not have to face costly red tape  from policies meant to protect them in the first place.   I want to thank, again, Chairman Conaway for leading on this issue  and for the hard work in committee, all the conversations, all the  background it takes to get this done and put the light on the practical  effects of the unintended consequences on the actual customers, the end  users.   This bill is about American producers and consumers. I am proud to be  part of this work product we have on the floor today, and I urge my  colleagues to support this measure.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple, straightforward  one, bringing clarity to the law and relief, again, to the end users,  such as farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers that use swaps to hedge  commercial risks associated with their business, including volatile  markets and price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. This critical  financial tool allows them to do their jobs and provide products in an  affordable and accessible manner, keeping consumer costs low.   Discussing Dodd-Frank, Congress always intended that these end users  should not have to clear the swaps entered to hedge these commercial  risks and provide the end-user exemption to that end.   The Commodity Exchange Act defines as a financial entity a person  predominantly engaged in certain financial activities. The Fed's  rulemaking when defining financial activities repeatedly states the  rule is for the purpose of title I; therefore, bringing it in to title  VII was something they did not have in mind when issuing their  definitions of predominantly engaged for financial entities. Therefore,  financial entities cannot rely on this end-user exception.   However, because of a catchall in the definition of financial  entities, end users who engage in successful hedging programs could be  regarded as financial entities, thereby creating barriers and  unnecessary restrictions to their business operations. This completely  turns the concept of being an end user in title VII on its head.   My amendment today ensures end users will not lose their ability to  rely on the end-user exception, which is a clearing requirement due  simply to the position performance of a transaction entered into solely  to mitigate commercial risk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H426]]         Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Human  Trafficking Awareness Month.   In my home State of California, human trafficking is a notoriously  large and dangerous industry, with over 300 reported cases of  trafficking that involved children, teens, and young adults last year,  including the very mysterious case that happened in November, that of  Sherri Papini from Shasta County, who may or may not have been drawn  into this. Fortunately, she was released on Thanksgiving Day. Indeed,  the whole State is thankful for her release and that she didn't get  caught in that horrible system.   We must do more to stop this human trafficking. That is why I am a  proud supporter of H.R. 440, the SHAME Act, which was introduced by my  colleague, Mr. Poe of Texas. The bill makes public the names and  pictures of criminals who have been convicted of buying sex from a  minor or from a sex trafficking victim--stripping their anonymity and  sentencing them to the public humiliation they deserve for their  despicable acts.   I believe the SHAME Act will help to discourage participation in  further human trafficking and will lead to a safer environment for our  children in America. We must combat this now--indeed, a very dangerous  and immoral problem.                            ____________________
