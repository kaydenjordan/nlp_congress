 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the just completed  chairmanship of Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Chucri and to  congratulate the incoming chairman, Supervisor Bill Gates.   Maricopa County is the Nation's fastest growing county, and Steve  Chucri has had a lot to do with our success. He has led efforts on the  board of supervisors to create a healthier urban environment, foster  more job connections, fight homelessness, and sustain good governance.  We are thankful for his service as chairman of the board of  supervisors.   Incoming chairman is Supervisor Bill Gates, and I congratulate him on  his new post. I know he will continue to lead Maricopa County well  throughout this next year.   I am grateful for individuals like Steve Chucri and Bill Gates who  help to make Maricopa County an attractive destination to millions of  men, women, and children.                            ____________________
