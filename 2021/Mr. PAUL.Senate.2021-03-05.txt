 Mr. President, I call up my amendment 1014 and ask that it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided.    Mr. President, the Paycheck Protection Program was created  to help small businesses. We should all agree that an organization with  thousands of employees working in dozens of cities across the country  is not a small business, but this bill has a provision that would  extend small business assistance to these kinds of large organizations.   That means that an organization operating in 100 cities across  America, with thousands of employees, will get money that was really  intended for small businesses. My amendment would remove this  provision, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this amendment is an insult to every cashier  at Walmart or bagger at Kroger who comes to work every day in person.  This amendment is an insult to every meatpacker or waiter or waitress  who comes to work every day in person.   Supporters of this amendment care more about government contractors  making $100,000 a year than they do about the people who serve your  food. If food servers and grocery store clerks can go to work in  person, I think government contractors can, too.    I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1391
