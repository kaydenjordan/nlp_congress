 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight one of the most  forceful and significant pieces of leverage on the world stage that  President Biden surrendered on his first day in office: America's  energy independence.   Later today the President will brazenly attempt to rewrite history by  hailing his so-called leadership amidst the horrific and heartbreaking  war unfolding in Ukraine while ignoring the self-inflicted crises he  has imposed on the American people. Yet no amount of spin, lies, or  deflection can hide the damage that Biden has done to our great  country--particularly through his failed, destructive, and reckless  energy policies.   On day one he killed the Keystone XL pipeline destroying 11,000  American jobs and delivering a crushing blow to domestic energy  production. Shortly after, President Biden infamously green-lit the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline--handing Vladimir Putin a victory long before  his Russian troops ever stepped foot into Ukraine.   Throughout the first year of Biden's Presidency, the current  administration embarrassingly begged OPEC to produce more oil while  stalling and even halting oil and gas permits here in the United  States.    To further weaken our position on the world stage, President Biden  withdrew U.S. support for beneficial energy projects around the world,  increasing our dependence, as well as our allies' dependence, on  foreign adversaries. President Biden removed U.S. support from the  Eastern Mediterranean gas pipeline that would have connected Israel's  offshore gas reserves to Europe.   In spite of lauding this project as a new opportunity and a  geopolitical win-win back in 2014 when Biden was Vice President, now  President Biden claims his priorities lie with moving away from fossil  fuels in order to promote green energy and renewables. Some may believe  President Biden simply had a change of heart, but this would be naive.  Instead, he has dangerously appeased the far-left flank of his party by  fully embracing Green New Deal garbage.   Enough is enough, Madam Speaker. It is abundantly clear that energy  independence is national security. And through every solitary energy  policy, the Biden administration has chipped away at our ability to  independently fuel our Nation, thereby damaging our national security.   Due to President Trump's powerful efforts, the United States was  recently energy independent just a year ago. Yet thanks to President  Biden's utopian Green New Deal fantasies, we have lost our energy  independence. So rather than strengthening domestic production by  having every energy industry firing on all cylinders, we are left  purchasing oil and gas from other countries, like Russia. Yes, Russia.   In fact, the United States buys over 635,000 barrels of oil every day  at over $103 per barrel. That is over $65 million every solitary day  that we are sending to Russia filling Putin's war coffers in the  process. I stand with patriots boycotting Russian vodka, pouring it out  all over the streets, supporting the Ukrainian people.   But why on Earth are we not boycotting Russian energy to put America  first and really hit Russia where it hurts: in the pocketbook?   Mr. President, we must immediately cease purchasing Russian oil and  fully unleash domestic energy production.   Ahead of his State of the Union Address tonight, I urge President  Biden to rescind existing regulations and reverse harmful executive  orders that undermine our energy independence. Restore oil and gas  production by swiftly authorizing vital leases and permits, and  abandoned radical climate rules and policies that obstruct our ability  to have domestic energy production roaring at full throttle.   Unfortunately, based on the President's most recent record, I fully  expect him to double down on his disastrous energy agenda. Just this  weekend, Press Secretary Jen Psaki comically claimed that we need to  reduce our dependence on foreign oil, on oil in general, and we need to  look at other ways of having energy in our country and others.   As a military veteran, I can assure the White House that renewable  resources are meaningless in fueling military equipment on the  battlefield and winning a war.   To no one's surprise, recent reports claim President Biden will tout  his energy policies tonight and request this body to deliver  legislation to achieve so-called clean energy that promotes climate  action. What a disappointment.   There is still time for the President to cease this capitulation to  the far left, stop putting $65 million every day into Vladimir Putin's  war chest, and put Americans first by fully empowering and unleashing  domestic energy production.                            ____________________
