 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise to express my concern and frustration with this  bill in its current form. While I appreciate the work done on this  NDAA, the legislation simply doesn't provide our military men and women  with the resources needed to adequately protect the homeland and could  negatively impact facilities in and around the Fourth District of  Tennessee, including Arnold Air Force Base, Redstone Arsenal, Oak Ridge  National Laboratory, and the Y-12 National Security Complex.   Whether it be refusing to deploy the W76-2 tactical nuclear weapon to  deter Russian aggression or underprioritizing funding for research and  development of next-generation capabilities, such as hypersonic weapons  and directed energy, this NDAA does not adequately meet the  requirements for addressing challenges posed from our adversaries.                                time  1800    Finally, this NDAA highlights my colleagues' continuing disregard for  the national emergency occurring at our southern border. This bill  prevents the DOD from playing a role in addressing the crisis. Our  military's number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. If my  Democratic colleagues refuse to provide funding for DHS to secure the  border, then the military must have a role.   Mr. Chairman, this bill, from its funding top line to its policy,  does not support our military or our security appropriately. For that  reason, I cannot support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''  [[Page H5349]]
