 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I love this country. I love this country for what it is. I  love this country for the principles and the ideas on which it was  founded. America is not a place. It is not a government. It is not a  people. It is an idea.   One of the ideas of our Founders is that the government is most  effective when it is local, the closest to the people.   I want to correct something that I think my colleagues on the other  side may not understand or are just not presenting to the American  people. Yes, the Constitution gives Congress the ability at times to  come in and modify election law, but this bill is so sweeping, it  strips the States of their constitutional authority that was given to  them by the Constitution by eliminating their influence in elections  altogether.   The true intention of the Founders when it came to this provision in  the Constitution was predominantly to ensure that the States could not  render the Congress ineffective by refusing to hold elections so they  would ensure that we always have a quorum here.   That was the purpose of that. We need to go back to the original  intent of the Founders when they added this in the Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, if you read the writings of the Founding Fathers, this  is ultimately clear. I want to read to you something that James Madison  said regarding the States' authority, especially when it comes to  elections. He said, ``The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution  to the Federal Government are few and defined. Those which are to  remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. . . . The  powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects  which in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives and  liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order,  improvement and prosperity of the State.   They could not be clearer that the States should be the ones setting  the laws regarding elections. This would totally undermine that.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), my good friend and colleague.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what the gentlewoman from Texas just  brought up, but part of the responsibilities of the State are to ensure  that those who have been given the right to vote are the ones voting.  That is why the States--and the Supreme Court has upheld this--have not  only the right, but the responsibility to ensure that the voter rolls  are purged of those who have moved, who have passed away, or who have  been shown as ineligible to vote.   Just a few weeks ago, I was able to write a congratulatory letter to  a new immigrant to the United States. For 16 years, she worked to  become a citizen of the United States, with the dream of voting. This  next election she will be able to cast her vote as a citizen of the  United States of America.   Part of our responsibility is to ensure that her vote matters and it  isn't discredited by someone who is not eligible to vote casting a vote  and diluting her  [[Page H2396]]  voice in this government. That is why it is more appropriate for the  States, who are closer to the people, to be the ones who are setting  the standards--according to our Constitution--for election.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Olson).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I thank my esteemed colleague, the majority leader, for  whom I have an immense amount of respect. I appreciate the words that  he said and especially his participation in the commemoration of the  march in Selma, in which my family has also participated.   Have we always got it right in the United States? No. Our Founders  knew that we would make mistakes along the way, but they gave us the  power and the ability to correct those mistakes.   The lack of civil rights in this Nation was a travesty to the people.  It flew in the face of the ideas of our Founders that all men were  created equal. That is why Republicans fought so hard for civil rights  during the 1960s and 1970s.   I agree with the majority leader. We do have the ability, according  to the Constitution, to make modifications. But H.R. 1 is not a  modification. It is a sweeping takeover of the election system, leaving  the States with very little authority or power over their own  elections, as well as the Federal elections.   I also would like to say that I heard that this bill has had  extensive hearings. I serve on the Committee on House Administration,  the only committee which had a hearing on this bill. The hearing lasted  5 hours, and the only reason it lasted that long was because the  Republicans submitted 28 amendments to the bill. Otherwise, this bill  would have gone right in and right out of committee, with probably less  than an hour of a committee hearing, and come to this floor.   It has 10 committees of jurisdiction. It has not gone before those  committees, so I submit it has not followed regular order.   Especially with something of this magnitude, the American people have  the right to hear, they have the right to understand, what is in this  bill. They have not been afforded that opportunity.   Mr. Chair, we have 50 States, 50 State Governors, 50 secretaries of  state, and I know my Governor and secretary of state have not been  involved in this process. It has a drastic impact, not only upon the  voting rights of the people in Georgia, but also on the budget of  Georgia, the fiscal cost.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the gentleman and the author of the bill and his  comments. Are there some good ideas in this bill? Absolutely. The  States already have them implemented. Early voting. Great idea. Georgia  did that many years ago; even included Saturday voting.   It is improper for the Federal Government to be the arbitrator of  these, to push these down upon the American people. That is something  that has been reserved for the States and the States have been doing  those well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I do want to commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for  something that they have accomplished with H.R. 1, and that is unity,  because this bill has brought the American Civil Liberties Union,  National Right to Life, The Heritage Foundation, and the U.S. Chamber  in unity in opposition to this bill, something that I thought I would  never see happen here in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins).
