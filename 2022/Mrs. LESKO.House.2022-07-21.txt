 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8373.   I am here today with my Republican colleagues to stand up for the  health and safety of women and girls across our Nation.   It is unfortunate that this bill is written in such a way that it is  unclear that it just covers traditional contraceptives. It is  disappointing to see that my colleagues across the aisle are continuing  to push their extreme abortion on demand agenda.   It is unclear why those who call themselves the ``party of women''  insist on prioritizing the billion-dollar, far-left abortion lobby over  women and girls.   This legislation--the payouts for Planned Parenthood act--permits the  widespread use of chemical abortion pills. The FDA deems these drugs as  high-risk because they can cause excessive bleeding, intense pain,  infections, and even death.   To make matters even worse, this bill allows abortion providers to  administer non-FDA approved drugs and devices to women and girls  without any regard for the drug's efficacy or the safety of the  patient.   We should not be promoting the widespread and unsupervised use of  high-risk or unapproved drugs that could endanger women and girls'  lives, and almost certainly will end the lives of their babies.   This legislation also erodes decades of bipartisan agreement that  taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. Instead, the  payouts for Planned Parenthood act forces States to direct more Federal  funding to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.   This legislation is not about protecting access to contraception. It  is not about protecting the rights of women and girls. It is about one  thing, and one thing only, lining the pockets of Planned Parenthood and  the rest of the abortion lobby.
