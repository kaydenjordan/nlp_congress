 Madam Speaker, the American people know that we cannot  sit idly by and watch preventable gun deaths happen day after day, year  after year.   Over the past few weeks, I have heard from hundreds of constituents  of all ages and all walks of life who are demanding action to reduce  gun violence.   When our Framers gathered in Philadelphia to write the Constitution,  they were explicit about the purposes of that entire document: . . .  establish justice, to insure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense''--not individual Armageddon--``promote the general  welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our  posterity.''   With those words, our Government was created to meet the needs of the  people.   But how can we meet the needs of the people if we don't take action  to prevent them from being gunned down in their schools, workplaces,  houses of worship, or neighborhood streets?   How can we be faithful to the purposes of the Constitution while  allowing the routine terrorization and slaughter of our children,  neighbors, teachers, doctors, and seniors?   I refuse to tell the American people, and particularly our children,  that they must be sacrificial lambs to a twisted theory of armed Second  Amendment liberty that defies the express purposes of our Constitution  by undermining the general welfare and destroying domestic tranquility.   The American people know, as well as we do, that the time is now to  act. The Safer Communities Act is a minimal first step in taking action  to keep our children and communities safe. But after 30 years of Senate  inaction, it is a step, and we know that it should not be the last.   Our children deserve a brighter future in which they can enjoy the  blessings of liberty, instead of being traumatized by active-shooter  drills and actual active shooters.
