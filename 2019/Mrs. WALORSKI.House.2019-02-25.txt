 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Maureen  McFadden on a remarkable 40-year career at WNDU-TV. I want to take a  moment to honor the iconic legacy Maureen is leaving behind and thank  her for all she has done for Michiana communities.   A lifelong Hoosier, Maureen has been a fixture in South Bend as a  reporter and anchor at WNDU Newscenter 16 for the past four decades.  She has played a  [[Page H2089]]  vital role in making northern Indiana stronger not only by bringing us  the day's news, but always finding ways to serve her neighbors and give  back to the community she loves to call home.   I am grateful to Maureen not only for her excellence in journalism,  but also for the incredible example she has set for aspiring  journalists and young Hoosier women who are always looking for ways to  give back to build a brighter future.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  exceptional character, leadership, and compassion Maureen has  demonstrated both on and off the air.   Mo, I wish you the very best.                            ____________________
