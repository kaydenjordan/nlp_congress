 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  American Libraries Week.   This is a perfect time to thank our local libraries and the employees  who keep them open to the public to ensure access to reading and  learning.   While extreme MAGA Republicans are banning books and bashing  librarians, House Democrats are protecting and recognizing their public  libraries. We are putting people over politics. That is why I am proud  to honor my local library, the Houston Public Library.   Mr. Speaker, they have announced that with local support, our library  will no longer charge late fees on overdue books or other borrowed  items. This is one of the many efforts that they are making to make  sure that libraries are more accessible.   In honor of public libraries, I am reintroducing my bill, the More  Social Workers in Libraries Act, today. Public libraries are vital  community hubs, and this bill will reinforce America's social worker  talent pipeline by creating a paid social worker internship in public  libraries across the Nation.   Libraries are for learning. They are for seeking resources and  finding job opportunities. We need to lift them up and not bash them.                            ____________________
