 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  California delegation to speak about the terrible loss our community  has endured and to honor the lives of those who perished on Sunday.   We are all heartbroken by the loss of life, as this week our  neighbors lost parents, children, friends, coaches, and heroes in a  horrific accident: Alyssa, Keri, and John Altobelli; Gianna and Kobe  Bryant; Payton and Sarah Chester; Christina Mauser; and Ara Zobayan.   They were all connected by a love of the game, a steadfast belief in  sports being bigger than a score, more than just an hour or two on the  court.   The parents we lost knew all too well that the early morning wake- ups, sweaty car rides, and late nights in a gym were worth the lessons  they instilled in their children: teamwork, dedication, and faith.   Our community lost kids who were overflowing with promise; kids who  were great competitors and even better friends; kids you could count  on, on and off the court; kids who pushed themselves to be more and who  were the best daughters that any parent could ask for.   All of us wish they could play another game.   Orange County is grieving, but we will find solace and purpose in the  example they left behind and the belief in something bigger than  ourselves.   I ask that in Orange County and across our Nation, we think of the  lives lost, in neighborhood basketball courts, school gyms, NBA arenas,  and wherever the game is played.   May God bless their families, and may our community come together to  offer them this support in this trying time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters),  my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members and guests in the  gallery rise for a moment of silence.
