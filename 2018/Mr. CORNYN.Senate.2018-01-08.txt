 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Corker), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Georgia  (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from  Georgia (Mr. Perdue), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), and the  Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, this last weekend I had the honor of going  to Camp David with Members of both the House and the Senate to meet  with the President and Vice President and members of his Cabinet to  talk about the prospects for 2018. After a very successful 2017, we are  now looking forward to what sort of legislation we can do on a  bipartisan basis that will help us build on those successes of 2017.  Many of these are domestic priorities, but, of course, others are  national security in nature.   Our internal strength, of course, affects our diplomacy and military  effectiveness abroad, and where we were located, at Camp David,  actually demonstrates that. It was, after all, the site for secret  talks to negotiate the Camp David Accords, historic peace agreements  signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978. What happened on American soil  ultimately changed the global landscape, and it wasn't the only time.  Over the years, Camp David has come to represent peace. It is a place  where leaders put aside their differences to look to avoid conflict.   Nonetheless, today we have to admit, given the global environment,  that peace is imperiled. We have recently seen that in Iran, where the  largest wave of protests in more than a decade have revealed widespread  discontent not only with Iran's economy but also as a result of the  actions taken by its military, which has supported Hezbollah and other  terrorist organizations around the world. As a matter of fact, Iran is  the No. 1 state-sponsor of international terrorism, which is one reason  why many of us blanched at the idea of releasing money to Iran as part  of the joint agreement on Iran's nuclear program--money that they could  then plow back into their support for organizations like Hezbollah and  their aggressive support for terrorist organizations generally.   Last week the Trump administration imposed sanctions on five entities  tied to Iran's ballistic missile program. Apparently, Tehran continues  to care more about funding its terrorist proxies across the Middle East  than supporting its own citizens, and frustrated  [[Page S61]]  Iranians rightfully have said: Enough already; we are not going to take  it anymore.    As Secretary Mnuchin said last week, here in the United States we  shouldn't ``hesitate to call out the [Iranian] regime's economic  mismanagement, and diversion of significant resources to fund  threatening missile systems at the expense of its citizenry.'' The  Secretary is exactly right.   Meanwhile, the situation in North Korea remains precarious. That  country--and I say this unequivocally--must denuclearize. That is why I  recently introduced a resolution with many of my colleagues here in the  Senate.   The purpose of the resolution is to expressly declare that Congress  is unified in its condemnation of the increasingly hostile and  intransigent behavior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   Since Kim Jong Un took power 6 years ago, he has ordered at least  four nuclear tests, including the September detonation of what his  regime--and outside experts generally agree--said was a hydrogen bomb.   Despite great efforts made by the United States, including a recent  Executive order by the President, North Korea's history as a bad-faith  negotiator continues unabated on the world stage. It obstinately  violates diplomatic norms and human rights at will and was recently  redesignated, itself, as a state sponsor of terrorism.   The resolution I referred to a moment ago asserts that the United  States, as well as the United Nations Security Council and our regional  allies, should continue to implement the absolute strictest of sanction  regimes in an effort to get the regime's attention and hopefully bring  them to the table as part of this path forward toward denuclearization.  We must continue to exhaust every reasonable diplomatic option  necessary to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile  programs.   Our resolution also recognizes that the President has the  constitutional responsibility to protect the United States and our  allies, but it emphasizes that congressional authorization is necessary  prior to committing U.S. forces to a sustained military operation on  the Korean Peninsula. In other words, under the Constitution, the  President has his responsibilities and duties, and Congress has its  responsibilities and duties, and this resolution recognizes both. We  look forward to working together closely with the President in a  unified front this year to confront North Korea, as well as rogue  actors elsewhere.   President Trump, we know, does not take our national security threats  lightly. He has a world-class national security team, with General  Mattis, Secretary Tillerson, and Director Pompeo, just to name three.  In an important speech last month, the President outlined the four  pillars of his administration's national security strategy.   He said the first pillar is to protect our homeland. We can't secure  our Nation if we can't secure our own borders, and we can't secure our  borders unless we confront, both at home and abroad, the threat of  terrorism and ideologies bent on doing us great harm.   Second, the President said that we need to promote American  prosperity because the only way we are going to be strong militarily  and at the homeland is if we have the resources and economy to pay for  it. Economic growth at home is critical for our influence around the  globe as well. We, of course, took a big step in this direction by  passing tax reform last month, but a lot more needs to be done to  continue to grow our economy and to return America to its historic  prosperity--like updating and not scrapping the North American Free  Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, for example, and rebuilding  our national infrastructure, which was also on the agenda at Camp David  this weekend.   The President's third pillar of the national security strategy is to  preserve peace through strength. We usually attribute that concept to  Ronald Reagan, but of course he is not the first or the last to  recognize the joinder of peace and strength. President Trump said in  his speech that ``weakness is the surest path to conflict, and  unrivaled power is the most certain means of defense.''   I think he is exactly right--which means we have to end the defense  sequester that started with the Budget Control Act of 2011. I supported  our efforts to rein in discretionary spending, but the fact is, only  about 30 percent of the money that the Federal Government spends is  actually appropriated, and a little more than half of that is defense  spending. I simply cannot in good conscience agree to continue those  budget caps for defense spending without considering the increase in  risks to our men and women in uniform and our country's national  security generally. We have to continue to modernize our military,  which we started last year by reauthorizing the Defense Authorization  Act.   Fourth, the President's strategy asserts that we have to advance  American influence in the world through strong alliances and by  championing our core values without apology. As the President said:         A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot       protect its interests abroad. A nation that is not prepared       to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. A       nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident       in its future. And a nation that is not certain of its values       cannot summon the will to defend them.    I couldn't have said it any better myself.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2282         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Venue Reform Act       of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) bankruptcy law provides a number of venue options for       filing bankruptcy under chapter 11 of title 11, United State       Code, including place of incorporation, principal place of       business and assets, or where an affiliate has filed a case       under chapter 11;        (2) the wide range of permissible bankruptcy venue options       has led to an increase in companies filing for bankruptcy       outside of their home States, or the district in which their       principal place of business or principal assets are located,       a practice known as forum shopping, and has resulted in a       concentration of bankruptcy cases in a few districts;        (3) bankruptcy forum shopping prevents small businesses,       employees, retirees, creditors, and other important       stakeholders from fully participating in bankruptcy cases       that will have tremendous impacts on their lives,       communities, and local economies, and deprives district       courts of the United States of the opportunity to contribute       to the development of bankruptcy law in their jurisdictions;       and        (4) reducing forum shopping and manipulation in the       bankruptcy system will strengthen the integrity, build public       confidence, and ensure fairness in the bankruptcy system.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prevent the       practice of forum shopping in cases filed under chapter 11 of       title 11, United States Code.       SEC. 3.
