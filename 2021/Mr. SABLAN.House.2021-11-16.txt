 Mr. Speaker, my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3730,  creates a VA advisory committee for marginalized veterans living in the  Marianas, the other United States insular areas, and in the freely  associated States. Veterans in my district, especially, and in the  other insular areas, too, face barriers to VA services no vet should be  forced to endure.   In Northern Marianas, there are no VA clinics and no Vet Centers.   Veterans in my district sometimes fly 3,700 miles to Hawaii or over  6,000 miles to California to access VA services. And that is why my  bill, establishing a committee to educate the Secretary on the  obstacles insular area veterans face, is so important.   Each U.S. insular area and each of the freely associated States would  have a seat on the advisory committee. Each would be able to describe  the barriers their veterans face in receiving VA services.   Establishing an advisory committee will not solve every logistical  problem for veterans who live in geographically remote areas of  America, but at least those veterans on the margins will have a way to  communicate directly with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. And when  the Secretary hears about the barriers to service these insular  veterans face, maybe, just maybe, change will occur.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Minority Veterans of America, the Veterans  of Foreign Wars, American Legion, and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans  of America for their support of this bipartisan bill, H.R. 3730.   I also thank Chairman Takano, Ranking Member Bost, Congresswoman  Radewagen, and my fellow members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs  for their unanimous support to report my bill favorably to the House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3730 to give  marginalized veterans in the insular areas a voice in the Department of  Veterans Affairs.
