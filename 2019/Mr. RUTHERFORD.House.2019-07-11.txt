 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle announced they will soon bring to the floor the Raise the Wage  Act, a bill to increase the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to  $15 an hour.   While supporters of this legislation have good intentions, the  repercussions would spell disaster for our economy, for small  businesses, and the very same low-wage workers who they intend to help.  Nonpartisan estimates of the Raise the Wage Act expect it could cause  up to 3.7 million people across the country to lose their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, that is almost as many people as in the entire State of  Oklahoma, the entire State of Oklahoma unemployed.   Cities that have already imposed a $15 minimum wage have been the  first to see the negative effects of this initiative. Recently, the  University of Washington conducted a study on the efficacy of Seattle's  newly mandated $15 minimum wage, and the results were very clear. Costs  to low-wage workers in Seattle outweighed the benefits by 3-to-1, and  the average low-wage worker lost $125 a month.   While most of the discussion regarding the Federal minimum wage is  focused on major metropolitan cities, what about the rural areas across  the country where the cost of living is much lower? This bill would  effectively eliminate small, rural businesses and skyrocket costs for  goods and services.   Finally, let's look at who is currently making minimum wage in the  U.S. Half are under the age of 25, and almost a quarter of them are  teenagers. A $15 minimum wage would threaten the job prospects of young  folks who are looking to enter the workforce for the first time, hoping  to gain the skills needed to move ahead in a real career.   Over 80 percent of economists agree that a $15 minimum wage would  have a negative impact on youth employment.   Look, I cannot support a bill that is guaranteed to shutter business  and lay off workers around the country. I hope that my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle will reconsider this attempt to backtrack  on the economic success of recent years and, instead, support  bipartisan policies that will help all workers get ahead.                            ____________________
