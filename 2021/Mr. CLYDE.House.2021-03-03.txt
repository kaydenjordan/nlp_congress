 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition  to H.R. 1 because it violates the U.S. Constitution. It usurps the  rights of States to establish and administer their own elections.   As we speak, Georgia lawmakers are working to make smart and targeted  reforms to Georgia's election laws, like picture identification for  absentee voting. Such reforms are critically important.   H.R. 1 would not only nullify Georgia lawmakers' efforts, but it  would also mandate that all States provide no-excuse absentee voting  with absolutely zero safeguards.   I read the bill to see what I needed to do to obtain and cast an  absentee ballot under H.R. 1. I was shocked to learn I needed nothing:  no witness signature, no picture identification. Nothing is required.   Just tell that to TSA the next time you try to get on an airplane, or  to your local gun dealer when you try to buy a gun. In fact, if we are  going to eliminate a valid government-issued photo ID for  constitutional voting rights, then let's eliminate the need for photo  ID to exercise your Second Amendment too.    The hypocrisy by the liberal left to eliminate voter ID is stunning.  Trust starts by States taking steps to verify that all votes are legal  and cast by eligible voters. That is why we must verify citizenship and  require picture identification.   I commend our Georgia lawmakers for strengthening the integrity of  our Georgia elections, and I am proud to support those efforts by  voting ``no'' on the Federal takeover of elections.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1280, a  purely partisan bill, developed with zero Republican input, that would  defund the police and hamstring the ability of our law enforcement  agencies to keep our communities safe.   This bill would lower the legal threshold to criminally prosecute a  police officer for deprivation of rights, which would, at best, lead to  a torrent of frivolous cases against officers and, at worst, discourage  them from doing their jobs.   Our officers are already forced to work in difficult environments.  Countless officers have already simply quit or retired early, while  morale has plummeted for those who stay. It will continue if this bill  passes.   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1280, a bill  that defunds the police.
