 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the  nomination of Kenneth L. Marcus, of Virginia, to be Assistant Secretary  for Civil Rights, Department of Education.   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, OCR, was  established to address discrimination that prevents all students from  receiving an equal opportunity to learn. No student should experience  harmful discrimination because of their race, gender, disability,  religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity.   Based on Mr. Marcus's record and performance during his confirmation  process, I have no confidence that he is ready to effectively lead OCR  and robustly enforce civil rights protections throughout the country.  Mr. Marcus's demonstrated lack of commitment to the mission of OCR and  his failure to understand that all children, regardless of citizenship  status, have a right to attend public schools, are warning signs that  the nominee is not the right person to lead OCR.   Students in Illinois and across the Nation deserve a leader of OCR  who will actively investigate and enforce civil rights protections,  particularly in cases where there is evidence of systemic  discrimination. An unwillingness or inability to address comprehensive,  systemic discrimination in education is disqualifying, and I must  oppose Mr. Marcus's confirmation.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  vote No. 118 on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 603, the  nomination of Kenneth L. Marcus, of Virginia, to be Assistant Secretary  for Civil Rights, Department of Education. On vote No. 118, had I been  present, I would have voted nay on the confirmation of Executive  Calendar No. 603.                            ____________________
