 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, our Nation was again stunned  by yet another horrific attack on Americans gathered at worship.  Saturday's shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California came  as Jews around the world celebrated the last day of Passover.   One woman, Lori Gilbert Kaye, was murdered in the attack and three  others were wounded. I continue to pray for the recovery of those  injured in the shooting and offer my deepest condolences to the family  and friends of the victims.   The latest attack happened exactly 6 months to the day after the  assault on worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh,  which claimed the lives of 11 people, the deadliest attack on the  American Jewish community in our history.   These shootings were committed against a backdrop of rising anti- Semitism both here at home and around the world.   According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2017, anti-Semitic  incidents surged in the United States by 57 percent. This represented  the largest single-year increase on record and the second highest  number of incidents since the ADL started tracking such data in 1979.  In 2018, we saw nearly the same number of reported incidents as in  2017.   In recent weeks, there have been other chilling displays of anti- Semitism beyond our borders as well. In February, a Belgian carnival  float featured grotesque caricatures of Orthodox Jews standing on large  piles of money. On Easter Sunday in a small Polish village, adults and  children beat and burned an effigy of Judas, but the effigy did not  look like a character from Biblical times. Rather, it was a  stereotypical Orthodox Jew dressed in ninth century Hasidic garb.   Feeding into these dangerous incidents, just last week, the  international edition of The New York Times published a disgusting  anti-Semitic cartoon. The paper subsequently apologized, but the damage  was already done. It was an astonishing editorial failure by one of the  Nation's most important papers of record. I was pleased today to see  the editorial board of the Times directly address this issue.   Especially at these times of growing anti-Semitism, we must all be  extra vigilant, lest we add fuel to the flames of hate and intolerance.   Whenever and wherever we see anti-Semitism, we must speak out to  stanch it, for what begins as stereotypes and cartoons far too often  leads to violence that has claimed so many lives throughout our  history.   Our Nation was founded on the idea that every American of every  religion has the fundamental right to practice their faith without fear  of persecution or violence. This was established in the very first  amendment to our Constitution and enshrined in our Bill of Rights. But  this right has been shattered far too many times at the synagogues in  Poway and Pittsburgh; at an African American church in Charleston,  South Carolina; and at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.   I will not repeat the Poway shooter's name or give him the notoriety  he sought, but it is clear that he was motivated by white supremacism  and anti-Semitism, citing the shootings at the mosque in Christchurch,  New Zealand, and the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in his  manifesto.   The sad truth is, far-right white supremacists have been responsible  for more terror attacks and deaths in the United States in the past two  decades than any other domestic extremist movement. We need to update  our laws to reflect the growing threat of domestic terrorism.   That is why I introduced, with Senator Richard Durbin, the Domestic  Terrorism Prevention Act, legislation that would strengthen  coordination among the Federal agencies in monitoring radicalized  groups and individuals and, hopefully, preventing hateful acts of  violence.   This is a necessary first step to help our law enforcement agencies  contain the threat, and I urge my colleagues to join me on this  legislation.   We also have a duty to responsibly update our gun laws. I am proud  that this House voted earlier this year to pass universal background  checks and close the Charleston loophole, a loophole that allowed the  Emanuel AME shooter to acquire a firearm before the results of his FBI  background check were complete.   We need the Senate to stop stonewalling and bring these bills up for  a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but reflect that, this week, the United  States is observing Holocaust Remembrance Week and honoring the 6  million Jews and millions of others murdered by the Nazi regime.   In the memory of all of those lost to anti-Semitism and other forms  of hate, we have a moral responsibility to stamp out intolerance and  prejudice in our time. Otherwise, as the late Elie Wiesel famously  said: ``To forget the victims means to kill them a second time.''                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me  the time.   Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 2 years since President Trump  recklessly announced the United States' withdrawal from the Paris  climate accord. We are now the only country in the world not firmly  behind this agreement.   There are times where we must stand alone. This is not one of them.  Climate change and its impacts are an existential threat, and American  leadership has an important role to play, but under the Trump  administration, we are retreating from our responsibility and giving up  our seat at the table.   Two years ago, more than 180 Representatives joined my resolution  condemning President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, but  the Republican leadership refused to let this body vote its will.  Today, that changes. That is because this House is finally reflecting  the will of the American people, which, by a 5-to-1 margin, support  staying in the agreement.   We need to work with the rest of the world, and the nations of the  world are looking to us to lead. Staying in the Paris Agreement and  developing a plan to meet emission reduction targets agreed to would be  an important first step.   As this House takes action to pass H.R. 9, I hope the Senate will  follow our lead and promptly take up the legislation, and I hope  today's vote--this vote--represents just the first of many efforts to  reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and prevent a global climate  disaster.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by my colleague, Congressman Rouda, of which I am a cosponsor.   It was a low point of the Trump Presidency when President Trump  announced his plans to recklessly begin withdrawal of the United States  from the Paris climate agreement. This was an abandonment of our global  leadership.   But I took heart watching the many cities, States, and localities  step forward to declare their intention to keep the emission reduction  commitments of the Paris accord. These include 20 cities and villages  in the 10th District that have joined the Greenest Region Compact to  implement sustainability plans to reduce the risk of global climate  change and mitigate its effects.   Regardless of the lack of leadership from the White House on  addressing climate change, our cities continue to drive the change  needed to prevent a climate disaster.   I am glad this House is finally taking action with H.R. 9, the  Climate Action Now Act. I fully support this amendment to recognize the  actions of our cities and States that continue to uphold the spirit of  the Paris climate agreement.
