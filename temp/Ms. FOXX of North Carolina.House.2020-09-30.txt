 Mr. Speaker, we are in the height of  robocall season, and the American people are beyond fed up.   The recent 6-3 ruling by the Supreme Court that upholds a Federal ban  on robocalls warrants a serious conversation that is long overdue.   Under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act, TCPA, prerecorded  voice messages and the use of automatic dialing systems were  effectively banned. The prevailing argument was that the American  people would no longer face intrusive nuisances that we have now come  to recognize as robocalls.   In retrospect, the TCPA was a novel endeavor, but the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2015 introduced setbacks that compromised the progress  that had been achieved in the fight against robocalls. Debt collectors  received a special carve-out that allowed them to place automatic calls  to Americans who owed money to the Federal Government.   Though the Supreme Court eliminated this carve-out on the basis that  it was a violation of the First Amendment, bountiful opportunities to  enact meaningful reform remain on the horizon.   Unwanted robocalls have become the bane of many, and with phones  ringing off the hook in households across the country, Americans are  wondering when they will get a reprieve from these nuisances. Imagine  you are sitting down for dinner with your family, and within seconds of  the meal starting, your phone begins ringing. It is yet another  robocall.   Now, magnify the scene to households across the country. It is an  enraging scenario that all of us have been affected by, but I have a  blueprint that can set things right.   Since 2005, I have introduced the Robo Calls Off Phones Act,  legislation that directs the FTC to revise its regulation for the  National Do Not Call Registry and allows politically oriented messages  to be added to that list.   In fact, the genesis for this legislation came from my constituents.  Many were livid that they had been bombarded with unwanted calls during  the 2004 election year. They demanded that Congress act to end these  nuisances, and I took it upon myself to carry the mantle.   Ever since I have reintroduced this legislation to address the  cyclical issue, and I remain adamant that Congress must address this  immediately. For years, politicians in Washington have told their  constituents that they would fight against robocalls. Now it is time to  hold ourselves to account and be part of the solution.   H.R. 805, the bipartisan Robo COP Act, is the vessel by which we can  achieve meaningful reform.   The simple truth is that no American is immune to receiving  robocalls. It is becoming a nagging problem that has evolved to the  point where we now believe it is commonplace to receive them at any  point during the day.   The answer to this problem is right before our very eyes, and  Congress finds itself in an opportune moment to enact meaningful  reforms that have been overlooked for far too long.                            ____________________
