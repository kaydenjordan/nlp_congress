 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  ordering of the yeas and nays on motions to suspend the rules be  vacated to the end that the motions stand disposed of in accordance  with the earlier voice votes thereon, and the motion to reconsider be  laid on the table, with respect to the following:   H.R. 91;   H.R. 92;   H.R. 207;   H.R. 209; and   H.R. 3508.   These five suspensions have been reviewed. They are noncontroversial.  They represent five war heroes, and we thank them greatly for their  service and sacrifices.
