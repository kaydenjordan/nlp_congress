 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1241 and ask  that it be reported by number, as I intend to withdraw the amendment  shortly due to majority party mischief.    Mr. President, the Senate has been preaching regular  order for some time, and I have been cheering them on. I have been a  strong advocate for regular order because we need a process that  engages all of the Members of this body. But one has to ask why my  bipartisan, germane amendment is deemed a ``poison pill'' and now needs  60 votes to pass. Well, I know the answer. It is simple. Because it was  going to pass. That is why. That is why suddenly it is a ``poison  pill.'' Senate Democrats would rather provide the Biden administration  cover by taking a show vote designed to fail than follow real regular  order. The will of the Senate should prevail here, but they are not  going to let it.   This appropriation limitation amendment would prevent the U.S.  Department of Transportation from finalizing their illegal rule  requiring States to measure CO2 tailpipe emissions and then  set declining targets for individual States on their roadways.   Congress has not provided any authority for the Department of  Transportation to dictate CO2 performance requirements. They  can't do what they don't have the authority to do. And even if we had,  it is not a workable solution. It may be hard for bureaucrats in  Washington, DC, to imagine this, but you cannot tell States like North  Dakota and Montana that to reduce tailpipe emissions is easy. Just  build a subway. Build a subway or dedicate bus lanes on your gravel  roads. That is why a majority of the States in this country have  submitted comments expressing their concern and opposing--outright  opposing--this rule.   When the Environment and Public Works Committee negotiated the last  highway bill, we expressly left this authority out. We made the  decision to not give this authority to the Department of  Transportation.   I would note that that bill moved out of committee unanimously and  then became the cornerstone of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act. Ironically, the Biden administration created the ``poison pill''  that this amendment is meant to address.   I am not interested in show votes, so I am going to withdraw the  amendment.   The administration should scrap this rule, but if they finalize it, I  will be back. I will be back with a CRA resolution, and then Senate  Democrats can't force a 60-vote majority on that one, and I will lead  an amicus brief pointing to the major questions doctrine, which the  Department of Transportation clearly violates with their rule.   With that, I yield.                         Amendment No. 1241 Withdrawn    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
