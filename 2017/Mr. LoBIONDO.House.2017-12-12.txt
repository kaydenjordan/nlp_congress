 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring H.R. 4285, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 123 Bridgeton  Pike in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, as the James C. ``Billy'' Johnson  Post Office Building, to the floor for consideration.   Second Lieutenant Johnson was born and raised in my district in  Richwood, New Jersey, in 1920. Due to his strong desire to serve his  country, Billy enlisted as a private in the United States Army in 1941.  He was later commissioned as an officer.   He was assigned to the 370th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Division during  the height of the Italian Campaign in World War II. Second Lieutenant  Johnson made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when he was  tragically killed in action in October of 1944.   It is because of his steadfast commitment to his country, along with  his valor and dedication to his country, that I support the naming of  this post office after Second Lieutenant Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.
