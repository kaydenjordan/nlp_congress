 I say to my friend from Delaware that my understanding  is the same as that of the Senator from Alaska, and I thank him for his  inquiry into this provision of the bill.    Madam President, first of all, I can't tell you what a  pleasure it has been to work with Chairman Murkowski. We have been able  to show--and even in the 115th Congress, with the ranking member,  Senator Cantwell--the committee worked in a bipartisan way. So when  people think the process is broken, it is really not broken. It might  be wobbling a little bit and might need some repairs, but in the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee on the Senate side, we have shown it  can be done. But it has to be a matter of trust. We have to trust each  other and, basically, communicate to work through these issues, and we  have been able to do that.   When there has been a little bit of concern popping up from time to  time, we get together. Senator Murkowski and I have called and talked  to each other and worked through it. We have talked with the chairman  and ranking member over in the House to make sure they are in lockstep  with us as we went through this.   We look for this to be extremely successful as it reaches the House.  These bills are going to improve the way public lands are managed and  conserved at the ground level. While these bills are important to the  residents of small towns across America, many of the bills in this  package do not have a significant impact outside their local sphere.  These are truly local bills. As such, it is rare for these bills to  receive consideration on the Senate floor. I believe what we are saying  is, by themselves it would be hard to move something like this, but as  a package--and it has been over 45 years since the lands package has  been done; that is really the reason it has been quite time-consuming.   I want to again thank my colleagues for their tireless work--of  course, Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Marie Cantwell, and Senators  Heinrich, Gardner, and Daines on the Republican side. Everyone has  worked very well together.   I also want to thank the committee staff because the committee staff  and floor staff really have made this package come together, and they  have worked tirelessly.   All of the outside groups brought all of their information to us. We  were able to work with them, and it was quite fulfilling.   The package has been warmly received by both Democrats and  Republicans, and from our conversations with folks in the House, we are  expecting it to receive a warm reception over there as well.   I cannot tell you how many Members are excited to get this to the  President's desk for his signature. This package adds thousands of  miles to our National Trails System, designates 1.3 million acres of  wilderness, designates hundreds of miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers, and  will improve hunting, fishing, and recreation access to our Federal  lands.   As I have said before, our public lands are truly one of our Nation's  greatest treasures, and we are fortunate to have so many places set  aside for the public to enjoy. Each year, 67 percent of the people of  West Virginia take to the outdoors to enjoy our wild and wonderful  areas. In my State of West Virginia, it is truly almost Heaven because  of the access to all the beauty we have.   Again, in my State of West Virginia alone, outdoor recreation  supports 91,000 direct jobs--that is a lot of jobs for my State but,  really, for any State--and $9 billion in consumer spending.   The centerpiece of this package is the permanent reauthorization of  the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This is truly the part of the  legislation that really carries the water, figuratively speaking. This  is a simple yet highly effective conservation tool with unrivaled  success over the last 50 years.   Unfortunately, the LWCF expired last September, but this package will  reinstate the program to ensure that States and Federal public land  management Agencies can continue to protect and conserve our natural  resources.   Since 1965, more than $243 million in LWCF funds have been spent in  West Virginia on more than 500 projects, both on State and Federal  lands. This includes improvements to local parks and public spaces in  54 of our State's 55 counties, and it does so without relying on  taxpayer dollars.   I again want to highlight the long-awaited priorities for sportsmen's  groups included in this package. Hunting in all of our States and in my  State of West Virginia is one of our oldest pastimes, where friends and  family gather and spend quality time. It is important that we provide  opportunities to keep these traditions alive.   The Natural Resources Management Act will expand and enhance  sportsmen's access by making Federal lands throughout West Virginia and  throughout the Nation ``open unless closed'' for hunting, fishing,  recreational shooting, and many other outdoor activities.   As a hunter myself, and as vice chair of the Congressional  Sportsmen's Caucus, I know how frustrated the sportsmen's groups have  been in trying to get their bills passed over the last few years. That  is why I am so pleased that so many of our priorities are included in  this package.   I am pleased to say that the Natural Resources Management Act will  establish several national heritage areas, including one in West  Virginia--the Appalachian Forest Heritage Area. This local heritage  area has been operating as an ad hoc national heritage area.   By providing an official NHA designation, the Appalachian Forest  Heritage Area can earn the national recognition it deserves and is now  also eligible for grants and technical assistance from the National  Park Service. This will enable the heritage area to take the services  they provide to the region to the next level.   I believe that this package is a great bill for both Republicans and  Democrats and all of our friends. Numerous pieces of legislation have  been longstanding priorities for many Members, and they have been  included.   I would like to thank Chairman Murkowski again, as well as the other  Members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, all of the staff  members, and the floor members for their efforts to reach an agreement  on this bill.   I would also like to thank the majority leader for his willingness to  bring this bill to the floor in such an expedited manner.  [[Page S1196]]    I believe it is time for this bill to get over to the House and to  the President for his signature. I want to thank all who have been  involved.                Vote on Amendment No. 182 to Amendment No. 112     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Schaff,  a staff member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, be  granted floor privileges for the duration of the 116th Congress.
