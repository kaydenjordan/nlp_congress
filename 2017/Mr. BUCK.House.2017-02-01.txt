 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 71 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 71         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 41) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted       by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to       ``Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers''.       All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 40) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to       Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007. All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying resolutions.   Before us is a resolution of disapproval that restores constitutional  rights and empowers individuals with disabilities. Many of us know  someone who struggles with a disability. We know friends or family who  have mental challenges. We know these people, and we know they deserve  the same constitutional protections as everyone else.   That is why this resolution is so important. It ends discrimination  against individuals with disabilities. It restores due process rights.  It keeps the Social Security Administration focused on its duty.   Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's last-minute regulation to  strip disability benefit recipients of their constitutional rights is  deeply troubling.   The regulation at hand declares that just because an individual needs  assistance in managing their disability benefits, they are also unfit  to own a firearm. But this kind of thinking is discriminatory, forcing  those with disabilities to choose between their constitutional rights  or their disability benefits turns back the clock on disability rights.   This regulation singles out a single constitutional right to strip  away from a group of Americans. It doesn't make sense.   Why take away one right and not others? Why not also strip those  citizens of the right to vote or the right to trial by jury or the  right to free speech?   In this country, your rights can't be limited without due process,  but this regulation limits a constitutional right and only offers the  recourse of appeal after the decision has been made. When it is easier  to have your rights stripped away than to have them restored, it means  your due process rights have also died in the process.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution restores the due process rights of  individuals with disabilities. This resolution also refocuses the  Social Security Administration. The agency's job is to administer  benefits to Americans, not adjudicate cases concerning constitutional  rights.   Mr. Speaker, I am also worried that this regulation will divert  precious Social Security Administration resources from vital agency  tasks. We trust the agency to fulfill our commitments to seniors and  those with disabilities. This regulation distracts from those sacred  promises.   I thank Mr. Johnson and my colleagues for their hard work on this  resolution. We need to pass it.   Mr. Speaker, we also need to pass the joint resolution of disapproval  for the Dodd-Frank section 1504 regulation. This resolution restores  competitiveness to American energy companies. It allows American  companies to comply with foreign and domestic laws, and it protects  American workers abroad.   Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank requires companies to report their  payments to our government or foreign governments related to oil,  natural gas, and mineral extraction. After reporting this to the SEC,  the agency publishes these disclosures. This process is costly and  unfair to American businesses.   By forcing disclosure of project-level sensitive business  information, American energy companies will face a disadvantage against  government-owned energy companies. Since government-owned companies  control three-quarters of the world's oil supply, this regulation could  drastically impair the competitiveness of American companies. And the  actual cost of compliance limit, estimated by the American Petroleum  Institute to take 217,000 employee hours over a 3-year period, would be  devastating.   Section 1504 must also be rolled back because it might force American  companies to break the law of foreign countries. Some foreign nations  prohibit the very disclosure requirements  [[Page H832]]  required by this SEC regulation. Our companies should not have to  decide between following the rule of law here and following it abroad.   Finally, by forcing such detailed and specific disclosures to the  public, section 1504 could make energy extraction sites prime targets  for terrorists. Whether in the U.S. or abroad, we need to wisely  protect American workers from terrorism and other threats.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution restores competitiveness to American  companies, allowing them to contribute to the global energy economy in  a safe, secure, and legal manner.   It is time for Congress to reassert its authority and fix this poorly  implemented legislation.   I commend the work done by Representative Huizenga and my colleagues  on this important resolution, and I urge its passage.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts raising the issue of a  thoughtful process and whether this legislation was rushed to the  floor.   I think it is worth noting that the original legislation, which this  rule seeks to amend, became law in a time when my colleague was in the  House and his party was in the majority. The NICS Improvement  Amendments Act of 2007 was introduced in the House on June 11, 2007.   The bill was moved by Congressman Conyers under suspension of the  rules and passed by the House on June 13, 2007. There was no markup in  the Judiciary Committee. There was no meaningful debate on the floor.  The bill was rammed through the House in 3 days without any thought to  the potential consequences of its passage. It passed the Senate by  unanimous consent.   I did not see others standing up to leadership at that point in time.  In its implementation, we are seeing the consequences. They involve the  stripping away of constitutional rights and due process rights. They  involve the elimination of due process rights. They involve  discrimination against individuals with disabilities.   As for the point that this rule that we are now debating somehow  encourages corruption, the fact is that this regulation puts U.S.  companies at a competitive disadvantage to state-owned entities abroad  that are not subject to SEC regulation.   Additionally, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance  costs for U.S. businesses. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act already  prohibits bribes to foreign governments to obtain or retain business.  These are legitimate payments being made to foreign governments, the  payments that we are discussing here, and we should still prosecute any  corruption to the full extent of the law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am waiting for one. I do not have a speaker now, but the  gentleman's eloquence would be welcome at this point and any way that  the gentleman would like to inform us on important issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments before I close, and then  I would like to recognize the chairman for additional comments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for being  here today and just reinforce some of what the chairman had to say.   As I travel Colorado, I hear from individuals of all walks of life  about the regulatory burdens that they face, the burden that has been  placed upon them by their own government and how those burdens have  impeded their life, liberty, and certainly pursuit of happiness. Small- business owners who would not open their business today because of the  change in the business climate find that their tax burden, their  regulatory burden, and the attitude of Federal regulators is such that  they would choose a different path had they had to do it all over  again.   I talked to school administrators who are, again, facing a pile of  paperwork to comply with school and nutrition requirements that have  been promulgated by this previous administration.                                time  1300    I talk to veterans who have to wait on long, long lines and fill out  ridiculous paperwork because the Veterans Administration is unable to  recognize the necessity, the importance of what those veterans are  trying to accomplish at the VA. I am deeply concerned about the  regulations, and I am proud that my colleagues have decided to address  some of these regulations in the way that they have. I appreciate the  chairman standing up on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Kentucky for  their remarks, and I appreciate the insightful remarks from the  gentleman from Massachusetts. I am troubled right now. I am struggling  to remember--as the gentleman describes Russia with its terrible record  on human rights, I am trying to remember exactly who it was who had the  reset button with Vladimir Putin, and I don't think it was the Trump  administration. I could be wrong.   Mr. Speaker, America has come so far in advancing the rights of those  with disabilities. We have also fought long and hard to protect our  constitutional rights. The rule before us achieves both of those ends.  The Obama administration's last-ditch effort to strip constitutional  rights from individuals with disabilities must not stand. We also  cannot stand for regulations that place American companies at a  disadvantage and place their workers at risk.   The rule before us will undo the costly and dangerous reporting  requirements placed on America's energy companies operating abroad.  When we repeal this unwise regulation on American energy companies,  they can again fully contribute to the world's energy economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this rule and the underlying  measures.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
