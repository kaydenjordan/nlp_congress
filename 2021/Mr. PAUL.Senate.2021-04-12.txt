 Mr. President, at 10 p.m. on March 30, 2021,  Stanford, KY, Police Officer Andy Ferguson and Detective Ryan  Kirkpatrick were dispatched to the parking lot of a local eatery after  receiving a 911 call from Maria Vergara, a teenager who witnessed a  heinous crime: a young woman being assaulted and dragged, screaming,  into the cab of a semitruck.   Once on the scene, these law enforcement professionals gained access  to the vehicle, rescued the victim, and eventually arrested the 29- year-old perpetrator who was later charged with sexual assault and  kidnapping.   Working with SPD Chaplain Jeremy Johnson and the Kentucky Cabinet for  Health and Family Services, the out-of-State victim received medical  treatment at the hospital and was reunited with her family.   But the story does not stop there. A locket containing the ashes of  the victim's mother had been ripped from her neck and discarded during  the assault, and officers were unable to locate it during the night.  The next day, Chaplain Johnson and Stanford Mayor Dalton Miller  returned to the scene and eventually found the necklace, which has  since been returned to the victim.   These actions remind us all of several things: of one person's  ability to change the course of history for another--in this case, the  teenager who reported the crime, of the mix of professionalism and  heroism that sends police officers into unknown but certain danger; and  of the never-give-up attitude of our best public servants who are moved  by compassion to go the extra mile for those who are hurting. We honor  each of these individuals today and thank them for their  example.                            ____________________
