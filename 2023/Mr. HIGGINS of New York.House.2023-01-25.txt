 Mr. Speaker, on January 11, the failure of  the Notice to Air Missions system grounded thousands of flights across  America. This malfunction created air travel chaos for days.   This system is essential to safe flight operations and needs to be  reformed. The Notice to Air Missions Improvement Act takes a proactive  approach to make much-needed upgrades.   Many of the airline safety measures implemented over the past 15  years were borne out of the lessons we learned following the crash of  flight 3407 outside of Buffalo. We must not wait for another tragedy to  make the  [[Page H292]]  necessary steps to protect the flying public.   I support this bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.                            ____________________
