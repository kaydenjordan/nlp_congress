 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan  legislation.   Our economy has struggled for years under the weight of misguided  Washington policies. Banks have closed and consolidated, and  communities across this country have lost their local financial  institutions. American families have found it harder to get the funds  they need to buy a home, and small businesses have been starved of  credit to innovate, invest, and hire more workers.   In this economic environment, small businesses have struggled to grow  or even get off the ground. A recent study observed that we are missing  650,000 small businesses because of burdensome regulations relating to  the financial industry over the last 10 years.   Everyone, from the single mom in Ambridge looking to buy her first  home to the entrepreneur in Beaver Falls working to achieve his or her  version of the American Dream, deserves access to financial services  and the chance to thrive in a growing, healthy economy.   Today's bill addresses some of these barriers that have been holding  us back.   I am also proud to say that two of my bills are in this legislation.  One of these bills gives mutual banks the flexibility to evolve so that  they can better serve their communities.   The other bill addresses the unintended negative impacts of the  supplementary leverage ratio on custody banks. This is technical, but  the current SLR actually makes it harder for custody banks to safeguard  cash of pension funds and nonprofit foundations in times of stress.  Today, we fix that.   Both of my bills received unanimous, bipartisan support in the  committee, and I am glad they will soon become law.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Hensarling for his work on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
