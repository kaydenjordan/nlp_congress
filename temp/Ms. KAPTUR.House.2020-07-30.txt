 Mr. Speaker, as our Nation reels from COVID-19 and over  150,000 deaths, millions of Americans depend on the U.S. Postal Service  for access to medicine, stimulus payments, small business support, and  trustworthy door-to-door service upon which Americans rely. Yet,  recently appointed Postmaster General and major Trump donor Louis DeJoy  has instituted a deeply misguided policy that puts American lives at  risk.   In a disturbing memo, it reads: ``late trips are no longer authorized  or accepted . . . we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom  floor or docks.''   The United States Postal Service has served our Nation ably for over  two centuries, delivering at the most cost-effective rate. Letter  carriers walk through rain, sleet, snow, dark of night to ensure the  mail gets delivered. That is why Congress already provided $10 billion  in financing to the Postal Service during this pandemic, and,  tragically, the Trump administration continued to hold it up, causing  backups in mail across our Nation.   I demand the Trump administration release the funds Congress provided  to our Postal Service. We must act now to ensure our people have access  to medications they need, protect our small businesses and democratic  institutions, and end these senseless delays.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member  Granger, and Vice Ranking Member Cole.   Please let me add my thanks to Chair Lowey for her years of  honorable, dedicated, and affable service to this committee and to our  Nation and for her recognition of the full potential of the Energy and  Water division.   Truly, she will be missed. Without question, she has made her mark  across our Nation and the world. She can draw great satisfaction from  that.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my brother, Stephen, who is  watching from a distance. Without his strength and courage, I would not  be here today.   This bill represents an overwhelming majority of our total  discretionary appropriations, and with its passage, the House's  completion of 10 appropriation bills.   Mr. Speaker, I extend congratulations to Chairwoman Lowey and, of  course, Ranking Member Kay Granger for this feat in the middle of a  global pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I also have to thank the marvelous committee staff who  have made this possible. I wish to say that the Energy and Water  division captures the American spirit of ingenuity and independence in  our enterprising Nation.   Our bill lays the foundation for critical investments to combat  climate change. It is poised to pass today as the most important funded  climate change bill the 116th Congress will pass.                                time  1045    Truly, this bill will sustain life in America and address global  imperatives.   Our bill upgrades and strengthens our Nation's energy and water  infrastructure.   It responsibly funds our Nation's nuclear deterrent. It rejects the  administration's dangerous plan to start nuclear explosive testing.   The bill rejects the President's drastic and shortsighted proposed  cuts that would harm America's leadership at home and abroad. Instead,  it invests in important programs that keep our Nation at the forefront  of global energy innovation.   It enables the efficient shipment of goods. It provides water,  irrigation, and electricity to millions upon millions of Americans, and  these programs propel real economic growth and the jobs that go with  it.   Let me briefly walk through the bill.   The Army Corps of Engineers receives $7.6 billion, the second year of  record funding and an increase of $1.7 billion above the budget  request.   The Bureau of Reclamation receives $1.64 billion, an increase of $508  million above the request.   The Department of Energy receives $41 billion, an increase of $5.1  billion above the request. Within the Department of Energy, the bill  contains historic funding levels for key programs critical to our  future.   First, energy efficiency and renewable energy receive $2.85 billion,  $2.1 billion above the request. ARPA-E, our advanced energy portfolio,  receives $435 million, a record amount for a program the President  proposed to eliminate, blunting America's future.   The Office of Science receives $7.05 billion, $1.2 billion above the  request.   This bill also provides an increase for the home Weatherization  Assistance Program. It helps ensure that additional low-income  households have energy-efficient and more livable and affordable  futures in communities across our Nation.   The National Nuclear Security Administration receives $18 billion,  $1.3 billion above 2020. Within the Nuclear Security Administration,  the bill responsibly funds America's nuclear deterrent.   Nuclear nonproliferation receives $2.24 billion, an increase of $209  million above the request.   Finally, this bill prohibits the diversion of essential Army Corps  funds to be used for a border wall. In addition to regular  appropriations, the bill cues up additional investments that will spur  a job-rich, robust economic recovery by modernizing our water and  energy infrastructure.   I cannot thank our chair more for her efforts to make sure this  occurs, including $17 billion to accelerate backlogged Army Corps of  Engineers projects across this Nation; $3 billion to accelerate work on  authorized reclamation projects; and $25.3 billion for the Department  of Energy to modernize infrastructure and deploy technologies for our  Nation's future clean energy.   In sum, the Energy and Water division will help put America back to  work. It makes desperately needed investments in crumbling water  infrastructure across the Nation.    It maintains a credible nuclear deterrent while  supporting a robust nonproliferation program.   I would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his  partnership and thank our subcommittee staff for their hard work: Jaime  Shimek, Farouk Ophaso, Scott McKee, Marcel Caldwell, Mike Brain, Mark  Arnone, and Angie Giancarlo on the other side.   I want to thank all of our committee members, especially dear friends  like Chairman Visclosky; Chairman Serrano; Chairwoman Lowey; and on the  Republican side, Mr. Graves, all of whom are retiring. They will take  with them over a century of cumulative legislative knowledge that  simply cannot be replaced.   It is a profound contribution but also a great loss to our Nation as  you depart. May God bless you all.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
