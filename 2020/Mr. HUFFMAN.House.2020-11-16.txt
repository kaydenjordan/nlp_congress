Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1964, the Lumbee Recognition Act, introduced by our colleague  from North Carolina, Mr. Butterfield, will finally extend recognition  to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.   The Lumbee Tribe resides primarily in Robeson, Hoke, Cumberland, and  Scotland Counties of that State and has approximately 60,000 members.  That means it is the largest Tribe in North Carolina, the largest Tribe  east of the Mississippi River, and the ninth largest Tribe in America.   In 1885, this Tribe was recognized by the State of North Carolina. It  then sought Federal recognition from the United States in 1889, and  they have been seeking that recognition ever since.   Over the past 130 years, numerous bills have been introduced in  Congress to federally recognize the Lumbee people, resulting in a  record of hearing transcripts and committee reports. In addition,  numerous academic studies have been undertaken on Lumbee ancestry, and  reports have been requested and filed by the Department of the Interior  on the Tribe's validity.   All of these documents consistently conclude one thing: The Lumbee  people are indeed a distinct, self-governing Indian community that has  been continuously and undeniably present in the Robeson County area.   In 1955, the Lumbee Tribe sought Federal recognition. Unfortunately,  this was during the era known as the termination era, when the United  States sought to terminate relationships with Tribal governments and  force the assimilation of indigenous people into mainstream American  society.   To that end, the Department of the Interior recommended that Congress  amend the legislation to deny eligibility for the benefits and services  available to the Tribe recognized under the bill.   Congress then enacted this amended legislation in 1956, giving it the  dubious effect of simultaneously federally recognizing the Lumbee Tribe  and then effectively terminating that recognition.   In 1987, the Lumbee Tribe again attempted to restore their Federal  recognition, this time through the newly created Federal acknowledgment  process at Interior. However, the Department determined that the Tribe  was ineligible to participate in that process because Congress,  pursuant to that 1956 act, had terminated the relationship with the  Tribe and, therefore, only Congress could restore the relationship.  That is exactly what enactment of this bill will accomplish.   Federal recognition is the formal establishment of a government-to- government relationship between the United States and a Tribal nation.  Its importance to Tribes cannot be overstated.   Federal recognition allows a Tribe to establish a homeland and to put  land into trust to protect future generations. This, in turn, allows  the Tribe to manage its own resources and gives them control over local  jurisdiction and taxation issues.   Recognition also entitles Tribal people to distinctive benefits,  including eligibility to participate in many Federal programs,  including healthcare and education.   That is why enactment of this bill is so vital to the Lumbee people  and why they have been seeking Federal recognition for so very long.   Other Tribes that were terminated by congressional action have come  before Congress, and they have had their relationship reestablished  through legislation. It is finally time that we act on that prerogative  and extend Federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Butterfield for being a champion  of this bipartisan legislation, and I urge its quick adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an email from the  CBO. While we do not have an official CBO score, we do have this email  today confirming that the bill will not affect direct spending or  revenues.

Mr. Speaker, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6237) to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to  clarify the requirement of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the  Department of Defense to reimburse the Indian Health Service for  certain health care services, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6237         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Proper and Reimbursed Care       for Native Veterans Act'' or the ``PRC for Native Veterans       Act''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO                     REIMBURSE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FOR CERTAIN                     HEALTH CARE SERVICES.         Section 405(c) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act       (25 U.S.C. 1645) is amended by inserting before the period at       the end the following: ``, regardless of whether such       services are provided directly by the Service, an Indian       tribe, or tribal organization, through purchased/referred       care, or through a contract for travel described in section       213(b)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, H.R. 6237, is the PRC for Native  Veterans Act, introduced by our colleague from Arizona, Representative  Gallego. This bill will ensure that Native veterans can access high- quality healthcare regardless of the system where they choose to seek  it.   Providing for the healthcare of our veterans should be one of our top  priorities, including the care of approximately 150,000 Native veterans  who have served our country.   By law, a Native veteran is eligible to receive services under both  the VA and Indian Health Service. They can choose which one of those to  use at any given time.   In instances where a Native veteran is eligible for a particular  healthcare service from both the VA and IHS, the VA is considered the  primary payer. As such, the VA reimburses IHS and Tribal facilities for  any direct care they provide.   Here is the problem that sometimes arises: It is with the Purchased/ Referred Care Program, known as PRC. IHS and Tribal facilities are not  always able to directly provide all of the necessary health services a  Tribal member may need, and in order to bridge that gap, the PRC  program was created. It authorizes the purchase of services from a  network of private providers when care is not available at IHS or  Tribal facilities.   During the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care  Improvement Act, Congress amended section 405(c) of that law to require  the VA to reimburse IHS and Tribes for health services provided under  that PRC program.   But the VA now claims that this language does not statutorily require  them to reimburse specialty and referral services through IHS or Tribal  facilities. The VA, instead, insists that the referral must come from  them.   That creates problems. It means that the Native veterans who arrive  at IHS or Tribal facilities needing specialty care are often forced to  travel extreme distances to the nearest VA just to get a redundant  primary care visit and a referral.   These extra steps cause significant hardship for many Native veterans  and can delay critical care. The result is that many IHS and Tribal  facilities are referring Native veterans out for specialty care and  then just paying for it themselves with their already meager PRC fund  so that the patient can be treated in a timely and competent manner.   This bill clarifies that the VA is responsible for reimbursing IHS  and Tribes for any specialty care provided through a referral by an IHS  or Tribal facility.   I think we can all agree our Native veterans should have timely  access to the quality of care they need no matter where they choose to  access it.   I want to thank Representative Gallego for championing this  bipartisan legislation on behalf of all Native veterans, and I urge its  quick adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 327) to amend the Federal Lands  [[Page H5739]]  Recreation Enhancement Act to provide for a lifetime National  Recreational Pass for any veteran with a service-connected disability.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 327         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wounded Veterans Recreation       Act''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL RECREATIONAL PASSES FOR DISABLED VETERANS.         Section 805(b) of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement       Act (16 U.S.C. 6804(b)) is amended by striking paragraph (2)       and inserting the following:        ``(2) Disability discount.--The Secretary shall make the       National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass available,       without charge and for the lifetime of the passholder, to the       following:        ``(A) Any United States citizen or person domiciled in the       United States who has been medically determined to be       permanently disabled, within the meaning of the term       `disability' under section 3 of the Americans with       Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102), if the citizen or       person provides adequate proof of the disability and such       citizenship or residency.        ``(B) Any veteran who has been found to have a service-      connected disability under title 38, United States Code.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill to provide wounded  veterans with free access to our national parks and our public lands.  This clearly is a bipartisan priority, and thanks to the leadership and  hard work of my colleague, Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire, it  cleared the Senate with unanimous support.   I also know that my good friend, Raul Ruiz from California, the House  sponsor of the bill, worked very hard and cares very deeply about the  impact this bill will have on the veteran community.   The Department of the Interior and the Forest Service currently waive  fees for all disabled Americans, and this bill will make this a  permanent and standard feature for all veterans with a service-related  disability, ensuring that there are no barriers to access to the lands  and waters these brave Americans have sacrificed so much to protect.   Sending this bill to the White House for the President's signature  less than a week after Veterans Day is also fitting. It is a meaningful  action that will impact the lives of wounded veterans and recognize  their important contribution and sacrifice. In the Natural Resources  Committee, we have heard numerous stories about the healing and  restorative powers of our public lands for countless veterans.   Again, I want to thank the sponsors of this legislation for their  attention to this issue. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1069) to require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the  Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  to establish a constituent-driven program to provide a digital  information platform capable of efficiently integrating coastal data  with decision-support tools, training, and best practices and to  support collection of priority coastal geospatial data to inform and  improve local, State, regional, and Federal capacities to manage the  coastal region, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1069         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Coast Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for effective       Federal partnerships with State and local government,       nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.        (2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and standards-      based geospatial information, tools, and training to       characterize the United States coastal region is critical for       public safety and for the environment, infrastructure, and       economy of the United States.        (3) More than half of all people of the United States       (153,000,000) currently live on or near a coast and an       additional 12,000,000 are expected in the next decade.        (4) Coastal counties in the United States average 300       persons per square mile, compared with the national average       of 98.        (5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for       construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal       counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and       institutional construction to support this population.        (6) Over half of the economic productivity of the United       States is located within coastal regions.        (7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote sensing and       other geospatial data play an increasingly important role in       decision making and management of the coastal zone and       economy, including for--        (A) flood and coastal storm surge prediction;        (B) hazard risk and vulnerability assessment;        (C) emergency response and recovery planning;        (D) community resilience to longer range coastal change;        (E) local planning and permitting;        (F) habitat and ecosystem health assessments; and        (G) landscape change detection.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Coastal region.--The term ``coastal region'' means the       area of United States waters extending inland from the       shoreline to include coastal watersheds and seaward to the       territorial sea.        (2) Coastal state.--The term ``coastal State'' has the       meaning given the term ``coastal state'' in section 304 of       the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1453).        (3) Federal geographic data committee.--The term ``Federal       Geographic Data Committee'' means the interagency committee       that promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and       dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis.        (4) Remote sensing and other geospatial.--The term ``remote       sensing and other geospatial'' means collecting, storing,       retrieving, or disseminating graphical or digital data       depicting natural or manmade physical features, phenomena, or       boundaries of the Earth and any information related thereto,       including surveys, maps, charts, satellite and airborne       remote sensing data, images, LiDAR, and services performed by       professionals such as surveyors,  [[Page H5740]]       photogrammetrists, hydrographers, geodesists, cartographers,       and other such services.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.       SEC. 4.

(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary $4,000,000 for each       fiscal year 2021 through 2025 to carry out the program.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Digital Coast Act, which passed the Senate by  unanimous consent, is an important piece of legislation, one which we  passed here in the House as part of the Coastal and Great Lakes  Communities Enhancement Act back in December of 2019.   The importance of data in today's world can't be overstated, nor can  the role of the climate crisis. NOAA's Digital Coast Partnership  supports coastal managers with the data they need to confront today's  challenges with intensifying storms, coastal flooding, sea level rise,  and coastal economic development.   Digital Coast is a web-based platform containing data, tools, and  training resources to support our coastal managers. This includes  economic data, satellite imagery, visualization tools, and predictive  tools gathered from hundreds of sources across academia, non- governmental, Federal, State, Tribal, and county partners. The Digital  Coast Partnership also provides coastal managers with collaborative  events like conferences, workshops, and meetings where these managers  can focus on important issues like coastal resilience, ocean planning,  and habitat protection.   This commonsense, good governance legislation would formally  authorize a program that has been proven to work. The National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration estimates that the Digital Coast  Partnership currently produces a 3:1 benefit-to-cost ratio, and they  predict that this ratio will increase to over 5:1 by fiscal year 2028.  [[Page H5741]]    Let's continue to support this amazing program and make the Digital  Coast Act into public law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger) to speak on this bill.   (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 910) to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College  Program Act, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 910         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR NATIONAL SEA                     GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud supporter of the Sea Grant College Program.  In fact, I am the lead author of H.R. 2405 to reauthorize Sea Grant in  the House. Today, I am proud of the bipartisanship this bill has  garnered, and I am happy to stand in support of S. 910, the National  Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act championed by the chair of the  Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Wicker. The Senate passed this bill  by unanimous consent in September. The Senate overwhelmingly supports  this bill on both sides of the aisle.   The House passed my legislation as part of the Coastal and Great  Lakes Communities Enhancement Act back in December 2019, again, a great  piece of legislation that for some reason didn't include the Great Salt  Lake, but we can keep working on that. My hope is that we, once again,  vote in support of this legislation today. This is an exciting day, as  we have never been this close to getting the Sea Grant College Program  reauthorized.   The Sea Grant College Program supports our oceans, coasts, and Great  Lakes through grants and contracts with 33 State-level programs. These  programs support research, education, and advisory services that are  crucial for our coastal communities. Sea Grant is incredibly efficient,  too. For every Federal dollar appropriated, Sea Grant leverages nearly  $3 from partnerships among State universities, State and local  governments, and coastal communities and businesses.   In 2017 alone, after being appropriated $63 million, it is estimated  that Sea Grant Programs helped regenerate $579 million in economic  impacts, created or supported 12,500 jobs, assisted 462 communities to  improve their resilience, restored or protected over 700,000 acres of  coastal ecosystems, worked with 1,300 industry and private sector,  local, State, and regional partners and supported the education and  training of over 1,800 undergraduate and graduate students.   In addition to reauthorizing and updating the Sea Grant College  Program, this bill also makes important updates to the program's Knauss  Marine Policy Fellowship, which fosters our next generation of ocean  and coastal policy managers.   The legislation also identifies Sea Grant spending priorities for the  next 5 years, which include aquatic invasive species, oyster disease  and restoration, harmful algal blooms, coastal resilience, sustainable  aquaculture, and fishery research and extension.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle will likely have one main  complaint about Sea Grant, and that is the decades-old fellowship  program. Somehow I think my colleague across the aisle may believe the  fellowship is a handout to Democratic offices. The truth is that Sea  Grant, which has been around since 1979, focuses on training the next  generation of ocean scientists and policy makers, and fellows end up in  the offices where they can best prepare for future careers in marine  science and policy. Sea Grant fellows have gone on to prominent  positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations. In fact,  the Trump administration's former Chief of Staff at NOAA is a  fellowship alumni.   Further, this legislation will actually help level the playing field  for Republican and Democratic offices vying for fellows by directing  that NOAA ensure equitable distribution among political parties.                                time  1645    I would hope that my colleagues on the Committee on Natural Resources  would take a step back and listen to the many Republicans representing  coastal areas who strongly support this legislation. I thank Senator  Wicker and all the cosponsors of my bill in the House for their support  and their work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this program and vote in  favor of the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the broad bipartisan support for this  bill and its House companion bill, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
