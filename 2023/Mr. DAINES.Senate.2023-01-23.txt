 Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing a true Montana hero, Dr. Daniel Edelman. Dr. Edelman is a  veteran of the U.S. Army who was seriously injured on a mission while  deployed overseas as the noncommissioned officer in charge of security  and intelligence of the 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, First  Infantry Division. Despite his severe injuries, Dr. Edelman pursued and  obtained bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees, along with  several professional certifications, allowing him to have a long and  distinguished career serving his fellow Montanans.   While serving as chancellor at Montana State University-Billings, Dr.  Edelman championed many student causes with a particular focus on  veterans, disabilities, first generation, underserved, and Native  American students. He worked with the FBI and other Agencies to provide  educational opportunities for victims of human trafficking and also  entered into an agreement for MSUB to partner with the University of  North Texas Health Science Center to identify human remains,  particularly those of murdered Native Americans. Additionally, he  created a veteran's success center at MSUB. Dr. Edelman also helped  raise the final funds for a science building and student scholarships.  Outside of his work at MSUB, Dr. Edelman volunteers by serving on the  board of Horses Spirits Healing, a nonprofit that helps veterans with  PTSD.   After a career dedicated to serving Montana and our Nation, Dr.  Edelman recently retired from MSUB due to a terminal condition  connected to his time in the U.S. Army. Dr. Edelman truly embodies the  values and spirit of a Montanan, and I have no doubt that his legacy of  service will continue for generations to come. It is my honor to  recognize Dr. Edelman for his service to our great State and Nation and  for his dedication to improving the lives of his students and fellow  Montana veterans. You have made Montana and our country proud.                            ____________________
