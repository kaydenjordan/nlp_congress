 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues Senator  Klobuchar, Senator Wyden, Senator Hirono, and so many others who have  been out here speaking on behalf of women and their ability to make  their own healthcare decisions after the disastrous decision from the  Supreme Court. And it has been now almost a month since the Supreme  Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the right to abortion, and really  upended healthcare for women across this country.   And every single day, women and providers and patients have been  shouting from the rooftops about how damaging this is, how women's  lives are now at risk. Every single day we are seeing the horrors  caused by Republicans' oppression: women forced to stay pregnant and  give birth when they don't want to; patients denied prescriptions that  they need; a 10-year-old forced to travel across State lines to get an  abortion after being raped; a woman experiencing a miscarriage left  bleeding for 10 days as providers were not clear if they could treat  her due to Republicans' extreme bans.   And all the while, Republicans have been trying to ignore the  devastation that they have caused. And even more cruelly, they have  been trying to distract us, telling us that what we are seeing isn't  really happening. They have tried to say it won't undermine birth- control access, even as patients have been denied Plan B. They have  tried to say we don't need to protect the right to travel for abortion  care, even as some Republicans are already writing and introducing  bills to take that right away.   They have even tried to say their extreme bans won't undermine care  for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, even as providers have already  been forced to change the standard of care because Republicans'  dangerous abortion bans making them perform riskier, invasive surgeries  than would otherwise be necessary or even sit on their hands until  patients' vital signs drop before they can do what is needed to save  lives.   It really is unconscionable. And despite what we have heard from  Republicans, it is happening right now in this country. And I know I am  not the only one who is entirely unconvinced by Republican words about  wanting to support women and families.   I am skeptical when one Republican Senator said:         We have to start thinking in terms of some of these things       . . . to be more supportive of families and mothers.    I am skeptical when another one said:         It's not just a matter of saying, ``We are pro-life.'' It's       a matter . . . of promoting and allowing these people who are       making very difficult decisions with their lives to make sure       we can help.    I was, frankly, surprised when, just last week at a hearing that I  chaired on how this Dobbs decision threatens women's health, the junior  Senator from Kansas claimed he believes that ``family planning  opportunities need to be expanded.'' He even promised to continue  supporting ``robust funding.''   Here is the chance to match that rhetoric with action because Senator  Smith and Senator Warren and I have a bill right here that would do  exactly that. In fact, it is even called the Expanding Access to Family  Planning Act. I know Senator Smith cares a lot about this. While she  can't be here right now due to COVID, I want to thank her for her  leadership on this and explain what this bill does for her.   This bill is pretty simple. It almost couldn't be simpler. It takes  our Nation's longstanding Family Planning Program, title X, and  provides the strong mandatory funding title X needs now to support  patients across the country. That is it. It is very easy. It is very  straightforward.   If Republicans really mean what they are saying, if they are really  serious about expanding access to family planning, there is no reason  why we cannot get this done right now. After all, we are talking about  a program that has a long history of bipartisan support. We are talking  about a program that was signed into law by a Republican, President  Nixon, way back in 1970. We are talking about a program that helps  patients get the birth control they need, the STI testing and the  treatment they count on, the cervical and breast cancer screenings that  could save their lives, and the support they need to plan a family on  their own terms.   This isn't just the popular thing to do, although helping patients  get the birth control they need is an overwhelmingly popular thing to  do; this is the right thing to do. Let's get this done. It should not  be controversial. It simply expands our Nation's longstanding Family  Planning Program--a program, I should note, that we included in our  bipartisan funding bill earlier this year.   Just a few months ago, some Republicans were adamantly against any  increases for this program, but now, as we hear, they are changing  their tune and claiming they do want to support families. They do want  to expand family planning services. They want to do exactly what this  bill does--unless, of course, they don't mean it, and it is simply  rhetoric or just another Republican distraction from the reality that  has been ushered in.  [[Page S3593]]    Right now, the Republicans will have a chance to go on the record on  whether they actually support family planning, whether they actually  want to help people get birth control. And believe me, the same people  Republicans have been trying to ignore--the same people who are having  their healthcare undermined, their lives upended, their controls over  their own bodies taken away--are going to be watching us closely, and  they are not going to forget how much or how little Republicans'  promises are worth.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 4550 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, there you have it--the real Republican  position on expanding family planning summed up in two simple words:  ``I object.''   As much as Republicans are talking now about supporting women's  health, as hard as they might try to pretend that they do support  family planning services, when they have been given a chance today to  do exactly that--to expand a program with a long track record of  helping women get the care they need; a long history, I remind all of  us, of bipartisan support--they stood in the way.   Let's be clear. The bill that the Republicans blocked today does not  fund abortion. The truth is, title X only provides services like birth  control, STI testing, cancer screenings--services Republicans claim to  support.    We are not proposing anything radical or groundbreaking; we are  simply saying we should expand the national Family Planning Program  that already exists, the one President Nixon signed into law decades  ago, the one we have already funded before in a bipartisan way many  times.   Title X is a program that is already providing patients family  planning services and contraception, STI testing and treatment,  screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer, and more. I know that  because I have met with title X providers and patients in my home State  of Washington many times. I would strongly urge my colleagues who block  this bill to do the same. Listen to those patients. Listen to the  doctors. Listen to the nurses in their States. This is a program we  already know helps so many people, and it can help more.   I can't say I am surprised by Republican objections today. I can't  say this is the first time Republicans have said one thing about  women's health and done the opposite, and I think we all know full well  it won't be the last.   My message to the American people who are witnessing this: Pay  attention. Pay attention. The Republican agenda is no to family  planning, no to your right to travel for the healthcare you need, and  no to your constitutional right to abortion.   Senate Democrats and I will not stop holding them accountable for  empty promises or for the devastating harm their extreme abortion bans  are now inflicting on so many patients and families.   I yield the floor.
