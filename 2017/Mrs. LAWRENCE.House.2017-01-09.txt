 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a stand against  those who seek to further divide our Nation. We face the greatest chaos  not by the acts of outsiders or foreign intruders, but by the division  and war with each other. The nomination of Jeff Sessions as our  Attorney General threatens our strength as Americans. Over three  decades of a career in public service, Jeff Sessions' words and actions  lead to one question: Who is included and excluded from the public he  chooses to serve?   Jeff Sessions has referred to the Voting Rights Act as a ``piece of  intrusive legislation.'' The first Federal prosecutor in the country to  bring charges against civil rights activists for voter fraud since the  passage of the VRA in 1965, Sessions has called the Shelby v. Holder  case, which eliminated the preclearance formula, ``good news . . . for  the South.''   Sessions has referred to the NAACP and ACLU civil rights groups  saying they have done more harm than good by trying to force civil  rights down the throats of the good people of the United States. He has  referred to these organizations as un-American and communist inspired.   African Americans and other people of color are disproportionately  affected by acts of voter suppression and the criminal justice system.  Those, among others, are the key areas in which Sessions has shown  deliberate disregard for the justice and equality of all Americans.   This is a pivotal moment in our Nation's history, and we simply  cannot treat the American people like a social experiment. History will  reflect on this moment in time, and our action and inaction will be  accounted for.
