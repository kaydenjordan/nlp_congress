 Madam Speaker, I am not sure what John Lewis my  Republican colleagues are talking about when they say he was their  friend and what he would have wanted. He helped write this bill.   Let me just say that, on behalf of millions of Black voters who stood  in lines across this country, including in my home State of Ohio, and  leaders like our beloved John Lewis, who risked his life as he crossed  the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.   On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, we say we step into  history today as we tread the same path when, 56 years ago, President  Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law calling the day ``a  triumph for freedom as huge as any victory won on any battlefield.''   So to all of my colleagues, I say: Support this bill. Our power, our  message, the Congressional Black Caucus.
