 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Budget Committee for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, there is a big difference between Democrats and  Republicans. We fight for the people; they fight for the privileged  few. We will pass the Build Back Better Act. They passed the GOP tax  scam where 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent  so they could subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. There  is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans.   The Build Back Better Act will invest in the creation of millions of  good-paying jobs and cut taxes for working families. It will lower  childcare costs, housing costs, and education costs; and it will drive  down the high cost of lifesaving prescription drugs.   The Build Back Better Act will invest in a green economy--a  sustainable economy and a resilient economy--and lower energy costs for  everyday Americans.   The Build Back Better Act will create an economy that works for every  single American creating opportunity and prosperity in every single ZIP  Code.   Madam Speaker, I thank President Biden for his extraordinary  leadership. Democrats don't talk about it; we are about it. And because  we are going to build back better for the people here in America, the  best is yet to come.
