 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I can't say it better than the Vice President said it  himself. Vice President Mike Pence said, ``Last week, I did not yield  to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority to  determine the outcome of the election, and I will not now yield to  efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a  time so serious in the life of our Nation.''   Mr. Speaker, I include this letter in the Record.                                              The Vice President,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker: Every American was shocked and saddened       by the attack on our Nation's Capitol last week, and I am       grateful for the leadership that you and other congressional       leaders provided in reconvening Congress to complete the       people's business on the very same day. It was a moment that       demonstrated to the American people the unity that is still       possible in Congress when it is needed most.        But now, with just eight days left in the President's term,       you and the Democratic Caucus are demanding that the Cabinet       and I invoke the 25th Amendment. I do not believe that such a       course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or       consistent with our Constitution. Last week, I did not yield       to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority       to determine the outcome of the election, and I will not now       yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play       political games at a time so serious in the life of our       Nation.        As you know full well, the 25th Amendment was designed to       address Presidential incapacity or disability. Just a few       months ago, when you introduced legislation to create a 25th       Amendment Commission, you said, ``[a] President's fitness for       office must be determined by science and facts.'' You said       then that we must be ``[v]ery respectful of not making a       judgment on the basis of a comment or behavior that we don't       like, but based on a medical decision.'' Madam Speaker, you       were right. Under our Constitution, the 25th Amendment is not       a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th       Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedent.        After the horrific events of this last week, our       Administration's energy is directed to ensuring an orderly       transition. The Bible says that ``for everything there is a       season, and a time for every purpose under heaven . . . a       time to heal . . . and a time to build up.'' That time is       now. In the midst of a global pandemic, economic hardship for       millions of Americans, and the tragic events of January 6th,       now is the time for us to come together, now is the time to       heal.        I urge you and every member of Congress to avoid actions       that would further divide and inflame the passions of the       moment. Work with us to lower the temperature and unite our       country as we prepare to inaugurate President-elect Joe Biden       as the next President of the United States. I pledge to you       that I will continue to do my part to work in good faith with       the incoming administration to ensure an orderly transition       of power. So help me God.            Sincerely,                                                  Michael R. Pence,      Vice President of the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Vice President for his  excellent leadership, for his professionalism, and, frankly, for his  faithfulness to our Constitution.   Not only would it be an abuse of the 25th Amendment for Mike Pence to  invoke it to make a political statement, it is clearly not our role in  Congress to do what we are doing here tonight or what is proposed to be  done by the majority.   Speaker Pelosi claims that President Trump incited the mob that  attacked the Capitol at a rally. As Mr. McClintock spoke earlier, he  read the President's statement. He encouraged people to come peaceably  and patriotically.   The Washington Post is reporting something that I would hope that our  chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence would know  about. The FBI report warned of war at the Capitol the day before the  attack on our Capitol. I am curious how someone proposes that the  President incited the mob at a rally the day before the rally.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article.                 [From The Washington Post, Jan. 12, 2021]   FBI Report Warned of `War' at Capitol, Contradicting Claims There Was                     No Indication of Looming Violence                   (By Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky)         A day before rioters stormed Congress, an FBI office in       Virginia issued an explicit warning that extremists were       preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and       ``war,'' according to an internal document reviewed by The       Washington Post that contradicts a senior official's       declaration the bureau had no intelligence indicating anyone       at last week's demonstrations in support of President Trump       planned to do harm.        A situational information report approved for release the       day before the U.S. Capitol riot painted a dire portrait of       dangerous plans, including individuals sharing a map of the       complex's tunnels, and possible rally points for would-be       conspirators to meet in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts       and South Carolina and head in groups to Washington.        ``As of 5 January 2021, FBI Norfolk received information       indicating calls for violence in response to `unlawful       lockdowns' to begin on 6 January 2021 in Washington, D.C.,''       the document says. ``An online thread discussed specific       calls for violence to include stating `Be ready to fight.       Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in,       and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being       spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or       a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we       die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.''        BLM is probably a reference to the Black Lives Matter       movement for racial justice. Pantifa is a derogatory term for       antifa, a far-left anti-fascist movement whose adherents       sometimes engage in violent clashes with right-wing       extremists.        Yet even with that information in hand, the report's       unidentified author expressed concern that the FBI might be       encroaching on free-speech rights.        The warning is the starkest evidence yet of the sizable       intelligence failure that preceded the mayhem, which claimed       the lives of five people, although one law enforcement       official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid       disciplinary action, said the failure was not one of       intelligence but of acting on the intelligence.        At the FBI office in Norfolk, the report was written within       45 minutes of receiving the information, officials said, and       shared with counterparts in Washington.        The head of the FBI's Washington Field Office, Steven       D'Antuono, told reporters on Friday that the agency did not       have intelligence suggesting the pro-Trump rally would be       anything more than a lawful demonstration. During a news       conference Tuesday, held after The Post's initial publication       of this report, he said the alarming Jan. 5 intelligence       document was shared ``with all our law enforcement partners''       through the joint terrorism task force, which includes the       U.S. Capitol Police, the U.S. Park Police, D.C. police, and       other federal and local agencies.        He suggested there was not a great deal for law enforcement       to do with the information because the FBI at that time did       not know who made the comments. ``That was a thread on a       message board that was not attributable to an individual       person,'' D'Antuono said Tuesday.        D'Antuono did not say what, if anything, the FBI or other       agencies did differently as a result of that information. Nor       did he explain why he told reporters on Friday that there had       been no such intelligence.        Steven Sund, who resigned as Capitol Police chief, said in       an interview Tuesday that he never received nor was made       aware of the FBI's field bulletin, insisting he and others       would have taken the warning seriously had it been shared.        ``I did not have that information, nor was that information       taken into consideration in our security planning,'' Sund       said.        Since the riot, agents and prosecutors have been intent on       tracking down and arresting the most violent participants in       the mob, in part because there is already significant online       discussion of new potential clashes for Sunday and again on       Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden is set to take the       oath of office.        Michael R. Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for D.C., said       there would be a strike force of prosecutors looking to file       charges of seditious conspiracy where the evidence merited       it.  [[Page H144]]         The Jan. 5 FBI report notes that the information represents       the view of the FBI's Norfolk office, is not to be shared       outside law enforcement circles, that it is not ``finally       evaluated intelligence,'' and that agencies receiving it       ``are requested not to take action based on this raw       reporting without prior coordination with the FBI.''        Multiple law enforcement officials have said privately in       recent days that the level of violence exhibited at the       Capitol has led to difficult discussions within the FBI and       other agencies about race, terrorism and whether       investigators failed to register the degree of danger because       the overwhelming majority of the participants at the rally       were White conservatives fiercely loyal to Trump.        ``Individuals/Organizations named in this [situational       information report] have been identified as participating in       activities that are protected by the First Amendment to the       U.S. Constitution,'' the document says. ``Their inclusion       here is not intended to associate the protected activity with       criminality or a threat to national security, or to infer       that such protected activity itself violates federal law.        ``However,'' it continues, ``based on known intelligence       and/or specific historical observations, it is possible the       protected activity could invite a violent reaction towards       the subject individual or others in retaliation or with the       goal of stopping the protected activity from occurring in the       first instance. In the event no violent reaction occurs, FBI       policy and federal law dictates that no further record be       made of the protected activity.''        The document notes that one online comment advised, ``if       Antifa or BLM get violent, leave them dead in the street,''       while another said they need ``people on standby to provide       supplies, including water and medical, to the front lines.       The individual also discussed the need to evacuate       noncombatants and wounded to medical care.''        On Jan. 6, a large, angry crowd of people who had attended       a rally nearby marched to the Capitol, smashing windows and       breaking doors to get inside. One woman in the mob was shot       and killed by Capitol Police; officials said three other in       the crowd had medical emergencies and died. A Capitol Police       officer died after suffering injuries.        The FBI said in a statement that its ``standard practice is       to not comment on specific intelligence products,'' but added       that FBI field offices ``routinely share information with       their local law enforcement partners to assist in protecting       the communities they serve.''        For weeks leading up to the event, FBI officials discounted       any suggestion that the activities of Trump supporters upset       about the scheduled certification of Biden's election win       could be a security threat on a scale with the racial-justice       demonstrations that followed the police killing of George       Floyd in Minneapolis in May.        While the nation's capital is one of the most heavily       guarded cities on the planet, local and federal law       enforcement agencies sought to take a low-key approach to       last week's event, publicly and privately expressing concerns       that they did not want to repeat last year's ugly clashes       between protesters and police.        Some law enforcement officials took the view that       protesters who support Trump are generally known for over-      the-top rhetoric but not much violence, and therefore the       event did not pose a particularly serious risk, according to       people familiar with the security discussions leading up to       Jan. 6.        Even so, there were warning signs, though none as stark as       the one from the FBI's Norfolk office.        FBI agents had in the weeks before the Trump rally visited       suspected far-right extremists, hoping to glean whether they       had violent intentions, said a person familiar with the       matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the       law enforcement activity. It was not immediately clear who       was visited or if the FBI was specifically tracking anyone       who would later be charged criminally. These visits were       first reported Sunday by NBC News.        In addition, in the days leading up to the demonstrations,       some Capitol Hill staffers were told by supervisors to not       come in to work that day, if possible, because it seemed the       danger level would be higher than many previous protests,       according to a person familiar with the warning who spoke on       the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Capitol       Police did not take the kind of extra precautions, such as       frozen zones and hardened barriers, that are typically used       for major events near the Capitol.        Federal agents are on high alert as the inauguration nears,       with authorities bracing for possible violence not just in       Washington but also nationwide, officials said.        The FBI recently issued a different memo saying that       ``armed protests'' were being planned ``at all 50 state       capitols'' and in D.C. in the run-up to the inauguration,       according to an official familiar with the matter, speaking       on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive law       enforcement matter.        The memo--first reported by ABC News and later confirmed by       The Post--is a raw intelligence product, compiling       information gathered by the bureau and several other       government agencies, the official familiar with the matter       said. Some of it is unverified, and the threat probably will       differ significantly from place to place, the official said.        But the information it highlights to law enforcement is       nonetheless troubling--including that there was data       suggesting people might storm government offices or stage an       uprising were Trump to be removed from office, the official       said.        In a statement, the FBI declined to comment specifically on       the memo about state capitols but said: ``Our efforts are       focused on identifying, investigating, and disrupting       individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in       criminal activity. As we do in normal course of business, we       are gathering information to identify any potential threats       and are sharing that information with our partners.        ``The FBI respects The rights of individuals to peacefully       exercise their First Amendment rights,'' it said. ``Our focus       is not on peaceful protesters, but on those threatening their       safety and the safety of other citizens with violence and       destruction of property.''     Others are reporting a timeline that has the breach out  of sync as well, but that highlights the importance. There is far too  little that we know about this attack on our Capitol.   Here is what we do know. No one has defended this attack on our  Capitol. On the contrary, we are missing--willfully missing, in my  opinion--a moment of extreme unity in our Nation, just like what was  willfully done earlier this year.   At a time of great political and partisan division, even seething  anger, one thing all Americans seem to agree on is that these attacks  were wrong. The President condemned them. He discouraged violence, not  just on January 6 but on other days throughout the year as he talked  about law and order and as he talked about something that we finally  seem to agree on, that there is a clear distinction between the  Constitution's First Amendment protection of the right to assemble  peaceably and riots, criminal, unlawful riots.   There is a distinction between rioters and protesters. Frankly, it  took us months to agree on that as a body in Congress, but the people  of the United States of America agreed to it. They understood it.   I encourage my colleagues across the political spectrum, the Members  of Congress gathered here together today and tomorrow, to stand united  and move forward with the agreement our country had, that this was  wrong.
