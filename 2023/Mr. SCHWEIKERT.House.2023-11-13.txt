 Mr. Speaker, it feels like it has been a while since  we had these. I think it has been 6 weeks since I have been behind this  microphone, 6 weeks since we basically shot ourselves in the temple and  all the other craziness that went on.   The amazing thing is in those 6 weeks, you would be stunned how much  the numbers, the debt numbers, have moved against us. This is just a  fascinating time.   Think of this: within a month or so, we have actually been having to  recalculate our projections of debt deficits and what was going on. If  that doesn't give you a sense of this thing called interest rate  fragility, basically meaning  [[Page H5717]]  as interest rates go up it is consuming more and more and more of the  available resources that you could have either put into your  communities or maybe into military or other things.   I am going to show you a couple charts in a moment. Interest, the  Office of Management and Budget, Treasury just a couple hours ago did  an update that shows that gross interest this fiscal year will not be  the fourth biggest expense, it will be the second biggest expense.  Social Security, interest, Medicare, defense.   Now, that is a gross number, but we are going to talk about what  gross and net means in the U.S. Government interest rate world.   Let's actually walk through some of the parameters here. Once again,  our basic rule is if you don't like math and don't want to deal with  reality, please stop watching.   This is our update from 2023. Mr. Speaker, 73 percent of the spending  Members of Congress functionally have no voice on--we don't vote on  it--that is mandatory, it is Social Security; it is Medicare; certain  veterans' benefits; certain Tribal benefits, those things that are a  formula, we call mandatory. They are mostly earned benefits. Some are  benefits you get because you fell below a certain income, but they are  a formula.   You see this green and this blue. The blue is defense. The green, 15  percent, that is all other--let's call it nondefense discretionary. The  blue obviously is all of defense. That is 13 percent. All of this  colored area right here, the green and the blue, is on borrowed money.  Every dime Members of Congress vote on is on borrowed money.   Then last year, about $400 billion of this red was on borrowed money.   So as we kick each other's heads in here, which a lot of it is well  worth doing, fighting for a little here, a little there, we are  borrowing about $6.5 billion a day--I think on the average of about  $77,000 or $78,000 a second.   One of the reasons I come back to this is being home this weekend and  having some conversations with people--these are smart people. I  represent one of the best educated districts in America. You have these  conversations, and people say, David, if it just weren't for waste and  fraud; David, if it weren't for foreign aid. For my friends on the  left, I am going to show a bunch of slides here because I need to nail  this down. They say, if we just would tax rich people more, we would be  fine.   None of that is true.   You take the math and take every Democrat proposal starting with this  one and do tax maximization on those over 400,000. On estate tax,  income tax, capital gains tax, you do the tax maximization, and then do  the economic model, and you get about 1.5 percent of GDP. Last year we  borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP.   It turns out 1.5 is a hell of a lot less than 8.4. This being a math- free zone, I thought we might do this several times to see if some of  it sinks in.   Once again, 73 percent of our spending is on autopilot. If we don't  really move defense, all we are fighting over right now is within this  green wedge--15 percent of our spending.   That is what is going on.   Let's actually talk through what is happening around us. If I had  come to this floor a year or two ago and said gross interest in the  2024 fiscal year was going to cross over a trillion dollars, you would  have laughed your hearts out.   Guess what? OMB, a couple hours ago, confirmed gross interest is  going to be over $1 trillion this year, making it the second-biggest  expense of this government.   Does anyone understand, a couple years ago, 3 or 4 years ago, we were  looking at numbers of 300, $400 billion? We have more than doubled it.  Does anyone care? Is it just one of those, you know, we can just  continue to ignore it?   A couple months ago, I came here and showed some charts that in this  fiscal year we are going to bring 9.6--that was our best model--$9.6  trillion to market. About $2 trillion we estimated to be virgin, new,  issuance. That is from the borrowing from this year. The rest is what  we call refinancing. It is the short bonds, even some longer bonds.  Many of these bonds were really low, I mean, just slightly above zero,  and they are coming back for refinancing.   All of a sudden you have how many trillions and trillions of dollars  that are down here with almost no interest expense to this government  to our taxpayers, and now they are coming in, and we are starting to  see mean interest moving over 3 percent, and it keeps going up.   This should be what we talk about on the floor. If this continues, it  consumes everything in its path.   Is interest Republican or Democrat? It is just something we have to  pay, but trust me, we will find a way to turn it partisan.   This is one of the punch lines I need us to try to get our heads  around. We are modeling for the 2024 year. So the fiscal year we are in  now, we just finished our first month of it, Social Security we expect  to come in about $1.45 trillion.   Gross interest. As of a couple hours ago we adjusted it. Actually,  our model was a billion dollars over this, but CBO came in and said  gross interest is now over a trillion dollars.   Now, if you want to do net--and now might be the time to explain the  difference. What is the difference between net interest and gross  interest?   When Treasury reaches over to the Social Security trust fund--which  is also gone in about 8 or 9 years--reaches over and grabs that money  and spends it, we put special T-bills, Treasury bills over there, but  we have to pay them interest, and we pay them interest twice a year.   It is still an expense. It is still money that got paid for the rent  of this money, and you take all the trust funds, and that is the  difference between whether we are going to pay as the Treasury is  coming back and saying 839--I need to disclose, my model, our joint  economic model is closer to 879, and we have been more accurate the  last 2 years than Treasury has, but gross interest, money we will spend  on interest as this government is now over a trillion dollars.   Our third biggest spend now is Medicare. Medicare moved up 12.3  percent last year. For its scale, interest moved up 38 percent.  Medicare moved up over 12 percent. Those are the primary growers in  borrowing and spending.   Then number four, the fourth biggest expense now is defense. You run  into someone at the grocery store back home and ask them--particularly  if they lean on the left side, and they almost immediately viscerally  go straight to defense. How many of them will believe defense is now  the fourth biggest expenditure? It is no longer the first. It is not  the second. It is not the third. It is the fourth.   Interest now has become the second.   If I had held up this chart a year ago, you would have stared at me  like I was out of my mind. It has happened. It has happened. We have  talked about how this was coming, and in some ways it saddens me that  the prediction has come true.   You have got to understand when you start seeing these--and we did it  in chart fashion to try to make it more visual. Here is Social  Security. Here is interest. Here is Medicare. Here is defense now.  Healthcare costs and interest. Your government is an insurance company  with an Army, and the interest payments just keep coming.   We actually believe this number is wrong, we think it is out of date,  but the point of this chart is to show you what interest fragility is  doing to us.   In 2022, we spent $475 billion in interest. In 2023 we spent 659, and  we thought that was outrageous. Our number is actually 880 for primary  interest, not gross. Even if we use the most conservative number we  have been given, and this number is already now a month or so out of  date, you are looking at another 30 percent growth in just that  spending line. That is not counting for the interest we pay ourselves  from the borrowing when we borrow out of the trust funds.   Look, I know this didn't move the markets, and it won't move the  markets until we start to have a really stressed bond auction, but you  already know that two of the biggest credit rating agencies have done  an actual downgrade. Moody's last Friday basically put us on downgrade  watch. They still let us have our AAA, but they said we believe the  bias is now negative.   You do realize there are five, six countries now out there that have  better credit ratings than the United States. Good job, guys. We should  all be very, very proud of ourselves.  [[Page H5718]]    Not that anyone here pays attention to the bond market, but why I  keep coming back to the bond market is because we are incapable of  doing our job here telling the truth about the math. Remember, 100  percent of the borrowing from today through the next 30 years is  demographics. It takes away some of the political fun out of it,  doesn't it, when you can't sort of say, well, it is this or that.   We got old. Take a look at the baseline data. It is healthcare costs,  it is interest, it is Medicare, it is Social Security, and it is in,  functionally, 9 years when that trust fund is gone.   This is a chart of what happened, I think it was Thursday or Friday,  we had a 30-year bond auction. Did anyone pay attention to the fact  that it was substantially what they call undersubscribed?   It wasn't a disaster, but there were definitely signs of stress. It  shot up. That is what this line is here. They had to spike up the  interest rates on those 30-year bonds to get the buyers, get them sold,  and I believe--and I may have my number wrong--I believe the primary  dealers, this is actually a special deal they have with Treasury, the  primary dealers had to take down, had to buy almost a quarter of these  bonds. In past years it would have only been around 12 percent. That is  a big deal. The fact of the matter is you had to turn the switch, and  the dealers had to take down the bonds because there weren't enough  buyers.   Does anyone in this body pay any attention to the fact that if we are  borrowing $6.5 billion a day and then we are about to refinance several  trillion dollars this year, how much of this we have to bring to market  every couple weeks? If this had gotten a little bit worse, this would  have been the headlines over the weekend.                                time  2015    Let's actually start to walk through, once again, our realities. The  reason I am walking through this chart is I am going to spend some time  on where the spending is. I am going to spend some time on where the  tax receipts are and who pays them. We are going to spend some time on  some of the proposals out there to show how hollow they are, because I  am so tired of having conversations with people who I know are smart  and they are so wrapped in folklore about the U.S. debt and deficits.   Even in this body, we will knife each other. Trust me, I have been  involved in those knife fights. I have offered some of the most brutal  amendments on this floor for cutting spending. We will go to war with  each other, and the debate time on the floor, if we are borrowing  $77,000 a second, there was more borrowing during the time of the  debate than the amendment would have saved.   Social Security is about 21 percent of our spend. Now, you always  need to think of Social Security as unique. It functionally has its own  tax line, FICA taxes. Why do we keep coming back and paying attention  to it? This is one of the brutal dishonesties I get, particularly from  our brothers and sisters on the left.   I actually watched one Democrat Member over here--I think she is  running for Senate in California--on one of the leftwing cable  television shows holding a little white board going: You see, it adds  nothing to the deficit. She is absolutely right. Social Security adds  nothing to the deficit.   In 9 years, we double senior poverty, because in 9 years there is a  25 percent cut to Social Security. I am going to walk through some of  those slides to understand the scale.   That is one of the reasons, if you have someone talking about debt  and deficits and they are talking about the future, if they are not  talking about how to save Social Security, they are completely  dishonest, they are absolutely hollow, and they are immoral.   I am going to show also the proposals being given to us by the left  on what we can tax only gets you about 20 percent. I am going to show  the charts that say just get rid of the cap, tax everyone the 12.4  percent, and you only cover about 20 percent of the shortfall. We have  no concept of the scale. Remember, the shortfall is functionally three- quarters of what we spend on defense. There is this lack of  understanding of how brutal the math is.   No, you can't actually tax your way out of this, and, no, my brothers  and sisters, we can't actually cut our way out of this, because the  growth is actually because we got old. We made promises, and we haven't  figured out how to finance them. It is a moral imperative that this  group gets off its heinies and starts putting some batteries in their  calculators and starts understanding the scale of what we are talking  about.   Social Security is 21 percent. Medicare is 13. National defense is  13. Interest is 10. That was last year. That interest now is closer to  13, 14, 15 percent of our total budget. Just in that 1 year, now that  we are starting to refinance our bonds and the trillions we are having  to sell that are new borrowing at those new interest rates, this whole  hierarchy is changing. We get what for paying the interest?   Now, if you are one of the people that goes: Well, we are paying  China. China only owns, we think, maybe $800 billion, $900 billion of  our bonds. Still a lot of money, and, yes, they may hold certain of our  bonds offshore. Our best guesstimate is Japan owns more and is our  number one that we are indebted to, but that is only like a $1 trillion  or $1.4 trillion. Most of the rest is actually what we finance  ourselves. We owe our own pension systems, like your retirement. If you  have a 401(k), you will find out that part of this U.S. sovereign debt  is in it.   This is important to understand when we start talking about the  growth of our obligations. This year, 12,000 of our brothers and  sisters turn 65 per day. Sixty-five years ago, this was one of the peak  years of the baby boom. We get 12,000 baby boomers turn 65 per day  right now.   Our estimate is Social Security this year will pop up to $1.450  trillion. That is about 7.9 percent growth, even though the COLA is  only a fraction of that. Last year the COLA was 8.3, and the spending  went up 11.1. How did it do that? Because of the increase in  population. A decade ago, 1 out of 8 Americans was 65. Two years ago, 1  out of 6 was 65. It is demographics.   How often do we ever talk about the reality of our demographics? How  many of you saw the article from the Census Bureau that was put out a  couple days ago? Did you see what is happening on our fertility rates?  Looks like in 15, 18 years, this country has more deaths than births.  We have about 40, maybe 50 years, and actually then we roll over, and  the United States actually might start to have a declining population.  It is demographics. That is part of our job here, but it would require  math.   Let's actually walk through something that just frustrates me so  much, because I believe it is moral to fix it and immoral to avoid the  conversation. The fact I talk about saving Social Security, I get  attack ads back home; because he talked about it; let's attack him.   It is not 2034. It is 2033. We have a mistake on our boards. I  apologize for that. We estimate in functionally 9 budget years, the  very first year the trust fund is gone, the shortfall is $616 billion.  First year, the trust fund is gone.   Let's go to the solutions we get from our left. Let's just tax  everyone over $400,000. We are going to tax them the 12.4 percent tax,  unlimited income, and they get no benefit for it. All right. Except the  problem is, the best math says that gets you about $86 billion.  Remember, $616 billion is the shortfall. I did this on a single year to  make it more understandable. $616 billion is our shortfall in 2033.  Taxing everyone over $400,000 the 12.4 percent tax and giving them no  benefit only produces about $86 billion.   Let's get rid of that. No cap at all. You get your benefits up to-- what is it? Next year I think it is $168,000. We are going to tax  everyone above that the 12.4 percent, but you get no benefits. How much  of that first year's shortfall would it cover? Remember, the shortfall  is $616 billion. You cover $164 billion of it. Twenty percent? This is  the solution we are being given.    Does anyone understand the scale and the fact that to recapitalize  something that is burning through in a few years, that is three- quarters of a trillion dollars a year shortfall.   What does it take to recapitalize parts of that Social Security trust  fund or to actually have enough taxes? I am going to show you a slide  in a little while where you can go to a 20 percent  [[Page H5719]]  VAT tax in the United States, with all of other taxes, and you still  can't get close to covering the Social Security shortfall.   Why isn't this place terrified about this? Because it is such a great  political issue to attack people who try to save it.   Is it moral, the fact that in 9 years, you double senior poverty in  America? That is what is being laid upon us.   You see these parasite groups that fill up our email boxes: You can't  talk about that. Just tax rich people more.   I am going to keep showing you, it doesn't get you anywhere near what  is required. We are going to have to do really difficult but really  complex--complex problems all have simple solutions that are absolutely  wrong. It turns out complex problems require complex solutions, and in  this case, they require a hell of a lot of math.   The reason for this chart, all the big trust funds are gone over the  next 8.5 to 9 years. Transportation is gone. Medicare part A is gone.  The big behemoth, the Social Security trust fund, is gone.   I am glad we are spending lots of time working on the fact of how we  are going to not dramatically increase senior poverty in this country,  how we are not about to do what is necessary to protect our brothers  and sisters, what is necessary to grow the economy.   I have a 16-month-old son. I have an 8-year-old daughter. No making  fun about being an old dad. My wife is exactly my age. Do they have the  right to live as well as we did?   If you look at the math, the basic math from CBO says something like  in 20 years, every single U.S. tax needs to double just to maintain  baseline services. Does anyone here actually care? Is it too hard? Is  this too difficult? I thought this is what we were here for, to  basically have common prosperity. Instead, we lie, or we lie through  avoidance.   Even with 100 percent tax rates on small businesses, upper-income  families, when we did the math, we are heading toward times--remember,  we borrowed 8.4 percent of the GDP, so this slide is already out of  date. You do a 100 percent tax--which obviously anyone with the most  basic elementary school economics class, when you take everything, no  one works at all. If you take every dime of upper-income families and  small businesses, you might cover 5 percent of GDP. Think about that.  If we borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP last year, during a time when we are  being told how wonderful Bidenomics was, how wonderful the economy was,  does anyone see something is horribly wrong around us?   Then you start walking through the actual pay-fors. The reason this  slide is really important, this is just Social Security and Medicare.  The shortfall is about 5.5 percent of the economy. We are using 2040 as  the base year. If you have 5.5 percent, that is the amount of the  economy that is short and you start walking through. One of the reasons  I grabbed this board is if you impose a 20 percent VAT tax, a national  sales tax, it doesn't even come close to covering half of the Social  Security shortfall. That is a 20 percent VAT tax. Understand, VAT taxes  basically crush the middle class.   We have this fight around here about the middle class, the working  poor. These numbers are terrifying, but we will do everything we can to  avoid telling the truth.   In just 20 months, President Biden added $4.8 trillion to the 10-year  deficits. To all the people who spend their time attacking the 2017 tax  reform--that did an amazing job of closing income inequality, then this  little pandemic thing hit--when it was first scored, might be $1.7  trillion, then add some interest on it, but it turns out it had  dramatic impact on growing tax receipts. In 20 months, our brothers and  sisters on the left basically laid in $4.8 trillion, like 2.5 times  more than the tax reform. Are they willing to be intellectually honest  and say maybe they are a little duplicitous in their language?   These things start getting geeky. One of the problems is, when you  start dealing in very large numbers on U.S. budget issues and at a time  of inflation, the most rational way to do it is you do it by  percentages of GDP, except no one knows what that means. It is actually  the proper way to do your comparisons because it basically normalizes  what would be your inflationary growth.   This is important to understand where the tax receipts come from. The  top 20 percent have an effective tax rate of about 15 percent of their  income. The second quartile, the next 20 percent down, have 5.7 percent  of their income.                                time  2030    The bottom 40 percent of the income earners in America actually get  money from the government. They don't pay taxes. They get money on  income taxes. The working middle class, if you are in that third  quartile of 20 percent, you are in that 40 to 60 percent, you are  paying 2.2 percent of your income.   Do you understand after the December 2017 tax reform that in the  United States our income tax actually got more progressive. More  progressive, not less progressive. The working poor and the working  middle class, before tax reform, actually paid a higher percentage of  their income to taxes than they do today.   How many times have you ever heard that?   We have real trouble telling the truth about math around here when it  doesn't actually fit one person's campaign ad. The facts are the facts.   This is a new chart for us. I am trying to figure out how you figure  out where the tax receipts come from. Let's have a little fun.   If you are part of that top 20 percent--and understand the top 20  percent it turns out is a lot lower than $400,000, depending on parts  of the country. The top $400,000 and up, you are in the top 5 percent  of the income earners. Understand what we are grabbing here.   They actually would pay about 209 days of the Federal budget. The  next group pays 44 days. The next group pays 19 days. The bottom 40  percent pays 5 days. If you go from people that are very, very poor up  to the 40 percent of the population, they pay for 5 days of the Federal  budget, and then 88 days is borrowed.   Basically you see that 25 to 30 percent of what we spend is borrowed.  This is the math. Our brothers and sisters on the left believe we are  going to finance the rest of the government from this population up  here. I am going to show you the slide saying, okay, maximize their tax  rates. Maximize them up and down, everything, and then normalize it for  the economic effects. You get about 1.5 or 1.6. It just doesn't get you  there.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    The reason I am doing this again is that I have just  grown exhausted trying to work with some of my brothers and sisters on  the Democrat side who I have walked through the math with, and say,  here are some ideas and things we can do. They say, no, people just  want us to tax rich people more. Okay. Fine. Maybe do it. The next day,  can we go back to talk about the problem because you didn't fix  anything?   Taxing the rich could raise, at most, 1 to 2 percent of the GDP by  maxing out all the different tax rates and then adjusting for the  economic losses.   Let's say you get the full 2 percent. We borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP  last year. I know I have come back and done this again, but is anyone  paying attention?   Let's walk through this in a little more detail. I will do this  quickly. Maximizing sustainable revenues from taxing the rich. Let's  actually maximize income taxes. Raise the top two income tax brackets  by another 10 percent. There is a whole model out there--I need to  explain this for someone who doesn't live in this economic world.   There is this concept that you can raise taxes to a point where you  maximize receipts--technically, the government doesn't have revenues,  they get receipts--but the next incremental tax hike rolls over and you  start to get fewer receipts.   Capital gains is actually in many ways the most sensitive to this.  There is sort of this maximizing rate--and we actually have very, very  good models on this now. If you took every single tax and did the  maximizing of the rates, and that is what we have actually seen here,  from removing itemized deductions to paring back retirement  [[Page H5720]]  income abuses, and all the other things, everything you can do, you can  go up and down the list, and you start to see the calculations.   The Manhattan Institute and Brian Riedl, about 2 months ago, has a  fairly detailed paper. It is all referenced. It is not only referenced  from the Tax Foundation, joint tax, CBO, but even some progressive  groups are in the footnotes on how this math works.   This is if you maximized every single tax. Why this gets important-- why don't I just skip to the punch line. It looks like when you do the  economic adjustment you get 1.1 to 2 percent of GDP by taxing the rich.  Okay. Maybe we should do that. Maybe it will make us feel better  because God knows we now make our public policy here by our feelings.   The point I keep coming back to is we borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP  last year. If you actually do the blend, you get about 1.5 points. That  is how childish the discussion is here. You asked for real math and  real policy decisions.   We, on the right, are going to battle each other and try to cut parts  of nondefense discretionary. Okay. There is a bunch of that I would  love to get rid of. It is a really interesting ethical question. Is it  ethical for us to borrow money and give it to entities around the  country that have their own taxing authority?   That is going to be politically really unpopular. It is sort of  absurd that we do that. About 40 percent of nondefense discretionary is  actually transferred to these entities that have their own taxing  authority.   If you are functionally borrowing $80 billion, $90 billion a month,  we just covered 3\1/3\ months' worth of borrowing by wiping out most of  the discretionary budget, and then the next year it gets worse, the  next year it gets worse, the next year it gets worse.   Remember, 100 percent of the future borrowing is driven by Medicare,  and then in 9 years the Social Security trust fund is gone. I showed  you the scale for that.   Mr. Speaker, I have come behind this microphone for years now and  walked actually through some really interesting things we can do. We  saw during the 1-minutes some of our brothers and sisters came up and  talked about this being National Diabetes Awareness Month.   Diabetes is the single biggest cost of healthcare. Actually, it is  the single biggest cost to this government. It is 33 percent of  healthcare and 31 percent of Medicare. I have come up here repeatedly  and talked about what we can do in the farm bill, the new blood glucose  monitors, the discussion of some of the GLP-1s and the effect they are  having on obesity and diabetes.   There is a path, and it turns out the Joint Economic Committee, about  4 months ago, the Republican side--we actually went where we are not  supposed to go, but it was real math. We talked about our brothers' and  sisters' longevity. The fact is that in the last 4 years the life  expectancy in the United States has fallen.   If you actually look at the math, what is the number one reason?   It wasn't drugs. Drugs was up there. It was obesity. Let's actually  have an honest conversation because it also turns out it is not only a  moral battle to save our brothers and sisters from dying young, it also  is the most powerful thing you can do to start to stabilize U.S. debt  is helping Americans be healthier.   Isn't that something neat?   Is that Republican or Democrat?   It is neither. It is just the right thing to do.   We were coming up with a few trillion dollars over 10 years by taking  out obesity. Because of diabetes there is heart disease, kidney  failures, and all these other things.   I am just trying to do two things here: First, I am trying to get to  an understanding of how brutally ugly the actual debt and deficit math  is, and that the solutions being provided to it are just fantasyland,  ridiculous, childish, and asinine.   The second thing I am trying to do when I come behind the mike, there  are things we can do to have a revolution and stabilize this debt, and  none of them are going to be easy.   In the complexity is the morality. We could work with people to be  healthier. We could bring technology to make life easier, to provide  more access, particularly to healthcare, and you would disrupt the  cost.   The hardest part for us as electeds, you have to deal with those  armies of lobbyists marching up and down your hallways. You have to  look them in the eye, and say, in many ways the morality, the cure, is  in the disruption of doing the right and moral thing. I just don't know  if this body has the intellectual prowess to deal with that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
