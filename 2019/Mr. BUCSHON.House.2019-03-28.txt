 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishment of an outstanding group of young men from Vincennes  University in Indiana.   For the first time since 1972 and the fourth time in school history,  the Vincennes University Trailblazers captured the National Junior  College Athletic Association Men's Basketball Championship.   Led by coach Todd Franklin, the Blazers had a benchmark year, ending  the season with a record of 34-2 and defeating Ranger College in the  championship game by a score of 87-77.   The team's standout in the finals was freshman forward Kevin Osawe,  who scored 22 points and had ten rebounds, earning the tournament's  most valuable player honors.   Athletics provide a set of skills that will be with these young men  for the rest of their lives.   The commitment and follow-through required to come together as a team  and win a national championship are rare and should be commended.   Congratulations to the Vincennes University Blazers men's basketball  team on a job well done, and good luck next year.                            ____________________
