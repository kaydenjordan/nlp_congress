Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3168 to amend the White Mountain  Apache Tribe water rights settlement introduced by Senator Kelly of  Arizona. Representative O'Halleran of Arizona has the House companion  to this legislation.   This bill will amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe's existing water  rights settlement to extend certain deadlines and to increase the  authorization to construct the Tribe's rural water system.   The rural water system was originally authorized by Congress in 2010  as part of the Tribe's water rights settlement to provide a long-term  water supply solution for the Tribe.   This bill will accommodate unanticipated but necessary design changes  to the Tribe's planned water system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3308) to authorize the Colorado River Indian Tribes to enter  into lease or exchange agreements and storage agreements relating to  water of the Colorado River allocated to the Colorado River Indian  Tribes, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3308, the Colorado River Indian  Tribes Water Resiliency Act introduced by Senator Mark Kelly of  Arizona.   This bill authorizes the Colorado River Indian Tribes, or CRIT, to  lease a portion of its Colorado River allocation to assist Arizona  communities and to help slow unprecedented water level declines behind  Hoover Dam, which supplies water to tens of millions of people.   This authority will enable the CRIT to enter agreements to lease or  conserve water to support Tribal economic development and to help  address water shortages in the Colorado River Basin, which is currently  in its 23rd year of a historic drought.   I want to commend the Natural Resources Committee Chair Grijalva for  his work to develop this important legislation, along with Senator  Kelly's efforts to advance this bill in the Senate.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have no further requests for  time, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3773) to authorize leases of up to 99 years for land held in  trust for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3773         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF THE CHEHALIS RESERVATION                     LEASING AUTHORITY.         Subsection (a) of the first section of the Act of August 9,       1955 (69 Stat. 539, chapter 615; 25 U.S.C. 415(a)), is       amended, in the second sentence, by inserting ``, land held       in trust for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis       Reservation'' after ``Crow Tribe of Montana''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Chehalis Tribe's Reservation in Washington was  created in 1864 and sits at the confluence of the Chehalis and Black  Rivers.   To develop supply chain infrastructure, the Tribe is seeking to  finance improvements on an existing facility  [[Page H9942]]  located on Tribal trust land to secure a lease of the facility with an  outside entity. The financing required for the project requires a lease  agreement term of at least 86 years, which is currently not an option  for the Tribe under the terms of the Long-Term Leasing Act.   Instead, the act limits lease agreement terms to no more than 25  years with an option to renew for an additional 25 years.   Since the passage of the Long-Term Leasing Act, Congress has allowed  for longer leases by adding the names of certain Tribes to the Long- Term Leasing Act. Historically, such bills have been noncontroversial.   Since 1955, Congress has added 59 Tribes to the Long-Term Leasing  Act. S. 3773 will serve as a Long-Term Leasing Act fix for the Chehalis  Tribe to pursue its planned economic development activities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have no further requests for  time, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4104) to approve the settlement of water rights claims of the  Hualapai Tribe and certain allottees in the State of Arizona, to  authorize construction of a water project relating to those water  rights claims, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4104         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hualapai Tribe Water Rights       Settlement Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4104, the Hualapai Tribe Water  Rights Settlement Act introduced by Senator Sinema of Arizona.  Representative O'Halleran of Arizona has the House companion to this  legislation.   The bill would authorize and approve the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights  Settlement Agreement, quantifying the Tribe's rights to Colorado River  water.   The bill authorizes $312 million so that the Tribe can manage the  construction of a water supply project that will finally provide  reliable water supplies to the Hualapai Reservation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have no further requests for  time. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5066) to designate Mount Young in the State of Alaska, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5066         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5066, the Don Young  Recognition Act.   Don Young was a force of nature. He was so much to so many people.   For Alaskans, he was our sole Congressman for 49 years, a giant  fighting for the land and people he cherished--49 years for the 49th  State.   For his family, he was a father, grandfather, and husband with a  heart filled with love and stories.   For those in this body, he was a colleague quick to say yes to  cosponsor legislation and famous for making unexpected friendships.   Don was truly a man of the House of Representatives. It was  appropriate that, at the start of his lying in state at the Capitol,  his casket was processed up the House steps, and his service was held  in Statuary Hall, the old House floor.   I am glad that we are honoring him today at the conclusion of the  117th Congress, the final Congress in which he served, with this  celebration of his life.   This bill is a perfect tribute to him in many ways. It highlights  moments in his career, from his service in the Army, to his passing of  the trans-Alaska pipeline bill, to his work crafting the Magnuson- Stevens fishery act, which started out on the House side and was then  called the Young-Buck act.   It is fitting that the bill names a volcano in Alaska after him. Don,  like the volcano, would often rumble and get heated.   Just like the volcanoes in Alaska, Don was very much a part of the  foundation of our State.   The bill also designates a Job Corps center in Palmer, the Don Young  Alaska Job Corps Center.   Don always spoke fondly about his time working construction in  Alaska, driving a D8 Caterpillar bulldozer, and he always looked out  for people who worked with their hands.   He was a champion for labor, and I think he would smile knowing that  this center, which uplifts future generations of Alaskan workers, bears  his name.   Lastly, this bill names a Federal building in Fairbanks after the  Congressman. This, too, is fitting as Don represented the Alaskan  interior during his time in the State legislature. Don lived in the  village of Fort Yukon, and Fairbanks was his hub city.   Notably, the recently passed defense bill included another tribute to  the Congressman, the Don Young Coast  [[Page H9954]]  Guard Authorization Act of 2022. Don always fought for the Coast Guard,  and the bill contained provisions he secured to improve oil spill  response in Alaska. He would be very happy knowing that the legislation  he authored has been moving through the Congress even after his  passing.   I thank Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Westerman, and leadership  on both sides for scheduling this bill. I also thank Senator Murkowski  and Senator Sullivan for sponsoring it and securing its passage in the  Senate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5087) to amend the Not Invisible Act of 2019 to extend, and  provide additional support for, the activities of the Department of the  Interior and the Department of Justice Joint Commission on Reducing  Violent Crime Against Indians, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5087         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF, AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE                     ACTIVITIES OF, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR                     AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE JOINT COMMISSION                     ON REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME AGAINST INDIANS.         (a) Extension of Commission and Activities of the       Commission.--Section 4 of the Not Invisible Act of 2019       (Public Law 116-166; 134 Stat. 767) is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)(2)(B), by striking ``18 months after       the enactment'' and inserting ``36 months after the date of       enactment''; and        (2) in subsection (e), by striking ``2 years'' and       inserting ``42 months''.        (b) Additional Support for Activities of Commission.--      Section 4(b) of the Not Invisible Act of 2019 (Public Law       116-166; 134 Stat. 767) is amended--        (1) in the subsection heading, by inserting ``; Operation''       after ``Membership''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) Gifts.--The Commission may accept and use gifts or       donations of services or property from Indian tribes or       Tribal entities, academic institutions, or other not-for-      profit organizations as it considers necessary to carry out       the duties of the Commission described in subsection (c).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the crisis of missing and murdered Native people and  trafficked Native women has devastated families and communities and,  unfortunately, has gone unaddressed throughout history.   These losses are an open wound in our Tribal communities and add to  the generational trauma facing Native American families that many of us  have experienced.   In 2019, Senator Cortez Masto of Nevada, along with Representatives    Tom Cole, Sharice Davids, Markwayne Mullin, and Deb Haaland, introduced  the Not Invisible Act, which passed last Congress, to assist in  combating the longstanding missing and murdered indigenous people, or  MMIP, crisis.   The Not Invisible Act established an advisory committee on violent  crime to make recommendations to the Department of the Interior and the  Department of Justice on best practices to combat the epidemic of  missing persons, murder, and trafficking of Native Americans and Alaska  Natives.   It also created a point person within the Bureau of Indian Affairs  charged with improving the coordination of violent crime prevention  efforts across Federal agencies.   However, due to COVID-19 and a delayed transition between  administrations, the Not Invisible Commission was delayed in organizing  and action. S. 5087 will extend the duration of the commission and  includes additional support for functions of the commission so they can  continue to do their important work for Indian Country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 5087, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 989) to establish a Native American language resource center  in furtherance of the policy set forth in the Native American Languages  Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 989         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) In General.--The Secretary of Education is authorized       to make a grant to, or enter into a contract with, an       eligible entity for the purpose of--        (1) establishing, strengthening, and operating a Native       American language resource center; and        (2) staffing the center with individuals with relevant       expertise and experience, including staff who speak American       Indian and Alaska Native languages and the Native Hawaiian       language and have worked in language education in the       American Indian and Alaska Native languages and the Native       Hawaiian language in a preschool, elementary school,       secondary school, adult education, or higher education       program.        (c) Authorized Activities.--The Native American language       resource center established under subsection (b) shall carry       out activities to--        (1) improve the capacity to teach and learn Native American       languages;        (2) further Native American language use and acquisition;        (3) preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom       of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native       American languages in furtherance of--        (A) the policies set forth in the Native American Languages       Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.); and        (B) the United States trust responsibility to Native       American communities;        (4) address the effects of past discrimination and ongoing       inequities experienced by Native American language speakers;        (5) support the revitalization and reclamation of Native       American languages; and        (6) support the use of Native American languages as a       medium of instruction for a wide variety of age levels,       academic content areas, and types of schools, including       Native American language medium education.

[[Page H9956]]         (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section, $3,000,000 for       each fiscal year.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 989, the Native American Language  Resource Center Act of 2022.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 989, the Native  American Languages Resource Center Act of 2022.   By 1990, some 150 remaining Native American languages were dying out  after decades of policies that worked to eliminate Native American  languages. While Congress has previously acted to reverse those  efforts, Native American languages are still at risk.   To that end, I applaud Senator Brian Schatz for championing the  Native American Language Resource Center Act.                                time  1615    Specifically, this bill will create a center that will provide  support for Native American language programs in schools serving  students of all ages and at all levels of learning from pre-K to Ph.D.;  serve as a resource to Federal, Tribal, State, local governments, and  other organizations to spread best practices for the development of  Native American language teaching and learning; and support teacher  preparation programs that prepare teachers to teach Native American  languages.   Madam Speaker, research shows that the best way to reverse Native  American language extinction is to invest in Native American language  education. The Native American Language Resource Center Act of 2022  will accomplish that goal.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Now more than ever, Congress needs to take action to reaffirm our  commitments to indigenous populations and make good on our promise to  preserve Native American languages.   The Native American Language Resource Center Act of 2022 is a  critical step to achieving that goal. By creating a hub for resources  and learning, Congress will signal their commitment to protecting  Native American languages.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill, (S. 1402) to amend the Native American Languages Act to ensure  the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1402         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1402, the Durbin Feeling Native  American Languages Act of 2021.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1402, the Durbin  Feeling Native American Languages Act of 2021.   Preserving Native American languages is essential to preserving the  identity, traditions, and culture of the Native American community.   Regrettably, for decades, the Federal Government created policies  that sought to suppress the use of Native American languages.   In response, President George H.W. Bush signed the Native American  Language Act into law, which ensures the rights and freedoms of Native  Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages.   The bill before us today, the Durbin Feeling Native American  Languages Act of 2021 helps ensure the Federal Government makes good on  that promise. Specifically, the bill directs the President to review  Federal agencies' compliance with the Native American Language Act  requirements and make recommendations to improve interagency  coordination.   It would also authorize a Federal survey of Native American language  use and language revitalization programs' unmet needs every 5 years.  These surveys will serve as ``health checks'' to improve targeting of  Federal resources for Native American languages.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in preserving Native  American languages and pass S. 1402.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, now more than ever, it is critical that we work  together to preserve Native American languages.   During the pandemic, Native Americans lost their lives at higher  rates compared to other demographics in the United States. The loss of  Tribal members inflicted an immeasurable loss to Native Americans'  traditions and languages.   Today, we have an opportunity to help correct the course. I urge my  colleagues to pass the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act of  2021 and support and preservation of Native American languages.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5329) to amend the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation  Act to improve the program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5329         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. BILL EMERSON GOOD SAMARITAN FOOD DONATION ACT.         The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (42       U.S.C. 1791) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``or is charged a good       Samaritan reduced price'' before the period at the end;        (B) by redesignating paragraphs (6) through (10) as       paragraphs (7) through (11), respectively;        (C) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following:        ``(6) Good samaritan reduced price.--The term `good       Samaritan reduced price' means, with respect to the price of       an apparently wholesome food or apparently fit grocery       product, a price that is an amount not greater than the cost       of handling, administering, harvesting, processing,       packaging, transporting, and distributing the apparently       wholesome food or apparently fit grocery product.''; and        (D) by adding at the end the following:        ``(12) Qualified direct donor.--The term `qualified direct       donor' means a retail grocer, wholesaler, agricultural       producer, agricultural processor, agricultural distributor,       restaurant, caterer, school food authority, or institution of       higher education (as defined in section 102 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)).''; and        (2) in subsection (c)--        (A) in paragraphs (1) and (2), by inserting ``at zero cost       or at a good Samaritan reduced price'' after ``needy       individuals'' each place it appears;        (B) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4);        (C) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:        ``(3) Direct donations to needy individuals.--A qualified       direct donor shall not be subject to civil or criminal       liability arising from the nature, age, packaging, or       condition of apparently wholesome food or an apparently fit       grocery product that the qualified direct donor donates in       good faith to a needy individual at zero cost.''; and        (D) in paragraph (4) (as so redesignated), by striking       ``and (2)'' and inserting ``, (2), and (3)''.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 5329, a bill to amend the Bill  Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act to improve the program, and  for other purposes.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 5329, the Food Donation  Improvement Act of 2021, championed by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts,  Mr. Newhouse of Washington, Ms. Pingree of Maine, and the late Mrs.  Walorski of Indiana.   Nearly 40 percent of the food in the United States is wasted, and the  U.S. spends over $408 billion each year disposing of food that has  never even been eaten.   Meanwhile, in 2021 more than 10 percent of households in America  struggled with food insecurity. The Food Donation Improvement Act of  2021 addresses food insecurity by tackling food waste.   Specifically, the bill makes improvements to the Bill Emerson Good  Samaritan Food Donation Act by expanding liability protections that  will encourage food donation, including by protecting direct donation  to needy individuals.   Madam Speaker, simply put, the Food Donation Improvement Act of 2021  makes it easier to donate food that might otherwise go to waste.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in tackling food waste  and insecurity and vote ``yes'' on S. 5329.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, food waste is unacceptable as millions of children and  families face food insecurity. By encouraging retailers and  organizations to donate food, the Food Donation Improvement Act of 2021  will make it easier to donate food and, ultimately, crack down on food  waste.   While we have more work to do to ensure every American has consistent  access to nutritious meals, this bill offers us the opportunity to send  a message to Americans that improving food security is a clear priority  for every Member of Congress.   I thank Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts, Mr. Newhouse of Washington,  Ms. Pingree of Maine, and the late Mrs. Walorski of Indiana for their  leadership on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5016, the  Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System  Act.   Colonel Rasmuson was an inspiration and driving force for advancing  the role of women in the military and engaging in critical community  service. Her presence was felt in every community she touched, and her  legacy has lived on for future generations.   In 1942, as the United States engaged in World War II, Mary Louise  Rasmuson wanted to serve her country and joined the Women's Army  Auxiliary Corps. She was part of their first graduating class and laid  the groundwork for millions of women to come.   As she continued her military career, Colonel Rasmuson soared through  the ranks and took on multiple leadership roles in the Army. In 1957,  she was appointed as the fifth director of the Women's Army Corps and  was appointed again in 1961 by President Kennedy. Colonel Rasmuson  retired from the Army in 1962, but her legacy and community impact  expanded well beyond these years.   Following her military retirement, Mary Louise Rasmuson moved to  Alaska, where she was a monumental philanthropist and pivotal member of  the community. She secured funding for dozens of programs to support  Alaskans, most notably for the Anchorage Museum.   Most importantly, Colonel Rasmuson was a strong leader for veterans,  especially female veterans, assisting them in securing their benefits.   This bill is a perfect tribute to Mary in many ways. It highlights  her dedication to veterans in Alaska, philanthropic work, and deep  commitment to improving the lives of all Alaskans.   This bill would designate the Department of Veterans Affairs medical  center in Anchorage as the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the  Alaska VA Healthcare System, a fitting tribute to a woman who gave so  much to the veterans of Alaska.   I thank Chairman Takano, Ranking Member Bost, and leadership on both  sides for scheduling this bill. I also thank Senators Murkowski and  Sullivan for sponsoring and securing its passage in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
