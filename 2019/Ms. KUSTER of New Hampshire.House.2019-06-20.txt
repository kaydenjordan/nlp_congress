 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my  colleagues for unanimously passing my bipartisan amendment yesterday to  increase funding by $3 million to the Northern Border Regional  Commission.   The NBRC is a critical, rural economic development agency that has  created jobs in my district and supported so many meaningful projects  around New Hampshire.   From 2010-2017, the NBRC invested over $7 million into the Granite  State communities and, more importantly, leveraged nearly $31 million  in matching funds.   This is a smart and strategic use of tax dollars, and I am so pleased  that the House passed my bipartisan amendment with Congressman Chris  Pappas, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, and Congressman Peter Welch, to  increase funding to the historic level of $25 million in the next  fiscal year.   As a conferee on the 2018 farm bill conference committee, I was  pleased to lead the effort to add Cheshire and Belknap Counties, and I  am delighted to add $3 million.                            ____________________
