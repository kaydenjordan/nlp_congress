 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend,  Dr. Ruiz, for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of families of children with complex medical  needs--and there are many families like this all across America--I rise  to urge approval of H.R. 1839, which includes a bill I have been  working on for a number of years with my colleagues, including former  Representative Joe Barton. It is called the ACE Kids Act.   We drafted the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act a few years  ago with a simple but important goal of putting children and their  families first. The bill authorizes the creation of cost-saving and  time-saving health homes where specialized care is coordinated in a  high-quality setting.   Mr. Speaker, the children with complex medical conditions and their  families are heroic, like Caroline West in my hometown of Tampa. She  has a rare genetic condition, cerebral palsy, and a seizure disorder.  She can't walk, and it is very difficult for her to speak, but she  attends school part time and enjoys the life of a typical teenager, in  many respects.   Lucy Ferlita is the only living person in the United States with  early onset myopathy with areflexia, respiratory distress, and  dysphagia. Very little is known about this disease, but we know that it  is very difficult for her to eat. She has to have a feeding tube, a  ventilator to breathe, and nursing care 24 hours a day.   Jaden Velasquez has a congenital heart defect.   Lakota Lockhart has a central nervous system disorder that causes him  to not be able to breathe while he sleeps.   I met all of these kids back home in Tampa at St. Joseph's Children's  Hospital. St. Joe's has a world-renown Chronic-Complex Clinic that was  started 16 years ago by a compassionate pediatrician, Dr. Daniel  Plasencia. This ACE Kids Act is modeled upon their work and the other  good work being done at children's hospitals across this country.   The bill provides an incentive for States to establish health homes  to  [[Page H2779]]  better coordinate care for kids with medical complexities. It also  directs HHS to provide guidance to States on best practices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill with the ACE  Kids Act included.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from a whole host of  organizations thanking us for our leadership and for introducing this  bipartisan legislation to improve care for children with complex  medical conditions.                                                    March 25, 2019.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Bennet,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kathy Castor,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Gus Bilirakis,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jaime Herrera Beutler,      Washington, DC.        Dear Sens. Grassley and Bennet, and Reps. Castor,       Bilirakis, Eshoo, and Herrera Beutler: As national       organizations committed to children's health, we write in       strong support of the ``Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids       Act of 2019'' (ACE Kids Act, S. 317/H.R. 1226), which has       been incorporated into the Medicaid Services Investment and       Accountability Act of 2019 (H.R. 1839). We thank you for your       leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation to       improve care for children with complex medical conditions in       the Medicaid program.        Children with complex medical conditions have chronic life-      limiting illnesses and disabilities, and often see six or       more specialists and a dozen or more physicians. Under the       current Medicaid system, parents of children with multiple,       life-threatening disabilities struggle to coordinate the       complex care of their kids, which often requires travelling       to out-of-state providers. The ACE Kids Act works to create a       patient-centered, pediatric-focused delivery system for this       unique population of children. It is an important step in       fixing the current fragmented system for children with       complex medical conditions, ensuring ready access to care and       reducing the burden on their families.        Under the ACE Kids Act, specially-designed health homes       created for children with complex medical conditions will       employ national quality standards and coordinate care--both       essential to improving overall quality of care. These health       homes will include the full range of acute, post-acute and       primary care providers, and will focus on outpatient care to       ensure children get the care that they need in the most       appropriate setting closest to home while reducing       unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits. The       ACE Kids Act--which is voluntary for states, families and       providers--will also help families access the array of       outpatient and community services and supports needed by       these children.        Providing children with complex medical conditions enrolled       in Medicaid the best possible care is a national challenge,       and the ACE Kids Act will bring us closer to ensuring these       vulnerable children receive the care they need. We are proud       to support the ACE Kids Act, and we look forward to working       with you to advance this critical legislation this year.
