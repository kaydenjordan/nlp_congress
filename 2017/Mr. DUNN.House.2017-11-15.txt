 Mr. Speaker, this is a historic week, one that has been 31  years in the making. In a once-in-a-generation vote, we will vote to  cut taxes for the middle class and unleash the power of the American  economy.   Our Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages of opaque rules and  regulations  [[Page H9266]]  that cost Americans money and jobs. In critical ways, our Tax Code  gives explicit economic advantage to our foreign competitors. That  changes with this bill.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts the American taxpayer and the American  economy first. The bill cuts taxes for individuals and families in  every tax bracket.   By lowering rates, doubling the standard deduction, and increasing  the child tax credit, hardworking American families can keep more money  in their paychecks. The average family of four earning $55,000 will see  a tax cut of over $1,000.   This bill will supercharge our economy by making everyone play by the  same rules. It substantially reduces taxes on small businesses and  manufacturers. This means more jobs, more money, and more opportunity  for American workers.   Tax reform is the single best thing we can do for our economy. I urge  all my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
