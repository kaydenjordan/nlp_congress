 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a celebration of  love, acceptance, and diversity and a powerful testament to the  resilience and spirit of the LGBTQ+ community, Pride Month in the city  of San Diego.   San Diego has long been a beacon of progress and inclusivity, and at  the heart of our great city lies Hillcrest, the vibrant LGBTQ+ center  of San Diego in my congressional district.   Hillcrest stands as a symbol of hope and empowerment. Its colorful  streets, adorned with rainbow flags, proudly reflect a community that  has overcome adversity and fought for the rights and freedoms of all.   Let's take this moment to celebrate the achievements of the LGBTQ+  community and reaffirm our commitment to a future where every  individual can live authentically and without fear of discrimination.   In San Diego, and across the Nation, let us build a society that  celebrates diversity, cherishes our differences, ensures equality for  all regardless of who they love or how they identify.   Happy Pride Month San Diego.                            ____________________
