 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3097 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, we witnessed about a month ago historic and  unprecedented protests in Cuba as the people took to the streets. One  of the things that has been untold and I think now is a greater  realization is that one of the reasons that is now possible is because  Cubans had a limited access to the internet, which allowed them to then  go on social media, communicate with each other and communicate with  the world. As a result, they were able also to share with the world the  true brutality of that regime by posting videos of what was happening.  It was the first time that people had ever seen it.   What this amendment does is it creates a reserve fund within the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration to help  ensure that we are doing all we can to provide internet access that is  unfettered, uncontrolled by the regime in Cuba, which actually cuts off  that access, as it did in the middle of these protests--by the way,  using Chinese technology.   So this would allow us to pursue how we can provide unfettered  internet access to the people of Cuba. It is something that I  understand has broad support in this Chamber, even in the  administration, and I hope we can pass this.
