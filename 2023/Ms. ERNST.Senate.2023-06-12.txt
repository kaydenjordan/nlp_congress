 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Precision Optical Group of Creston, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Following a fishing trip, friends Mike Tamerius and Matt Somers  started Precision Optical Group in 1992. Mike had his start in the  optical industry working as an optician during his time at Grinnell  College in Grinnell, IA, and is a member of the Opticians Association  of Iowa and is a certified optician from Metro Tech Community College.  Initially starting as a two-person shop, with 100 square feet, the shop  expanded operations after only 1 year to a larger building. Over the  years, Precision Optical Group has expanded to three locations while  maintaining their Creston headquarters. The company acquired the  Chicago lab location in 2014. Seeing a need for additional expansion,  they acquired the Precise Optical lab in San Angelo, TX, in 2018.   Precision Optical Group is a family enterprise; Mike's son Alex is a  sales and marketing specialist with the team. He has a degree in  business management from Central College in Pella, IA, in 2018 and has  been working there since high school where he started helping in the  lab. He also spent time early in his career helping his aunt Deb, who  serves as the purchasing manager.   Between the three labs, they have a team of 140 employees and make  1,700 lenses per day. As the country's largest independently owned  wholesale optical lab, they have customers across 48 States and export  globally. Additionally, Precision Optical Group is a member of the  Creston Chamber of Commerce.   In 2022, Precision Optical Group celebrated their 30th anniversary.  Precision Optical Group's commitment to providing quality lenses  throughout the globe while maintaining their Iowa roots is clear. I  want to congratulate Mike Tamerius and the entire team at Precision  Optical Group for their continued dedication to the optical industry. I  look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________
