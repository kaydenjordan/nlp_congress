 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week. I would be happy to yield  to my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  distinguished majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his response.   I would like the gentleman to walk through, if he could, the  scheduling process for how the House will further proceed with the  impeachment inquiry.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, ask the question I had asked last  week:   Are we currently in an impeachment inquiry, as the Speaker said we  are a few weeks ago?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As this  determination moves forward, there is a growing cry for fairness. And I  know we talked a little bit about that last week, but we saw it again  this week with more closed hearings, more hearings where both sides  were not allowed the same equal rights that have always been provided  in impeachment inquiries.    And, of course, when you look through our Nation's history,  fortunately, there are not that many instances where Congress had to  try to impeach or inquire about impeaching a President--three times.   In fact, in all three cases, it started with a vote of the full  House, and it started with a fair set of rules. And in the last two  that were the most public, where you saw the proceedings on television,  you saw both sides vote for Nixon, where you had a divided government.  You had a Democrat House and a Republican President.   And then, for the Clinton impeachment, you had a Republican House and  a Democrat President. They used the same set of rules. Both sides got  to call witnesses, both sides got to subpoena. The President's legal  counsel actually got to be in the room and, maybe most importantly, the  public got to be in the room.   Members of Congress, even if they weren't on the relevant committees,  were allowed to watch these hearings. That is not going on today. These  hearings are going on in secret in a secret room.   A number of my colleagues and I went down to see what was going on,  to see the hearings and the proceedings. It turned out, what we found  out in the SCIF, which is designed for classified briefings, it wasn't  a classified briefing. The chairman, himself, acknowledged that it was  not a classified briefing. In fact, it included a Department of Defense  official. And members of the Committee on Armed Services asked if they  would be able to participate in that hearing, and they were denied the  ability.   And so when the press can't see what's going on, when the public  can't see what's going on, when Members of Congress try to see what is  going on, and the chairman takes the witness and runs out of the room,  it begs the question, ``What are they trying to hide.''   What kind of tainted document are they creating, if it is an  impeachment inquiry?   And if it is not, then stop trying to use two different sets of  rules. But if it is--and the Speaker, herself, is the one who said it  is an impeachment inquiry--at a minimum, use the same standards that  have always been used for that serious of a process. The House of  Representatives has a constitutional ability to ultimately make this  kind of decision.   And, again, it has only been done three times, but in each of those  cases, there were fair sets of rules used, so that you could actually  find out what was happening. And if there was something that reached  the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, it was not based on what one  person decided, but based on everybody being able to present the  evidence, everybody being able to bring witnesses forward. That is not  happening right now, and it ought to change.   And I would hope, and ask the gentleman, if this is going to continue  moving forward, if there is going to be any credibility to whatever  report would come out of it.   There is much less credibility if it is done in secret with one  person and one person only getting to choose who comes forth to  testify, as opposed to an open process, as has always been the case in  our country's history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I would imagine the gentleman would also  agree that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee should also not  be above the law. He should not be able to write his own rules of  impeachment, his own rules of engagement, in secret.   These meetings are being held in secret. In fact, when some of us  went into the room today, he ran out with the witness.   What are you trying to hide when, as any kind of secret hearing,  people run out of the room as soon as the lights come on? What is  really going on?   If you want to talk about numbers--  The sad part is, the only way you can find out what  happens in those secret hearings is reading the paper because somebody  on the majority staff is, against the direction of the chairman,  selectively leaking information to the press.  [[Page H8445]]    The press knows more about this impeachment inquiry than voting  Members of Congress. Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of this Congress is denied  access to those hearings, 75 percent.   Maybe you can read what was leaked by somebody on your majority  staff, Mr. Speaker. Maybe that is where you can get your information  because that is the only place to get information. That shouldn't be  where Members of Congress have to go to find out what happened.   By the way, you talk to some of the people who were in the room, and  they were directed by the chairman not to say anything. He can say  something or somebody on his staff can say something, and he hasn't  done anything to control the leaks. But then they say, actually, there  was a lot of other testimony that contradicted what was leaked to the  paper. But nobody really knows because they are denied access.   Do you know, if you take the voting Members of Congress who are not  allowed in that room, it represents over 230 million American citizens  who are denied representation in those impeachment hearings, over 230  million Americans who are denied access because 75 percent of voting  Members of Congress are not allowed in the room?   You can talk about who is allowed in the room. Everybody should be  allowed in the room. The press should be allowed in the room. Cameras  should be in the room, like in previous impeachments.   If you want to try to remove a President--maybe you don't agree with  the 2016 election result, and you are concerned about what might happen  next year. That is not why you impeach a President, by the way.   But if you really do want to search for the truth, you search for the  truth in public. The people of this country ought to be able to see  what is happening. It shouldn't be a selected story in the newspaper  that was leaked by the majority staff. It should be something every  Member of Congress who is going to be asked to vote on this actually  can find something out about.   We can't go and read the transcripts. Seventy-five percent of us  can't. Yet, that is the process that is going on right now.   If you want to call that fair, maybe it is fair to you, but is it  really the justice that we look for across the street at the Supreme  Court?   Imagine if only one side--the accused couldn't present witnesses. You  could accuse anybody of anything. And you have that ability, as you are  doing right now, and then you tie the hands behind the back of those  you are accusing because they can't even be in the room.   The other side can't even bring witnesses forward. There are  witnesses that our Members would like to bring forward who were in that  room, yet they are not even allowed that opportunity. That is not fair.  Maybe in the Soviet Union that is fair, but not in the United States of  America.   It is not how you should be running an impeachment operation to try  to take out a President of the United States when we have an election  next year. Let the people of this country make that decision, not one  person sitting in a secret room downstairs, keeping other people out.  When Members of Congress who are trying to find out what is going on  walk in the room, he runs out of the room with the witness.   Is that really the fair process that this country deserves? It falls  well short. We can absolutely do better than this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, the law requires the President to verify  that there is not corruption involved with the taxpayer money that is  in question. That is a law we passed. I believe the gentleman from  Maryland voted, as I did vote, for that law. It is a good law to say  that if we are going to send taxpayer money to a foreign country, we  ought to make sure that there is no corruption.    There were claims of corruption in Ukraine. In fact, a lot of the  interference in our election by the Russians went through Ukraine in  2016.   Now, President Trump wasn't the President back then when this country  was allowing Russia to interfere with the election.    But he is looking into it, as he should be.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Again, we can talk about why we needed to root out  corruption, why we want to find out what happened in the 2016 election  where the Russians tried to interfere, because we don't want it to  happen again.   We also know, as it was discussed on that phone call, that President  Trump sold Javelin missiles to Ukraine so they could protect themselves  against the Russians, the aggression that the gentleman was talking  about on the eastern front, where the previous President allowed the  Russians to come into Crimea when Ukraine was asking us to help them.   Ukraine, back when President Obama was in office, was asking us to  sell them those same Javelin missiles, and President Obama wouldn't do  it. He has never answered why he wouldn't, but it is a fact that he  didn't sell the Javelins. But President Trump did and allowed Ukraine  to defend themselves against the Russians.   In fact, they talked about maybe buying more, but they were already  allowed to buy what they needed to defend themselves, and I am glad  they were. It helped a friend.   But you talk about all of those things that are going on right now  with impeachment. The real issue is what is not happening here in this  Congress.   I will refer you to a different newspaper, as you want to talk about  newspapers, the front page of The Washington Times: Democrats writing  more subpoenas than laws. Impeachment inquiries sideline Pelosi's  agenda.   In fact, if you look at the difference between subpoenas and bills  that came out of this House that are actually signed into law, you have  produced 56 subpoenas. You have produced only 46 laws. That is 20  percent more subpoenas that you have produced than laws to help people  across this country.    I would be happy to yield when we talk about all the  things that this House could be doing that it is not, like lowering  drug prices, like getting better trade deals with our friends in Mexico  and in Canada and in all the other countries that are lined up that  would love to come behind USMCA that can't right now.   They can't because there is this infatuation with impeachment, in a  one-sided way, in a closed way, in a Soviet-style Star Chamber.   But that is not happening right now. This is what is not happening;  this is what is happening. It is not what the American people expected  out of this majority.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    It is factual.    Well, first of all, the gentleman is making an assertion  that has been disputed--in fact, disputed by the President of Ukraine,  this alleged quid pro quo that didn't happen. Zelensky himself said it  didn't happen. In fact, he got the money. He got the money.   Now, we had to check to make sure, like the law says, in two  different places. We have two different sets of law that require the  administration ensure that there is not corruption before they send the  money.   I can assure the gentleman from Maryland that, if he would have sent  the money over and there was corruption involved, you would be going  after him for breaking the law, for not following the law.   You voted for the law. I voted for the law. Again, it is a good law.  But then he ultimately released the money.   You talk about the Javelin missiles. He sold that to them before the  phone call even happened because it was a friend saying protect us  against Russia.   President Obama wouldn't stand up to Russia when Ukraine made that  same phone call, yet President Trump did. President Trump said: I will  sell you those missiles so you can protect yourself and can defend  yourself against the Russians.   And Zelensky, on that phone call, was thanking the President, again,  for selling those missiles to them. It has allowed them to push back  the Russian aggression and to root out--ultimately, they talked about  rooting out and getting to the bottom of the corruption and the  interference that happened with Russia in our 2016 election, which I  hoped we would be more vigilant to root out together.   It shouldn't just be President Trump wanting to stop it from  happening again. All of us should want to make sure that that doesn't  happen again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, it is not a question. It is a  false assertion that the gentleman is making. And so you can make  claims about people, but ultimately, if it is not backed up in fact,  you just continue on.   This has been the pattern of this majority, really, since before you  took the majority. It has been an assertion to impeach the President,  finding something; if there is nothing there, just keep looking.   You had the Mueller investigation; 2,800 subpoenas, 22 months  meandering around, looking for something, hoping; and we saw the  chairman of the Intelligence Committee said publicly, time and time  again, for 2 years, that he, himself, had more than circumstantial  evidence of criminal acts. It turned out there were none.   The chairman never showed the evidence that he had. Maybe he went and  had a meeting with Mueller and Mueller discarded it. But if he really  did have more than circumstantial evidence, he would have brought it  forward. He would have shown all of us, but he didn't. He made the  assertion, but it was a false assertion.   And if it wasn't false, by the way, I would challenge the gentleman  to bring it forward. He ought to have that duty to bring it forward.    No, no. We are talking about the Mueller investigation,  but it didn't happen. So the collusion argument that was supposedly  going to yield some kind of ability to go and impeach the President  didn't turn out to be true.   So, instead of stopping and moving on to the business of the American  people, instead of more subpoenas--not laws. No lower drug prices  because it is an impeachment infatuation. Instead of moving on, they  went to this because there was this whistleblower.   And let's go back to the memo of the whistleblower, before the  whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower actually wrote a memo.  Admittedly, they never even listened to the phone conversation, but  they talked to other people.   And if it was so dangerous what those other people heard, they had a  legal ability and authority to go and file their own whistleblower  complaint, but they didn't. So someone with a political bias, by the  inspector general's own admission, a person with a political bias who  had access to information that was classified, in violation of law,  hears what they want to hear, writes a memo saying it was crazy; it was  disturbing. Those were the words that the whistleblower wrote about the  phone conversation.   Lo and behold, the phone conversation gets released by the President.  It was unprecedented. He didn't have to do it. I might have preferred  if he didn't do it because you don't want a pattern where every  conversation between world leaders is going to be out in the public.   But, okay, it is now. And all of those assertions that were made were  false. It wasn't a crazy conversation. It wasn't a disturbing  conversation. It was two people talking about--one congratulating the  other on his election. One talking about how he got elected on a  platform of rooting out corruption, which he is doing, and we are  [[Page H8447]]  helping them with. That was the conversation.   So now the whistleblower isn't even going to be brought forward,  according to the chairman, because the chairman is the only person who  gets to bring witnesses forward.   Then the gentleman talked about Trey Gowdy's committee, the Benghazi  Select Committee. He tries to use that as the reference point for  holding an impeachment inquiry.   Let's all be clear: Trey Gowdy's committee on Benghazi was a special  select committee to find out what happened.    I will ultimately yield, but you mentioned all of these  things, and so I want to clear up the things that the gentleman  mentioned.   So the Trey Gowdy committee, where four Americans died and we were  trying to get to the bottom of that--not to impeach anybody, but to  find out how four Americans died when people should have known that  there was danger over there and the proper precautions weren't taken.  So he had a committee.   Do you know, I would ask the gentleman from Maryland, that Chairman  Gowdy allowed the minority to call witnesses? He didn't sit there and  say: Hey, I won and you lost, and so I can just roll over you and then  back up the car again. That is not what Trey Gowdy did. He was the  chairman, but he let the ranking member, the minority leader of the  committee, call their witnesses.   That is not happening right now. Not one witness has been allowed by  our side. Closed hearings to the public.   If this is something that you are so concerned about, if you are  concerned about corruption, why root it out in secret, behind closed  doors, with a one-sided set of rules that represents and reflects more  how the Soviet Union would conduct something like this as opposed to  how the United States of America has always conducted impeachment  inquiries? We are talking about impeachment inquiries in secret, behind  closed doors.   So, yes, the gentleman raised a lot of issues, and I wanted to go  back to each of those.   So what we have asked for is the same fairness that has always been  allowed, both sides--not just the winning side, both sides. This is  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, if we really are about getting to the  facts, to think that you can suggest it is a fair process when only one  side gets to choose who the witnesses are--again, the gentleman  references Trey Gowdy's committee. Chairman Gowdy allowed both sides,  Republican and Democrat, to bring forward witnesses because he wanted  to get the facts. If you really wanted to get the facts, would the  chairman of the committee, literally, take the witness and run out of  the room as soon as other voting Members of Congress showed up? That  happened today.   If the chairman really wanted to get the facts out, would he  literally close the meetings? Tell all Members, Republican and  Democrat, not to go talk to the press. And then somebody mysteriously,  selectively leaks things to the press that are negative, in many cases  disputed by other testimony that was given in secret, so it can't get  out. And so you get one side of the story.   I guess if you are okay with having only one side of a story told,  that might be your prerogative because you are in the majority, but  don't call that fair. It is clearly not fair if only one side gets to  tell their story and the other side doesn't get to bring their  witnesses.   The President who you are accusing of possibly committing some crime  so high, high crime and misdemeanors is the standard, if you are  accusing him of that, you can't lay it out yet, you are hoping and  looking around for something, which isn't the process, by the way, that  has been used in the past.   If you don't like the results of the election, there is an election  next year. And if you don't trust the people of this country to make  that decision, do you really go into a Star Chamber and run a Soviet- style set of hearings where only one side gets to tell their side of  the story?    What is the allegation that is untrue?    Who can call the witnesses? Just your side. You think it  is fair that only you can call the witnesses, and then you want to get  the truth? Are you going to get the facts when you shut out the other  side? When you don't let the President have his own legal counsel  there, like has always been done.    This is not a grand jury. This is the United States  House of Representatives.    If you want to run a grand jury, go get a jury.   This is the United States Congress. Voting Members of Congress are  being shut out of the room, Mr. Speaker. Voting Members of Congress are  being shut out of this process. You want to call that fair? Good luck.  But it is not fair.   It is a one-sided process to create a document with a determined  outcome. It is going to be a tainted document, because it only tells  one side of the story. The old saying is, a grand jury can indict a ham  sandwich, if they want to. There is a reason for that because only one  side can call witnesses.   When we have had impeachment inquiries in the past you don't have to  reinvent the wheel. It has only happened three times. And in modern  times they have used the exact same standard.   The standard is: Both sides get to call witnesses. That is not going  on right now.    It was done in public. That is not being done right now.   It is going on in secret. The press can't go in. You can't go in. I  can't go in, unless they run out with the witness.   That is not a fair process. Maybe that is the process that you want  to conduct, but don't call it fair, because it is not.   And, ultimately, it is not going to result in a fair document that is  going to be determining whether or not a President of the United States  is impeached.   And Members of both sides, 75 percent of the Members of this body,  Republican and Democrat, are going to be asked to cast a vote on  something that they can't even go and determine and find out about.  They can't sit in the hearings. They can't read the testimony. 230  million Americans are represented by those Members of Congress who  cannot get access to what is going on in that room. Maybe you can get  it from reading leaked press reports.   Is that really how you determine whether or not to impeach a  President of the United States? That is not fair.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know if the gentleman is asserting  that we will have a vote on impeachment, that might be breaking news,  but if these Members, all of us, are going to vote on impeachment,  shouldn't we be able to see what goes on? Shouldn't we be able to have  access to the hearings? Shouldn't we be able to have access to the  transcripts? Can we now?   I would ask the gentleman, would he release the transcripts now of  these hearings so that Members can start preparing? So Members can know  what they are going to vote on?   Are you going to keep it in secret and then drop something on the  floor after it has been baked and predetermined what the outcome should  be before Members really have an idea of what is going on in those  rooms that are being denied entrance to those rooms right now? It has  never happened before in other impeachment inquiries.   And you can say it is about process. It is about history.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hoyer mocked that the process is  tainted, that the process is being run like it might be run in the  Soviet Union, not in the United States of America. It has never been  done like that before.   And you talk about Trey Gowdy, as if we were looking around for  something to impeach a President on. We weren't.   You had four Americans die. There are a lot of questions that still  haven't been answered about why those Americans died.   And all of us should be concerned about what happened at Benghazi. To  ridicule the fact that there were eight hearings on something so  alarming? Nobody was fishing around, looking--   By the way, we never tried to impeach the President over anything.  All of the things that we disagreed with him on, none of those. Even  times when he would sign executive orders that circumvented the law,  and we would challenge him in the court, and we won a number of those  court cases, but that doesn't mean it rose to the level of high crimes  and misdemeanors. And so we never went down that road.   But maybe some, in some part of a base, want to see impeachment, no  matter what. And some have said that. Some in your own party have said  they just want to impeach the President because if they don't, he will  get reelected. That has been said by members of your party.    That is not why you impeach a President, because you think he is  going to get reelected. The American people make that determination  next year.   We have had investigation after investigation. Again, Mueller alone  had 2,800 subpoenas. He had the full authority to bring charges against  the President on collusion, on obstruction. Even the Attorney General  said that he had the authority to bring charges, but even if he did  have those, he wouldn't have brought charges on obstruction, because  there wasn't obstruction and there wasn't collusion. But he had full  authority to bring charges on both fronts, and he didn't. But, again,  222 months of that meandering witch hunt to try to find something. And  it wasn't found because it wasn't there.   And then you had the whistleblower, the so-called whistleblower. Who,  if you are worried about who is talking to somebody to try to get their  stories straight, interestingly, the whistleblower--who, again, was  identified to be somebody with a political bias--went and met with  Chairman Schiff's staff prior to filing the whistleblower complaint.   Yes, somebody did collude. Real interesting how that happened. Before  the whistleblower complaint was filed, they actually sat down with the  staff of the majority leader, Chairman Schiff, and lo and behold, you  get a political document that comes out with allegations, disproven in  many cases, but that is where we are. That is the basis for starting an  impeachment inquiry.   That is not really an impeachment inquiry, because we are not  following the same rules that have always been followed under an  impeachment inquiry, but that is the genesis of this, and that is where  we are.                                time  1930    And if that is what the document is going to ultimately yield, it  will be a tainted document. But I guess if you want to find an  outcome--this isn't a grand jury. This is the United States House of  Representatives, and there are 75 percent in this body who are going to  be asked to vote on something that they cannot see, they cannot  participate in, they have absolutely no access to. That is not what  this country is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    When?    I would if it was true, but it is not.    You can only read it in the press because of selective  leaking. And so that is how Members of Congress are supposed to make a  determination on impeachment of the President, based on selected leaks  to the press?    Mr. Speaker, here is another headline: ``Democrats  Writing More Subpoenas Than Laws.'' That is a headline. That is what  angers people who want to see their prescription drug prices lowered,  but they can't because of this infatuation with impeachment. That is  what is holding this country back. That is what is holding this House  back from doing the people's work.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask if the gentleman has anything else. If not,  I would be ready to yield back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
