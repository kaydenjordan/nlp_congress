 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 271.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 274, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 271) Condemning the Trump Administration's  Legal Campaign to Take Away Americans' Health Care, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Allred), who is the sponsor of this resolution.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), who is the Speaker of the House and who was so  much the force behind making the Affordable Care Act reality.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), who is the vice chair of our Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chair of our Consumer Protection &  Commerce Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire about the amount of time that  remains on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I talk about H. Res. 271 which is before the  House today, I want to respond to my ranking member's statements about  H.R. 692. This is the bill that he repeatedly has mentioned on the  Republican side.   I want to point out that the Republican bill, H.R. 692, under that  legislation, you could theoretically buy insurance if you have a  preexisting condition; but it is very deceptive because the bill will  still allow insurers to set premiums based on health status, resulting  in individuals with preexisting conditions being charged substantially  more or priced out of the market.   The Republican bill does not include critical ACA consumer  protections, including community rating, essential health benefits  requirements, and annual or lifetime prohibitions. Basically, the GOP  bill would allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions. They would be priced  out of coverage because they wouldn't be healthy enough. Individuals  with preexisting conditions like cancer or diabetes could face  extremely unaffordable premiums and, again, be priced out of the care  that they desperately need.   The GOP bill would also put a significant financial burden on older  Americans, while doing very little to lower costs for young adults.  This Republican bill leaves Americans worse off and does nothing,  really, to protect people with preexisting conditions, in reality.   Now, if I could speak again in support of H. Res. 271, which is  before us today, that condemns the Trump administration's legal  campaign to take away Americans' healthcare.   As you know, last Monday night, the Justice Department filed a brief  saying that they wanted the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act in  its entirety.                                time  1530    The Trump administration's announcement last week that it would  actively support this frivolous lawsuit striking down the entire  Affordable Care Act shows the President's shameless disregard for the  health and well-being of the American people, in my opinion.   If the Trump administration got its way in court and the ACA is  struck down, tens of millions of Americans would lose their health  coverage overnight. Hundreds of millions would immediately lose  protections for preexisting conditions, and we would be sent barreling  back to the days of lifetime limits and price discrimination against  women based on their gender.   Republicans had their chance to repeal and replace the ACA, and the  American people overwhelmingly rejected their plan. And now by refusing  to defend the ACA in court, the Trump administration is asking the  courts to do what President Trump and the Republican Congress could not  do, and that is repeal the ACA and all the protections that it includes  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with  preexisting conditions and for other protections included in the  Affordable Care Act. Well, now is your chance to show it.   We have an opportunity today to send a clear message that we will not  support this reckless attack that imperils the well-being of millions  of hardworking Americans.   The time for empty promises has expired. It is time to act. The Trump  Administration is determined to destroy protections for preexisting  conditions and to tear down every last benefit guaranteed by the  Affordable Care Act, and today's vote is an opportunity to stand up in  solidarity against this heartless attack.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 271, to  send a clear message: We will not stand idly by while the Trump  administration wages an all-out assault on Americans' healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
