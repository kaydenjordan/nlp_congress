 Mr. Speaker, there are certain phrases that we have learned  to grow to accept with great suspicion: The check is in the mail. It is  not you; it is me. Don't worry, I will respect you in the morning. I  have had just a few drinks; I am fine with driving.   And now we have to add to that: Don't worry. Large tax cuts for the  most wealthy will pay for themselves, and I am a fiscally conservative  Republican who cares about debt and deficits.   The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that, with interest  payments, this bill will add over $2.3 trillion, with a T, to our  national debt over th next 10 years. That is why last week, in  committee, I was offering an amendment that would expand the endangered  species list to include fiscally conservative Republicans because your  vote on this bill will make you extinct.    And what is unfortunate is, unlike past tax cuts that weren't paid  for, we have run out of time. We no longer have the luxury of time to  recover from a huge fiscal mistake, not with 70 million baby boomers  beginning their massive retirement--10,000 a day joining Social  Security and Medicare. Those programs and the solvency of Social  Security and Medicare will be in jeopardy with another $2.3 trillion of  debt over the next 10 years.   And what is unfortunate, it didn't have to be this way. There was  bipartisan interest in simplifying the Code, making it more  competitive, broadening the base, making it fair for working families  and small businesses and family farmers, but doing it in a fiscally  responsible way.   Asking 34 million Americans to accept a tax increase to pay for a 43  percent marginal rate reduction to the largest companies is hardly  responsible, and it is hardly fair. I encourage my colleagues to let us  take a different approach and reject this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I think my good friend and colleague from  California is raising a very important point, and it is a point that  all of us here this evening on the Ways and Means Committee, with the  leadership of Mr. Neal from Massachusetts, have been raising for some  time.   Doing tax reform right is tough. There are a lot of moving pieces to  it, and there are a lot of traps and unintended consequences if you do  it the wrong way. Not having one hearing, not having proper vetting,  not taking the time to listen to people back home in our respective  States and districts about the consequences of something that is going  to affect every American life in this country is legislative  malpractice, and that is what we are on the verge of committing leading  up to tomorrow's vote.   My friend from California mentioned the $2.3 trillion in additional  debt over the next 10 years by the time you add in the interest  payments and how devastating that will be, and it is happening at the  wrong time.   I mean, we might have gotten away with that with the 1981 tax cuts  that weren't paid for back then because there was a little bit of time  to recover  [[Page H9368]]  from a big fiscal mistake, and from 2001, 2003. We have run out of time  as a nation, with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive  retirement, 10,000 a day joining Social Security and Medicare.   But their entire theory is premised on the fact that over two-thirds  of the tax cut will be going to large corporations under their bill of  this illusory growth that is going to come from it. Part of that is  based on this tax holiday, they call it deemed repatriation, where  these multinational companies are going to be able to bring dollars  back into America at a much lower rate and supposedly reinvesting here  that is going to promote growth.   But there was a recent survey by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch of  300 executives of some of the largest U.S. multinational companies  asking them what they would do with this deemed repatriated money  coming back to the country. Their number one response was paying down  debt. Reinvesting in their company, reinvesting in research and  development, investing in more jobs and good-paying jobs barely  registered in that survey.   But this should not come as a surprise. It is not like we haven't  been down this road before. We tried a repatriation bill back in the  early 2000s, where these companies were able to bring back a ton of  money, and what they used it for was dividend give-outs and stock  buybacks. Yet they are refusing to learn the lessons of the past and  going on this theory of an illusory growth that none of the major  economists see under this tax bill, and it is a huge fiscal gamble that  I think i going to leave us in the same place as the 2001 and 2003 tax  cuts, which was one of the worst decades when it came to job growth in  our country.     I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Chicago. He  represents a large urban district. I represent a large rural district  in Wisconsin. He may be a Bears fan, and I might be a Packers fan, but  one thing we agree on is this a bill of goods for both of our  constituencies.   I am especially concerned about the economic impact in the large  rural congressional district that I represent where production  agriculture is still an important part of our economy.   Some of the changes that they are making are going to be devastating  to family farmers. They are taking away the 199 tax deduction, which is  as important for our domestic manufacturers as it is for our family  farmers.   If you want to grow things and invent things and create things, make  things in America, the 199 has a proven track record of making it  easier for our farmers and manufacturers to do it. Under their bill,  that goes away.   That operating loss carryback, which is important for a lot of  farmers in order to recoup some of the losses that they have  experienced in their business, it goes away.   Like-kind exchanges for property and heavy machinery in farm country  goes away. A lot of my farmers are operating on a margin right now. I  am concerned about the impact this is going to have on the rural  economy and our family farmers with what they are proposing.   You don't have to be from a city or from a rural district to  understand that, again, the work wasn't put into this bill to  understand the real consequences of what they are asking for. It is not  too late. We can still regroup and work in the bipartisan fashion that  tax reform was meant to occur and figure out a way to truly simplify,  make us more competitive, but make it fair for working families, small  businesses, and family farmers in all of our districts, rather than  this rush to judgment just so they can score a political win before the  end of the year.                                time  2030    So I think the points that my friend from Chicago raised are very  valid, and it is something that I would hope all of us would heed  before we reach our final decision tomorrow morning.    Amen.
