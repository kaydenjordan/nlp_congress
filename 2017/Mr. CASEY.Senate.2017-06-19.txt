 Madam President, this past Friday, when I was back in  Pennsylvania, I had the opportunity to meet a family whom I have  referred to very often on the floor--the Simpson family. Rowan Simpson,  their son, is on the autism spectrum. I have talked a lot about Rowan's  disability in the context of the healthcare debate.   We have now the beginnings of a debate about what will be in the  Senate bill, if one emerges. If we are going to be up front about what  happens to families and individuals like Rowan, I think it would be  important to know what happens to a family who has a loved one with a  disability in the context of both the Senate bill and the House bill  merging.   Madam President, on behalf of Rowan and families who have loved ones  with disabilities, I ask unanimous consent that no motion to proceed to  calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, be in order  until the bill is jointly referred to the Committee on Finance and the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I will start tonight with one of the  questions  [[Page S3593]]  that we have, and this will be a procedural question. I want to alert  the Chair, I am going to pose this question initially before I make my  remarks about the debate we are having on healthcare.   Is the Chair able to confirm that the Committee on Finance considered  S. 1796, the America's Healthy Future Act, which was ultimately  incorporated into H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act, in executive session on eight separate calendar days prior to  reporting the bill favorably?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Secretary of the Senate's office, through  the Senate Library, confirms that.    Thank you.   Mr. President, I rise tonight to provide some context about what is  at stake for children in the United States with regard to the debate we  are having on healthcare and, in particular, what would happen--some of  the adverse impacts on children with disabilities.   I will start with the broad view, but I think it is important to  frame our discussions. Sometimes our debate on healthcare comes down to  a discussion of big numbers. How many people will be impacted? For  example, the Congressional Budget Office told us that 23 million people  would lose their healthcare coverage over the course of a decade if the  House bill were to become law. So healthcare coverage would be ripped  away from 23 million people or we hear about the impact on the deficit  one way or the other or we hear about broad numbers. Probably the best  way to think about the impact of these policies is, if the House bill  were to become law or some version of it because of what a few Senate  Republicans are working on right now--maybe the better way to think  about it is in terms of a couple of individuals, children.   I will give you two examples for now. Angelica and Rowan--two  different children, two different stories. We received a letter in the  last couple--I am sorry. Angelica is the parent. I should have said  Amaya. Amaya is the child whom her mom wrote to us about. Her mom is  Angelica.   She wrote to us and said:         I am writing to you because I am appalled by all that is       happening to this country. I have an amazing story about my       daughter Amaya. She was basically born with no bones and she       received a miracle drug that regrew her bones. She will have       to take this medicine for the rest of her life but the fact       that she is doing so amazing has to do with all the help that       she received from Medicaid. She is the youngest patient in       the U.S. to take the drug. I don't only want to talk about       her but I am concerned about the future of our party. Looking       forward to hearing from you.    So said Angelica. Then, later on, she talks about what happened in  her case to her child. She says she decided with a counselor to check  with the Allegheny County officials about whether or not Medicaid  expansion would cover Amaya's treatment. She said they made an inquiry.  She said by the next day, ``Someone from the State had called me, and  later that week her treatment was approved. Thanks to the Medicaid  expansion, my daughter receives her lifesaving treatment.''   So I make that reference to one letter about one child, Amaya. Then,  of course, there are so many other letters. I will just highlight one I  received months ago now from Pam Simpson. She is from Coatesville, PA-- Southeastern Pennsylvania just outside the city of Philadelphia. Now  you are talking about Rowan in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Amaya in  Southwestern Pennsylvania, two corners of the State--two children  facing challenges that most of us can't even imagine.   In this case, Pam Simpson wrote to me about her son Rowan and talked  about his life before a diagnosis of autism and before he was getting  the help he is getting now. Pam talked about all of the challenges she  and families like her face. She talked about the fact that he was  having all kinds of difficulties, but then they finally got the word  that Rowan would be covered by Medical Assistance. That is the  Pennsylvania version of Medicaid at the State level. She said she  applied in January of 2016. After Pam got the word that Rowan would be  enrolled, she said:         We were able to obtain wraparound services, which included       a behavioral specialist consultant--so-called BSC--and a       therapeutic staff support worker. The wraparound services       have been a godsend--    Referring to the services provided to her son Rowan. Then she goes on  later in the letter and says:         Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full time       to support our family. We would be bankrupt or my son would       go without the therapies he sincerely needs.    Here is how Pam concludes her letter:         Please think of my dear Rowan and his happy face, his big       blue eyes, and his lovely strawberry blonde hair. Please       think of me and my husband, working every day to support our       family, and please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna.    I will stop there just to explain. She is talking about Rowan, who is  a couple of years older. The reference here is to his younger sister  Luna.         Please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna who smiles and       laughs at her brother daily. She will have to care for Rowan       later in her life when we are gone. Overall, we are       desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would       be devastated if we lost these benefits.    That is what Pam Simpson wrote to me months ago. After referring to  her story and Rowan's story over the last couple of months, I finally  had the chance to meet her and to meet Rowan and his dad and his sister  Luna. So I met this family--four people in a family. I met them on  Friday. It is one thing to read about it and to get a sense of what a  family is up against every day, and it is another thing to meet them.  Right now, the Simpson family has what they need for Rowan. That  doesn't mean they don't have challenges. It doesn't mean it will not be  difficult in the years ahead, but they have the benefit of Medicaid  right now--Medical Assistance, as we call it in Pennsylvania.   Rowan now, because he has autism, has the benefit of those behavioral  specialists and Medical Assistance. There was a person with them the  day I met them, to work with Rowan every day so the parents can work  and have the peace of mind to know they can go to work, and they can  raise their family with the benefit of the kind of healthcare every  child should have. Some might say: You know what. If the Republicans  get their way on this bill, maybe the Medicaid provisions will not  apply to Rowan. Maybe he will be protected or maybe in Allegheny  County, maybe Amaya will be protected. Maybe it will not reach that  far. Maybe when the Congressional Budget Office--I will read directly  from page 17 of the report by the Congressional Budget Office analyzing  the House bill when it says: Medicaid enrollment would be lower  throughout the coming decade, culminating in 14 million fewer Medicaid  enrollees by 2026, a reduction of 17 percent relative to the number  under current law. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says  about the impact of the House bill on Medicaid--14 million people lose  their Medicaid.   Some might say: Let's assume for purposes of this argument that those  two children we just spoke about might be protected from those cuts. We  don't know that, of course, and they can't guarantee that because what  they are doing when they go at these Medicaid provisions is taking away  the guarantee that has been there for 50 years and, over time,  eliminating the Medicaid expansion. That is what we expect to happen.  That is certainly what the House bill did.    Let's assume for the sake of argument that they could come in here  and make an ironclad guarantee that those two children, Rowan and  Amaya, won't be affected. You know what. That is not good enough. That  is not good enough because there are a lot of other children who will  be affected, children who might have a disability.   Sixty percent of children with disabilities are enrolled in Medicaid.  We know that. We know that millions of other children who come from  low-income families get the benefit of Medicaid. We know that a lot of  seniors depend upon Medicaid to get into a nursing home. But no family  who has a child with disabilities who benefits from Medicaid should  have to worry for 15 minutes about what would happen in this Chamber-- because a small group of Republican Senators are meeting in secret, and  they are supposed to produce a bill that we are all supposed to  consider in a short timeframe--no product of that secret process should  in any way give any parent who has a  [[Page S3594]]  child with a disability any concern at all that that benefit will be  taken away. That is not who we are as a country. We are America. We  take care of people who need those kinds of services, that kind of  benefit.   So if a child like Rowan, who is receiving the benefits of Medicaid  today because of his disability--if a child like that is receiving  those services today, we should guarantee that he will receive those  benefits for as long as he needs those benefits. Even if it goes the  length and breadth of his life, we should guarantee that, take it off  the table so that family doesn't have to worry.   That, I hope, would be the result of this process undertaken by a  small group of Republican Senators. I have been waiting to hear that,  waiting to hear whether they will guarantee that to that child, to give  that family some peace of mind with all the challenges they have, even  with Medicaid, even with the great support they get. It is not easy. It  is a very difficult life many families lead when they have a child with  a disability. But we should do everything we can to make sure that if a  child with a disability--just one category of people who benefit--any  child with a disability who gets the benefit of Medicaid should have  that protection for as long as they need it. And I will be waiting to  hear that from our colleagues when they finally emerge from this  secretive process with the bill. So I hope that is what they are  working on in their meetings because we know that it affects a lot of  children.   As I said before, Medicaid covers 60 percent of all children with  disabilities, ranging from autism, like Rowan, to traumatic brain  injuries. We know that children on Medicaid receive what many consider  the gold standard for children's healthcare--early and periodic  screening, diagnostic and treatment options, so-called EPSTD--so they  can get the screenings they need, so they can get preventive healthcare  when they need it.   All of these protections should be not just a goal, they should be  guaranteed for those children. I am hoping our friends who are working  on this right now will consider Rowan and Amaya and children like them.   We will come back to it later. We will have other stories to tell  about children and what they are up against. But on a night like  tonight, I am thinking of those children and worried about some of the  headlines we are seeing on some analysis.   I will wrap up with this: The Center for American Progress report  dated May of 2017 is titled ``Cuts to Medicaid Would Harm Young  Children With Disabilities.'' That is one report. Another report is  from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, May 18, 2017:  ``Medicaid Cuts in House ACA Repeal Bill Will Limit Availability of  Home- and Community-Based Services.'' That is another headline. We  won't get into the details of those reports now.   We have a lot to work on here to make sure that nothing that happens  in this process will rip away healthcare from children with  disabilities.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, today I wish to commend Cheryl Bullock as  she retires from public service. Cheryl has honorably served the people  of Pennsylvania for 9 years through her role as my southeastern  Pennsylvania regional director. She has been a valuable asset to my  office, the city of Philadelphia, and the Commonwealth.   Prior to joining my office, Cheryl spent the majority of her career  with WPHL-TV. Cheryl spent over 20 years with the station handling  media buys and marketing for local and national advertisers, including  sports sponsorships and advertising with the Philadelphia Phillies,  Flyers, and 76ers. Her tenacity and infectious laugh made her a natural  at WPHL. She was later appointed governor of the Philadelphia  Advertising Club from 2012 through 2014 after they recognized her  strong leadership and dedication to her work--in and outside of the  office.   Upon her departure from WPHL-TV, Cheryl transitioned to the public  relations team within the Community College of Philadelphia. From 2007  to 2008, Cheryl managed strategic messaging, communications, and campus  activities and events--skills she later utilized throughout her work  for the people of Pennsylvania. Due to her creative nature and way with  words, she was trusted to write multiple articles for three community  college publications.   In addition to her professional pursuits, Cheryl has held leadership  roles in several organizations geared towards community empowerment and  service. Cheryl served as the vice president of Philadelphia Chapter of  the Links, Incorporated, as well as president of the National Coalition  of 100 Black Women. The National Coalition of 100 Black Women was  created to establish a leadership forum for Black women from all  geopolitical and socioeconomic groups. Cheryl's service within these  organizations is a clear demonstration of her long-standing commitment  to improving the lives of others.   Over the course of the last 9 years, the Commonwealth has benefited  from Cheryl's thoughtful guidance, driven attitude, attention to  detail, and overall leadership. We will all miss her passion for  service and commitment to helping others. I wish Cheryl well in her  retirement as she plans to spend more time with her husband, George,  and son Jordan.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oregon  for bringing the passion and the determination that he brings to his  work, especially when it comes to healthcare.   I spoke earlier tonight about the potential impact of any Senate  bill, but of course the impact that we know already with regard to the  House bill, because the House bill is legislation that passed and  legislation that we can analyze as it relates to the impact on  children, especially children with disabilities.   Of course, when it comes to healthcare generally, but, in particular,  Medicaid and what Medicaid provides to children, we know the impact  nationwide. In my home State of Pennsylvania, we have 1.1 million  children who are covered by Medicaid. So I am very concerned about any  effort that would undermine or ultimately extinguish the ability of  Americans--especially children--to have the benefit of Medicaid  expansion, but, of course, the Medicaid program itself. It is  especially insulting when some would support cuts to the Medicaid  Program that would undermine or even threaten to undermine healthcare  for children with disabilities. I spoke earlier of two children in  particular.   I will come back to children in a moment, but I wanted to go to the  other end of the age scale--older Americans. So many people think of  healthcare for people over the age of 65 to be solely limited to  Medicare, not Medicaid. But, of course, we know that Medicaid plays a  role as well.   One of the parts of our healthcare infrastructure that may not be as  well known is the impact that Medicaid has on supporting aging older  adults, in particular, with regard to supports and services. We know  Medicaid is critical to supporting aging older adults, providing them  dignity and choice as they age. Medicaid covers long-term services and  support for low-income, older adults and adults with disabilities,  including nursing home and home community-based programs.   Generally, health insurance does not cover long-term supports and  service costs. Medicare coverage for those services can be limited, and  private, long-term care insurance is unaffordable for many Americans.  So spending on long-term supports and services for older citizens  accounts for almost two-thirds of all Medicaid spending. I said  Medicaid, not Medicare. A lot of people don't know that we spend that  much in terms of long-term supports and services.   To give this perspective, in 2016, the median annual cost for a year  of home health aide services was over $46,000--for home health aide  services. The median cost for a semiprivate room at a nursing facility  was $82,000--a much greater cost. So we know the impact of those  numbers. About a third of the people turning 65 will require nursing  home care at some point during their life. So these are big costs, and  we have to make sure that as we move forward, we can provide this kind  of care for aging adults.   Three-fourths of nursing home residents will eventually be covered by  Medicaid. So if you are going to a nursing home and you spend down, the  only option for you in most instances is Medicaid. We know that in  about a 1-year timeframe, between July of 2015 to June of 2016 in  Pennsylvania, 123,000 Pennsylvanians aged 55 and older received long- term supports and services through Medicaid. One group of about 80,000  Pennsylvanians received those long-term supports and services at a  nursing home. Another group of about 50,000 Pennsylvanians 55 and older  received Medicaid home and community-based services.    There are lots of numbers there and lots of data, but the key thing  is, we know the great dependence folks have on the Medicaid Program in  addition to the obvious benefits provided by Medicare. So cuts or per  capita caps on Medicaid would have a devastating impact on older  Americans.   I know the closed-door secret discussions taking place in the Senate  between among only a small group of Republicans so far--we know those  kinds of discussions are taking place. What will they do with regard to  Medicaid? Will they cut it outright or will they put a per capita cap  on it or will they send it back to the States and tell the Governors  and State legislatures they have to balance their budget: It is up to  you to provide most of the Medicaid services. The Federal Government is  getting out of that business or at least transferring substantial  responsibility to the States.   So we have to be vigilant about that and make sure we do everything  we can to put the interests of older citizens and the priority of  taking care of them at the front of the agenda.   Research also shows that Medicaid dollars play a role in supporting a  lot of good-paying jobs in a State like Pennsylvania. We are told that  over a quarter of a million jobs in the long-term care field--meaning  long-term supports and services--are Pennsylvania jobs right now. So  any change there could have an adverse job impact. The Commonwealth  Fund and George Washington's Milken Institute released a report  projecting 942,000 fewer jobs in 2026 and that nearly every State would  experience an economic downturn if the Republican bill were to become  law based upon the House bill as we know it. As we were told most  recently by a Republican Senator, the Senate bill will reflect the  House bill about 80 percent. So we have a sense of the outlines of the  Senate bill, if not all the details yet.   In Pennsylvania, this same report by George Washington University's  Milken Institute said that just in Pennsylvania, the job impact would  be 85,000 fewer jobs by 2026, and of those 85,000, more than 52,000 of  those jobs would be healthcare jobs which would be lost if the  Republican bill were to be enacted into law.   We get a sense of the job impact, we get a sense of the healthcare  impact when it comes to cuts to Medicaid that are substantial. As we  know, the Congressional Budget Office told us that were the House bill  to be enacted into law, in that decade, 14 million folks on Medicaid  would lose their coverage. That is on page 17 of the CBO report.   When we look at it by county in Pennsylvania, we can see the impact  in this age category of 55 and up. Allegheny County--our second largest  county by population--over 10,000 Pennsylvanians over the age of 55  receive care in a nursing home or at home because of Medicaid. That  generated nearly $360 million in payments to providers in the county, a  huge impact in addition to the impact on the care people receive.   I will not go through every county, of course, but just to give a  sense of it. Cambria County, a much smaller county by way of  population--where Johnstown is in the southwestern corner of our  State--1,100 individuals in Cambria County age 55 and older receive  care in a nursing home or at home because of Medicaid. That is about a  $36 million impact on that county. In my home county, Lackawanna  County, where Scranton is located, 2,500 Pennsylvanians over the age of  55 receiving nursing home care because of Medicaid, a $96 million  impact just in Lackawanna County. I will not go through all the  counties, but we can see the impact on both care and jobs when it comes  to the impact of Medicaid on long-term care, support, and services.   We talked earlier about Medicaid and the impact on children. I don't  think it has been at all clear until recently the reach and scope of  Medicaid when it comes to children. Forty percent of every child in the  country is covered by Medicaid. I mentioned earlier tonight, and I will  say it again: Sixty percent of all children with disabilities ranging  from autism to traumatic brain injury, and a lot of disabilities on  that list in between, rely upon Medicaid.   I said the Republican plan at the bare minimum should guarantee every  child with a disability who has Medicaid coverage today would in fact  have that coverage going forward for whatever time they need it because  I think that is part of who we are as a country. When a child has a  disability that is so substantial in terms of the impact on that child  and his or her family and they have Medicaid, nothing the U.S. Senate  should do should undermine that in any way. I would hope, at a minimum,  our Republican colleagues would ensure that. I think it is insulting to  even create doubt or uncertainty or create any degree of anxiety for a  [[Page S3612]]  family to have to watch this bill proceed--either the House bill that  was passed or the Senate bill which is in formation right now. For any  family who has the benefit of Medicaid and has a child with a  disability to in any way be anxious or uncertain because of what might  happen here, I think is an insult to them and to our values as  Americans.   We are a great country. We can make sure children with disabilities  have the benefit that comes from the early periodic screening and  diagnosis, preventive care, the quality care that comes from services  provided by Medicaid for kids with disabilities. We are a great  country. We can pay for that and still be a growing economy, still have  the greatest military in the world, still have the strongest GDP in the  world. We can do all of that and still take care of the children.    I guess some believe the only way to prosperity is to say we have to  substantially cut back on Medicaid, to the point where 14 million  Americans lose their coverage over 10 years, but we still, at the same  time, have to give tax cuts to the very wealthy. One estimate showed  the original House bill--the one that didn't get a vote but was  substantially similar to the one that did get a vote--the first bill  gave to 400 Americans a tax cut of some $7 million each. How does that  make the country stronger when you are cutting back on Medicaid and  giving gross substantial tax cuts to people who already are worth  hundreds of millions of dollars or maybe even billions of dollars? I  don't see how that moves the country forward to shortchange folks on  Medicaid, especially if it were to adversely impact a child with a  disability.   We mentioned all of those impacts, but I think it is especially  devastating when it gets down to an individual family. I talked earlier  about Rowan Simpson whose mom wrote to me months ago. I had the chance  to meet Rowan and his mom and dad just last week for the first time in  person, but the idea that Pam Simpson--or any parent--would be at all  uncertain or worried about what would happen here in the next couple of  days or weeks is really an insult to who we are as a people.   I hope those who are behind closed doors making decisions as we  speak--maybe they are done for the day now, but I hope they will be  thinking about Rowan and his mom and their family.   I mentioned the overall impact of Medicaid on children. In  particular, we know the Medicaid Program, of course, in addition to  covering children with disabilities, covers adults with disabilities as  well. In my State, by one estimate, it is over 720,000 people. Across  the country, in 2015, there were 15 million people with disabilities  who were Medicaid beneficiaries. Through Medicaid, those 15 million  people receive assistance with their healthcare. They get the benefit  of durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs or assistive speaking  devices. They get long-term supports for daily living, such as personal  care attendance because of their disability. So Medicaid is now the  primary payer for healthcare services for those with disabilities. It  is also the primary payer for long-term supports and services that help  people with disabilities live independent lives.   In many cases, these long-term care supports and services also make  it possible for a person with a disability to hold down a job because  of the support they get from Medicaid.   We know that in 2014, across the country, the average spending for a  person with a disability enrolled in Medicaid was a little more than  $19,000. In Pennsylvania, it was a little more than 18,300. The average  annual growth in enrollee spending for persons with a disability  between 2000 and 2011 was 4.5 percent. In my State, it is a little more  than that almost. It is almost 5.7 percent, and we have seen the  outline of a proposal that would limit that annual growth to about 2.4  percent. I would hope those who are working on the Medicaid provisions  would take into account the reality of what it costs to provide help to  someone with a disability and not come up with some arbitrary number to  cap or limit what an individual with a disability would have available  to them, especially by way of Medicaid or otherwise. They are dependent  upon and have a right to expect that kind of healthcare would continue  to be provided.   We will see what happens. I know those who are behind closed doors  have a sense of those numbers. I hope they would be very determined to  make sure no one with a disability is worse off as a result of their  efforts, but that is the reality people with disabilities live with. I  think when we consider what some families are up against right now,  many families have just barely come out of the last recession. Some  families lost their home, some families lost their home and their job  or even if they lost a job and have since recovered because they are  employed or partially recovered, sometimes the job they have isn't the  job they had prior to the recession.   I can only imagine what it is like to have the kind of economic  stress some live with because they have lost a job or the job they have  now doesn't pay what their old job paid. On top of all that, if your  son or daughter or someone in your family has a disability and the only  thing that has kept you above water or allowed you to get from one day  to the next to make ends meet is the availability of Medicaid for that  individual and the family who needs that kind of help--we will see what  the bill drafters come up with. Every indication so far has been very  negative and very much adverse to the interests of those families-- those millions of families who depend upon Medicaid for basic  healthcare, especially the basic healthcare that would be connected to  a disability, whether that disability is a physical disability of one  kind or another or whether it is a disability because that child or  adult is on the autism spectrum or whether it is a child with Down  syndrome who is dependent upon Medicaid or is dependent upon some other  healthcare program that would be adversely affected.   We can debate the outlines and the broad numbers of this legislation,  but what I hope would not be up for debate is that those who now have  the benefit of Medicaid because of a substantial burden in their life-- meaning a disability because of circumstances that require one  individual to have the benefit of long-term care, where the family has  spent down their assets to such an extent that only Medicaid can allow  that loved one to get into a nursing home--I would hope that it would  not be much of a debate that we should continue to help those families  and those individuals.   At a minimum, I think we can agree between the two parties that  vulnerable Americans who depend upon Medicaid and other healthcare  programs will be protected. I think that is something on which both  parties should be able to agree. Unfortunately, the House bill in no  way agreed with that assertion. That is why it was particularly  objectionable, and that is why you have an array of organizations  across the country that came out against the bill, those who have  experience delivering healthcare to the vulnerable, those who have  experience making sure people with disabilities are given that kind of  help and that kind of care. If the Senate bill is substantially similar  to the House bill, those with disabilities will be substantially and  adversely and, I am afraid, irreversibly impacted to such an extent  that we wouldn't be the same country we are today if those individuals  lost their healthcare and lost the benefit of those healthcare  services.   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
