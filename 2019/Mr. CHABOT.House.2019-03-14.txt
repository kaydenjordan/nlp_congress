 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address an issue that  impacts all our congressional districts and communities: the opioid  crisis.   For years now, it seems that the only news about it has been bad  news: 70,000 overdose deaths in 2017, widespread importation of deadly  drugs like fentanyl, families devastated, lives wasted.   But now, finally, some good news to report. In my district,  specifically, in  [[Page H2722]]  Hamilton County, we have had a 20 percent decrease in opioid deaths in  the first half of 2018.   The decline is the result of multiple prevention efforts, a task  force of first responders, law enforcement, health officials, and  community leaders all working together to tackle this deadly epidemic.  Their efforts are truly saving lives in our community.   Most importantly, their successes can be used as a model to help save  thousands and thousands of lives across the country. And I can't think  of any better news than that.                            ____________________
