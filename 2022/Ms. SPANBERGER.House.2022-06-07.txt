 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the 340B  program. I rise today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 340B  drug discount program, which has supported health providers in their  mission to care for the most vulnerable and low-income patients in our  communities, all at no additional cost to the taxpayer.   Tonight, the House will hear stories from both Democrats and  Republicans about how 340B supports the healthcare safety net in  districts across the country, including in Virginia's Seventh District.   In 1992, Congress started the 340B program with a simple goal. The  340B program has helped hospitals, community health centers, and  Federal grantees stretch their scarce resources as far as possible,  helping them reach more eligible patients and provide more  comprehensive services.   The way it works is simple: 340B requires pharmaceutical companies to  make drugs more affordable for healthcare providers serving vulnerable  communities and low-income patients. By discounting the drugs, these  providers can stretch their resources further and reach even more  patients.   The 340B program is especially important for providers in rural  America. In these areas, lower incomes lead to higher rates of  uncompensated care and a disproportionate number of patients with  Medicare and Medicaid. Hospitals struggle to maintain costly services  such as maternity wards and trauma centers, and patients at federally  qualified health centers lack the resources to access high-cost drugs  for HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, or diabetes.   Unfortunately, since the summer of 2020, at least 16 pharmaceutical  companies have announced or implemented restrictions on 340B pricing.  Both the current Biden administration and the previous Trump  administration have found these restrictions to be unlawful, yet HHS  has taken no serious enforcement action to prevent or penalize these  illegal actions.   Let me be very clear: Every time a pharmaceutical company withholds a  340B discount from an eligible pharmacy, that company is unlawfully  overcharging the healthcare safety net and withholding resources from  the most vulnerable patients in our communities. And, in response, we  need to defend 340B.   I commend HHS for its commitment to protecting the integrity of the  340B program, but I urge the agency to penalize the companies that  refuse to comply with Federal law. It is the right thing to do for the  people we serve.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee  for his comments. Certainly, his comments focus so much on the  importance of the 340B program. We know that rural hospitals are the  lifeblood of their communities. They often serve as the largest  employer in a town and a way to keep and attract young people to that  community.   Rural hospitals are already in crisis, and since 2005, more than 180  rural hospitals have closed their doors. One reason why that number is  not higher is the 340B program.   Savings from 340B discounts and community pharmacies are half of all  the savings for rural hospitals. If these losses are allowed to stand  and grow bigger, we will face a real crisis across rural America.   Recent actions by the pharmaceutical companies threaten the ability  of rural hospitals to stay open, costing them, on average, $229,000.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona for  speaking about this important program and the value that it has across  his district.   I am now grateful for the opportunity to yield to my colleague from  Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania  for his comments. They are so important because he was talking about  the impact that we see when pharmaceutical companies do not abide by  the 340B program.   We know that hospitals that serve more urban areas report that, on  average, they have lost nearly a quarter of the 340B resources they  receive through partnerships with community pharmacies. That is a  median loss of $1 million.   For critical access hospitals that are the only source of hospital  care for their remote, rural communities, this loss is nearly 40  percent, and the median loss is $220,000.   These losses of millions of dollars are harmful to hospitals with  razor-thin operating margins, especially the more than half that  operate in the red even with 340B support, echoing and illustrating the  point made by my colleague from Pennsylvania.   To be clear, these losses are going to drug companies that continue  to report excellent results to their shareholders, many of whom report  double-digit profit margins. We know that that impacts hospitals across  our communities and their ability to serve patients and provide care.   I am now pleased to yield time to the gentleman from New Hampshire  (Mr. Pappas).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Pappas for sharing the  stories that he is hearing directly from his district.   When I asked pharmacists about how this program works in practice, we  were overwhelmed with responses related to how patients have been able  to access care through the 340B program. I will just give one example  as follow-up to Mr. Pappas' comments.   We had a pharmacist say, ``I have countless numbers of patients who  are now able to get their insulin and control their diabetes because of  the 340B program.'' When their local pharmacy prices put their insulin  costs into the range of hundreds of dollars each month, this  pharmacist, because of the 340B program, is able to meet the needs of  these community members with diabetes who otherwise would not be able  to afford their lifesaving medication.   We have story after story from pharmacists who recognize the value of  this program and depend on it in order to serve patients throughout  Virginia, New Hampshire, and throughout the country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis for his comments and  certainly for bringing up the important role that federally qualified  health centers raise in providing care. We know that they stretch their  scarce resources. In fact, one of the federally qualified health  centers in my district in Louisa County has shared with us some stories  about the impact of this program.   Louisa County is one of the most rural counties in my district, and  the Louisa County Health and Wellness Center is a federally qualified  health center, and it is an invaluable resource for Louisa County and  our local community.   Discounts through the 340B program allows the Central Virginia Health  Services and the Louisa County Health and Wellness Center to offset the  costs of providing nonprofitable services, such as dental and  behavioral health. The savings from 340B allows Central Virginia Health  Services to have a strong clinical pharmacy team that provides  extensive support with Medicare annual wellness visits, medication  compliance with complex patients, managing its hepatitis C program, and  overseeing diabetic initiatives. Most importantly, the 340B savings  allows Central Virginia Health Services and other federally qualified  health centers to offer substantial sliding fee discounts to patients  regardless of whether or not they have insurance.   The Federal grant only covers about 40 percent of the cost of  treating a patient, and the rest comes from 340B savings. So let me be  clear on that: It is the savings that federally qualified health  centers receive because they are able to participate in this program.  Because the drugs that they are prescribing and giving to their  patients cost less, those savings they are able to invest elsewhere. In  the case of Louisa County, they are putting those dollars into dental  and behavioral health.    The intent of the 340B program for the past 30 years has been to help  stretch Federal resources for the benefit of the taxpayer, and this is  a great example of exactly how that is happening back home in  Virginia's Seventh District.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia) to  speak on this important program.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois for  providing such an important story, illustrating the value of the 340B  program in Illinois, and those stories exist across the country.   I now yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), as we  continue our discussion about the value of this program.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I  appreciate his talking about the PROTECT 340B program. I was so proud  to lead this effort. And certainly, as we have heard today, Congress'  intention for the 340B program is to support safety net providers and  their ability to stretch their scarce resources and provide more  comprehensive services to vulnerable patients.   Congress certainly did not intend for the 340B program and those  discounts to subsidize the profits of Fortune 100 pharmacy benefit  managers, and I thank Mr. Rose for recognizing that.   I was proud to work with my colleagues across the aisle to introduce  PROTECT 340B to stop PBMs from, frankly, pickpocketing 340B discounts  so that we can ensure the benefits of 340B reach the community health  centers, the HIV/AIDS clinics, and the rural hospitals that Congress  intended to support.   I thank the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who has been  an absolute champion of this issue. I have been so grateful to work  with him and his team every step along the way. His commitment to West  Virginia, the safety net hospitals, the rural hospitals, and the  communities that rely on 340B is apparent through his dedication to  this.   Our bill is in response to the stories that we have heard from  pharmacists across our districts. PBMs have established two tiers of  payment for pharmacy-dispersed drugs, one for chain and retail  pharmacies unassociated with 340B providers, and another significantly  lower rate for 340B pharmacies.   Years of market consolidation have given the three leading PBMs  incredible market power, and they can effectively dictate terms to  smaller 340B pharmacies. What that means is PBMs are essentially  pickpocketing 340B savings from safety net providers. Instead of  helping the healthcare safety net reach more patients, the 340B savings  are subsidizing the profits of some of the largest, most profitable  companies in America, and that means that those safety net hospitals,  those rural hospitals, those federally qualified health centers are not  able to put those savings toward care to patients.   Our PROTECT 340B Act would hold PBMs accountable and prevent them  from applying these predatory business practices to the local health  centers, the rural hospitals, and other Federal grantees. It would also  create a national clearinghouse to track 340B discounts and make sure  340B drugs are not included in States' Medicaid rebate requests.  Together, these changes  [[Page H5329]]  would restore the integrity of the program and protect the healthcare  safety net so many of our constituents rely on.   I am proud that for over the past 2 years many States, including  Virginia, have passed laws to protect the healthcare safety net from  these predatory business practices, but it is not enough. A Federal  standard is necessary to ensure consistent and broad protections for  healthcare providers and, importantly, to actually ensure that we are  enforcing the law, and we are seeing momentum toward that moment.  Currently, our bill has more than 90 cosponsors, and I welcome the rest  of our colleagues to join our effort. Certainly, from tonight, people  should be able to see this is an issue that many people from across the  country and across the aisle certainly can get behind, and I urge my  colleagues to consider joining us in this legislation.                                time  2015    Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield time back to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose) to continue this conversation and education about  the value of the 340B program.    Madam Speaker, I thank and appreciate the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, we have been joining together to recognize the  importance of this program, ensuring that it is there to serve our  communities. And I will give an example.   Virginia Commonwealth University, or VCU, is the largest safety net  hospital in Virginia, and it serves the greatest number of uninsured  and Medicaid patients in our Commonwealth.   Nearly three-quarters of VCU's payor mix is public or uninsured. I am  proud that VCU has been a good steward of the discounts it receives  through the 340B program, consistent with Congressional intent that the  340B program be used to ensure these discounts can stretch Federal  resources.   The 340B program supports VCU's health systems' commitment to serving  all members of the community, regardless of their ability to pay. And  in 2020 alone, the program's savings helped VCU Health provide nearly  2,100 patients with $27,300 discounted or free medications and over $64  million in uncompensated care in fiscal year 2021.   I am going to repeat that. The program savings, the savings that VCU  was able to get through the 340B program, allowed them to provide $64  million in uncompensated care.   VCU has used its 340B discounts to stretch its resources and expand  patients' access to care. For example, in just one year, one patient  visited VCU's Emergency Department nearly 50 times. He was homeless,  and he had multiple chronic conditions; so the emergency department  referred him to VCU's Health Complex Care Clinic. There, thanks to 340B  discounts, the patient received significantly discounted medications  from the hospital pharmacy. Meanwhile, the clinic staff helped the  patient find transitional housing and apply for Medicaid coverage.   Over the next 3 years, the patient only had four emergency department  visits. In 1 year, this man visited the emergency room 50 times because  it was how he was able to get the healthcare that he needed. But thanks  to the 340B program and how well it is utilized by hospitals like VCU  and hospitals across the country, this man was able to get the medicine  he needed through this program at a discounted rate. And the hospital  was able to invest its resources in providing care and ensuring that  this gentleman could get the medication he needed for his chronic  illness and also find his way into transitional housing, apply for  Medicaid coverage, and over 3 years, he had four emergency department  visits.   That is investing in the community, in better health outcomes, and  this is exactly why this program was created. The discounts available  through 340B helped providers like VCU meet the needs of their patients  and certainly uphold the intent of 340B and the program as it was  created 30 years ago.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), my  colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Rose and his commitment to  this issue, and I thank him for joining me in this Special Order hour.  It has really been a wonderful experience to hear from our colleagues  from across the country and across the aisle talk about the value of  this program.   Certainly, we heard Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania talk about the  impact that the 340B program has on hospitals; their ability to  operate, their ability to provide their service, and their ability to  be there for their patients, the importance that this program has to  the operation of our healthcare system here in the United States.   We heard from Mr. Pappas of New Hampshire, stories of particular  people's experience, that thanks to the 340B program, patients with a  need in communities wanting to serve their constituents have been able  to ensure that people who need medication can get it through the 340B  program.   Mr. O'Halleran of Arizona highlighted the value of this program in  rural communities across the United States. And Mr. Davis of Illinois  talked about the creation of Federally qualified health centers and how  vital the 340B program is to their ability to serve their patients,  their communities, and our communities.   Mr. Garcia of Illinois told a really specific story about the impact  of 340B on a patient with diabetes and what he  [[Page H5330]]  is hearing directly from constituents. And certainly, Mr. Rose, in our  comments back and forth, my colleague and I have talked about the value  of this program, the intent of this program, and our efforts to ensure  that pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers are not  breaking the law and are not raiding the coffers of the 340B discount  program.   Madam Speaker, I close out tonight by just thanking all of the  Members who came to the floor, all of the Members who support  legislation to support this vital program, and all of the Members who  recognize the value of the 340B program within their district. Again, I  give a very special thanks to my friend from Tennessee that helped  manage the floor during this Special Order hour.   Since it came into being nearly 30 years ago, 340B has enabled a  strong healthcare safety net that has served thousands of communities  and millions of patients. It has been a lifeline for hospitals, health  centers, and clinics that serve patients with low incomes, especially  those who are uninsured or on Medicaid and those in rural areas. It has  done so with strong bipartisan support and without costing any taxpayer  dollars. Again, these savings allow our communities' hospitals to  stretch those Federal dollars, to save those Federal dollars. This  program does not cost a single taxpayer dollar.   The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a success story for patient access  to care. We should celebrate it. We should protect it. We should defend  340B.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
