 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 30,  H.R. 815.    Mr. President, later this morning, I will join my  Democratic colleagues on the floor to ask unanimous consent to pass the  assault weapons ban, among other gun safety legislation. I will have  more to say before the unanimous consent request, but right now the  scourge of gun violence in America is a national crisis.   I hope my Republican colleagues stand with us to take action that  Americans demand.                             Military Promotions    Mr. President, now, on Senator Tuberville, yesterday, 10 months of  pain and uncertainty finally came to an end for hundreds--hundreds--of  military nominees and their families. Senator Tuberville, after months  of obstruction, stubbornness, and reckless disregard for military  readiness, withdrew his blanket holds on over 400 generals and flag  officers, and, in the span of just a few minutes of floor time, the  Senate unanimously confirmed nearly every single one of them to their  posts. Thank God, these military officers finally got the promotions  they so rightfully earned, but it should not have taken so long.   If there is one word that underscores why we prevailed on Senator  Tuberville, it is persistence. For months, I said it would be up to our  Republican colleagues to talk some sense into Senator Tuberville and  get him to relent in his holds. Senators Ernst and Sullivan stepped up  to the plate and deserve a lot of commendation for their courage, for  their strength.   And, as I predicted, the frustration and pressure on the senior  Senator from Alabama eventually won out. We were persistent and  persistent and persistent and held the line that military nominees  should never, never become pawns to push a partisan agenda.   So let this be a warning. No one--no one--should attempt blanket  holds on our military ever again.   After all the damage he caused, Senator Tuberville has nothing-- absolutely nothing--to show for his obstruction, except for the harm  done to our military and the pain caused to  [[Page S5768]]  military families. His reckless strategy did not succeed, and if, in  the future, others try to hold up military appointments to get their  way, they, too, will fail. Again, let this be a warning that no one  should ever hold up military appointments again.   We cannot cave to any single Member's views, no matter how strongly  felt. I don't doubt that Senator Tuberville feels the issue very  strongly opposite of what I feel, but when our military families are at  stake, we should not use these strong feelings to hold them hostage.  What the senior Senator from Alabama did through his holds was bring  the Senate to a new low, and, in the end, it was all for nothing.   I want to thank my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, who spoke  in defense of our military families. I want to thank particularly  Senator Reed, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator  Klobuchar, the chair of the Rules Committee. I also want to thank  Senator Sinema, who was instrumental in creating bipartisan support for  our resolution. On the Republican side, I want to, once again, thank  Senators Ernst and Sullivan for their courage in helping to break the  logjam after so, so many months. Because Senators on both sides  persisted and held the line, this sad chapter in the Senate is finally  over.                             Supplemental Funding    Mr. President, now, on the supplemental, the question before the  Senate today is simple yet momentous: Will Senators agree to begin  debate--just a debate--on legislation to defend America's national  security on an issue so important it goes to the actual preservation of  Western and democratic values in the world. Are we willing to hold a  discussion, here on the floor, about steps necessary to safeguard  democracy, stand up to autocratic brutes, and respond to our  adversaries with strength, or will Senators prevent us from moving  forward over extremist border policies? Because, this afternoon, the  Senate will hold a vote on whether or not to move forward on a national  security supplemental.   At stake is America's safety, the safety of democracy, and the future  of the war in Ukraine. As we have done throughout our history, the  Senate should rush to the defense of democracy and stand up to  autocratic brutes.   And I have promised my Republican colleagues that if they agree to  move forward, I will give them a vote for a border package entirely of  their choosing--no conditions. This is a golden opportunity for  Republicans to present whatever border policy they want, and our side  will not interfere with the construction of that amendment in any way.   It has been reported that Senate Republicans will make another  attempt to craft a border proposal and share it with Democrats, because  the last proposal was so far away from what anyone could accept on our  side. Well, I have a suggestion for my Republican colleagues: Vote with  us to begin debate, and then bring that proposal to the floor as an  amendment. We can debate it right here, right here on the Senate floor.   If Republicans vote no today and reject the opportunity to offer a  border amendment, then what the heck is going on? Republicans said they  want border. It is they who have injected border into the Ukraine  issue, even though the two are unrelated. And now they are getting a  golden opportunity to offer border at 60 votes. If that is not good  enough for them, then what are they doing?   Let's not forget, Mr. President, that it was the Republican leader  and others on the Republican side in the House and Senate, mainly from  the hard right, who demanded that border and Ukraine be tied together.  Well, we are willing to give them an amendment--that is what they have  asked for--and now they are spurning that offer. Why hold up Ukraine  aid if they can't even present a border package that can pass the  Senate?   We are asking ourselves this question: Has border been nothing more  than an excuse for the hard right to kill funding for Ukraine and too  many other Republican Senators, who are not part of the hard right, are  going along? I hope that is not true.   I hope Republicans vote yes and take up our offer on a border  amendment at 60 votes because we don't have much time to keep  negotiating off the floor if all we will do is go around in circles,  which is what has happened over the last 3 weeks, despite the good will  of negotiators. Democrats have spent 3 weeks in negotiation in good  faith, trying to get somewhere on the border, to no avail.   We believe we should do something on border. In fact, the President's  proposal, which is the base bill--which I am making the base bill--has  very significant border provisions in it, particularly those talking  about stopping the flow of fentanyl into this country by providing much  more help at the ports of entry. We want to reach a middle ground with  Republicans on border. It is important. But we cannot waste time on  something like H.R. 2, which every single Democrat voted against, which  could never pass the House, while the clock is ticking to get Ukraine  the help it so desperately needs.   Now, I understand that this is frustrating for some of our Republican  colleagues. I appreciate that the hard right may feel boxed in and be  feeling the pressure that they can't come up with a package that can  get only 11 Democrats if all of them vote for it. But the only way  anything on border gets done is with votes from both sides of the  aisle. That is how the Senate works.   So, again, I hope our Republican colleagues do the right thing for  our country and vote in favor of debating the supplemental. I hope they  take this free opportunity, this golden opportunity, to make a real,  serious proposal on the border--though, in reality, they can propose  whatever they want--and see if it can get the 60 votes that is always  required in this type of legislation in the Senate.   If they make a serious offer on the border and it gets 60 votes, then  the Senate will have spoken. If they cannot get 60 votes on a border  proposal, then that should not prevent us from giving Ukraine the aid  they so desperately need.   Let me repeat that again. If Republicans, who injected border into  this whole debate, now can't come up with an amendment that can pass  the Senate, they should not prevent us from giving Ukraine the aid it  so desperately needs.   The world is watching. The world is watching what the Senate does  today. You can bet, my colleagues, Vladimir Putin is watching. Hamas is  certainly watching. Iran, President Xi, North Korea--all of our  adversaries are closely watching. Let us do the right thing and move  forward today.                              AI Insight Forums    Mr. President, now, today, on our AI Insight Forums, we will continue  our work with our eighth and ninth bipartisan AI forums. The morning's  Insight Forum will begin at 10:30 a.m. and focus on long-term risks  associated with AI and how we can guard against AI doomsday scenarios.   This afternoon's Insight Forum will begin at 3 p.m. and focus on one  of the most critical and urgent areas of AI national security. We will  discuss the opportunities AI presents to bolster our national security  and the risks if we fall behind the Chinese Government. It is in the  Kennedy Caucus Room.                           Federal Trade Commission    Mr. President, finally, on the FTC investigation of Exxon, last  month, I wrote a letter, along with 20 other of my colleagues, urging  the FTC to investigate Exxon's $60 billion blockbuster merger with  Pioneer, one of the largest mergers in the energy industry in two  decades. Having the largest oil company merge with the largest oil  producer in the Permian Basin is only going to do one thing: raise  prices for the average consumer.   Well, I have good news. The FTC heeded our warning and announced  yesterday that the FTC will closely review Exxon's proposed acquisition  of Pioneer. It is welcome news for the American people because if the  merger were to proceed, it would result in higher gas prices for  families across the country. Profits for these big oil companies would  soar, fueling stock buybacks, while everyday Americans struggle to fill  up their tanks.   So this merger between Exxon and Pioneer has all the hallmarks of  harmful anti-competitive effects, and I am glad the FTC is moving  forward.  [[Page S5769]]    I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 25 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I further ask consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    I know that the Senator from Alabama wants to speak.  Could I ask the Senator from Alabama how long he wants to speak for?    Well, we want to all speak seriatim, and I thought I was  going to speak before this.    Would the Senator yield also to Senator Durbin after me;  is that all right?    Thank you.   Mr. President, I just heard, unfortunately, our Senator from Wyoming  object. Here are the facts: The scourge of gun violence in America is a  national crisis. The American people are sick and tired of enduring one  mass shooting after another. They are sick and tired of vigils and  moments of silence for family, friends, classmates, coworkers.   Today, Democrats move to pass the assault weapons ban to help rid our  streets of these deadly weapons. I want to thank my colleagues who  support this measure, particularly Senator Durbin, chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, as well as Senators Murphy and Blumenthal and  Warnock, who organized today's efforts with me.   We already have a decade's worth of proof that a ban on military- style assault works and saves lives, plain and simple. After I led the  passage of the assault weapons ban--I carried the bill in the House as  a Congressman, alongside our late colleague Senator Feinstein, who  carried it in the Senate. What happened? America saw a significant  decrease in mass shootings and in gun deaths--a decrease.   Unsurprisingly, when that ban lapsed, there was a sudden and dramatic  spike in mass shootings and deaths from those shootings. We must change  that. We still feel the unquenchable suffering of the families of Sandy  Hook, where 11 years ago next week 26 innocent lives were cut short by  an automatic weapon. I still see the pictures of those little children,  and I still remember--because I speak to them fairly recently--the  parents who have a hole in their hearts forever because some madman  with an assault weapon was able to kill 26 of them, one after the  other.   We still feel the agony of places like Buffalo, where a year-and-a- half ago a gunman murdered 10 people in cold blood at a Tops grocery  store. I was at that grocery store a few days later. I still feel their  pain. We feel the pain of Uvalde, Las Vegas, El Paso. The list sadly  goes on and on and on.   And we also take action today because of tragedies like the Long  Island Rail Road massacre that happened 30 years ago tomorrow in my own  backyard, the innocent people who lost their lives at the Maryland  train station. It was the 533 train filled with commuters heading home  from work--so many injured, six killed. My heart still sinks. And I  will never forget hearing that news, the river of blood in the aisles  of the commuter railroad train, just horrible.   By passing the assault weapons ban today, we can help save lives, get  these weapons off our streets, and prevent future tragedies. So today  Republicans face a choice, as they do every day. We want to say to our  Republican friends: Stand with families fearing for their lives or  stand with the gun lobby and block this assault weapons ban.   Just look at what happened the last time both sides worked together  on commonsense gun safety measures. We did something many believed to  be impossible. Under the leadership of Senator Murphy, Senator Durbin,  Senator  [[Page S5773]]  Blumenthal, and so many others, we passed the first major gun safety  bill in three decades. While this bill was a long-overdue step in the  right direction, we have to do a lot more.   Today, we have an opportunity to come together and pass another  lifesaving measure.   I yield to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the chair of the  Judiciary Committee.    Madam President, the question before us is simple: Will  Senators rise to defend Western democracy, protect our fundamental  values, and support our friends abroad fighting for their lives? Are we  willing to stand up to autocratic brutes and respond to our adversaries  with strength, not weakness? Will we help the people of Ukraine fight  against Vladimir Putin like we promised?   This is a moment in history. This is a moment history will record.  The answer to all these questions should be an emphatic yes. At stake  is America's safety, the survival of democracy, and the future of the  war in Ukraine. As we have always done in our history, the Senate  should rush to the defense of democracy and stand up to autocratic  brutes.   You can be sure Vladimir Putin is watching closely to see if the  Senate will approve more aid to Ukraine. Whether or not we approve an  aid package will likely sway the outcome of the war. We must act.   To show our Republican colleagues that we care about this issue  deeply and are serious about moving forward in a bipartisan way, we are  willing to give them an amendment here on the floor on any border  proposal of their choice at 60 votes. We will not interfere with  whatever policy they want to present. It is vital we move forward and  to show that we are willing to work with our Republican colleagues to  be reasonable.   This, again, is a moment of truth for the Senate, for the country,  for the fight for democracy and Western values. Again, history will  record this moment. We must rise to the occasion. We must stand with  Ukraine. We should all vote yes.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider.    Madam President, tonight is a sad night in the history  of the Senate and in our country. Republicans just blocked a very much  needed proposal to send funding for Ukraine, funding for Israel,  humanitarian aid for innocent civilians in Gaza, and funding for the  Indo-Pacific.   If there is a word for what we most need now, it is to be  ``serious.'' If Republicans in the Senate do not get serious very soon  about a national security package, Vladimir Putin is going to walk  right through Ukraine and right through Europe.   This is a historic moment for the Senate. Are we going to do  something about the threats to democracy happening around the world?  Are we going to hold the line against autocrats and dictators and the  enemies of our way of life?   We had before the Senate a proposal not only for national security  but one that included significant funding for border security that  President Biden requested.   We also made our Republican colleagues an offer to get something done  on border by allowing them to vote on an amendment on any border  package they wanted--any one they wanted, and all they would need is 11  Democratic votes.   Unfortunately, Republicans refused to move forward, even with the  offer to vote on a border amendment that would have required only 11  Democratic votes. They couldn't come up with a solution.   Nevertheless, Democrats remain committed to working very hard to find  a solution to this impasse. I understand that Republican negotiators  are preparing another package of border policies very soon, and I hope  they come up with something serious instead of the extreme policies  they presented thus far.   Democrats have always supported commonsense, realistic solutions to  the border. We wished Republicans would have taken us up on our offer  to have a debate on the floor. Our offer to the Republicans of an  amendment still stands, and we hope we can break this impasse soon.   This is a serious moment that will have lasting consequences for the  21st century. If Ukraine falls, Putin will not stop there. He will be  emboldened. President Xi will be emboldened. Our adversaries will keep  undermining us at every turn. Western democracy will begin to enter an  age of decline if we aren't willing to defend it.   This Senate, this Republican Party, must get serious.   I yield the floor.
