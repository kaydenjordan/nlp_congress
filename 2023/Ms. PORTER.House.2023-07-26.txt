 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a foundational program  that has delivered for older Americans and people with disabilities.   Since 1935, Social Security has lifted millions of families out of  poverty. It has protected seniors' retirement, helped disabled  Americans live with dignity, and provided a lifeline for families that  have lost loved ones. Over 1 million Californians rely on Social  Security.   We should build on that success, not dismantle a program that adds  zero dollars to the Federal deficit.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Social Security 2100  Act, which will safeguard this program for generations to come.   Workers pay into Social Security. They work hard and contribute to  our economy. Congress has a duty to keep this Nation's promise and  guarantee that Social Security will be there when workers and their  families need help.   On the 88th anniversary of Social Security, let's recommit ourselves  to fulfilling this responsibility.                     Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, August 5, 2023, marks the 60th anniversary  of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, a milestone that shows our  commitment to peace and safety.   The year before the treaty's signing, the world was closer to nuclear  war than ever before. By halting most nuclear tests, this agreement  cooled the arms race and demonstrated the power of diplomacy.   The anniversary of this treaty also serves as a solemn reminder that  the United States has never taken responsibility for the harms of the  67 nuclear tests that we conducted in the Marshall Islands.   With world tensions heightening once again, the ideals put forth six  decades ago in the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty remain just as  important today. I have introduced bipartisan legislation to formally  apologize for the harms we inflicted on the Marshallese people, and I  will continue to demand action as a member of the House Indo-Pacific  Task Force.   We owe it to our kids and grandkids to safeguard this planet for  future generations.                                time  1100                         Holding the FAA Accountable     Mr. Speaker, the Federal Aviation Administration is  responsible for keeping Americans safe in the air and on the ground. It  should be subject to rigorous and consistent oversight.   Our constituents deserve a Congress that does its job of holding the  FAA accountable. Too often, the FAA takes months just to respond to  congressional inquiries, much less fix these longstanding problems.   I am proud that the House adopted my bipartisan amendment requiring  the head of the FAA to testify annually before Congress so that we can  get answers about the Agency's successes and shortcomings. My amendment  also strengthens the transparency on FAA's response time for  congressional requests.   Holding Federal agencies accountable is not a partisan issue. Every  American benefits from tough, consistent, and fair oversight. I urge  the Senate to include this oversight amendment in its own FAA  legislation.                  Brain Imaging Helps Blast Exposure Victims     Mr. Speaker, our troops risk their lives to keep us safe.  In training and during combat, they can develop health conditions that  aren't immediately visible. To repay those who serve our country, we  must do all we can to identify and treat these internal injuries and  prevent them when possible.   In recent decades, we have seen a striking increase in troops with  traumatic brain injuries due to blast exposure. I have worked with  Democrats and Republicans to deliver help.   The House recently adopted a bipartisan amendment that I wrote to  gather more data on how routine brain scans can contribute to the  diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention of brain injuries.   At least one study has shown that regular brain imaging can  accelerate patients getting the care they need and put them on the path  to recovery. A more complete understanding of this technology will help  us get our servicemembers the top-notch care they deserve.                            ____________________
