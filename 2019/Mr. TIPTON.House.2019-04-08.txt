 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2030, the  Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act.   Following a historic two-decade long drought in the Southwest, I am  glad to see an effective strategy produced after years of collaboration  between the seven States involved and the Federal Government.   Demand for water has drastically increased over the years due to  population growth, but prolonged drought has diminished water supplies.  As the location of the headwaters for the river that supplies roughly  40 million people, Colorado plays an especially crucial role in the  management of our most precious resource.   This past winter brought much-needed snowpack to the region, but  there is no certainty that this trend will continue in the coming  years. It is important to have a contingency plan in place.   Ensuring the Colorado River can meet the demands of all water users  who rely on it is a shared responsibility among all of the upper and  lower  [[Page H3114]]  basin States. The drought contingency plan agreed to by the basin  States will ensure continued hydropower operations and compact  compliance.   Now each State must work to develop a plan for meeting the  obligations of the DCP. Within the State of Colorado, it will be  critical that all of the stakeholders come together to shoulder the  burden of a voluntary demand management program. The western slope  cannot carry the entire load, nor can the front range.   I would like to thank the local and State governments who have worked  on the DCP, and my colleagues in the House and the Senate for  recognizing the urgency of this issue. I am proud to cosponsor H.R.  2030, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.
