 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to, please, have  1 minute in morning business.    Mr. President, today is Sunday, and I want to remember  what Senator Byrd said on a lot of Sundays when the Senate was in  session. He didn't say this because he didn't want to work on Sunday,  but he wanted everybody to remember the significance of Sunday for some  people, particularly Christians. He always said: ``Remember the Sabbath  and keep it holy.''   Now, I want to refer to another particular Sunday. Never in the  Senate's history has the Senate convened Congress--meaning a new  Congress--on a Sunday. The Constitution mandates that Congress convene  at noon on January 3, unless the preceding Congress, by law, designates  a different day.   Of course, January 3 has fallen on a Sunday over the last 238 years,  and each time, by unanimous consent, the Congress set a new convening  day other than that Sunday. So now it appears, for the first time in  history, that Senate Democrats don't want to agree to such unanimous  consent and instead are insisting that the Senate start the 117th  Congress on Sunday.   I am not looking to get out of work. I have proven that I have  respect for attendance in the Senate. But out of respect, the Senate  usually does not have business on religious holidays observed by  members of various faiths.   So just like Senator Byrd, I also think the Lord's Day, particularly  when it is paired with the weight of starting a new Congress, deserves  reverence.   I yield.                            ____________________
