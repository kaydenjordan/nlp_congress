 Madam President, we approach the culmination of one of  the most productive stretches in recent Senate memory. It began almost  2 months ago when, in the wake of unimaginable bloodshed in Buffalo and  Uvalde, the Senate came together and passed the first gun safety law in  nearly 30 years.   A few weeks later, in the face of the damaging semiconductor  shortage, the Senate approved the largest investment in American  manufacturing and scientific research in decades.   This week, we finally told American veterans with cancer, lung  disease, and other terrible ailments that their wait for their benefits  was over by passing the PACT Act.   And a few days ago, as Russian aggression toward Ukraine continues,  we swiftly approved the accession of Sweden and Finland to the NATO  alliance, greatly strengthening that alliance in the face of Russian  aggression.   Gun safety, chips, veterans, NATO--all of this we got done in under 6  weeks. And, now, we have one more groundbreaking item left, the most  important of them all: the Inflation Reduction Act. Passing any one of  these bills in a summer would be significant. Yet we are on the verge  of getting all  [[Page S4052]]  of them done before the August State work period.   In a few hours, we will formally begin the process of passing the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 by voting on the motion to proceed. Our  meetings with the Parliamentarian have now largely concluded, and we  thank her and her staff for their hard work and diligence on such a  large bill in such a short period of time. And now that our meetings  with the Parliamentarian have largely concluded, we have a bill before  us that can win the support of all 50 Democrats.    I am happy to report to my colleagues that the bill we presented to  the Parliamentarian remains largely intact. The bill, when passed, will  meet all of our goals: fighting climate change, lowering healthcare  costs, closing tax loopholes abused by the wealthy, and reducing the  deficit.   This is a major win for the American people and a sad commentary on  the Republican Party as they actively fight provisions that lower costs  for the American family.   As the Inflation Reduction Act works its way through the floor, the  American people are going to learn an unmistakable truth about this  proposal: It was written, first and foremost, with the American people  in mind. It reduces inflation, it lowers their costs, and it fights  climate change. For seniors who have faced the indignity of rationing  medications or skipping them altogether, the Inflation Reduction Act  will lower prescription drug costs and finally cap out-of-pocket  expenses.   For families that have fallen behind on the electric bill while  trying to stay cool through a heat wave, this bill will lower energy  costs and provide the largest investment in clean energy ever in  American history. For every child deprived of clean air and a  neighborhood where they can play safely outside, away from smog and  exhaust fumes, this bill will help reverse air pollution and help clean  up communities that have endured the shadow of congested highways and  industrial sites. And, as the most significant action of climate change  ever, it will help deliver our children and grandchildren the planet  they deserve.   The Inflation Reduction Act was written with the American people in  mind: families struggling to pay the bills, kids who struggle with  asthma and pollution, seniors who can't afford lifesaving medications.  This bill is for them.   For many years, many in Washington promised to address some of the  biggest challenges facing our Nation, only to fall short. Many have  talked about the need to act on climate change, the need to hold drug  companies accountable, the need to make the Tax Code fairer. But where  previous efforts have fallen short, this Senate majority is on the  verge of succeeding.   After years of trying, we will finally empower Medicare to negotiate  the price of prescription drug costs. After years of trying, we will  finally cap out-of-pocket expenses and make vaccines free for our  seniors.   After years of trying, after years of Americans calling for action-- particularly our young people--Congress will pass the largest clean  energy package ever. We will cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030,  helping us avert the worst consequences of a warming planet. That is a  huge goal, and we are going to meet it. We will prevent nearly 4,000  deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks each year by reducing air pollution.  We will save Americans money on their utility bill by making it easier  for them to tap into clean energy and expand incentives for utility  companies to explore cleaner ways to generate power. We will make it  easier to finally usher in the era of greater solar and wind power,  battery storage, and EVs and bring manufacturing of this technology  back to America. We will restore coastlines, regenerate our forests,  shield communities everywhere from the danger of droughts and  sweltering heat waves.   Through it all, we will create more than 9 million jobs over the next  decade--good-paying union jobs--an average of nearly a million a year.  So many of those jobs, as I said, will be good-paying union jobs.   From the moment Democrats announced the Inflation Reduction Act,  Senate Republicans have fruitlessly tried every approach under the sun  to lay a glove on our bill.   First, they said our bill will make inflation worse, only to give up  on that once everyone from Larry Summers to Hank Paulson, to seven  Nobel laureates said it would do the opposite. Then they tried calling  our bill a bill of tax hikes on the middle class before changing their  minds and actually admitting that the bill contains no tax rate  increases at all for the middle class.   At every turn, they have resorted to the decades-old talking point of  calling our bill nothing but wasteful spending, conveniently ignoring  that our bill, in fact, lowers the deficit and is completely paid for.   I will grant my Republican colleagues that their task is not easy. By  one measure, over 65 percent of Americans support the policies in the  Inflation Reduction Act, and other polls reflect the same. Republicans  haven't been able to get around the fact that Americans like that we  are letting Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They  like that we will close tax loopholes that allow billion-dollar  companies to pay zero in taxes. Voices across the country, from Nobel- winning economists to former Treasury Secretaries, to even Republican  movie star ex-Governors, have all praised the Inflation Reduction Act  as an inflation-fighting, climate-saving, job-creating piece of  legislation.   At a time of seemingly impenetrable gridlock, the Inflation Reduction  Act will show the American people that when the moment demands it,  Congress is still capable of taking big steps to solve big challenges.  We will show the American people that, yes, we are capable of passing a  historic climate package and rein in drug companies and make our Tax  Code fairer. We are able to make big promises and work hard at keeping  them as well.   We know that Republicans will continue their mightiest to try to  smear our work before the bill is passed. This isn't our first time  going through the reconciliation process, and no one is going to be  surprised when the other side comes up with wild, misleading, and  wholly partisan amendments that have nothing--nothing--to do with our  bill. These efforts will not deter us. No matter how long it takes, the  Senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill.   In short, this is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching  pieces of legislation that has come before the Congress in decades. It  will help just about every citizen in this country and make America a  much better place.   We are not leaving until the job is done. The American people deserve  nothing less. So let's get to work today.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 4785, which was introduced earlier today.    I further ask that the bill be considered read three  times and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, well, first, I want to thank my dear  friend and our great leader and chair of the Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee for her positive words on this bill and her  reminder to all of us that our work is not done and particularly for  her work on one of the most urgent issues facing American families:  childcare. I don't know of a single Member of this Senate, Democrat or  Republican, who has done more to push the issue of childcare and get it  done than the senior Senator from the great State of Washington, and I  thank her for that.   I want to thank my colleagues Senator Kaine and Senator Blumenthal,  who have also been such strong leaders on this issue.   I am here to say that what they are saying--Senator Murray, Senator  Blumenthal, Senator Kaine--is right. We need to do something in this  country to lower childcare costs and increase its availability. I  pledge to my colleagues and to the American people that I will keep  working with Senator Murray until we get something done to increase  access to high-quality childcare for working families.   We all know that, today, families pay more for childcare than at any  point in American history. Amazingly, sometimes families have to pay  more for childcare than they would pay for a mortgage. It is out of  reach.   Some people forget how the world has changed. When I was a kid, my  dad had this little junky exterminating business. My mom was what was  then called a housewife. I got home from school every day at 3 o'clock,  and there was Mom with milk and cookies, asking me what homework I  had--oh, I don't have any homework, Mom--and telling me what time I had  to come back home from going out and playing in the schoolyard for  dinner.   That doesn't happen anymore. The vast majority of families in America  are either single parent or two parents,  [[Page S4061]]  both working. The percentage that have two parents, only one working,  is minimal. So childcare is now a necessity. It is a necessity for  families.   The anguish people go through to try to find childcare, and then when  it is not available or something happens, what are they going to do?  They are both working and scrambling. Who is going to watch the kids?  It is agony. It is not this kind of agony that comes, you know, God  forbid, once in a lifetime when you get a serious illness, but it is  real agony and anxiety. We have to do something.   There is another reason we have to do something: our economy. You  read all of the economic experts. We are short of labor. We are short  of labor. You go to any business--small, medium, big--they are short of  labor.   Probably the No. 1 or No. 2 reason in the whole country we are short  of labor is we don't have adequate childcare. Moms or dads don't want  to go to work because they don't know who is going to take care of the  kids. Moms or dads stay home or retire or whatever. So our economy  desperately needs this. When parents can't enter the workforce-- particularly women--our country suffers as an economy, and productivity  is greatly diminished.   Of course, there are other issues to deal with in this economy as  well that are related. Home- and community-based services. People need  a roof over their heads. We need to support families through paid  leave. We need to make sure that every child in this country has a  chance to grow and reach their potential, not in poverty. All of these  issues are important. Childcare is so important--so important.   So I want to first thank again Senator Murray for her words. I want  to thank my colleagues. Two of our leaders on this issue, Senators  Kaine and Blumenthal, are here today.   We want to pledge to the American people that we are going to keep  working until we get something done in childcare, and we will keep  fighting for all these issues to expand opportunity for all Americans.  It is so, so vital to the future of our country and to the well-being  of families across the Nation.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in a moment, I will move to proceed to  the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The time has come for the Senate  to begin debate on this historic piece of legislation.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a groundbreaking bill for the American  people--for families struggling to pay the bills, for seniors  struggling to pay for medication, for kids struggling with asthma. This  bill is for them.   I thank all of my colleagues who have dedicated their blood, sweat,  and tears toward shaping this outstanding legislation.   This is one of the most comprehensive and impactful bills Congress  has seen in decades. It will reduce inflation, it will lower  prescription drug costs, it will fight climate change, it will close  tax loopholes, and it will reduce--reduce--the deficit. It will help  every citizen in this country and make America a much better place.   The time is now to move forward with a big, bold package for the  American people; to fight inflation and make it easier for people to  afford everything from trips to the doctor's office to trips to the  pharmacy; to hold drug companies accountable and empower Medicare to  negotiate the cost of prescription drugs; to help families pay their  utilities with the boldest clean energy package in American history; to  make sure that nurses and teachers and firefighters and middle-class  families don't pay more in taxes than billion-dollar corporations; to  reduce pollution, restore our coastlines, protect our forests, and  deliver to our children and grandchildren the planet they deserve.   Again, the time is now to move forward with a big, bold package for  the American people.   Again, this historic bill--this historic bill--will reduce inflation,  lower costs, and fight climate change. It is time to move this Nation  forward.   Senate Democrats began this majority by promising to tackle the  biggest challenges facing our country. The Inflation Reduction Act will  make good on that promise and serve as the capstone to one of the most  productive stretches the Senate has seen in a very long time. And in  the end, it will be the American people who benefit from the work we do  here and now.                              Motion to Proceed    So I move to proceed to Calendar No. 464, H.R. 5376.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I call up amendment No. 5194, as  modified, with the changes at the desk, and I ask that it be reported  by number.    Madam President, I know of no further amendments to the  substitute.   The VICE PRESIDENT. If there are no further amendments, the question  is on agreeing to the substitute, as amended.   The amendment (No. 5194), as amended, was agreed to.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will read the title of the bill for the  third time.   The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a  third time.   The bill was read the third time.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.    Madam President, it has been a long, tough, and winding  road, but at last--at last--we have arrived.   I know it has been a long day and a long night, but we have gotten it  done. Today, after more than a year of hard work, the Senate is making  history.   I am confident the Inflation Reduction Act will endure as one of the  defining legislative feats of the 21st century.   Our bill reduces inflation, lowers costs, creates millions of good- paying jobs, and is the boldest climate package in U.S. history.   This bill will kick start the era of affordable clean energy in  America. It is a game changer. It is a turning point, and it has been a  long time in coming.   To Americans who have lost faith that Congress can do big things,  this bill is for you. To seniors who face the indignity of rationing  medications or skipping them altogether, this bill is for you. And to  the tens of millions of young Americans who have spent years marching,  rallying, demanding that Congress act on climate change, this bill is  for you.   The time has come to pass this historic bill.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have got to compose myself a little  here. Every Senator knows an undeniable truth: We can never do what we  do without our amazing, incredible staff. They work behind the scenes;  they never fall under the spotlight. But they do incredible work,  nonetheless.   Now that we finished passing the Inflation Reduction Act, I want to  applaud all of the staffers--we already applauded them, but that is  good--who made this possible. The hundreds of staffers who served in  Senate offices across the various committees. I want to thank every  single one of them for their remarkable work in passing the Inflation  Reduction Act.   I will submit their names into the Record to honor their achievements  and preserve forever the role they played in bringing this bill to  life. And I ask unanimous consent to have the names of all of the  committee staff who contributed printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Senate Committee Staff Who Contributed to the Passage of the Inflation                  Reduction Act of 2022--August 7th, 2022                             Committee on Finance         Bobby Andres, Chris Arneson, Shawn Bishop, Adam Carasso,       Ryan Carey, Ursula  [[Page S4202]]       Clausing, Drew Crouch, Michael de la Guardia, Liz Dervan,       Jack Dolgin, Eva DuGoff, Mary Ellis, Grace Enda, Mike Evans,       Peter Fise, Jon Goldman, Taylor Harvey, Josh Heath, Melanie       Jonas, Anna Kaltenboeck.

Madam President, to the floor staff, particularly the  Parliamentarian, who worked so hard under not easy conditions. And  especially because we had to do so much in such a short period of time,  we thank you so.   The clerks, the doorkeepers, the reporters--thank you.   Thank you to the pages who worked over time to help us in this  historic endeavor. You will tell your grandchildren you were here. You  were here.   Thank you to the cafeteria workers, custodial staff, and Capitol  Police. The Senate can't function without all of you. And I thank the  Office of Legislative Counsel, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the  Congressional Budget Office. And, of course, I cannot forget my own  staff--the best staff ever on Capitol Hill--and my Members know it. The  Members know how good my staff is. I am so dedicated to them, the best  in the business. Of course, every Senator thinks their staff is the  best on Capitol Hill; but in my case, it happens to be true.   To Mike Lynch, who has been with me all these years and is so strong  and steadfast and steady; to his deputy chief and my deputy chief Erin  Sager Vaughn, another person who has been here a very long time and is  just amazing. We praise her for her EQ, among other talents. She told  me that.   To Martin Brennan, another like Mike Lynch--Mike Lynch and Martin  Brennan have been with me just about since I started to be a Senator,  and they are just such rocks in our office--incredible. Probably the  team of husband and wife who have done more to save the Earth this year  than just about anybody else is Gerry Petrella and Meghan Taira. They  met and got married on my staff. They have a beautiful little boy,  George. And when you have two people so important as policy director  and legislative director and a little child at home, it is tough. But  they managed to be great parents at the same time as being great and  amazing staffers. And they are brilliant. They are just brilliant.   My executive team is world class: Emily Sweda, Kellie Karney, Abby  Kaluza, and Raisa Shah--who just left a few weeks ago; an amazing press  team, Justin Goodman, Alex Nguyen--nicknamed ``Win,'' of course--Monica  Lee, Alice Nam, Ken Meyer, Cyre Velez, Jasmine Harris, Jonathan  Uriarte, Natalia Cardenas, and everyone on the digital team, the Senate  Media Center who worked day and night, to record, edit, finalize  photos, graphics and videos of every sort. They are a blessing.   And I want to recognize my press staff up in New York. They are just  incredible. Amazing. I am just so blessed: Angelo Roefaro, Ally  Biasotti, Paige Tepke; my speechwriter, Tony Rivera; my rapid response  director, Dan Yoken; the amazing team of researchers: Hanna Talley,  Thaha Sherwani, Mikael Tessema. And to our talented press assistants,  thank you so much: Gabriel Avalos, Gracie Kanigher, Riya Vashi, and  Sidney Johnson.   Two people who do an amazing job reaching out to the community:  Cietta Kiandoli and Julietta Lopez--incredible. They talk to all the  groups and make them feel part of what we are doing and they know what  we are doing. It is so wonderful, the job they do. And a brilliant  legislative team--brilliant. ``Brilliant'' is an overused word, but it  is not overused in the case of my staff. The ideas they come up with,  the way they manage to get everything done. It is amazing.   So there is Adrian Deveny and Tim Ryder, Matt Fuentes, Dili--it is a  hard, long last name. I always call him Dili. I'm glad it is just Dili.  It is Sundaramoorthy. How did I--Where is he? Oh, he is not here to  correct me. Good.   Anna Taylor. Anna Taylor is so damn dedicated. She had a baby 2 days  ago, and she is still on the phone talking. And I said: Anna, stop.   No, no, no. She was so dedicated and put so much time into this that  she kept working. And her little beautiful child, Posey. We heard her  crying happily in the background as we were moving through all of this.  Jon Cardinal--an amazing guy who worked so hard on this and on CHIP  fab--Reggie Babin on counsel, Rob Hickman, Annie Daly, Ramon Carranza,  Catalina Tam, Sam Rodarte, Jillian McGrath, Justine Revelle, Ryan  Eagan, Didier Barjon, Grace Magaletta, Bre Sonnier-Thompson, Vandan  Patel, Leela Najafi, Leeann Sinpatanaskul, Jeff Dickson, Mike Kuiken,  Lane Bodian, Reza Zomorrodian, Yazeed Abdelhaq, Beth Vrabel, Kai Vogel,  Josh Gutmaker, and Gunnar Haberl.   And the floor staff--you know, there are certain people you say: We  couldn't have done it without you, and a bunch of the names I have  mentioned fall in the ``couldn't have done it without you'' category.  But we all know that just the wisdom and the knowledge and the history  that is in his bones and brain just make him indispensable, and that is  Gary Myrick.   Is he here? He is very modest. So I am going to make him mad. We  should all applaud him. He hates it.   (Cheers and applause.)   And, of course, Tricia Engle, his great deputy, and the wonderful  team on the floor and in the cloakroom: Stephanie Paone, Rachel  Jackson, Nate Oursler, Daniel Tinsley, Brad Watt, Jacky Usyk, Maalik  Simmons, and Miriam Wheatley.   And, of course, my tech and IT team, what a great bunch. And for  someone who is not very tech-oriented, his team is indispensable, too:  Scott Rodman, Hemen Mehta, Jon Housley, and Amy Mannering.  [[Page S4203]]    And more staffers who work here every day in Washington--and we  didn't name a lot of my staff in New York. I will just throw in the  name of Steve Mann, who has been our deputy director since I started in  the Senate and does a wonderful job. They all do, but I just wanted to  mention him. And we commiserate with Mike Lynch over the Yankees, who  are losing a lot of games these days.   Today, as I conclude, I ask unanimous consent to have the names of my  entire staff printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Leader Schumer Senate Staff, August 2022         Abdelhaq, Yazeed, Legislative Correspondent; Ahiable,       Immanuel, Graphic Designer; Aguilar, Joseph, Digital       Communications Assistant; Allbrooks, Joshua, Community       Outreach Assistant; Armwood, Garrett, Deputy State Director;       Ashraf, Azmain, Digital Organizing Assistant; Avalos,       Gabriel, Press Assistant; Babin, Reggie, Chief Counsel;       Banez, Robert, Photographer; Barjon, Didier, Legislative       Assistant; Barton, Steve, Director of Intergovernmental       Relations; Battle, Sharon, Mailroom Assistant; Benavides,       Jackie, Deputy Immigration Director/Community; Outreach;       Biasotti, Allison, Senior Press Secretary; Bodian, Lane,       Legislative Assistant; Bowman, Quinn, Director of the SDMC;       Brennan, Martin, State Director; Brutus, Gerdine, Staff       Assistant; Cardinal, Jon, Director of Economic Development;       Cardenas, Natalia, Deputy Director of Hispanic Media.

Madam President, I want them to know how much I  appreciate their work, how great a difference they have made. This bill  is going to change America for decades, and you did it. Wherever you  go, whatever you do, you should never forget how much you have helped  make the world and the globe a better place--never forget it.   So, to every single staffer on my team, to staffers in other offices,  committees here on the floor: Thank you, thank you, thank you, very,  very much.   I yield the floor because Mr. Padilla has some important words about  a New Yorker.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 985.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 736.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, August 7,  be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Carrin F. Patman, of Texas, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of  Iceland; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of the Senate, the President  of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the majority and minority  leaders be authorized to make appointments to commissions, committees,  boards, conferences, or interparliamentary conferences authorized by  law, by concurrent action of the two Houses, or by order of the Senate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then  convene for pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted,  on the following dates and times and that following each pro forma  session, the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Tuesday,  August 9, at 9 a.m.; Friday, August 12, at 9 a.m.; Tuesday, August 16,  at 8 a.m.; Friday, August 19, at 2:30 p.m.; Tuesday, August 23, at  10:30 a.m.; Friday, August 26, at 10 a.m.; Tuesday, August 30, at 10  a.m.; Friday, September 2, at 9 a.m. I further ask that when the Senate  adjourns on Friday, September 2, it next convene at 3 p.m., Tuesday,  September 6; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Lee nomination; further, that the cloture motions  filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September  6.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior  Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin, be authorized to sign duly enrolled  bills or joint resolutions from August 8, 2022, through September 6,  2022.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the provisions  of S. Res. 748.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:42 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, August 9, 2022, at 9 a.m., under the previous order and,  pursuant to S. Res. 748, as a further mark of respect to the late  Jackie Walorski, former Representative from Indiana.                            ____________________
