 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  public school in my district, less than 1 mile from my house, Wiley  Elementary School.   For the second time in 5 years, Wiley has been named a top magnet  elementary school in the Nation for its dedication to excellence.   It is both an international magnet and a true neighborhood school. A  diverse and welcoming community, Wiley's teachers, faculty, parents,  and staff go above and beyond to ensure that every student receives the  best education possible.   Wiley offers the International Studies Magnet Program, which allows  students to take as many as eight electives, including five foreign  languages, in elementary school. Through this program, students are  able to learn about cultures other than their own and experience  diverse perspectives.   I believe the foundation to a quality education begins in elementary  school, and I know that Wiley is setting students up for success.   I am honored to represent Wiley Elementary School in Congress, and I  am awed by all that their children achieve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, debt collectors often operate with impunity,  threatening servicepeople, denying small business owners due process,  and harassing customers and homeowners with repeated calls, texts, and  emails.   Harassment by debt collectors negatively affects students' career  decisions, small business growth, homeownership, and families'  financial stability. It hurts the economy and amplifies racial, gender,  and socioeconomic inequities across the Nation.   For example, rates of student loan distress are especially  concentrated among low-income borrowers, borrowers in rural areas, and  borrowers of color. Debt collectors incessantly contacting borrowers  without consent adds another layer of loan distress, particularly  during this pandemic.   This is why I introduced an amendment to this bill that requires a  GAO investigation of communications by debt collectors, including  specific recommendations for Congress to reduce the harassment and  abuse of individuals with debt.   The Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act is critical to  protecting students, servicemembers, small business owners, and  consumers with debt from predatory practices.   I urge my colleagues to support this entire legislation. It is  important for the dignity of the average borrower in this country.
