 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  200th anniversary of my home, Oakland County, MI. Established March 28,  1820, and situated just north of Detroit in southeastern Michigan,  Oakland County has, over the past 200 years, transformed from a small  rural settlement to a thriving economic hub.   On January 11, 1805, Congress established the Michigan Territory, but  nearly a decade later the area remained largely unsettled due to the  reputation that it was too wild, even for the heartiest of pioneers.  The territory began to modernize and attract settlers under the strong  leadership of Governor Lewis Cass, appointed in 1813 by President James  Madison as a reward for his military service in the War of 1812. Avon  Township, now Rochester and Rochester Hills, became the first area  settled in Oakland County thanks to a settlers from New England, New  York, and southern Canada. Governor Cass requested the remaining  territory carefully surveyed, which revealed a bounty of fertile land  ripe for settlement in the area now known as Pontiac. Therefore, on  March 28, 1820, Cass established Oakland County and designated the  central city of Pontiac--no more than a day's journey from any point in  the county--as county seat. In this newly established seat, Cass  allocated land to erect a courthouse, jail, cemetery, market,  schoolhouse, and several churches. At this time, Oakland County had a  population of 330.   It is crucial to recognize the inhabitation and development of the  land prior to the arrival of European settlers. Native Americans from  the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi Tribes, collectively known as the  Anishinaabe, occupied the region for thousands of years prior. Early  European explorers to Michigan recorded the Anishinaabe development of  the land, noting their key paths and roadways. When forming the county,  settlers continued to use and build upon these thoroughfares, many of  which still exist to this day. The Shiawassee Trail is now Shiawassee  Street in Farmington; Saginaw Trail is part of Dixie Highway; and Grand  River Trail is now US 16. The Anishinaabe indisputably shaped the  current landscape of Oakland County and its trade and travel routes.   Today, 200 years since Governor Cass established Oakland County, I  recognize its transformation from a rural community to the home of 62  cities, townships, and villages, 11 colleges and universities, and a  center for industrial and technological development. The economy  employs over 650,000 workers, with the largest industries being  manufacturing, healthcare and social assistance, and professional,  scientific, and technical services. In addition to its robust private  sector, Oakland County is  [[Page S2450]]  the base for over 11,000 nonprofit organizations. But what truly makes  Oakland County unique are the parks, museums, beaches, downtowns, and  theaters enjoyed by the diverse population of residents from all  backgrounds, faiths, and identities.   As a fifth-generation Michigander living in Oakland County, I am  honored to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the rich history  of the region as well as this significant milestone. I wish Oakland  County continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
