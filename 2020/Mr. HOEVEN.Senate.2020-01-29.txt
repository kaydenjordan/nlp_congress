 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The President's counsel has 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you,  Senator, for the question.   The question asks about what Ambassador Bolton meant in a comment  that is purported hearsay by someone else saying what he supposedly  said. But what we know is that there are conflicting accounts of the  July 10 meeting at the White House.   Dr. Hill says that she heard Ambassador Sondland say one thing. He  denies that he said that. Dr. Hill says she  [[Page S671]]  went and talked to Ambassador Bolton, and Bolton said something to her  about what was said in the meeting where he wasn't there, and he was  saying something about it, calling it a drug deal.   And what he meant by that--I am not going to speculate about it. It  is a hearsay report of something he said about a meeting that he wasn't  in, characterized in some way, and I am not going to speculate about  what he meant by that.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from North Dakota.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have a question for  myself and also for Senator Portman and Senator Boozman. It is for the  President's counsel, and I am sending it to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from the Senators is as follows:         In September of 2019, the security assistance aid was       released to Ukraine. Yet, the House managers continue to       argue that President Trump conditioned the aid on an       investigation of the Bidens. Did the Ukrainian President or       his government ultimately meet any of the alleged       requirements in order to receive the aid?    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice.   Thanks, Senator, for the question. The very short answer is no. I  think that is fair. I think we demonstrated in our presentation on  Friday and Monday that the aid was released. The aid flowed. There was  a meeting at the U.N. General Assembly. There was a meeting previously  scheduled in Warsaw, precisely as President Zelensky suggested, and  there was never any announcement of any investigations undertaken  regarding the Bidens, Burisma, the 2016 election, no statements made,  and no investigations announced or begun by the Ukrainian Government.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Virginia.
