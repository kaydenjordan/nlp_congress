 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the last 12 months, the economy has  rebounded at levels that we have not seen in decades--a 5.7-percent GDP  growth rate and 6.6 million new jobs. This is the fastest our economy  has grown since, perhaps, 1984, and the new jobs we added to the  economy were the most ever for a President's first year.   After former President Trump botched our national response to COVID,  America is now on the right track under President Biden, but we face  serious challenges that demand action from Congress. The cost of living  has come up for families across the country and around the world. The  destruction unleashed by COVID has decimated supply chains, strained  the labor supply, and the effects of a global pandemic that began 2  years ago still reverberate today. These challenges demand action, and  Democrats remain laser-focused on lowering costs for American families.   Yesterday, our caucus met for our weekly lunch, where we held a  spirited, enthusiastic discussion about ideas from our Members of how  we can lower costs and take action to do so. We talked about how we can  continue working to lower childcare costs, prescription drug costs, the  costs of semiconductors, which is a huge driver of price increases  across a wide variety of products, and things as basic and vital as the  cost of food and meat.   Lowering costs will continue to be a caucuswide effort. We are not  going to agree on everything, but we are all on the same page in that  we need to tackle the issue head on.   That is the difference between Democrats and Republicans. Rising  costs, of course, impact all of us, whether we come from blue or red  States, but Democrats are the ones laser-focused on showing where we  stand and in offering solutions that aim squarely at the problem.  Republicans seem to have no solutions, just rhetoric. The other side,  sadly, seems, oftentimes, motivated by something else. Rather than  working with us in a bipartisan spirit, our Republican colleagues seem  more comfortable giving speeches that go on and on about rising costs  without offering any solutions. Complaining about the problem doesn't  make inflation better--proposing solutions does--and that is precisely  what Democrats will continue focusing on.   Over the next month and beyond, Members from our side will continue  offering a number of solutions--solutions--that will lower costs and  leave more money in people's pockets. We need to help working families  build wealth after the pandemic. We need to lower the costs of  medications like insulin, which can still reach $600 a month. We need  to relieve our strained supply chains and increase domestic  manufacturing on things like chips--and on that front, I am hopeful  that we can take bipartisan action soon.   Our Republican colleagues, we hope, will join us in these efforts.  Our Members would welcome it.   We have come a long way from the start of COVID, but we still have  more to do. Democrats' goals are to make sure that the job creation and  wage increases of last year carry into this year. We are going to keep  working on that this spring, and I hope to see our colleagues from the  other side work with us to improve the lives of the American people. If  we can keep wages growing and get costs down, the average American will  have more money in his or her pocket to live a better life.    Madam President, I thank the majority whip.   Thank you for your good work as chair of the Judiciary and for your  talk on this issue.   I thank my colleague from Minnesota, who has been passionate about  getting this done as well.   I rise today to join with my Democratic colleagues in support of  these U.S. attorneys and marshals who have singlehandedly been delayed  for weeks by one Senator, the junior Senator from Arkansas.   For decades--decades--Democrats and Republicans have regularly  cooperated to swiftly confirm the many, many individuals selected by  each President to serve in their administration. Regardless of the  party in the White House, both sides have long agreed that a President  deserves to have his or her administration in place  [[Page S740]]  quickly. That doesn't mean we don't disagree, but it does mean that  when nominees are held up, opposed, or blocked, it is for a legitimate  purpose, not for leverage and partisan games to score political points  at the expense of public safety. Most of us still believe in that  principle but, sadly, not all of us.   On the other side of the aisle, a small group of obstructionist  Republicans has spent the last year hijacking the rules of the Senate  to place an unprecedented number of holds on hundreds--hundreds--of  Presidential appointees.   Let me repeat. This isn't about a few nominees here and there; we are  talking about hundreds of nominees.   In this case, my colleague from Arkansas is holding back six U.S.  attorneys and two U.S. marshals--vital roles in preserving public  safety. The level of partisan obstruction is a new low for the Senate.   When President Trump was in office, every single U.S. attorney and  U.S. marshal--every single one--was confirmed by this Chamber with  unanimous consent. Yes, we had deep, deep problems with the Trump  Department of Justice, but never did we demand a rollcall vote just to  confirm nominees like these. In fact, the last time the Senate had to  hold a rollcall vote--listen to this--the last time the Senate had to  hold a rollcall vote to confirm a U.S. attorney was a half a century  ago--nearly half a century ago--in 1975, and it is not hard to see why.  U.S. attorneys and marshals aren't political positions. Their job is  literally to keep Americans safe. They are Federal prosecutors, and  they are Federal law enforcement.   If my Republican colleagues on the other side truly care about public  safety, why are they obstructing the appointments of individuals whose  jobs would precisely be to maintain public safety in the first place?  It is ``Alice in Wonderland'' logic.   Now, this isn't just about breaking precedent. Right now, communities  across the country still don't have their U.S. attorneys on the job  because of obstruction here in the Senate. Districts in Georgia, Ohio,  Nevada, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois are all still waiting for  U.S. attorneys.   Sadly, the families who live in these communities shouldn't have to  pay the price for what a very small number of Republicans are doing  here, but, sadly, that is what is happening. It is a textbook example  of why Americans are frustrated with the Senate and are frustrated with  their government.   On the other hand, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for  advocating on behalf of the U.S. attorneys and marshals. I thank my  friend Senator Durbin, chairman of the Judiciary, for speaking  passionately. I thank Senator Klobuchar for coming to the floor to  speak. I thank Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto and Duckworth and Brown,  who have also spoken.   One way or another, these nominees will be confirmed by the Senate.  Republican obstructionists can try to delay, but they cannot stop these  individuals from ultimately going through.   If the holds on these nominees are not dropped, I will be filing  cloture on them, and we will schedule votes to advance them until the  job is finished. If that means more late nights, then more late nights  are coming. If it means vote series with six or seven or eight votes in  a row, then that is what we will do.   Most of us don't want to go down that road, and we don't have to. The  overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans want to preserve the  decades of precedent and comity that has enabled us to work together on  nominees.   So let me say for one last time, delaying the appointment of U.S.  attorneys and U.S. marshals over cheap partisan games ultimately makes  Americans less safe and weakens law enforcement.   I urge my Republican colleague to drop his obstruction or else he can  explain to his colleagues why we have to schedule a dizzyingly large  number of rollcall votes just to push these nominees through.   I thank my colleagues for their work and yield to Senator Durbin.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30  a.m., on Thursday, February 17; that following the prayer and the  pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings  be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the  motion to proceed to Calendar No. 267, H.R. 6617, the continuing  resolution; that at 1 p.m., the cloture motion ripen.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:20 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, February 17, 2022, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
