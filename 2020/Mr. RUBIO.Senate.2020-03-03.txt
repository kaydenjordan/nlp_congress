 Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit, which  drives our economy. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Prestige  Ameritech of North Richland Hills, TX, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   When Kimberly-Clark Corporation closed its medical protective gear  manufacturing facilities in the United States, Dan Reese and Mike Bowen  sought to revitalize this critical industry. Since 2006, Dan and Mike  have led Prestige Ameritech, which specializes in manufacturing high- quality medical protective gear. During the HlNl swine flu epidemic in  2009, Prestige Ameritech worked around the clock to produce critical  protective equipment, including N95 respirators, medical face shields,  and medical goggles. As the epidemic subsided, Prestige Ameritech  struggled as its clients returned to foreign products instead of  continuing to support this vital industry. Dozens of workers were laid  off as the company fought to survive.   Now, 14 years later, Prestige Ameritech is the largest domestic  surgical mask manufacturer, employing about 100 workers. They are  certified as an FDA Registered Facility, HUBZone, and a certified  Native American Owned Business. As a leading advocate of medical supply  chain security, Prestige Ameritech supports development of the medical  industrial sector in the United States. According to the Department of  Health and Human Services, more than 90 percent of surgical masks sold  in the United States are manufactured overseas. If a public health  emergency arose, Dan and Mike have warned, disruptions in mask supply  could endanger millions of Americans.   For over a decade, since the HlNl swine flu epidemic, Prestige  Ameritech has strengthened industry partnerships and warned government  officials of the dangers of exporting our medical industrial capacity.  As part of the Secure Mask Supply Association--SMSA--Prestige Ameritech  works with domestically owned and operated surgical and respirator mask  manufacturers to raise awareness regarding the importance of prevention  and readiness by creating and maintaining an infrastructure for an  American-made mask supply. For years, Prestige Ameritech and SMSA  sounded the alarm about the vulnerability of American medical supply  chains.   In response to the growing coronavirus outbreak, Prestige Ameritech  has ramped up their daily production to 600,000 masks. Their work  provides protection for millions worldwide, from healthcare workers to  American citizens abroad. Due to increased demand, they have  prioritized supplying hospitals and medical installations with personal  protective equipment. The disruption of American medical supply chains  has catapulted Prestige Ameritech into the spotlight, highlighting the  vital importance of their work. They have been profiled in national  news outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wired, and  CNN. Through this surge in interest, Prestige Ameritech has remained  committed to their mission, driving home the need for a resurgence of  domestic industrial medial suppliers.   Recognizing their foresight, knowledge, and courage, I am proud to  congratulate Dan, Mike, and the entire Prestige Ameritech team for  being named as the Senate Small Business of the Week. I look forward to  watching your continued growth, advocacy, and leadership in this  critical segment of our industrial sector.                            ____________________
