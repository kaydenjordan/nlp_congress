 Mr. Speaker, my constituent Patty never  had to worry about health care. Her husband had insurance through his  job. But last year, Patty's husband passed away suddenly. Overnight,  Patty found herself without health coverage for herself and her 20- year-old son, who had a preexisting condition.   Even though she was grieving over the sudden loss of her husband,  Patty couldn't afford COBRA and had less than a month to find health  care for her family. Thank goodness she was able to get coverage  through the ACA.   Under TrumpCare, Patty could have her life upended all over again.  Patty is 62 years old, and TrumpCare would cause premiums for people  over 60 to increase by more than $6,000 a year, making insurance  unaffordable. And under the age tax created in this bill, insurance  companies could charge Patty five times as much as a young person. She  could see skyrocketing costs for her hypertension and doctor's visits.   TrumpCare is a bad deal for Americans like Patty.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote a resounding ``no'' to this  downright cruel bill.
