 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse) for the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke yesterday about the big-picture numbers behind  this cruel bill, how it would cut the SNAP benefits that families rely  on to buy groceries by over $20 billion. That includes slashing  benefits for vulnerable adults like veterans, the chronically homeless,  and teenagers aging out of foster care by $9.2 billion.   There is a provision in this bill that would rip benefits away from  nearly 1 million people, mostly from working  [[Page H4152]]  families with kids, by eliminating an important State flexibility  option called categorical eligibility.   The bill even included a provision that would have constructed  barriers to accessing SNAP for those with disabilities who have out-of- pocket utility costs--that is, until Democrats shamed the majority into  abandoning it as part of their manager's amendment unveiled late last  night.   But get this: this fix didn't come without a cost, Mr. Speaker.  Tucked into the manager's package--which was, yet again, written in  secret--is a provision that will kick over 600,000 vulnerable adults  off of SNAP in the first 2 years after enactment of this bill--2 years  before their misguided work bureaucracy goes into effect. Six hundred  thousand vulnerable men and women will lose their benefits before they  even have the opportunity to take advantage of the majority's new make- work program.   Really? What are you thinking?   This entire bill is an embarrassment, and this manager's amendment  only makes it worse. It should be scrapped and sent back to the  Agriculture Committee, where we can have real bipartisan negotiations  and craft a bill that actually helps people, because despite some  changes around the margins, the Republican farm bill remains an  unmitigated disaster.                                time  1230    Today I want to zoom in on that big picture and give telling examples  of how this disastrous Republican bill would impact real people in  their everyday lives, because that is what is at stake with the  Republican farm bill. That is what we need to be focussed on, because  it goes well beyond the numbers on a page.   McClatchy reported a story earlier this month that put it succinctly,  entitled: ``50-Something Food Stamp Recipients Could Face Tough Job  Search Under Proposed Rules.''   Take, for example, a woman named Sabrina, who was quoted in the  story. She works side jobs, like cleaning houses and doing yard work,  but has a difficult time finding steady employment at her age of 59.  This bill will take away her benefits, because she may not meet its 20- hour-per-week requirement. She is working. She is exactly the kind of  person my Republican friends say they want to support. Do they think  she purposely found jobs that pay so little and have so few hours? That  doesn't fit so nicely into the majority's press releases, but that is  the reality.   Or take, for example, Thomas, a single dad who lost his wife a few  years ago and is raising his preteen daughter on his own. He has worked  diligently to find stable employment, but jobs are scarce in his  community. Without SNAP and reduced-price school meals, Thomas said he  and his daughter ``would not be able to survive.''   These are the kind of people my Republican colleagues are demonizing  during this debate, and it is deeply frustrating.   Or take Lisa, a working mother of four kids earning about $14 per  hour as a nursing assistant. Lisa has to stretch her monthly income to  cover rent and utilities after-school care, clothing, and car costs so  that she can get to her job. Currently, she receives a modest SNAP  benefit to feed her family and her kids receive free school meals, but  because her income is just over the 130 percent threshold for a family  of five, she would automatically lose her SNAP benefits if this bill  becomes law.   For Lisa, SNAP makes an incredible difference in her ability to feed  her children.   Or take Elton, a U.S. Navy veteran who lost his benefits for 2 years  because of the strict work requirements and time limits that are  already part of the SNAP law. During the 2-year period he was unable to  access SNAP benefits, Elton was hungry every day wondering what he  could eat in order to get by.   It wasn't that Elton chose not to work. He worked physically  demanding jobs his entire life, but he lost his job after an injury. He  continues to struggle with health conditions and doesn't have reliable  access to transportation; issues that are exacerbating his job search.  Under this bill, Elton may lose his modest food benefits entirely.   These are real people, and if the majority on the Agriculture  Committee actually took the time and did a hearing on the heartless  nutrition title in this bill, they would have heard these and many  other real-life stories.   Take a moment to think about what you are doing here. My Republican  colleagues are denying food benefits to veterans, single dads  struggling to find work, and working moms. Why? Because Paul Ryan asked  you to? Because of a myth that people aren't struggling? It is  sickening.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is just legislation by sound bite; bad  legislation. It demonizes the poor and trades in stereotypes,  apparently just to help some in the majority with their next hit on FOX  News.   This bill has real consequences. It will hurt real people, our  constituents, yours and mine, in every single congressional district in  this country.   Now, it is obvious that this isn't a serious attempt at legislating,  because the process here was atrocious. The majority ignored the  recommendations from Democratic and Republican witnesses during the  Agriculture Committee's 23 hearings on SNAP. Controversial provisions  were inserted into this bill without explanation on where they came  from. I asked. I still can't find out. Democrats were left in the dark  as this legislation was drafted, we were left to read about it in news  reports; a total affront to the bipartisan tradition that has defined  the farm bill for years.   Now, the majority may be calling this a farm bill, but it is really a  total transformation of our social safety net. It is a farm bill that  doesn't even improve the farm economy. Let me state, our farmers work  hard, they should be valued, and they certainly deserve a hell of a lot  better than what is contained in this bill.   If Republicans want to hurt our workers and denigrate the poor, they  are going to have to do it alone, because, make no mistake about it,  that is what this bill is designed to do and that is what it will do  unless the responsible adults in the Republican Party join us in  defeating it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the gentleman from Washington, is  leaving, I would just urge him to read the bill, because if he did, he  would realize that if this bill were to become law, there are 60,000  people in his home State of Washington who would lose SNAP benefits  just due to categorical eligibility changes alone; more would lose  their benefits, but just for this one tweak in this bill.   The majority of the people who would lose their benefits under  categorical eligibility changes are working families, working families  with kids. Children, Mr. Speaker, will lose their SNAP benefits and  many of them will lose access to free school meals.   So, again, for all the talk on the other side about how this bill is  somehow a good bill for families, read the bill. It is a pretty cruel  bill for working families and for children.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask that we defeat the previous question,  and if so, I will offer an amendment ensuring that before the  legislation can take effect, the President must certify to Congress  that none of the administration's recent trade and tariff actions and  negotiations will harm U.S. farmers, ranchers, and other agriculture  producers.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), a member of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  for reminding us that there were 51 amendments made in order, but he  forgot to mention that 54 were blocked.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson), who is a member of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maine coming here and  giving a speech to the cameras, but I would suggest he read the bill.  When he says that nobody will lose their benefits, no benefits will be  cut from SNAP, he is wrong. The bottom line is that benefits will be  cut. Benefits will be cut to support an underfunded, unproven,  ridiculous excuse for a workforce and training program.   I also should say I hope nobody wants to emulate the State of Maine  when it comes to dealing with people who are struggling in poverty and  who need food. I would instruct my colleagues to read an article that  appeared in The Washington Post last year about what Maine's harsh  policies have resulted in.   A veteran who served this country with distinction lost his job due  to an injury and, because of Maine's strict work requirements, was  thrown off of his SNAP benefits, became homeless, and was skinning  squirrels in order to be able to survive. That is not a compassionate  policy that I think any State or, certainly, this country should want  to reach toward.   One of the things I am proud about the SNAP program is that it means  that we recognize that we have an obligation to make sure that nobody  in this country goes hungry. Why is that such a radical idea? Why has  this program been so demonized?   When the gentleman talks about a life of dependency, read the  statistics from the USDA. The average time somebody is on SNAP is less  than a year. That is not a life of dependency. I am not sure what he is  talking about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record the article that I referred for you to read  called ``Trump to Poor Americans: Get to Work or Lose Your Benefits,''  which talks about a veteran in Maine that basically was shut out of his  food benefit because of Maine's policies.                  [From the Washington Post, May 22, 2017]         Trump to Poor Americans: Get To Work or Lose Your Benefits                      (By Caitlin Dewey and Tracy Jan)         For a period last year after he lost his food stamps, Tim       Keefe, an out-of-work and homeless Navy veteran, used his       military training to catch, skin and eat squirrels, roasting       the animals over an open fire outside the tent he pitched in       frigid Augusta, Maine.        The new additions to Keefe's diet resulted from a decision       by state authorities to tighten work requirements for       recipients of the social safety net--forcing the 49-year-old,       who lost his job at a farm equipment factory because of an       injury, off the food stamp rolls.        ``I was eating what I could find, and borrowed from friends       and strangers,'' Keefe  [[Page H4156]]       said in testimony to the Maine legislature. ``There were many       times . . . when I would go two or even three days without       food. If one was inclined to lose a lot of weight, I could       recommend this diet wholeheartedly.''        Now the Trump administration in its first major budget       proposal has proposed more stringent work requirements--      similar to those in effect in Maine and other states--to       limit eligibility for food stamps and a host of other       benefits as part of sweeping cuts to anti-poverty programs.        The White House budget proposal, due to be unveiled on       Tuesday, would reduce spending on anti-poverty programs from       food stamps to tax credits and welfare payments by $274       billion over a decade, largely by tightening eligibility for       these programs, according to administration officials. With       additional reforms on Medicaid and disability insurance,       total safety net cuts would top $1 trillion over 10 in years.        Making low-income Americans work to qualify for so-called       welfare programs is a key theme of the budget. ``If you are       on food stamps and you are able bodied, we need you to go to       work,'' said budget director Mick Mulvaney during a White       House briefing on Monday.        He said the strengthened requirements in the budget focuses       on putting the 6.8 million unemployed or underemployed       Americans back to work. ``There is a dignity to work,'' he       said, ``and there's a necessity to work to help the country       succeed.''        The White House did not offer details Monday on how the       work requirements would be implemented, other than saying it       would be ``phased in'' for able-bodied adults without       dependent children.        The White House estimated the combined reforms to the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as       food stamps, would generate nearly $193 billion in savings       over a decade.        In addition to SNAP reforms, Trump will propose taking the       earned income and child tax credits away from undocumented       immigrants working in the United States, many of whom pay       taxes or have American born-children. That reform alone would       save $40 billion over a decade, according to the White House.        Anti-poverty advocates say the White House could implement       its desired reforms to SNAP in two ways: require recipients       to work more than the current minimum of 20 hours a week, or       cut the unemployment waivers in areas with high joblessness       rates.        The influential Heritage Foundation, as well as a number of       House conservatives have championed a crackdown on waivers,       leading many anti-poverty advocates to conclude that is the       most likely way the White House would implement its proposed       reforms.        Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage       Foundation who has asked the White House to prioritize work       requirements, said the Trump administration needs to ``go       after'' the four million able-bodied adults without       dependents in the food stamp program.        ``You say to them, `We will give you assistance, but come       to the office one day a week to do job search or community       service,'' ' Rector said. ``When Maine did that, they found       almost immediately that their caseload dropped 85 percent.''        Critics say such a change could endanger people like Keefe,       a veteran who has been unable to find a job after injuring       his wrist on the job at a plow factory in Rockland, Maine. As       a result, Keefe now is medically unable to lift more than 25       pounds--which disqualifies him from other work in       manufacturing.        The Navy veteran was one of several thousand former food       stamp recipients who lost benefits when Maine, in 2015,       declined to renew its waiver and reinstated statewide work       requirements. He has spent much of the last year living in a       tent.        ``I don't wanna worry no one,'' said Keefe, who recently       testified to Maine's Committee on Health and Human Services       about the impact the work requirement had on him. But, he       added: ``I hope they understand that people fall through the       cracks.''        The Trump administration is considering other changes to       SNAP. While details remain sparse, Mulvaney said the federal       government would be asking states to share in the costs for       the food stamps program, through a phased-in ``state match''       so they have a ``little more skin in the game.''        ``We believe in, the social safety net. We absolutely do,''       Mulvaney said. ``What we've done is not to try and remove the       safety net for folks who need it, but to try and figure out       if there's folks who don't need it that need to be back in       the workforce.''        Suspending employment waivers would hit hard in areas with       high unemployment such as southern and central California,       where the unemployment rate can spike as high as 19 percent,       as well as cities such as Detroit and Scranton, Pa., where       joblessness remains rampant. The change would also hit hard       in large portions of New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Georgia,       Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Idaho and Michigan.        ``It's unconscionable, cruel and ineffective,'' said Josh       Protas, the vice president of public policy at MAZON, a       national anti-hunger organization. ``I'm honestly not sure       what their goal is.''        Critics say the changes in unemployment waivers would be       devastating for Native American families living on       reservations in North and South Dakota, Arizona and Montana       where there is chronic poverty and high unemployment.        ``The President's budget proposal will force kids in rural       America to go hungry while wasting billions of taxpayer       dollars on misplaced priorities like a wall that won't keep       us safe,'' said Senator Jon Tester (D-MT), in a statement to       the Post. ``Parents in Montana and across Indian Country       should not have to choose between food for their tables, gas       for their cars, and shoes for their kids.''        The number of Americans on SNAP remains high, however. In       2016, 44 million Americans receive the benefits, compared to       just 28 million people in 2008.        ``They have not come down like we would expect them to       do,'' Mulvaney said. ``That raises a very valid question: Are       there folks on SNAP who shouldn't be?''        Anti-hunger advocates argue that, generally speaking, there       are not. Because SNAP benefits decrease gradually with       increased income, there is no incentive for people to avoid       work to get benefits--a phenomenon economists call the       ``welfare cliff.'' And benefits are too small for people to       subsist on them without working: The average food stamp       benefit was $465 a month for a family of four in 2015. Most       people are on the program for between seven and nine months       on average.        ``The notion that people would prefer not to work to get       that benefit, give me a break,'' said U.S. Representative Jim       McGovern, (D-Mass.) a longtime anti-hunger advocate. ``This       is a lousy and rotten thing to do to poor people. They look       at SNAP as an ATM to pay for their other priorities.''        Additionally, three quarters of households using SNAP       contain children, seniors, or people with disabilities, said       Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Income and Benefits       Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Without SNAP, the       country would have had 3 to 4.5 million more people in       poverty during the recession, she said.        More than a quarter of able-bodied adults without       dependents on SNAP do not have a high school diploma, Waxman       said; another 57 percent don't have college degrees--putting       them at a disadvantage when it comes to finding work.        A number are also veterans, young adults aging out of the       foster care system, and felons recently released from jail.       SNAP recipients who cannot find work, for these or other       reasons, are supposed to attend job training programs--but       they're not widely available because of lack of funding.        ``This is the trick. On the one hand, you want people to do       something, when in fact a lot of folks may not realistically       be able to find a job,'' Waxman said. ``Most states don't       want to put the money in. This is a dilemma that we're in.''        The evidence that stricter work requirements actually cause       people to get jobs is mixed, at best. In Kansas, which       reinstated the requirements in October 2014, 40 percent of       unemployed adults were still unemployed a year after being       kicked off SNAP. Among former SNAP participants who lost       benefits, the average annual income was only $5,562,       according to the Foundation for Government Accountability, a       right-wing think tank based in Florida.        Progress has also been hotly debated in Maine, a state that       conservatives regularly hold up as evidence that stricter       work-requirements are effective. When the state dropped its       waiver in 2015, the number of unemployed adults in the       program immediately fell by nearly 80 percent.        But a May 2016 report by the state found that nearly 60       percent of those affected individuals did not report any       income in the year after they left the program--suggesting       they were still unemployed or underemployed a year later.        On the national level, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow who       focuses on social welfare issues at the Cato Institute, a       libertarian think tank, said he doesn't think similar       mandates will have a huge impact on moving large numbers of       recipients into employment or result in significant budget       savings. Most SNAP recipients who can work are already       working, and many of those who are not meet one of the       various exemptions such as being disabled.        ``It's making a statement that Republicans think people who       are on public assistance should be doing all they can to get       off,'' Tanner said, ``and that means working whenever       possible.''        McGovern, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee, said       he was surprised to learn about the White House proposal       given Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's testimony before       the committee last week saying he did not favor any major       changes to the food stamps program.        ``It's been a very important, effective Program,'' Perdue       said, according to a recording of the hearing. ``As far as       I'm concerned we have no proposed changes. You don't try to       fix things that aren't broken.''        The Trump administration is advocating other ``fixes'' to       the safety net, as well. The budget will also propose       requiring people to have a Social Security number to collect       tax credits. Mulvaney said it is unfair that taxpayers       support immigrants working illegally in this country.        ``How do I go to somebody who pays their taxes and say,       'Look, I want you to give this earned income tax credit to       somebody who is working here illegally? That's not       defensible,'' Mulvaney said.        Rector, of the Heritage Foundation, said he also hopes       Trump will prioritize work requirements for those receiving       housing subsidies. Mulvaney did not address that on Monday.  [[Page H4157]]         Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing       Coalition, said the majority of Americans receiving housing       subsidies are elderly, disabled or already include someone       who works. Of the remaining households, nearly half include a       preschool child or an older child or adult with a disability       who needs the supervision of a caregiver.        Establishing work requirements for the remaining six       percent of households who are `work able' but not employed       would require state and local housing agencies already facing       funding shortfalls to establish cumbersome monitoring and       enforcement systems for a very narrow segment of rental       assistance recipients, she said.        ``This is neither cost effective nor a solution to the very       real issue of poverty impacting millions of families living       in subsidized housing or in need,'' Yentel said in a       statement to the Post.        Correction: This story incorrectly stated the average       annual income for SNAP participants in Kansas who had lost       and then found jobs was $5,562. That figure applied to all       SNAP participants who had lost the benefit.     Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia suggests that  we all take a mission trip around the world to see hunger and see how  lucky we are here in the United States.   Let me tell the gentleman, you don't have to go halfway around the  world to see hunger. I can take you halfway down the block, and you can  see hunger right here in our Nation's capital and in every  congressional district in this country.   There are over 41 million Americans who are hungry or food-insecure  in this country. We are the richest country in the history of the  world. We all should be ashamed. We ought to do something about it, and  this farm bill makes hunger worse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a distinguished member of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am just trying to think of a response to  the gentleman from Georgia, who is trying to defend the process in the  Agriculture Committee as that somehow, with this bipartisan process,  Democrats didn't want to participate.   But you know what? It is just not worth it. We have been explaining  it over and over and over again. This process is indefensible. It  really makes a mockery of the Agriculture Committee, and it makes a  mockery of this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms.  Moore).    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire of the gentleman from  Georgia: Do you have any speakers over there or anybody who wants to  talk about this bill? Because we have a ton, and we just want to----    It is an inquiry. I don't want to take it on my time.    As long as it doesn't come out of my time.    I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from  Georgia, but it is not coming out of my time.    Reclaiming my time, I am just taking note of all of the  excitement on your side of the aisle on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) talked about how we are  literally taking the food away from children. I want to make it clear  to my colleagues, there should be no mistake: This bill is going to  hurt kids.   First, it cuts 1 million people off of benefits through categorical  eligibility challenges alone. These people are working families with  kids. And once these kids lose their SNAP benefits, CBO, the  nonpartisan group of experts that we rely on, expects 265,000 children  will lose access to free school meals.   I ask my colleagues: Is that what you want out of a farm bill? We can  do so much better.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many  more speakers he has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I have to give credit where credit is due. This majority  can't balance a budget; they can't even pass a budget. They can't fund  the government without first shutting it down. They are so busy cozying  up to the big banks and passing tax cuts for the wealthy that they  ignore virtually every major issue facing our Nation. Right now as we  speak, this Republican majority is trying to jam through a farm bill  that won't even help most farmers.   But the one thing this Republican majority is incredibly good at, and  the one thing that they do with ruthless efficiency is stick it to poor  people. This majority is Robin Hood in reverse. They are master  legislators for the megawealthy. They might want this Chamber to look  out solely for those at the top, giving them more tax breaks, making it  easier for them to pollute our planet and systematically attacking the  safeguards we put in place to stop another financial collapse, but  while they work with unflagging, unshakeable, and dogged determination  to give a helping hand to the fat cats, they tell those struggling to  get by and those begging for an opportunity and a living wage that they  should just work harder.   Never mind that they didn't grow up in nice neighborhoods or in a  stable home with good nutrition and a quality education. Maybe they  started out in life having to play catchup. Maybe they need just a  little help from the Government to make the American Dream a reality in  their life. Or maybe they were born with advantages but have fallen on  hard times and they need a little bit of help.   I am standing here today--Democrats are standing here today--giving a  voice to our workers, the middle class, and those trying to break into  the middle class. If my Republican friends actually listened to their  voices, they would join us and vote against this monstrosity of a bill  that attacks working American citizens and takes lunch money away from  children.   It is disgusting, Mr. Speaker.   Now, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and the rule, and  I urge all of you--no, I plead with all of you--to vote ``no'' on this  bill.  [[Page H4160]]    I grew up in a family where helping those who were struggling was the  right thing to do, the decent thing to do. Please send this bill back  to committee. Surely we can do better. Let's demonstrate to the  American people that we are here to help, that we care, and that we are  decent.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia commented that we are all so  emotional on this side of the aisle when we are debating this issue.  You are damn right we are. We are emotional. We are angry. We are  frustrated because people are going to be hurt.   Mr. Speaker, if you have ever met a hungry child, it should break  your heart, and there are millions and millions in this country who are  hungry. We are the greatest country in the history of the world and the  richest country in the history of the world, and tens of millions of  our fellow citizens are food insecure or hungry.   Why isn't that a priority? Why isn't that a bigger priority than  another tax cut for a big corporation? I know my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle deep down inside care about those who suffer in  this country. Here is an opportunity to prove it. Let's do a farm bill  that actually doesn't make hunger worse in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am not even asking you to eliminate hunger, although I  wish that were a priority. I am just saying: don't make it worse. This  bill will throw millions of people off of a food benefit, and millions  of children will be impacted.   Mr. Speaker, they are not just people who aren't working. You know  better than that. Many of these people are working families, people who  are working hard but can't make ends meet. You are taking away a food  benefit. What is wrong with this institution? We can do better.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this rule, and vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I just want to say for the record that both  Feeding America and Feeding Texas oppose this farm bill because they  believe it will increase hunger in America, and I include the letter  from Feeding Texas in the Record.                                                  Feeding Texas,                                                     April 17, 2018.      House Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway and Committee Members: Regretfully       and despite years of hard work, we are writing to oppose the       farm bill proposed by Chairman Conaway, as we believe it will       increase hunger and make it harder for struggling Texans to       succeed.        Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors and people with       disabilities. Among SNAP recipients who can work, most       already do--just not at wages that allow them to escape       poverty. To help these workers we need to address the       weaknesses in our economy and our labor market that make it       hard for them to get ahead.        Instead, this farm bill largely ignores the complex       challenges faced by low-wage workers, imposing harsh new       sanctions and requirements that will take food away from       families who are willing but unable to find consistent work.        Hunger never helped anyone find a job.        According to the CBO, the Chairman's bill will move       billions of dollars off the kitchen table, largely to finance       state bureaucracies intended to assist recipients with       employment. Food will remain critical fuel for the success of       these families, yet this bill would effectively starve Peter       to employ Paul.        Losing SNAP will make it harder for these families to make       ends meet. We fully expect our food banks to experience the       brunt of this increased need. Across Texas, our food banks       already struggle to meet the demand in their communities, and       we will not be able to keep up.        We are also very concerned that this bill will repeal state       flexibility and put massive new responsibilities on states in       pursuit of better employment outcomes for recipients. These       ideas ignore the evidence-based policy making that the       Chairman has espoused by selling a promise on work, but not       delivering on the necessary funding or details.        We urge every member of the committee to reject this       proposal, and return to a bipartisan process that will help       more hard-working Americans avoid hunger and achieve       financial security.            Sincerely,          Celia Cole, CEO, Feeding Texas; Zack Wilson, Executive             Director, High Plains Food Bank; Theresa Mangapora,             Executive Director, Brazos Valley Food Bank; Bea             Hanson, Executive Director, Coastal Bend Food Bank;             Dennis Cullinane, CEO, East Texas Food Bank; Robin             Cadle, President/CEO, Food Bank of the Golden Crescent;             Jody Houston, CEO, Food Bank of West Central Texas;             Brian Greene, President/CEO Houston Food Bank.

Mr. Chair, I thought that this bill couldn't get any  worse, but I was wrong. This amendment is a sure sign that this  underlying farm bill is a complete mess. This manager's amendment is  longer than most bills that we consider in this House.  [[Page H4181]]    First, it puts a Band-Aid on the beating the majority took during the  markup when they finally realized that disabled people would be hurt by  their zeal to sever LIHEAP from SNAP. But to do that, to help disabled  people, cost them money, so they had to find savings somewhere. And  they landed on taking away more flexibility from States for waivers,  the result of which is that 600,000 people--600,000 more able-bodied  adults without dependents--will lose SNAP.   Here is the best part of it: The 600,000 will be kicked off right  away, at least a year before the mandatory work scheme--which is  underfunded and will be a mass of bureaucracy--is in effect. So in  spite of the rhetoric to provide on-ramps, off-ramps, trampolines, or  whatever to help people get good jobs, they do not deliver--not for  SNAP, and not for farmers.   As I have said over and over and over again, a farm bill should be a  bipartisan product. It should be reflective of bipartisan concerns. It  should help farmers, and it should help those struggling in need to put  food on the table. This bill doesn't do enough to help farmers, and it  certainly doesn't do anything to help people struggling with hunger. In  fact, this bill makes hunger worse in America, and that is shameful.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how many more speakers the  gentleman from Texas might have.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, let me close by saying this manager's  amendment highlights how deeply flawed this bill is. I regret very much  that a flawed bill is being brought to the House floor because of a  flawed process.   I am the ranking Democrat in the Nutrition Subcommittee. I didn't see  the nutrition title until it was made public to the press. We had 23  hearings in the Agriculture Committee. This nutrition title does not  reflect those hearings. We should have had a hearing on this nutrition  title to understand the impacts that it will have on some of the most  vulnerable people in this country.   We live in the richest country in the history of the world. We have  millions of people who are food insecure or hungry. We have an  obligation here in this House of Representatives to make sure that we  don't let them fall through the cracks. And yet, we have this bill that  will make hunger worse in America. This manager's amendment does  nothing to fix it. In fact, in some cases it makes it worse.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject it but,  more importantly, reject this bill. Send it back to committee. Let's do  it right. Let's have a bipartisan bill, one that we can all be proud  of.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I do want to say a few words, and that is, I  am trying to understand this amendment, because I really don't  understand the point of it.   Under current law, children can still get SNAP even if their parents  fail to comply with work requirements. That is the current law. H.R. 2,  the farm bill, does nothing to change this, so I am unsure why this  amendment has been offered.   I think I would classify this amendment as a covering-your-rear-end  amendment, because the bottom line is that there is a lot in H.R. 2  that I think does harm to children, because when their parents are  thrown off of SNAP, while they may not be thrown off of SNAP, the  overall household allowance for food gets decreased, and so there is  less food for the entire family.   I would say that if the majority really cared about the impact H.R. 2  would have on children, then they would address the changes that have  been made in broad-based categorical eligibility, which will throw  working parents off of SNAP.   According to CBO, the nonpartisan experts that we rely on to give us  data, over 265,000 students will lose access to free school meals.   So there is nothing to be opposed to, I guess, because this is  already current law. But I would say to the gentleman that broad-based  categorical eligibility, the changes in this bill, are going to  adversely impact a number of individuals in New Jersey.   With that alone, 35,000 individuals are going to lose their SNAP  benefits. That is just on this one part of the bill. Many of them have  kids, and the changes are going to affect these kids.   So, if you really care about these kids, I would urge you to reject  this bill. Send it back to the Agriculture Committee. Let's work in a  bipartisan way and construct a nutrition title which everybody  understands, which is clear, which has been vetted, and which we can  come to the floor and say with certainty that it will not adversely  impact kids. Because this underlying bill, no matter how you want to  slice and dice it, will have a negative impact on kids.                                time  1645    And this amendment, you go home and maybe do a press release on it,  but it doesn't change the impact of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I am at a loss. We have no opposition to this  amendment, but let's be honest with each other and let's be honest with  our constituents. H.R. 2 will hurt families, will hurt working  families, will hurt kids.   You know one thing that is also explicit, Mr. Chairman? According to  CBO, 265,000 kids will be thrown off of the free breakfast and lunch  program. That is according to CBO.   The other thing that is clear is that there are working families-- there are working families, Mr. Chairman, people who work, who now get  SNAP benefits, who, because we are eliminating broad-based categorical  eligibility, a number of them will lose their benefits. And they still  work. Their family  [[Page H4191]]  households, therefore, will have less of a food allowance. That will  impact these kids. That is undeniable.   So don't sit here and say this shows that we are going to protect  kids. The law is the law. If you want to restate the law, restate it.  Restate it 100 times, ``don't hurt kids.'' That doesn't change the fact  that this bill will hurt kids.   That is why so many of us on this side of the aisle and, hopefully, a  number of you on your side of the aisle are going to stand strong and  oppose this.   This is not right. There was a right way to do this farm bill, and  there was a wrong way to do this farm bill. This was the wrong way.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left.    Mr. Chairman, the CBO, the nonpartisan experts that we  all rely on, says that over 400,000 households will lose their benefits  because of the changes in H.R. 2 with regard to categorical  eligibility. We estimate that to be a million people. That is  undeniable.   So you can sit here all you want and say this is going to hold  everybody harmless and that kids won't suffer. It is just not true. I  mean, read the CBO score. Better yet, read the bill.   Look, we have no objection to you passing a restatement of current  law, because current law says that, even if parents don't comply, their  kids can't be punished. But make no mistake about it, the overall food  allowance in that household will decrease. That is a fact. That will  impact those kids.   So, if you truly want to help kids, if you truly care about kids, you  will vote ``no'' on this bill. You will vote ``no'' on H.R. 2.   You will make sure that this bill goes back to committee, that we  have a bipartisan process, and we have a bill that comes to the floor  that helps our farmers and that helps those in need in this country.   This is not it. This does not help kids. This amendment does nothing.  This is a covering-your-rear-end amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. This proposal  opens the door to sweeping changes in how States can operate SNAP. The  amendment, which was never debated or discussed by the committee, could  result in tens of thousands of American jobs being shipped overseas. I  know Donald Trump wants to create more jobs in China, but I don't think  we do.   This risks good-paying civil service jobs and puts benefits and  services to vulnerable households at risk. SNAP's merit system ensures  workers' aim is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by  private interests or profit motives. Some SNAP operational functions  can be appropriately turned over to private contractors, such as  computer systems, custodial services, or debit card issuance in order  to leverage businesses' competitive advantage.   Some, however, like eligibility determination, must remain a  government function. Some SNAP clients, including many elderly, have  very complex cases that require trained professional civil service  workers to dedicate significant time to appropriately screen and verify  their information, and ensure they receive the correct benefit levels,  which is important.   Good local jobs likely could be exported out of the area or overseas.  In many areas, including rural regions, civil service jobs offer some  of the best paying, most stable employment for local workers.  Privatizing core SNAP functions would mean many of these jobs would be  moved to other locations, including overseas. Why do we want to do  that?   Privatization could also compromise the security of a participant's  data. SNAP collects detailed information about applicants and  participants, including Social Security numbers, household composition  and income, and employment information. Handing private data of  millions of individuals over to private companies raises serious  concerns about their ability to keep it secure, and their interest in  using it for other purposes.   I respect the gentleman's intentions, I guess, but I think if we had  spent some time in the committee actually discussing this, some of  these concerns that I raise would be apparent. So this is a bad idea, a  bad amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4193]]         Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I am not going to reconsider my opposition.  I think this is a bad amendment, plain and simple. And I think the  issues like determining eligibility for who can receive SNAP should not  be contracted out to some private company. I do worry about creating  more jobs overseas and losing very good jobs here at home.   So if you are concerned about keeping good jobs--and these are good  jobs, civil service jobs--here in the United States, then you have got  to oppose this amendment.   Shifting core SNAP functions to private workers could disrupt timely  and accurate benefits. In H.R. 2, we are going after vulnerable  populations in a very, very harsh way, and I think this would  complicate things even worse.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
