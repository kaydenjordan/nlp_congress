 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                         U.S.-Mexico Sugar Agreement     Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my  considerable disappointment with the U.S.-Mexico sugar agreement that  was announced just last week. This deal was concluded recently. The  fact is that this is a bad deal for the United States. I am completely  mystified as to why our Commerce Department would agree to it. It is a  bad deal for U.S. consumers, and we are all consumers. It is a bad deal  for American workers.   It completely fails to address the high price of sugar that we have  in America today. In fact, it makes the problem worse. It increases the  price that we all have to pay for sugar. It reduces choices for  consumers, and it absolutely threatens jobs in the many food-producing  industries that we have across our country. What it does is that it  continues the protectionist policies that favor a handful of big sugar  producers and refiners.   These are large, agribusiness companies, generally, already  subsidized by domestic agricultural policies that force American  consumers to pay artificially inflated prices for their products. It  also limits imports, and the fact is that the agreement should be doing  just the opposite. It should be giving us a free market in sugar so  that American consumers can shop for the best deal available in the  world, and that is exactly what it does not do.   Unfortunately, what they did at the Commerce Department is they  failed to prioritize the concerns of ordinary American consumers,  ordinary American workers. The fact is that the United States is a  significant net importer of sugar. We are a huge country, and we don't  produce as much sugar as we consume. So we import the difference.  Mexico happens to be the No. 1 source of imported sugar. We get about  35 percent of our imported sugar from Mexico. The NAFTA trade agreement  provided for free trade in sugar. It took a long time to get there, but  it contemplated an arrangement where Mexico could sell to American  consumers--like my wife, when she goes shopping at the store, and all  of our families--without duties, without tariffs, without taxes,  without obstacles.   But that didn't work out so well for some of the sugar producers. So  they went to court, and they accused Mexico of dumping sugar.   In order to avoid tariffs, the Mexican Government agreed to what they  call the suspension agreement. It is an agreement that basically sets a  minimum price.   So that is what we do. That is our sugar policy. The government  dictates it, essentially, in conjunction with foreign governments. It  is the American Government that has all the leverage here. We set  prices. We fix prices. We don't have a free market. We establish, by  central government fiat, what the price will be.   We also establish import quotas. We decide how much of foreign sugar  an American will be permitted to buy, reminiscent of ``Moscow on the  Mississippi.'' This is not how you have a free market that allows  consumers to have the choices and the benefits from lower competition.   I was concerned about where this negotiation was heading. So Senator  Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic Senator from New Hampshire, and I sent a  letter to Commerce Secretary Ross to urge him to consider the impact on  consumers--which is all of us, I will reiterate--in negotiating this  deal. There was a similar letter from House Members. Unfortunately, it  apparently did not persuade our Commerce Department. In fact, this new  agreement--as I think I mentioned--leaves us with a policy that is  worse than it was before. This new so-called suspension agreement  increases the already-inflated price of sugar--2 percent higher for raw  sugar and 8 percent higher for refined sugar if it is imported from  Mexico.   How does it help the 320 million Americans? How does it help ordinary  Americans to be forced to pay more for the sugar that we all have to  buy? It is a staple in our food. The answer is that it doesn't help. It  hurts the single mom who is going to the grocery store to buy cereal  for her kids when she has to pay approximately twice the price of the  global price for sugar. Where does that money go? It goes straight out  of her pocket and straight into the pockets of this handful of wealthy  sugar producers in America. So it is absolutely bad policy for American  consumers.   Make no mistake about it. Higher prices for Mexican sugar mean higher  prices for American consumers--all of us. The Coalition for Sugar  Reform estimates that the new agreement--just the new agreement--will  cost U.S. consumers an additional billion dollars a year. That goes  straight to the growers, the producers. As I said, U.S. sugar prices  are already almost double the world prices, generally, because of the  ridiculous agricultural policy we have with respect to sugar. The  American Enterprise Institute reports that they believe that the  current policy already costs U.S. consumers $3 billion a year. So you  have the $3 billion a year from this flawed policy we used to have. Now  we just added another billion dollars a  [[Page S3446]]  year in costs to our consumers by virtue of this suspension agreement.  What the Commerce Department should be doing in these contexts is  described as to reduce and eliminate this mandatory price fixing,  eliminate these barriers to trade, and put U.S. consumers as the first  priority.   I will point out that it is not only Americans as consumers who are  harmed by this, but it is also Americans as workers. There are  industries that use sugar as a component in their food products. My  State of Pennsylvania, in particular, has a lot of these companies--200  confectioners. We have the most in any State. Our sugar-using  industries employ nearly 40,000 workers across our Commonwealth. We  have 600,000 workers across the country in the various food and  beverage industries that make products that we all consume that use  sugar. Guess what. Higher sugar prices jeopardize those well-paying  food manufacturing jobs. About 120,000 such jobs have been lost over  the last 2 decades because what happens is that American food producers  just can't compete. American food producers are forced to buy  artificially expensive sugar. Their foreign competitors don't have to  do that. Their foreign competitors can buy sugar on the world market at  about half the price. So guess what? An American candy maker or cereal  maker or other food maker is at a huge competitive disadvantage. We  have been losing them, in part, because we force them to pay these  artificially high prices.   Our own Commerce Department--the very same Commerce Department that  negotiated this deal--did a study. This is their work, not mine. They  estimate that when you artificially prop up the price of sugar, you  might save some jobs in the sugar-growing industry, but for every job  you save there, you lose three jobs in the food processing and  manufacturing industry--in the sugar consumption industry. What a  terrible trade. What a terrible arrangement.   I am very disappointed to learn about this. The Commerce Department  clearly failed to negotiate an agreement that would put consumers first  and consumers' pocketbooks first. Instead, we have increased prices  above the already artificially high levels. We have restrictions on  sugar trade, and, apparently, we have decided to pursue protectionist  policies that advance the interests of a small handful of wealthy  growers at the expense of several hundred million American consumers.  This strikes me as crony capitalism, and it is a huge mistake.   I hope that this is not a sign of what is to come in trade  negotiations. We are told that the administration is going to be  reevaluating and renegotiating various agreements, including NAFTA and  others. As they are being reconsidered, I hope we will not go down this  protectionist road of favoring a handful of the privileged few at the  expense of the many, as we apparently did in this agreement.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
