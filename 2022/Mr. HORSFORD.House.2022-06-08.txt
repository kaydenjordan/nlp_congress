 Madam Speaker, later this month, 30 years to the day,  my father was shot and killed by senseless gun violence.   And so I rise today with a heavy heart for those who have been  murdered by gun violence and the survivors who now must live with that  trauma every single day.   I have a heavy heart for the 58 victims and survivors in my hometown  of Las Vegas who experienced the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.   I have a heavy heart for the parents and families in Uvalde, Texas,  whose children were murdered while at school.   I have a heavy heart for the Black Americans who were murdered at a  grocery store in Buffalo, New York.   I have a heavy heart for the doctors and nurses who were killed at a  hospital in Tulsa.   I have a heavy heart. But I also have the courage to protect our  children, and I will continue to work to break the cycle of violence.   The question is: Do my colleagues have the courage to protect our  kids?   Vote ``yes'' on this legislation.
