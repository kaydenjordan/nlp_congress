 Mr. Speaker, last month, the House passed my  resolution condemning the use of school facilities to shelter illegal  immigrants. This week, the House will take up H.R. 3941, the Schools  Not Shelters Act, to officially strip Federal funds from  [[Page H3650]]  those who allow our schools to be used as hotels instead of schools.   New York City Mayor Eric Adams claims there are over 51,800 illegal  immigrants in the city's care who need housing. The fact that so many  illegal aliens have made it all the way to New York is a direct  reflection of the state of our border crisis, and municipalities should  not be tasked with fixing this problem.   Since the Biden administration refuses to address the border crisis,  we must take action in Congress and fight for America's children. After  all, how can we feed America's children in cafeterias of schools if  they are housing illegal immigrants?   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Representative Molinaro for bringing this  important piece of legislation to the floor this week, and I look  forward to voting for its passage.                            ____________________
