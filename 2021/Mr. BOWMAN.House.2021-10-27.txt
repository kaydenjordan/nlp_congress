 Madam Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I worked in  education for 20 years. I served as a public school elementary teacher,  a high school counselor, and a middle school principal for 10\1/2\  years, and I can tell you without a doubt that the Build Back Better  Act is going to be transformative for our democracy for generations to  come.   The reasons are many, including climate change and investments in  home care; however, our investments in our children, particularly in  early childhood education, focusing on expanding the child tax credit,  universal pre-K programs, and making sure we have almost universal  childcare, will prepare our children--our babies--to enter kindergarten  hitting the ground running.   As we know, when we invest in early childhood education, we have much  better health, education, and economic outcomes with decreased costs in  prison as well as healthcare.   So this is an exciting time, and I am blessed to be a part of this  Congress during this time. I just want to celebrate the Build Back  Better Act's investment in our youngest, most precious resource: our  babies and our children.                            ____________________
