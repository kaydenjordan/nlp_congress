 Madam President, I rise today to recognize a  significant anniversary for the Natrona County Meals on Wheels Program.  On Saturday, June 19, 2021, this wonderful organization will celebrate  its 50th anniversary.   Meals on Wheels is dedicated to providing healthy meals, a friendly  smile, and a watchful eye to seniors across the Nation. As a doctor, I  understand the importance of balanced nutrition but also companionship  and care. The hard-working employees and volunteers deliver all three  by offering tailored meals and home visits.   In 1971 Casper resident Mabel Marvel founded the Casper branch of  Meals on Wheels. Mabel was on a trip to Colorado to visit family when  she ran across a similar service. The volunteers for the Colorado  organization were delivering hot meals to elderly residents from a  church kitchen. Mrs. Marvel realized that Casper did not have such a  program. Soon after, she formed an office in a Salvation Army coat  closet and requested that the Natrona County Memorial Hospital, now  Wyoming Medical Center, aid in providing meals. This was the beginning  of the Natrona County Meals on Wheels Program.   When Natrona County Meals on Wheels began initial operations, they  were preparing 20 meals a day. By 2001, the number of meals delivered  increased to over 500 per day. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the  need for home-delivered meals exploded. This Casper-based organization  rose to the challenge and served clients who were forced to quarantine  and unable to leave their homes. In Natrona County, they delivered over  650 meals each Monday through Thursday and an average of 1,550 meals on  Fridays to cover the weekends. Their hard work resulted in senior  citizens in Natrona County receiving nearly 207,000 meals in 2020.   Serving so many people at once is challenging, especially when many  of these meals are prepared with special dietary needs in mind. Meals  on Wheels prepares healthy food for community members requiring  specific diets including diabetic, celiac, and vegetarian. The  volunteers with Meals on Wheels also make home visits to check in with  members of the community who may not have enough social interaction or  are not as mobile. The giving nature of this organization presents its  members with a balanced meal and quality time spent with others.  Ensuring the needs of community members allows seniors to preserve  their independence at home.   Meals on Wheels continues to find new ways to enrich our community.  Jamie Loveall has been leading the charge as the Executive Director of  Natrona County Meals on Wheels for more than 17 years. She has written  grants, planned community events, and helped prepare meals in order to  keep clients fed, staff members engaged, and the community aware. A  favorite community event is their Bubbles, Baubles 'n Beans fundraiser.  It is a chili and soup tasting experience to raise money for annual  operating costs.   The strength of an organization is determined by the dedication of  its leadership, staff, and volunteers. The full-time staff are  responsible for preparing the meals, managing the financial aspects,  and writing the delivery routes. In addition to Executive Director  Jamie Loveall, staff members are Katrina Lorenzen, Foundation  Development Director, Andrea Trout, Route Coordinator/Administrative  Assistant, Debbie Cardinal, Receptionist/Volunteer Coordinator, Ashley  Woodward, Client Services Coordinator, Mariah Bokhari, Bookkeeper, and  Shelley Blake, Kitchen Manager.   Current board members are Jim Browlee, President, Joe Moss, Vice  President, Vickie Ujvary, Treasurer, Don Smith, Secretary, and members  Wendy Elmer, Bob Thunselle, Ed Chase, Jennifer Deurloo, Peggy Porter,  Kelli Carmichael, Paul Rhodes, CJ Lovato, Dane Grace, and Stacia Hill.   The volunteers deliver the meals, partake in home visits, and spend  quality time with clients. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers with  the Natrona County service are seniors themselves, using their time to  help friends and neighbors. About the volunteers, Jamie Loveall says,  ``Without these individuals, our program would not exist.''   It is my great honor to celebrate the incredible work of this  organization. Every day, the staff and volunteers of Natrona County  Meals on Wheels work to make our community a better place  [[Page S3984]]  to live. My wife Bobbi joins me in wishing the Natrona County Meals on  Wheels another 50 years of success.                            ____________________
