 Madam Speaker, last week, I was approached by  Larry Martinez who was there when the Community Service Block Grants  first started in New Mexico. He told me that my late father worked  tirelessly to secure funds so the State of New Mexico could match this  new program. He called my late father the conscience of the Senate.   My father knew that these funds would make a real impact in the lives  of New Mexicans, and he was right. It has made a difference. The  benefits are undeniable. Instead of a family shivering in the cold in  northern New Mexico, we have families using LIHEAP to keep their  children warm. Instead of a family being turned out of their home  because they couldn't afford rising rent, CSBG provides rental  assistance. Instead of a promising young man falling into homelessness  or despair without an income, we have CSBG programs helping with career  training and job searches.   One of my favorite programs is Head Start. I started my academic  career as a Head Start baby and fell in love with learning, and we know  that an investment in our children at the earliest age is the biggest  and best investment we can work; and this provides Head Start.   CSBG touches every aspect of our community because there is not one  root cause of poverty. We need to uplift our most vulnerable by meeting  them where they are because they have aspirations that we need to help  them achieve. The Communities Services Block Grant Modernization Act  would strengthen CSBG by increasing its authorization for annual  appropriations. The bill would allow the Community Action Network to  serve more people by increasing the income eligibility for services.    We should not kick people off a cliff back into poverty when they can  rise into the working middle class. These are changes that will  strengthen CSBG and strengthen our communities. We must be the  conscience of our communities in the House.
