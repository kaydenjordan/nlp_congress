 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 891,  I call up the bill (S. 2372) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide outer burial receptacles for remains buried in National Parks,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on S. 2372, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the John S. McCain  III; the Daniel K. Akaka; and with great honor, the Samuel R. Johnson  Department of Veterans Affairs Maintaining Internal Systems and  Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, or the VA  MISSION Act.   This bill exemplifies exactly how Congress should work. It is a  bipartisan, bicameral compromise agreement between the House and Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committees that was crafted over the last year and a  half through regular order and in close coordination with stakeholders  and advocates in VA, the White House, the military and veterans service  organizations, and the broader health community.   It is also aptly named after Senator McCain, late Senator Akaka, and  Congressman Sam Johnson, three great Americans whose lives and work  exemplify service and statesmanship. The MISSION Act is also aptly  named in that it would address and reaffirm Congress' commitment to  VA's core and most important mission: caring for, as President Lincoln  said, those who have borne the battle.   There are five main components of the MISSION Act. Each of these  components on their own would be noteworthy and significant. Together,  they are transformational.   The first component of the MISSION Act would consolidate and improve  VA's community care programs. VA uses several different methods to  refer veterans to community providers today. The most recent and  notable method is the Choice Program, which Congress created following  the nationwide access and accountability crisis in 2014. All of those  methods serve different purposes and employ different business  processes, reimbursement rates, and eligibility criteria. That creates  a tremendous and increasing amount of confusion and consternation from  VA employees, community providers, and VA patients.   The MISSION Act would consolidate all of those methods into a single,  streamlined VA community care program that is easier to understand,  administer, and deliver to veterans who need it. This would increase  access to timely quality care in every community across the country  and, in doing so, expand VA's reach and veterans' choice. It would also  return all VA community care funding to the discretionary side of the  ledger, thereby increasing transparency and accountability for the  hard-earned taxpayer dollars that VA receives.  [[Page H4039]]    The second component of the MISSION Act would address the pending  shortfall in the Choice fund. When Congress created the Choice Program  4 years ago, it also created the Choice fund and stipulated that the  program would end when the fund ran dry. Congress has acted time and  time again to prevent that from happening in recognition of the  millions of veterans who rely on the Choice Program despite its  imperfections.   However, Acting VA Secretary Wilkie sent a letter just last week  declaring that the remaining funds in the Choice fund will be exhausted  as early as May 31, just 2 weeks from today. The consequences of that  have the potential to be catastrophic for veterans, with Acting  Secretary Wilkie warning that wait times will increase, access to care  will decrease, continuity of care will be disrupted, and valuable  community partnerships will be damaged.   To prevent that, the MISSION Act would authorize and appropriate $5.2  billion to the Choice fund. This would prevent an access-to-care crisis  from occurring in the immediate future and provide sufficient funding  to allow the Choice Program to continue serving veteran patients over  the next year until the new, consolidated community care program is  implemented.   The third component of the MISSION Act would address VA's massive and  misaligned physical footprint. VA is one of the largest property- holding entities in the Federal Government with a capital asset  portfolio that includes thousands of medical facilities spanning  hundreds of millions of square feet.   The average VA medical facility building is more than five times  older than the average building in the not-for-profit system in this  country, with some VA facilities being much older than that. For  example, the VA medical center in my hometown of Johnson City,  Tennessee, was built in 1903 to care for Civil War veterans. It is  still seeing patients today.   Since being named chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs a  year and a half ago, I have made it a priority to travel to VA  facilities across the country. While many of them are doing great work,  they are operating out of facilities that were designed and built to  meet antiquated healthcare needs and delivery models.   Those facilities are increasingly impossible to manage and maintain  in accordance with modern standards and the ever-changing shifts in the  veteran population, not to mention that demand for care is growing  progressively more costly and complex in Tennessee and across the  country.   The Asset and Infrastructure Review, or AIR, Act process that the  MISSION Act would create is based on a recommendation from the  bipartisan Commission on Care that was put together by President Obama.  It would create an open, objective, politically insulated process to  recommend how VA's massive physical footprint can be realigned and  brought up to date. This would transform the VA healthcare system that  we know today into one that is stronger, more efficient, and better  able to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, now and for generations  of veterans to come.    None of us who are lucky enough to have a VA facility in their  backyard, as I do, want to contemplate a future where that facility may  change or disappear. But without action as bold, brave, and potentially  transformative as the AIR Act is, the long-term success and  sustainability of the VA healthcare system is in serious question, and  veterans will suffer the consequences.   I want to assure those who may still be concerned about AIR that they  will have nothing to fear from it. I worked closely with a wide variety  of veteran service organizations to ensure that the AIR process takes  and includes a high level of veteran, VSO, stakeholder, and community  involvement--both locally and nationally--and to make sure no AIR  recommendation would occur behind closed doors without an open  discussion and a review of all the relevant facts, with every option  and opportunity left on the table.   It is my firm belief that AIR will result in a modern, streamlined VA  healthcare system but not necessarily a markedly smaller one. VA is  going to remain a presence in communities large and small, and no  facility that is needed to care for veteran patients or that has a  worthy service to provide them will be negatively impacted.   The fourth component of the MISSION Act will be to expand the Family  Caregiver Program to the caregivers of pre-9/11 veterans. Congress  created the Family Caregiver Program in 2010 to provide services and  supports, including a monthly stipend payment and healthcare coverage,  if needed, to caregivers of post-9/11 veterans.   Caregivers provide an invaluable service, often at great personal  sacrifice, to those veterans who have been seriously injured in the  line of duty. Caregivers know no age or era, but for far too long the  Family Caregiver Program has been restricted to an inequality based on  era of service. The MISSION Act would correct that serious inequity and  finally give pre-9/11 caregivers the recognition they deserve.   The fifth and the final component of the MISSION Act would be to  enhance the internal capacity of the VA healthcare system to care for  veteran patients internally. Opponents of this bill will tell you  falsely that it is aimed at eventual privatization of the VA healthcare  system. That misconception is based on nothing but fear and rhetoric, I  think.   The MISSION Act contains numerous provisions that would make it  easier for VA to attract high-quality commissions and other  professionals and put them to work in VA medical facilities, just as I  have done. It also contains numerous provisions that would make it  easier for the providers already working in VA hospitals and clinics to  see more veteran patients and to be recognized and rewarded for their  great work.   Together, these provisions would fortify the VA healthcare system and  make sure it stays strong and able to provide the care that it is meant  to provide.   Before closing, I want to take a moment to recognize some people:  Chairman Johnny Isakson and Ranking Member Tester of the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member  Tester have been steadfast partners over the last year and over the  last several weeks, in particular. The MISSION Act would not be a  reality without their good-faith efforts to work hand in hand with me  and with our veteran service organization partners to overcome our  differences and craft a bipartisan, bicameral compromise bill that  veterans and their families can be proud of. Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank them for their leadership and for their friendship.   I am also grateful for the many members of the committee from both  sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, including Ranking  Member Walz, and to our VSO partners in the community, the VA, and in  the White House who have worked hard over the last year and a half to  craft and consider many of the provisions that make up the MISSION Act.   Finally, I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and  steadfast commitment to veterans since taking office. This bill would  not have been possible without his vocal leadership. This may well be  the most impactful vote that any of us will ever take for our Nation's  veterans.   And before I finish, I also want to thank the staffs on both sides of  the aisle, both in the Senate and in the House, both Republican and  Democrat, for their incredible hard work, the many hours behind the  scenes that you never see, that the public never sees, that I certainly  appreciate and I believe Ranking Member Walz does too, the hard work of  our staffs.   A ``yes'' vote is a vote for access, for quality, for choice, for the  long-term success and sustainability of the VA healthcare system, for  caregivers and for veterans. And for that I would recommend a positive  ``yes'' vote.   The MISSION Act is supported by every major military and veteran  service organization that rightfully recognizes this as a monumental  and historic opportunity to support a bill that will positively impact  the daily lives and well-being of millions of veterans and their  families and fundamentally shape and improve the second largest agency  in the Federal Government.                                time  1600    I urge every single one of my colleagues to stand today with me and  [[Page H4040]]  these organizations dedicated to the service of veterans,  servicemembers, and their families, and, most importantly, our Nation's  veterans, and support the VA MISSION Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the VSO in support  of the MISSION Act.                                                       May 7, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Johnny Isakson,      Chairman, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Ranking Member, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, Chairman Isakson       and Ranking Member Tester: On behalf of the millions of       veterans, service members and family members we represent and       advocate for, we offer our strong support for the ``VA       Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated       Outside Networks Act of 2018,'' also known as the ``VA       MISSION Act of 2018.'' This historic veterans legislation       would consolidate and reform VA's community care programs;       extend funding for the current Veterans Choice Program for       one year; strengthen VA's ability to recruit, hire and retain       quality medical personnel; review, realign and modernize VA's       health care infrastructure; and extend eligibility to VA's       comprehensive caregiver assistance program to aging and       disabled veterans injured before September 11, 2001.        Our organizations strongly support expanding eligibility       for VA's comprehensive caregiver program to all generations       of seriously disabled veterans, while maintaining the       caregiver benefits that are currently available. Today, this       program provides full comprehensive caregiver assistance only       to veterans injured on or after September 11, 2001, leaving       family caregivers and veterans injured during World War II,       the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf Wars ineligible for this       critical support. The legislation will help to correct this       injustice and we--along with millions of members in our       organizations--applaud you for taking this action and look       forward to working in the future to ensure that both injured       and ill veterans from all eras are eligible for this benefit.        The legislation would consolidate VA's community care       programs and develop integrated networks of VA and community       providers to supplement, not supplant VA health care, so that       all enrolled veterans have timely access to quality medical       care. The bill includes funding to continue the current       Choice Program for an additional year until the new community       care program is implemented as well as important workforce       improvement provisions to strengthen VA's internal capacity       to delivery care. This carefully crafted compromise       represents a balanced approach to ensuring timely access to       care while continuing to strengthen the VA health care system       that millions of veterans choose and rely on.        The legislation also includes a new Asset and       Infrastructure Review (AIR) process intended to design and       implement a comprehensive plan to optimize and modernize VA's       medical care facilities. The AIR process would provide       meaningful stakeholder involvement, transparency and other       safeguards during the review process to help ensure the final       result leads to a stronger and better aligned VA       infrastructure able to deliver care to veterans when and       where they need it.        Since the access and waiting list crisis exploded in 2014,       Congress, VA and veterans leaders have debated how best to       strengthen and reform the delivery of veterans health care to       ensure timely and seamless access for enrolled veterans. The       legislation before the Committee would take a major step       towards that goal by making improvements to and investments       in the VA health care system, creating integrated networks so       that veterans have access to care when and where they need       it, and providing the further recognition and assistance to       family caregivers of severely disabled veterans deserve.        As leaders of the nation's veterans and military service       organizations, we thank you for your steadfast leadership in       crafting this important bipartisan bill and call on all       members of Congress to seize this historic opportunity to       improve the lives of veterans, their families and caregivers       by swiftly passing the ``VA MISSION Act of 2018.'' The men       and women who have served, are serving and will serve in the       future are counting on Congress' support.            Respectfully,          Garry J.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), one of my personal heroes. One of the  greatest privileges I have had in the 9\1/2\ years I have served in  this U.S. Congress is to serve with Sam Johnson.    Mr. Speaker, just for clarification, we have  been under cap since 2011. The VA budget has grown exponentially since  then. We have always done the right thing for our Nation's heroes and  will continue to do that.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend. He served until he recently  moved to a different committee, as chairman of the Health Subcommittee.  He has been an active member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and has  been a very valued member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the vice chair of the committee and a  tireless worker on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to welcome  Ms. Kuster back. She has been out for a little bit due to some work,  and I am glad to see her back on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin), my good friend and a very active member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn), my good friend, a U.S. Army veteran, and an  active member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a very active member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a lieutenant general and an incredibly  valued member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone who was involved in this  process, beginning with the staff, who have been heavily involved in  this. Both the Republican side and Democratic side worked for the last,  really, almost 18 months.   I want to thank our Senate colleagues on the other side of this  Capitol who worked very hard and the hours that went into this. The  real winners here are our Nation's heroes, the veterans.   This VA MISSION Act does a community care where veterans can get  high-quality care both inside the VA and out when the VA can't do that.  We have heard speakers down here from areas that don't have a VA  hospital. They absolutely rely on that.  [[Page H4046]]    I was in Oregon a few months ago and realized that some veterans had  to drive 5 hours to a VA facility. They need the community care bill in  their community. We provide the funding for that bill to bridge us over  until the new Secretary implements that.   We have a caregiver. I am a Vietnam-era veteran, and I have seen many  catastrophically injured Vietnam veterans whose families struggled for  decades. 520-plus Vietnam veterans are dying every day. It is time we  implement this bill and get these needed benefits to those World War II  and veterans up to 9/11.   We need to rightsize the VA. Healthcare is not provided like it used  to be. It has become much more sophisticated and streamlined. And  outpatient, the VA needs to get to be able to do that also. That is  what the AIR Act is about. We are increasing the internal capacity so  we can train and get new clinicians and providers in.   The speaker, Sam Johnson, who spoke a minute ago, said it all. We  should be able to look at that hero, who is a true American hero, and  listen to his speech, which brought tears to my eyes, and vote for this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   The Speaker pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
