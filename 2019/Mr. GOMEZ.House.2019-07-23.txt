 Madam Speaker, on July 19, surrounded by loved ones, the  city of Los Angeles lost a giant. His name was Henry Lozano.   Madam Speaker, I simply don't have enough time to recount all of  Henry's achievements or the profound impact he had on our district and  on the Golden State. His list of accomplishments is pretty impressive.   He was a Korean war veteran, serving as a Marine corporal in the  1950s; a fierce workers' advocate as a labor leader for UAW Local 509;  chief of staff to Congressman Ed Roybal; an adviser to Xavier Becerra,  the current attorney general of California and the former Congressman  for the district I now represent.   Congressman Ed Roybal was the first Latino elected to Congress from  California since the 1800s, a founder of the Congressional Hispanic  Caucus. Oftentimes, I say I stand on the shoulders of giants, and  people think I am referring just to the elected officials who came  before me; but, more often than not, it is the people who surround  those elected leaders, like Henry Lozano, the ones who are their  advisers, their confidantes, the people who try to keep them true to  their word and to their core and to their principles.   Henry was that type of individual. He cared deeply about the Latino  community and empowering them in a time where we oftentimes felt  marginalized. He came up during the seventies and the eighties and the  nineties.   I did not work with Henry directly, but I got to know him. Back in  2004, at the Democratic National Convention, I was introduced to Henry  by a mutual friend, and he said that Henry was a legend within the  Latino community on the east side of Los Angeles. He said he was the  one who helped, really, mentor countless elected officials and wannabe  elected officials like myself.   I befriended Henry, and Henry gave me quite a bit of advice. Most  importantly, he wanted to make sure that I would remain truthful and  remain committed to the community that I would one day represent.   I got to visit him just before he passed in the hospital. He looked  pretty good to me. We talked, and the first thing he asked me about is  what did I think. I thought he was referring to the Presidential  election, but, in the end, it was really about a local city council  race.   He said that politics is always local, and you should always think  about the people first.   Henry will be missed. He had a profound impact on a lot of folks, and  I am one of them. So I hope that we will keep his memory alive.                           Honoring Barbara Torres     Madam Speaker, I have sad news to report regarding someone  else we lost on the east side of Los Angeles.   She was a labor union leader, an activist, and a daughter of East Los  Angeles. Her name was Barbara Torres.   Barbara passed away at the young age of 39, but she left a life of  meaning. She was always around, even though she didn't have a car. She  gave so much to people who had so little, even though she didn't have  much herself.   She fought against the biggest opponents, even though she was small  in stature. She would often be the first one into a fight because she  always had one saying: ``If we fight, we win.'' That really sums up  Barbara Torres.   She was the champion of the little guy and the underdog, because she  was the little guy and the underdog. She understood that the system can  sometimes be against the people who need the most help, but she was  always there and never gave up faith.   She valued her community, but we also valued her in return.   Yesterday, we put Barbara Torres to rest. At her funeral service was  the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, myself, Los Angeles City  Council President Herb Wesson, State Senator Maria Elena Durazo, as  well as Assembly Member Reggie Jones-Sawyer and the head of the  California Democratic Party, Rusty Hicks.   For somebody who did not have a title in the end, who was not of  wealth or means but was just somebody who showed up every single day  for every fight, she left an impact. She will definitely be missed  because we know that she made California, Los Angeles, and this country  a better place to live.                            ____________________
