 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the brave  action of the pro-democracy leaders in Cuba and the brutal repression  that they face as a result of their demands for freedom.   For example, in the last few weeks, the San Isidro Movement has  stepped up its calls for freedom and the release of all political  prisoners. Their protests include such dangerous activities as poetry  readings and sit-ins. And for that, these young rappers, artists, and  writers have faced arbitrary arrests, harassment, and abuse.   Mr. Speaker, some remain in prison, which is why many activists have  begun a hunger strike in protest. But despite the brutal repression in  Cuba, the pro-democracy movement is growing. Mothers, scientists, and  so many others have joined its calls for freedom and the release of  political prisoners.   I commend President Trump and his administration for their solidarity  with the Cuban people in imposing serious sanctions against the Cuban  dictatorship. We must all stand with the brave pro-democracy activists  in Cuba, who are risking their lives at this very moment, and join them  in their pleas for freedom and the immediate unconditional release of  all political prisoners.                            ____________________
