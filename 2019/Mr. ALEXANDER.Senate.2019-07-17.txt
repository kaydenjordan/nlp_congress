 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, within a few minutes, the Senate will  be voting on President Trump's nomination of Cliff Corker to be the  U.S. Federal District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. I am  here to strongly urge my colleagues to support Cliff Corker.   Cliff Corker has the respect of the people who know him best. He was  selected to serve as a magistrate judge by the district court judges of  the Eastern District of Tennessee--a very high testament to his  qualifications.   When Cliff Corker was appointed magistrate judge, this is what he  said:         It's a tougher job to be the decision maker rather than the       advocate. There's so much more responsibility in making the       decision than advocating for the client because you really       want to see justice done.    Prior to his nomination to be magistrate in 2015, Judge Corker had  his own law firm in Johnston City, TN. He handled a wide range of  cases, from civil litigation to capital murder.   He graduated from James Madison University and received his J.D. from  the William & Mary Law School.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Corker as unanimously ``well  qualified,'' the highest ranking a nominee can receive. I am sure that  is because of his judicial and litigation experience.   Judge Corker has big shoes to fill. He is taking over for Judge  Ronnie Greer, a very well respected Tennessean, a friend of mine for  many years, who has served as a judge in Tennessee's Eastern District  for the last 15 years. Prior to that, he was a State senator in  Tennessee.   Cliff Corker demonstrates the qualities that I look for in a judge:  good character, good temperament, high intelligence, respect for the  law, and respect for those who come before the court.   Tennessee is fortunate that President Trump chose to nominate such a  well-qualified candidate.   I urge my colleagues to support Judge Corker's nomination.   I yield the floor.
