 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  Food and Drug Amendments of 2022.   This is an important reauthorization that is necessary to help drive  innovation and make sure patients have continued access to critical  treatments and cures.   I am pleased to see the continued focus on innovation this agreement  brings, as well as its included policies like the DIVERSE Trials Act,  which I helped author, which will help increase diverse participation  in clinical trials.   More can be done to protect patients. One example being diagnostic  testing, specifically lab-developed tests.   For well over 5 years, I have been working on the bipartisan VALID  Act, H.R. 4128, with my colleague Diana DeGette, which establishes a  risk-based regulatory framework for diagnostic and laboratory-developed  tests.   This legislation allows for leading-edge development and innovation  to thrive while assuring doctors and patients have the certainty that  their test results are analytically and clinically valid. The draft  version of the user fee agreements introduced in the Senate addresses  the issue by including a version of the VALID Act.    Mr. Speaker, I again express my strong support for the Food and Drug  Amendments Act of 2022, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this legislation.                                time  1830
