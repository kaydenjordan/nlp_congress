 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the State  Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act.   Since 1979, as alluded to before, Oregon's Office of Rural Health has  provided services critical to the folks in the rural portion of my  State. Thirty-six percent of Oregonians live in rural communities, and  as we know, these communities often face challenges not experienced in  urban or suburban settings.                                time  1600    People in rural areas might have long distances to travel over  mountainous terrain just to see their doctor, or they might have issues  even finding a primary care provider or specialist who can help them  where and when they need it. That is why we need the Offices of Rural  Health and why the House should pass this bill today.   Oregonians have come to rely on the services and expertise of the  Oregon Office of Rural Health to help build up the healthcare in rural  areas so folks in these communities know they will be able to see a  doctor, nurse practitioner, or other healthcare professional.   The Office of Rural Health has worked with small hospitals and EMS  providers to ensure that patients are safe, the ethics are up to code,  and they can work through the often challenging patchwork of programs  and regulation.   My State's Office of Rural Health has also been instrumental in  providing the data and policy expertise we have needed to ensure that  all Oregonians receive the care that the Affordable Care Act and  Oregon's healthcare transformation projects have promised.   Everyone, including folks in our rural areas, should have access to  quality healthcare. This bill provides the Federal support and  resources necessary to ensure that all 50 States' Offices of Rural  Health can be there for the patients who need them.   I am proud to have led on this bill in the House with my good friend,  Markwayne Mullin. I am grateful to Chairman Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone for getting this to the floor before the end of a very  interesting session. I thank them for their leadership on this issue  and urge support for this bill.
