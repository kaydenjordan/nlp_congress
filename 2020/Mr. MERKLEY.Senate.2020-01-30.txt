 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  Senator Schatz, for Senator Carper, and for myself.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is for the House managers from Senators Merkley, Schatz,  and Carper:         Yesterday, Alan Dershowitz stated that a President cannot       be impeached for soliciting foreign interference in his re-      election campaign if he thinks it's in the public interest.       The President's Counsel stated the President cannot be       prosecuted for committing a crime. And the President himself       has said ``I have the right to do whatever I want as       President.'' Aren't these views exactly what our Framers       warned about: an imperial President escaping accountability?       If these arguments prevail, won't future Presidents have the       unchecked ability to use their office to manipulate future       elections like corrupt foreign leaders in Russia and       Venezuela?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you for the question, Senators. Before I  address it, I just want to complete my answer to the last question.   On September 7, the President has a conversation with Gordon  Sondland, and the President says: No quid pro quo, but Zelensky has got  to go to the mic, and he should want to do so.   This is in the context of whether the aid is being withheld in order  to secure the investigations. After that call on the same day, Sondland  calls Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, and says: You are not going  to get the money unless you do the investigations.   So you have got the communication between the President and Sondland  and Sondland conveying the message to the Ukrainians in short  succession. And so I think you see that the message the President gave  to Sondland was, in fact, communicated immediately to the Ukrainians.   Of course, Sondland went on to explain to Ambassador Taylor and to  Tim Morrison that the President wanted Zelensky in a public box. What  was meant by that is he wanted him to have to go out and announce  publicly these investigations if he were going to get the money.  Remember, Sondland explained that the President is a businessman, and  before he gives away something, he wants to--before he signs the check,  he wants to get the deliverable. Ambassador Taylor says: That doesn't  make any sense. Ukraine doesn't owe him anything.   So it was clear to everyone, including the Ukrainians, that they were  not going to get the money unless they did the investigations that the  President wanted. That is the connection on September 7 that makes it  crystal clear.   In terms of the Dershowitz argument, when coupled with a President  who believes that, under article II, he can do whatever he wants, yes.  I mean, this is the description of a President, not just of an imperial  President but of an absolute President with absolute power because, if  a President can take this action and extort one country, he can extort  any country. If he can make a deal with the President of Venezuela or  take an action that is antagonistic to what Congress has legislated  with respect to that country and can violate the law in doing it to get  help in his reelection--and I think that example that Senator King  asked about is directly on point--then there is no limiting principle  here, as long as the President thinks it is in the interest of his  reelection.   So, yes, he can ask the Israeli Prime Minister to come to the United  States and call his opponent an anti-Semite if he wants to get U.S.  military aid. That principle can be applied anywhere to anything, to  the grave danger of the country.   That is the logical extension not just to what Professor Dershowitz  said yesterday but to what the President's counsel said today. You can  accept every fact of the articles, and we still think it is fine and  beyond the reach of the Constitution. The President can extort an ally  by withholding military aid and withholding meetings. He can ask them  to do sham investigations, even if you acknowledge the fact that they  are a sham. In fact, they don't even have to be done; they just have to  be announced, and there is nothing Congress can do about it. That is a  prescription for a President with no constraint.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Indiana.
