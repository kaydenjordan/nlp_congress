 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the many  national cemeteries in Florida, especially the Jacksonville National  Cemetery, which is in my district.   These hallowed grounds are sacred to the families of those who have  served our country honorably, many of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice  for our freedom.   Recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs ranked the top national  cemeteries in the country, and I am proud to report that the  Jacksonville National Cemetery of the Southeast District has earned the  highest award, which was accepted by Al Richburg, the director of the  Jacksonville National Cemetery.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Al and his wonderful team for all the work they  do to preserve the final resting places of our Nation's military and  creating a beautiful, peaceful, and memorable place for loved ones to  visit.           Congratulating West Nassau High School Cheerleading Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the West  Nassau High School Cheerleading Team, who recently won the State,  National, and World Championships in Orlando.   With nine State titles, the Warriors are tied for the second most  championships in the State of Florida. In fact, this is the second year  in a row that they have claimed the State, National, and World titles,  and they are the first high school in Florida to do so.   The team is spearheaded by Coach Samantha Beazley, who has led West  Nassau to now five State championships, three National championships,  and two World championships.   On behalf of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, I want to  congratulate the West Nassau Warriors on a cheerleading dynasty.                            ____________________
