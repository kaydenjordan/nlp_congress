 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative  Malinowski, for yielding. I thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership in  advancing this legislation to the floor, and the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim), my friend, for partnering with me on this  important bill.   I rise today in support of my Securing Global Telecommunications Act,  a bipartisan bill I introduced to help combat China's attempts to  dominate the next generation of critical technology.   Mr. Speaker, many of the products we use every day are connected to  telecommunications networks, and they rely on a nearly invisible set of  internationally agreed-upon standards.   Our strategic competitors, Russia and China, want to gain an unfair  advantage over these critical areas. They are determined to set the  rules of the road for the next generation of critical technologies like  5G and AI. They are relentless in their efforts to provide their own  companies, like Huawei and ZTE, with an unfair advantage while shutting  out all competitors.   This effort is not just about helping their businesses win. This is  about controlling a key strategic domain, which poses serious risks and  consequences for the U.S. and global security. That is because the PRC  has demonstrated its willingness to abuse technology to steal data,  conduct surveillance, and invade privacy, all to further its  geopolitical agenda and bolster its model of a closed, authoritarian  system of governance.                                time  1515    The United States and our allies must work together to counter this  threat. We need to develop and deploy more secure and better trusted  tech and telecommunications infrastructure.   My bipartisan bill will help do just that.   First, the bill will require a comprehensive strategy for securing  global telecommunications infrastructure worldwide, incorporating  mobile networks, data centers, and emerging technologies like LEO  satellites and 6G.   We can't afford to be complacent about this challenge. We must have a  cohesive strategy to address this issue.   This bill will also help crack down on Russia's and China's malign  influence at the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU--a  little-known but incredibly important U.N. organization that could  determine the standards behind the future of the digital world. It is  vital that America and allied countries are in the room at the table  and leading the charge to set next-generation technology standards.   Finally, the bill would encourage the U.S. to work closely with our  allies and partners to promote and finance secure networks and trusted  vendors, without having to rely on Chinese state-owned companies that  threaten our security.   Taken together, these important measures will help us shore up key  gaps and vulnerabilities, while countering China's strategic technology  ambitions.   Mr. Speaker, our adversaries hope and believe that they can achieve  undue influence and dominance over international telecom infrastructure  and technical standards.   This bill is a step toward stopping their unfettered aggression in an  area that is of vital strategic importance.   It will help preserve our global leadership in tech and telecom, keep  our companies competitive, and protect the safety and integrity of the  networks we rely on every day.   Once again, I thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership in this area. I  urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative  Malinowski, for yielding. I also thank my dear friend and colleague,  Congressman Ted Deutch, for his tremendous leadership on this and so  many issues as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle East, North  Africa, and Global Counterterrorism. It is a privilege to serve with  him.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 558, a bipartisan  resolution I was proud to help introduce with Chairman Deutch, urging  the European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a  terrorist organization.   The Iranian-backed terrorist group, Hizballah, is responsible for  thousands of civilian deaths, not just in the Middle East, but around  the globe. Until 9/11, Hizballah had killed more Americans than any  other terrorist group. Today, it maintains an arsenal of 150,000  rockets aimed at Israel.   Just this past week, Hizballah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, issued a  series of grave threats and provocations against Israel, claiming its  missiles are locked on an Israel offshore gas field, which Israel seeks  to develop to export much-needed energy supplies to Europe.   This is another reminder of why it is incomprehensible that any EU  member  [[Page H7910]]  can credibly assert any distinction between Hizballah's so-called  military and political wings. The truth is, there is one unified  Hizballah, and it is dedicated to carrying out terrorist activities  around the world.   That is why this bipartisan resolution calls on our partners in the  EU to take a stronger stand against worldwide terrorism by designating  Hizballah--as a whole--as a terrorist organization.   We must continue to keep pressure on Hizballah and all other  terrorist groups that threaten the United States and our ally Israel,  and undermine peace, security, and stability throughout the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan measure, and I thank  Chairman Deutch for his steadfast leadership on this important issue.
