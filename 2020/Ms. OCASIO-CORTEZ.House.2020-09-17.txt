 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Hope  Lee, a revered constituent of New York's 14th Congressional District  who is celebrating his 100th birthday this year and has served so  valiantly for our country.   During World War II, Mr. Lee received a Bronze Star Medal, two Purple  Hearts, and a Combat Infantry Badge for his service to the country  during World War II.   Mr. Lee, in fact, was supposed to go to Washington, D.C., this year  to get his Congressional Gold Medal of Honor this May, but it was  postponed due to the pandemic.   I think it is incredibly important to honor his work and his service  here on the House floor.   He is extraordinarily proud of his service in the U.S. military and  hangs his American flag outside his house for every U.S. holiday.   In fact, he and his wife, Rose Lee, have been happily married for 76  years, and Mr. Lee still does the cooking for himself and his wife.   Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr.  Hope Lee.   Thank you for your service, and happy birthday, Mr. Lee.                            ____________________
