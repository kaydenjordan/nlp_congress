 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  organization in my district that strives to empower individuals with  special needs as well as their families.   The Miracle League of Northampton Township fosters both social and  educational growth through sports and recreation. Along with buddy  programs and coaching opportunities, Miracle League offers those with  special needs the ability to participate in baseball, basketball,  bowling, and soccer leagues.   On May 5, this organization will be holding its first annual charity  wiffle ball tournament. The Miracle League of Northampton Township  Wiffle Ball Classic will take place at Miracle League Fields in  Churchville, and will feature a single elimination bracket along with  awards for best team name and best uniforms.  [[Page H3350]]    I would like to recognize president Brian Damiani and vice president  Allan Corless, along with the executive directors, board members, and  volunteers, for the countless hours they put in to improve the lives of  those in Bucks County.     Recognizing Warwick Township for its Rank as One of Pennsylvania's                               Safest Cities     Mr. Speaker, we have no higher priority than working  to ensure the safety of the communities we represent. Working with law  enforcement and local officials is essential to meeting this  responsibility. I am proud to recognize Warwick Township in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, for being ranked as one of our State's safest  cities.   In identifying Pennsylvania's safest cities, the statistics were  compiled from the FBI Uniform Crime Report. This information indicated  that Warwick Township was the 15th safest city in the State of  Pennsylvania. I would like to thank Judith Algeo, chairwoman of the  Warwick Township Board of Supervisors, and Police Chief Mark Goldberg  for their hard work in keeping our district a phenomenal place to live,  work, and raise a family. I look forward to continuing our mission  together.                            ____________________
