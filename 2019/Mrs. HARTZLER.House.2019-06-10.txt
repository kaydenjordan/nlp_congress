 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to highlight a humanitarian  crisis happening within our borders.   Because of our failing immigration policies and inadequate border  security, people, including tens of thousands of unaccompanied  children, are streaming across our porous borders. In shelters  throughout the country, the Department of Health and Human Services is  caring for over 13,000 unaccompanied migrant children who illegally  crossed our southern border.   This is just a portion of the over 40,000 children who have come into  U.S. custody since October of last year, and more of these children are  arriving sicker than ever before and require immediate medical  attention.   Time is not on our side. To continue caring for these children, HHS  needs more funding. HHS projects it will be out of funds to provide  care within a matter of days.   HHS requested $3.2 billion in emergency funds to continue providing  shelter, food, and medical care for these children, but Democrats have  ignored this request.   It is time for us to work together to provide the resources necessary  to care for these children, work to fix our immigration system, and  secure our borders to prevent this crisis from happening again.                            ____________________
