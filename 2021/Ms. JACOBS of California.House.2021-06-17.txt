 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support this  critical legislation to repeal the 2002 Authorization For Use of  Military Force.   I want to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee and the chair of this  committee for their enduring leadership on this issue.   I was in middle school when Congress passed this authorization to use  force against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Today, as a Member of  this body, I am voting to repeal it.   I make this point to remind my colleagues that the decisions around  war and peace are some of the most consequential ones we make here. My  generation has spent our entire adult lives in the shadow of two long  and protracted wars.   I am proud to represent San Diego, a military community that has made  incredible sacrifices because of that vote in 2002. Now it is time to  take it off the books.   Repealing this authorization would not impact any of our current  military operations, but repealing it will prevent a future President  from abusing it and reclaim Congress' rightful role in authorizing war,  ensuring our servicemembers know that they are not being sent to harm's  way without a full debate of this representative body. There is nothing  rushed about something that has taken 20 years.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this repeal.
