 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3051, America's  Conservation Enhancement Act.   It is an incredible honor to manage this suspension debate for the  ACE Act, arguably one of the most important pieces of environmental  legislation for the Chesapeake Bay, national wetlands, and fish habitat  in years.   This bipartisan package of conservation and resource protection  policies will have tremendous benefits for both our environment and  individuals for years to come.   The ACE Act is a once-in-a-generation advancement to clean up the  Chesapeake Bay and protect and conserve natural resources across  America. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, and the ACE Act  provides additional resources and extends critical conservation  programs that preserve wetlands, reduce pollution, and increase  recreational opportunities both in the Commonwealth of Virginia and  across our great United States.                                time  1500    Title I of this bill includes important reauthorizations for programs  such as  [[Page H5174]]  the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, the National Fish and  Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, the Chesapeake Bay Program, the  Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998.   These are all very important programs, not only to the folks back  home in my district, but to all Americans who wish to have clean air to  breathe, clean water to drink, and an overall healthier environment  where our fish and wildlife populations are sustainable and thriving.   This bill also includes initiatives important to sportsmen, such as  the establishment of a chronic wasting disease task force with the goal  of researching this dangerous threat to white-tailed deer, mule deer,  elk populations, and moose populations.   This bill also has some practical solutions to offer farmers and  ranchers vital tools to help manage their herds and protect them from  predation.   Title II is a provision I am especially proud of and glad that we are  advancing through the House and on to the President's desk for his  signature. This includes the National Fish Habitat Conservation Through  Partnerships provision, a bill that I championed. This title  establishes a national fish habitat board that supports a successful  public-private partnership to restore fish habitat.   I would like to thank the ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee,   Rob Bishop, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Water, Oceans, and Wildlife,   Tom McClintock.   I would also like to thank all of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle for their ceaseless efforts and commitment to making sure we  do everything we can to conserve, protect, and enhance the resources  that we are in charge of taking care of.   I look forward to continuing to advance other important provisions,  but this bill, hopefully, will be on its way to the President's desk.   As co-chair of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Task Force, I would  specifically like to acknowledge my friends and colleagues in the bay  delegation who have labored so hard for so long to help clean up our  great Chesapeake Bay.   Representative  Bobby Scott, Representative   John Sarbanes, and  Representative   Andy Harris and I are proud to see the passage of  these important provisions to protect the Chesapeake Bay.   Mr. Speaker, the American Conservation Enhancement Act does much to  advance our bipartisan goals of conserving fish and wildlife  populations and preserving the environment for the enjoyment of untold  future generations of Americans.   The ACE Act will also give Americans increased opportunities to get  out and enjoy the natural beauty and wildlife in our country, from the  Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, from Puget Sound to the Chesapeake Bay.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to reflect upon the words of Representative Luria. This  really is a true bipartisan bill.   I would like to thank not just the colleagues on the other side of  the aisle but those colleagues from all of our States, Representative  Luria, the rest of the Virginia delegation. As I talked about the folks  from the Chesapeake Bay delegation, everybody has an interest in this  bill. It is an extraordinary effort across many, many different areas  where there is common interest, and it is a great example of what we  can get done when we are willing to focus on things we have in common  rather than those places where we have differences.   The one thing we do have in common is the great treasures that have  been bestowed upon us by our Creator and our obligation, as humanity,  to protect and to enhance those resources, not only now, but for  generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  I will close quickly.   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Dingell, for all  of her efforts.   Obviously, the Natural Resources Committee has a lot of input on  this. But, again, this is a great example of what we can all do when we  look at those things that we have in common.   We have been bestowed these fantastic natural resources, gifts from  our Creator. We have an obligation to protect them. And what we see  today is that common idea of that obligation and how we fulfill that  obligation. Today really is one of those days where we should remember  historically about all the different elements that have come together.   We know it is an arduous path for many of these pieces of  legislation, but today should really be a reminder of what we can do  when we look at those things we have in common, when we look at our  responsibilities and obligations to this Nation and to the treasures  that we have here before us.   Today is indeed a great day. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill. It truly is an indication of what makes this Nation great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5068, which would  authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation to  establish a commemorative work in Washington, D.C., to recognize the  commitment and service represented by women who worked on the home  front during World War II.   These 19 million American women stepped up to support their Nation  during America's involvement in World War II. Women worked in a huge  variety of critical professional roles, including code breakers,  aircraft testing pilots and trainers, welders, steamfitters, telegraph  operators, radio and electrical engineers, crane operators, surveyors,  assembly line workers, as they replaced men who were heading off to  war.   Some 300,000 Virginians served in uniform and more than 11,000 never  returned home. For many women, the war provided increased opportunities  to serve their community, their Nation, and to aid in the war effort.   The work women did during World War II can never be fully measured,  and their impact on our national welfare for the decades that followed  should forever be enshrined in our national story.   The beneficial contribution women made during the war were felt  locally here in Virginia, as well as across the Nation.   For example, the Richmond Engineering Company employed women welders  who made bomb heads. At Newport News shipyard, women worked as crane  operators, electricians, mechanics, and more, as critical members of  the Defense production workforce.   In recent years, Congress also has established the Rosie the Riveter  National Historical Park in California to further highlight the work of  these incredible patriots during the war. Authorizing this  commemorative work in our Nation's capital is another fitting tribute  to the brave, strong, multitalented, intelligent women who helped us  win the war.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of S. 3758. While this bill  makes important technical corrections that will provide relief to the  Klamath Basin irrigators which have been hard hit by drought, it also  includes a provision that perpetuates a 75-year mistake.   In 1946, the Bureau of Reclamation entered into contracts with two  irrigation entities in Montana to provide project use power, better  known as PUP.   Normally, these subsidized power rates are reserved for Federal  projects. However, for reasons lost to history, these two entities-- which are not part of any Federal project, and in fact, one is a  private company--have been able to obtain and renew their project use  power or PUP contracts.  [[Page H5181]]    Recently, the Bureau of Reclamation realized it lacked the authority  to provide these two entities PUP rates and has decided to let these  contracts expire December 31, 2020. It is extremely concerning that it  took the Bureau of Reclamation 75 years to realize it made a mistake,  which makes this situation quite unique. This unfortunate mistake by  bureaucrats left more than 130 family farms in limbo, uncertain if they  will be able to afford to maintain their farmland after January 1,  2021.   While we are not opposing this fix today, the committee wants to be  clear that this is a one-off, unique situation. We do not see this as a  pathway or precedent for other irrigation districts to follow.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two legal opinions from the  Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, which indicate  that the department did not have the legal authority to enter into PUP  contracts with the two Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program entities  because there is no Federal nexus.                                   U.S. Department of the Interior,                                         Office of the Solicitor,                                       Billings, MT, March 10, 2014.                                 Memorandum       To: Michael J. Ryan, Regional Director, Bureau of           Reclamation, Great Plains Region, Billings, Attn: GP-4100           (Fern Thompson)      From: Karan L. Dunnigan, Field Solicitor, Office of the           Solicitor, Rocky Mountain Region (Billings)      Subject: Authority to Enter Into a Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin           Program (P-SMBP) Project Use Power (PUP) Contract with           Kinsey Irrigation Company (Company)                                 I. Question          In an October 31, 2013 memorandum, you asked: (1) whether       the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) had or has the       authority to enter into a PUP contract with the Company; (2)       if not, whether Reclamation should continue to honor its       current contract with the Company until the contract expires;       and (3) if so, if Reclamation should approve the Company's       request for an increased contract rate of delivery.                               II. Brief Answer          Reclamation does not and did not have the authority to       enter into a PUP contract with the Company, because the       United States has had no interest in the unit and there has       been no federal nexus with the unit since the title transfer       of the Kinsey facilities in the 1940's. Because Reclamation       has no authority to provide PUP to the Company, Reclamation       should seek to terminate the provision of PUP to Kinsey as       soon as is practical. And any increased deliveries to the       Company should not be at a PUP rate.                               III. Background          The Farm Security Administration constructed the Kinsey       project in 1937. The project was referenced in Senate       Document 191, 78th Congress, 2nd Session, 1944, and thus       appears to have been contemplated to be (and indeed was       briefly) a P-SMBP unit. However, in 1945 the Company       purchased the federally-owned Kinsey project facilities from       the United States, rendering the Kinsey project entirely       private. The Kinsey project has no other federal nexus.         In 1946, Reclamation entered into a power contract with       the Company, providing power at the PUP rate of 2.5 mills per       kilowatt-hour. Reclamation's regional office raised concerns       about providing PUP power to a private district on several       occasions, but for reasons lost to history, the Commissioner       of Reclamation's office instructed the region to continue       providing PUP power to the district, and at the original 2.5       mill rate. The contract has been renewed and extended over       the years, and currently terminates on December 31, 2020.        The Kinsey project does appear in the 1963 ``Report on       Financial Position, Missouri River Basin Project'' (1963       Report) as a project entitled to PUP.                                 IV. Analysis         Pursuant to Reclamation Law and Policy, PUP is available       only where it has been specifically authorized by Congress       and, unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, only to       Reclamation projects. Here, while the Kinsey project was       initially a federal project, and briefly an authorized unit       of the P-SMBP, title transfer to the Company divested the       Kinsey project of its status as an authorized P-SMPB unit and       rendered it entirely private. Accordingly, the Company is not       entitled to PUP.      A. Project Pumping Power         Authority to produce and supply PUP is implied in the Town       Sites and Power Development Act of 1906 (Act of April 16,       1906, ch. 1631, 34 Stat. 116). PUP is further contemplated       under the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, at section 9(c),       which provides that:        Any sale of electric power . . . made by the Secretary in       connection with the operation of any project or division of a       project, shall be for such periods, not to exceed forty       years, and at such rates as in his judgment will produce       power revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate       share of the construction investment at not less than 3 per       center per annum . . .        Thus, under the 1939 Act, PUP must also be ``in connection       with the operation of any project or division of a project.''       And under further Reclamation law and policy, PUP is only       available to Reclamation projects for which PUP was       explicitly authorized. The Reclamation Act of 1902 provides       that ``the title to and the management and operation of the       reservoirs and the works necessary for their protection and       operation shall remain in the Government until otherwise       provided by Congress.'' Sec. 6. So, without further       authorization from Congress, Reclamation projects must be       owned by the United States.        The Reclamation Manual at FAC 04-06 provides that       ``[p]roject use power is used to meet the electrical service       requirements of a Reclamation project pursuant to       congressional authorization.'' Further, the Reclamation       Manual defines Reclamation Project as ``those facilities or       features of a project constructed/developed/or transferred       to Reclamation under the authority of Federal Reclamation       law (or the Water Conservation and Utilization Act) for       which ownership is retained by the United States, unless       otherwise authorized by Congress.'' As with the 1902 and       1939 Acts, under the Reclamation Manual project use power       can only be provided to project facilities owned by the       United States unless Congress authorizes otherwise.        The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized the P-SMBP.       Subsection (a) of Section 9 of that Act approved the general       comprehensive plans set forth in H.D. 475 and S.D. 191, 78th       Congress 2nd Session. S.D. 191, at page 22, provides:        In the plan proposed, irrigation pumping with its       incidental power requirements plays a large part. The cost of       such power will be an important element in the irrigators'       annual expenses, and must be low if success is to be       achieved. Experience and study indicate that the cost per       kilowatt-hour should not exceed 2\1/2\ mills for energy       delivered to major project pumping plants.        (The current PUP rate is of course much higher than the       rate contemplated in 1944, but still a fraction of the market       rate.)        The Kinsey project was a federal irrigation project,       transferred to Reclamation as a part of the Flood Control Act       of 1944. Therefore, the Kinsey project was briefly a P-SMPB       unit. However, the Kinsey project ceased to be a Reclamation       project when the Company bought it two years later. Without       specific Congressional authority, facilities transferred by       title transfer are no longer able to receive PUP because they       are no longer federal projects.      B. The 1963 Report        Although the 1963 Report indicates in its exhibits that the       Kinsey project receives PUP, we interpret this inclusion as       an oversight resulting from to the fact that the Kinsey       project was initially a P-SMBP unit and had continued to       receive PUP.        Congress adopted the ``1963 Report'' by passing .the 1965       Garrison Diversion Unit legislation:        In addition to reauthorizing the initial stage of the       Garrison diversion unit, the approval of this legislation       will indicate acceptance by the Congress of the Department's       recommendations with respect to the overall financial       position of the Missouri River Basin project. About 3 years       ago, the committee requested the Department of the Interior       to study ways and means of placing the Missouri River Basin       project in a sound financial position and to report its       findings and recommendations to the Congress. A ``sound       financial position'' was interpreted to mean that commercial       power and municipal and industrial water investments would be       repaid with interest in not to exceed 50 years and that       irrigation investments would be repaid within 50 years plus       any authorized development period, including that portion to       be repaid from power revenues.        H.R. Rept. No. 282, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1965).       Identical language appeared in the 1964 report, H.R. Rept.       No. 1606, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1964), and the Senate       committee report contained a similar acknowledgement, S.       Rept. No. 470 (on S. 34). 89th Cong, 1st Sess. 4 (1965).        Thus, as with our recent memorandum on PUP at Frenchman-      Cambridge Unit, we interpret the presence or absence of a       unit in the 1963 Report as evidence of Congress's intent for       that unit. But even where the Kinsey project's inclusion in       the report is contrary evidence, it is not sufficient to       indicate clear Congressional intent to provide PUP to a       project that is otherwise completely private and without a       federal nexus .      C. The Current Contract with the Company        The provision of power to the Company at a PUP rate has       never been authorized, so Reclamation should seek to raise       the rate or terminate the current contract as soon as it is       practical. The contract contains a ``Modification of Rates''       provision allowing for the United States to promulgate a new       rate schedule for the contract (General Power Contract       Provisions, para. F). The provision sets forth the procedure       by which the United States gives notice to the Company of a       new rate schedule, and the Company has the option to       terminate its contract instead of accepting the new rate.                                V. Conclusion         Without clear Congressional intent to the contrary,       privately owned facilities are not eligible to receive PUP.       The Kinsey project was transferred to the Company in 1946,       and has been private for 68 years. The project has  [[Page H5182]]       no other federal nexus. Reclamation has no authority to       provide power to the Company at PUP rates. Reclamation should       stop doing so as soon as it is practical.        If you have any questions, please contact Bryan Wilson in       this office.                                   ____                                    U.S. Department of the Interior,                                         Office of the Solicitor,                               Billings, Montana, November 30, 2017.                                 Memorandum       To: Michael J. Ryan, Regional Director, Bureau of Reclamation           Great Plains Region, Billings, Attn: GP-4100 (Margaret           Ventling)      From: Karen L. Dunnigan, Field Solicitor, Office of the           Solicitor, Rocky Mountain Region (Billings)      Subject: Authority to Enter Into a Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin           Program (P-SMBP) Project Use Power (PUP) Contract with           Sidney Water Users Irrigation District (Sidney)                                 I. Question         In a November 9, 2017 memorandum, you asked if the Bureau       of Reclamation (Reclamation) is authorized to enter into a       PUP contract with Sidney.                               II. Brief Answer         Reclamation does not have and never had the authority to       enter into a PUP contract with Sidney, because the United       States never had an interest in Sidney's project, there is no       federal nexuswith Sidney, and no other authority exists to       allow Reclamation to provide PUP to Sidney. This situation is       similar to that of Kinsey Irrigation Company, addressed in       our memorandum dated March 10, 2014, except that Kinsey was       originally a Reclamation project.                               III. Background         The Sidney project was constructed by the State of Montana       in 1938. Reclamation entered into Contract No. L79R-449 with       Sidney's predecessor-in-interest, the Montana State Water       Conservation Board, on July 31, 1946, for seasonal irrigation       pumping power. Contract No. L79R-449 terminated and was       replaced by Contract 14-06-600-9164 on May 15, 1967. The       latter contract was supplemented and extended, and ultimately       was to expire on December 31, 2000. The State assigned the       contract to Sidney on June 30, 1997, and the Western Area       Power Administration extended the contract until December 31,       2020.                                 IV. Analysis         Pursuant to Reclamation Law and Policy, PUP is available       only where it has been specifically authorized by Congress       and, unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, only to       Reclamation projects. While the Kinsey project referenced       above was initially a federal project, the Sidney project has       never been federal or had a federal nexus. Accordingly,       Sidney is not and never was entitled to PUP.        Authority to produce and supply PUP is implied in the Town       Sites and Power Development Act of 1906 (Act of April 16,       1906, ch. 1631, 34 Stat. 116). PUP is further contemplated       under the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, at section 9(c),       which provides that:        Any sale of electric power . .  . made by the Secretary in       connection with the operation of any project or division of a       project, shall be for such periods, not to exceed forty       years, and at such rates as in his judgment will produce       power revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate       share of the construction investment at not less than 3 per       center per annum . . .        Thus, under the 1939 Act, PUP must also be ``in connection       with the operation of any project or division of a project.''       And under further Reclamation law and policy, PUP is only       available to Reclamation projects for which PUP was       explicitly authorized. The Reclamation Act of 1902 provides       that ``the title to and the management and operation of the       reservoirs and the works necessary for their protection and       operation shall remain in the Government until otherwise       provided by Congress.'' Sec. 6. So, without further       authorization from Congress, Reclamation projects must be       owned by the United States.        The Reclamation Manual at FAC 04-06 provides that PUP ``is       used to meet the electrical service requirements of a       Reclamation project pursuant to congressional       authorization.'' Further, the Reclamation Manual defines a       Reclamation project as ``those facilities or features of a       project constructed/developed/or transferred to Reclamation       under the authority of Federal Reclamation law (or the Water       Conservation and Utilization Act) for which ownership is       retained by the United States, unless otherwise authorized by       Congress.'' As with the 1902 and 1939 Acts, under the       Reclamation Manual PUP can only be provided to project       facilities owned by the United States unless Congress       authorizes otherwise.        The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized the P-SMBP.       Subsection (a) of Section 9 of that Act approved the general       comprehensive plans set forth in H.D. 475 and S.D. 191, 78th       Congress 2nd Session. S.D. 191, at page 22, provides:        In the plan proposed, irrigation pumping with its       incidental power requirements plays a large part. The cost of       such power will be an important element in the irrigators'       annual expenses, and must be low if success is to be       achieved. Experience and study indicate that the cost per       kilowatt-hour should not exceed 2\1/2\ mills for energy       delivered to major project pumping plants.        (The current PUP rate is of course much higher than the       rate contemplated in 1944, but still a fraction of the market       rate.)        Sidney was always a state project. and it is unclear why it       was ever provided PUP. Without specific Congressional       authority, non-federal projects are not eligible to receive       PUP.                                V. Conclusion         Without clear Congressional intent to the contrary, non-      federal facilities are not eligible to receive PUP. Sidney is       not and has never been federal, and has no federal nexus.       Reclamation has no authority to provide power to Sidney at       PUP rates.        If you have any questions, please contact Bryan Wilson in       this office.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Congressman   Greg Walden for his sponsorship  of the House companion bill, H.R. 7116, that makes the needed  noncontroversial technical corrections to the Klamath Basin Water  Supply Act so that all the benefits can be accessed.   Congressman Gianforte is also supporting his constituents as the  House sponsor of H.R. 3471, which mirrors Montana's provisions that are  contained within S. 3758.   Again, I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  worked hard to resolve this issue so that folks in these regions can  have certainty about the water that they so desperately need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
