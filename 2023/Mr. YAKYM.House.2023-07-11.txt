 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jeremy Stutsman, who  recently completed his tenure of dedicated service as the mayor of  Goshen, Indiana.   Before stepping down last month, Jeremy had served as mayor of Goshen  since January of 2016, and he holds the distinction of being the  youngest mayor elected in Goshen's history of nearly 200 years.   Prior to becoming mayor, Jeremy also served on the City Council and  Redevelopment Commission, and his record of serving Goshen runs over  two decades deep.   Jeremy and I might belong to different political parties, but I  couldn't be more proud to count this good man with a servant's heart as  a friend.   Since leaving the mayor's office, Jeremy has hit the ground running  in his new role of CEO of Lacasa, a local nonprofit that helps lower- income Hoosiers attain affordable housing and achieve financial  stability.   I saw Jeremy just a few weeks ago at a ribbon cutting ceremony for  some of Lacasa's newly renovated homes, and I can attest that Lacasa is  indeed in very good hands.   We congratulate Jeremy on a job well done as mayor. May he keep up  the good work in his new role. May God bless him and his family.                                time  1915   UPDATING U.S. TRADE REMEDY LAWS AND COMBATING UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES    (Mr. MRVAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1  minute.)
