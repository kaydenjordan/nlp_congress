 Mr. Speaker, in the Judiciary Committee right now,  we are holding hearings to fight against the scourge of voter  suppression and the unfortunate abolishment of section 5 by the Shelby  case. I heard shouts of hallelujah when that case was abolished. The  reason is because we are here today denying citizens of the United  States the right to be represented fairly in the United States  Congress.   The 23rd Amendment?   Well, I can cite for you the 14th Amendment and the 15th Amendment,  not depriving people of their liberty and their justice.   What about those soldiers who shed blood from the District of  Columbia? What about those who are paying taxes from the District of  Columbia? What about the very citizens who work to move the engine of  government living in the District of Columbia?   My friends know that the Capitol will be separated. My friends  understand that there is a basic constitutional unfairness when you  deny people the right to vote.   I wonder whether or not the problem is that, when I first arrived  here many years ago, it was called chocolate city.  [[Page H2075]]    Let us not make this a racial issue. Let us make this a justice  issue, a constitutional issue. It is important, Mr. Speaker. Vote for  this legislation, for the 51st State.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, as  an original cosponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act,''  which declares the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, to be a  State of the United States of America, and declares its admission into  the Union on an equal footing with the other States in all respects  whatsoever.   In passing this legislation, we remove a stain that has blighted our  nation for more than 200 years.   Today, we vote to end two centuries of shame and correct an injustice  to the citizens of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of one indisputable and shameful  fact: nearly 500,000 people living in the District of Columbia lack  direct voting representation in the House of Representatives and  Senate.   Specifically, the citizens of the District of Columbia pay more in  federal taxes than 22 states and pay more in federal taxes per capita  than any state.   The District of Columbia's population (705,000) is larger than the  populations of Wyoming and Vermont, and seven states had populations  under one million in the last census.   The District of Columbia's annual budget ($15.5 billion) is larger  than the budgets of 14 states.   The District of Columbia has a higher per capita personal income and  gross domestic product than any state.   District of Columbia residents have fought and died in every American  war, including the Revolution itself, and almost 200,000 District  residents have served in the military since World War I alone.   Approximately 30,000 veterans live in the District of Columbia, and  it should be noted that during the Vietnam War, 243 District residents  were casualties of war, a casualty figure greater than that observed by  10 different states.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is undisputable that residents of the District of  Columbia serve in the military, pay billions of dollars in federal  taxes each year, and assume other responsibilities of U.S. citizenship.   But for over 200 years, the District of Columbia has been denied  voting representation in Congress--the entity that has ultimate  authority over all aspects of the city's legislative, executive, and  judicial functions.   Mr. Speaker, if a person can be called upon to pay federal taxes and  serve in the armed forces of the United States, then he or she should  at least have the opportunity to vote for a representative who could at  least cast a symbolic vote in this chamber on critical matters facing  our nation.   Issues like war and peace, equality, and justice.   And tear-gassing peaceful protestors in Lafayette Square exercising  their First Amendment rights.   Mr. Speaker, taxation without representation is tyranny.   H.R. 51 would create a state from essentially the eight hometown  wards of the District of Columbia and provides that the new state would  be equal to the other 50 states in all respects, and that the residents  of the State of Washington, D.C. would have all the rights of  statehood, including voting representation in Congress and full local  self-government   Under the legislation this new state would have no jurisdiction over  the reduced federal district, which would consist of the area that  Members of Congress and visitors associate with the capital of our  country: the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Supreme Court, the White House, the  principal federal monuments, and the federal buildings and grounds  adjacent to the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol.   It is unconscionable that more than a half million American citizens  are being unconscionably denied a vote and a voice in the most  important legislative body in the world.   As a supporter of freedom, democracy, and equality, I believe that it  is long overdue for the citizens of the District of Columbia to have  representation in the House and the Senate to advocate for their  interests on vital matters coming before the Congress of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, it is wrong that we must be reminded daily by license  plates in the District of Columbia that ``Taxation without  representation is tyranny.''   The people in Boston felt so strongly about this in 1775 that they  rebelled in Boston Harbor, launching the ``Boston Tea Party.''   The principle that political authority derives from the consent of  the government is no less applicable when it comes to the District of  Columbia.   Let us be clear, there is no dispute that hundreds of thousands of  American citizens reside in the District of Columbia.   We all agree that universal suffrage is the hallmark of a democratic  regime, of which the United States is the world's leading exemplar.   None of us believes it is fair that citizens of the District of  Columbia pay federal taxes, risk life and limb fighting wars abroad to  protect American democracy and extend the blessings of liberty to  people living in foreign lands.   In short, there is no moral reason to deny the citizens of the  District of Columbia admission as a state in the United States and the  right to full representation in Congress.   The only question is whether Congress has the will and the  constitutional authority to do so.   Congress has always had the constitutional authority but for much of  the last 200 years, it has not had the will.   Let us change that, beginning today with our vote to pass H.R. 51,  the Washington, D.C. Admission Act.    Madam Speaker, we have had a tumultuous, but yet  invigorating 2 weeks. Just a week ago, we were able, in the Judiciary  Committee, to pass H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop  Reparation Proposals.   Those who voted for it came from all parts of the country and  represented all racial groups. It was a wonderful experience of  understanding the cruciality and recognizing the slave history of  African Americans and further developing proposals to deal with the  dastardly impacts on African Americans.   We are delighted to have the support of Japanese Americans, Hispanic  Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and, of course, White Americans  because they understand the healing power of H.R. 40.   Then we just recently had a judgment--as I have said on this floor, I  know the Floyd family. They are America's family.   We had a judgment on Tuesday that showed the strength of America and  her justice system and the recognition that we are all created equal  and each one has to be held accountable for his actions.   So this has been a good week. America needs to know that. We look  forward to passing H.R. 40 on this floor in celebration of the  commemoration of Juneteenth when slaves were finally freed and passing  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.                            ____________________
