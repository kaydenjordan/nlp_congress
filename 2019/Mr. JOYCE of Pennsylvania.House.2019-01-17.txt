 Madam Speaker, today, I join my colleagues  in rising to support the dignity of human life, and no time is more  appropriate to do so than when we approach the 46th anniversary of Roe  v. Wade.   Not only was the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling a judicial overreach, it  was an assault on a fundamental truth that is essential to our  democracy, the truth that all people are created in the image and  likeness of God and that all people have the right to life.   Protecting that precious, God-given gift of life is not just  something I talk about; it is part of my identity as a doctor. When I  graduated from medical school, I pledged never to perform, assist, or  facilitate an abortion. The people of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District have sent me to Washington to apply that pledge to my work in  Congress as well.                            ____________________
