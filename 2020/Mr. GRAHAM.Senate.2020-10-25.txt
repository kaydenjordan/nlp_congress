 Mr. President, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, it  is my honor to speak on the floor about this nomination, which I think  is historic in many facets and all positive from my point of view.   We have before the committee the nomination of Judge Barrett, who  currently sits on the Seventh Judicial Circuit. She is one of the most  impressive people I have ever met. Two days of hearings; answering  every question thrown to her with grace and judicial demeanor. I think  it should be the gold standard for every other nominee.   I want to thank my staff, beginning with Lee Holmes, the director.  Lee has done such a great job on the Judiciary Committee and has done a  lot of things--some contentious and some not. I want to thank Lee for  shepherding this nomination and the fine work he has done.   Mike Fragoso--Mike, I got your first name right anyway. He is just  outstanding. He has done a terrific job.   The permanent nominations unit for the Judiciary Committee includes  Lauren Mehler, Raija Churchill, Tim Rodriguez, Watson Horner, and Akhil  R-A-J-A-S-E-K-A-R--I don't want to butcher your name. They all worked  incredibly hard for 135 article III judges, not just this one.   In addition, Lucas Croslow joined my staff to lead the team of  special counsels assisting with the Barrett nomination. That included  Sidd Dadhich, D-A-D-H-I-C-H, Joe Falvey, Abby Hollenstein, Eric Palmer,  and Robert Smith. They went through the entire record presented by  Judge Barrett to make sure we would be prepared for the confirmation  process.   The law clerks were Matt Simpson, Emily Hall, Megan Cairn, and Peter  Singhal. I would like to thank the Judiciary Committee's press  secretary, Taylor Reidy. They did a great job, along with George  Hartmann, as well as our deputy staff director, Joe Keeley.   The bottom line is, all of them worked really hard. They made  history. They should be proud and tell  [[Page S6583]]  their grandkids about all this. Well done.   To my Democratic colleagues, I know you didn't like what we did, but  I do appreciate the way you conducted yourselves in the hearing. It  wasn't a circus. I think you challenged the judge appropriately during  your time. We had 4 days of hearings. We heard from a variety of people  about Judge Barrett.   In terms of the process, it was well within what we have done in the  past. In every Judiciary Committee markup regarding a Supreme Court  Justice, we have done the same thing. The first day is opening  statements, then 2 days of questions, and the final day is input from  outside groups. That is what we were able to do here. So she went  through the process like every other nominee since I have been here.   But let me just say this to my Democratic colleagues. It is not about  the process. You will find ways to make sure that most of you can't  vote for anybody we nominate. It really does break my heart.   With Roberts, 78 to 22, that was sort of the norm. I think Alito got  96 and Ginsburg got 97. Maybe I got the numbers right. I can't remember  who got what, but one got 96 and one got 97. It used to not be this  way. It used to be different.   We looked at the qualifications and said: OK, you are good to go. You  are a person of integrity. You are smart. You are well rounded. You are  knowledgeable in the law. You may have a different philosophy than I  have, but we understand elections matter. And everybody accepted the  election outcome. Those days are over, absolutely completely over and  destroyed. There is nobody any Republican President can ever nominate,  I think, who is not going to face a hard time. That is too bad. That is  the way it is.   Alito, 58 to 42--Judge Alito was well known on our side of the aisle.  He was the kind of person you would be looking at to promote to the  Supreme Court. President Bush nominated him. Well within the  mainstream. Roberts and Alito were well known in the conservative  world, being ver bright court of appeals judges whom any Republican  President would be looking at to put on the Court if they ever had an  opportunity. There is no difference between Alito and Roberts, but  Alito went through hell. But he made it, and he got 58 votes.    So then along comes President Obama. He gets two picks--Sotomayor, 68  votes to 31. I think she deserved more, but 68 is pretty darn good. I  was glad to vote for her. I saw that she was qualified. Then we had  Elena Kagan, 63 votes. You can see the trend here. Both of them were  Obama nominees, 68 and 63, and I thought Elena Kagan was highly  qualified. She had a different judicial philosophy. She was a dean of  the law school at Harvard but worked for the Solicitor General's  Office. Both of them had been with the liberal side of the Court most  every case but not all. I am not surprised the way they decided cases.  I think they are tremendously well-qualified women and should be  sitting on the Court. That is exactly who you would expect a Democratic  President to pick--Sotomayor and Kagan.   So now we come back. Trump wins. Nobody thought he would win,  including me. I voted for somebody in 2016 I wouldn't know if he walked  through the door--Evan McMullin. I think I met him once. I had my  challenge for President Trump during the 2016 primary. He beat me like  a drum. I accepted my defeat. I have been trying to help him ever  since, and I think he has done a really good job of sending to the  Senate highly qualified judges. He has gotten input from a lot of  different people--the Federalist Society, you name it--a lot of  different people.   Gorsuch and Kavanaugh had one thing in common: They were in my top  three recommendations. Any Republican President looking to nominate  somebody to the Supreme Court would be looking at Gorsuch and  Kavanaugh. These are not exotic picks. They are in the mold of  Sotomayor and Kagan in terms of qualifications.   So what happened? Gorsuch was the first attempt at a partisan  filibuster. We had three votes to get 60, and we couldn't, so we  changed the rules for the Supreme Court like they changed the rules in  2013 for the district court and court of appeals. If we had not,  Gorsuch wouldn't be on the Court. And to say he is not qualified is a  joke. It is an insult to him and says more about you than it does Judge  Gorsuch. If you can't see he is qualified, you are blinded by your  hatred of Trump. So he made it, but we had to change the rules. We  hated to do it but had to do it because in any other time, Gorsuch  would have gotten the same type votes as Roberts because he is just  highly qualified.   Then comes along Kavanaugh. Nothing about process there. There was no  process argument. Right at the very end, the last day of the hearing  when we thought it was all over, you give us a letter that you had for  weeks, an allegation against the judge. It would have been nice to  share it with him so he could tell his side of the story, but you chose  not to do that. You had it precooked with the press outlets, and  everything blew up.   So all of us on the committee had to decide what to do. I sat down  with Senator Flake and Senator Collins, and we felt like the  allegations had to be heard. They are made. I know a lot of people on  our side thought it was unfair, dirty pool, but we had the opportunity  to have the hearing, and the rest is history. It was high drama.   All I can say is that something happened to the person who accused  Judge Kavanaugh, but I don't believe Judge Kavanaugh had anything to do  with it. This was a party in high school. Ms. Ford couldn't remember  where it was and who was there. The people who were said to have been  there said they don't remember anything like it happened.   Judge Kavanaugh hasn't lived a life like what was being described. He  was accused by four or five people. Three of them actually made it up.  I hope some of them go to jail for lying to the committee and the  country. They were trying to make him a rapist and drugging women in  high school, and what was his annual all about? It was the most  sickening episode in my time in the Senate. They were hell-bent on  destroying this guy's life based on a bunch of manufactured lies and  evidence that wouldn't get you out of the batter's box in any court of  law in the land.   And here we are, 50 to 48. What I saw there was a turning point for  me. We cannot continue to do this. You are going to drive good people  away. And I am hoping that the Barrett hearings, which were far more  civil and far more traditional, will be a turning point because I don't  know who the next President will be, but there will be an opening, I am  sure, on the Court. I am hoping that the next hearing is more like  Barrett's and less like Kavanaugh's, no matter who wins.   Now, Barrett. I understand the concern about the process. This is the  latest we have ever confirmed somebody. You heard all the arguments  about when the President is of one party and the Senate of a different  party; you have had one confirmation in 100-some years; that most of  the time, when the President is of the same party as the Senate, they  go through. I understand.    The bottom line is, we gave her the same type hearing that Alito,  Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh had. My Democratic colleagues  showed up at the hearing, they participated, they pushed her hard, but  I don't think they went across the line. They decided not to show up  for markup. I hate that, but that is the way it is.   I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the person who is  going onto the Court in about an hour.   If you are looking for somebody a Republican would be picking,  regardless of the process, it would be Judge Barrett. She would be on  anybody's list.   I listened to Senator Durbin, who is a good friend, and we will work  on whatever comes our way after the election. I find that he is  somebody you can work on hard things like immigration with. But his  description of Judge Barrett simply doesn't pass scrutiny.   He is trying to make a character of this person that doesn't exist.  There is nothing exotic about Judge Barrett. She is very mainstream in  our world. All I can say is that after 2 days of hearings, the American  people, by 51 percent--it is pretty hard to figure that in this  country, you get 51 percent agreement on anything--felt like she should  be going onto the Court.   Here is what Dean O'Hara said, the dean of Notre Dame Law School, who  [[Page S6584]]  hired Amy Barrett to be a professor at Notre Dame:         I have only communicated with this august committee on two       occasions. The first was ten years ago when I wrote a strong       letter in support of now-Justice Elena Kagan, whose term as       dean of Harvard Law School overlapped with my own. The second       is today introducing and endorsing Amy Coney Barrett in       equally strong terms. Some might find these recommendations       to be in juxtaposition, but I find them entirely consistent.    To anybody wondering about Judge Barrett, I would highly recommend  that you look at the ABA's recommendations and the process they used to  find her ``well qualified.'' Not one person uttered a negative word  about her character, according to the ABA. Someone said to the ABA: The  myth is real. She is a staggering academic mind. She is incredibly  honest and forthright. She is exactly who you think she is. Nothing  about her is fake. She is good, she is decent, she is selfless, and she  is sincere. She is an exemplar of living an integrated life.   The Standing Committee would have been hard-pressed to come up with  any conclusion other than that Judge Barrett has demonstrated  professional competence that is exceptional. Then they had a committee  to look at her writings--all of her writings. They accepted input from  944 people she has interacted with in her professional life. Not one  negative comment.   So forget about what politicians say about Judge Barrett. Forget  about what people who don't recognize President Trump as being a  legitimate President say about Judge Barrett. Forget about what I say  if you want to. Look at what people who worked with her said, who are  in the law business, who know her individually and have worked with her  as a judge, as a professor, and they conclude without any doubt that  she is one of the most gifted people to ever be nominated to the  Supreme Court.   There is nothing exotic about Judge Barrett. She is going onto the  Court in about an hour. That is exactly where she needs to be. She is  the type of person who has lived a life worthy of being nominated. She  is the type of person who is worthy of receiving a large vote in the  Senate, but she won't get it.   She is not going to get one Democratic vote. Write her out of the  process if you want to. That is fine. But what about the others? All I  can say is that we are going to have an election here in about a week,  and whatever happens, I am going to acknowledge the winner when it is  all said and done.   It may go to the Supreme Court. I don't know. But there will be a day  that we know who won, and I am going to accept those results, and I am  going to do with the next President what I have tried to do with this  one and every other one--try to find a way forward on things that are  hard to keep the country moving forward.   To the majority leader and the minority leader, it is a tough place  around here now. This, too, shall pass. But this is about Judge  Barrett. This is about her time, her moment. She has done everything  you would expect of her. She has exceeded every challenge put in her  way. She has impressed everybody she has worked with. She has impressed  the country. She is going onto the Court because that is where she  deserves to be.   As to us in the Senate, maybe down the road we can get back to the  way we used to be. I don't know. But I do know this. There is nothing  exotic about Judge Barrett. She is as mainstream as it gets from our  side of the aisle.   When it comes to people outside of politics looking at her, it was  universal: ``highly qualified,'' ``highly competent,'' ``ready to serve  this country as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.''   My last thought: It is hard to be a conservative person of color.  That is a very difficult road to hoe in modern American politics. My  good friend Tim Scott is a great voice for conservatism. And Tim--a lot  of things were said about Tim that were said about nobody else on our  side of the aisle. He is tough. He can handle it. The same for  conservative women.   Judge Barrett did not abandon her faith. She embraces it. But she  said: I embrace my faith. But as a judge, it will not be the rule of  Amy. It will be the rule of law. It will be the facts. It will be the  law and the outcome dictated by the law, not by anything I personally  believe.   I will say this. For the young, conservative women out there who are  pro-life and embrace your faith, there is a seat at the table for you.  This is historic. This nomination is different. This is a breakthrough  for conservative young women.   I was honored to be the chair of the committee that reported out  Judge Barrett to the floor of the Senate, and I am going to be honored  to cast my vote to put her on the Supreme Court, exactly where she  deserves to be.   I yield the floor.
