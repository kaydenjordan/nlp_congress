 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this pandemic has been ruthless. With over half a  million lives lost, we are a nation in a constant state of mourning.  Sadly, we cannot take away the pain and the suffering of our friends,  neighbors, and loved ones. But with this seismic legislation, we are  delivering much-needed help and relief to millions of our fellow  Americans.   In a few minutes, this Chamber will pass and then send to President  Biden a monumental piece of legislation that will begin to turn the  tide of an unprecedented health and economic crisis.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for the confidence that she offered to  the Ways and Means Committee as we wrote most of this legislation.   In the 33 years that I have served in this House, I don't know that I  will ever cast a more important vote than what we are about to do and  of such great consequence in but a few minutes.   I am immensely proud of the work that the Ways and Means Committee  members did to make this legislation a reality. We heard the American  people, and we went big. We proudly contributed substantial solutions  that will strengthen our recovery from this virus and rebuild our  economy to work better for all Americans. The Ways and Means Committee  was responsible for $1 trillion of this expenditure.    To contain the public health crisis and make health coverage more  accessible, we are making the largest expansion of the Affordable Care  Act since it was enacted and which the Ways and Means Committee helped  to write. We are bringing down costs for jobless Americans saving them  thousands of dollars in health insurance costs and more. We will also  include assistance for nursing homes that are desperate to contain this  virus.   We are going to help those struggling to stay afloat by putting cash  in their pockets and simultaneously creating liquidity and demand. For  the jobless, we extend Federal unemployment benefits to keep them  afloat for the better days that lie ahead.   We have made three key tax credits for low- and middle-income workers  and families more generous, more flexible, and more capable of tackling  the inequality and concentrated wealth that exists in our country. We  already know that a key to our recovery will be giving parents the  tools to go back to work even though their previous childcare may have  been upended. We will ease their worries by making childcare more  accessible and indeed more affordable.   The child tax credit will lift millions out of poverty, and the  expanded earned-income tax credit will put money into the pockets of  the lowest-income workers.   Mr. Speaker, listen to this following statistic: All in all, there  will be an increase in aftertax income for the poorest 20 percent of  Americans by increasing their income by 20 percent. That is a  staggering achievement. It is a life-changing achievement.   Lastly, we also made a long overdue fix to multiemployer pension  programs that will protect hard-earned savings of workers, many of whom  have been on the front lines of this crisis. These  [[Page H1272]]  are people who have played by the rules, served our country in the  military, and worked day in and day out with the promise of a secure  retirement not to have it pulled from under them. I would remind all  that 30 Republicans on two separate occasions have voted for this bill  as a standalone measure.   I heard a previous speaker say: This is a bailout. It is a backstop.   In addition, perhaps that individual didn't understand the PBGC,  because if we didn't come to the support of these pensions, it would  take down the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which insures all  pensions for Americans in the private sector.   I cannot stress enough--these provisions are going to change lives.  We are not creating a narrative talking about changing lives, we are  going to do it with this legislation.   We are doing the right thing, not only because of what we have been  saying that we would do for years--this is the moment--but this  legislation has the support of economists from the left, the right, and  the center. This is about the power of ideas. But because it is what  the American people want also, let me be clear: the American people,  regardless of political affiliation, overwhelmingly support this  package because they know what is in it is badly needed to get to the  other side of the crisis.   I regret that the overwhelming support that I have just described has  not been translated into unity in this Chamber. This is bipartisan in  America even if it is not bipartisan in this Chamber.   Our colleagues on the other side have deemed workers who saw their  entire industries evaporate perhaps unworthy of this moment. They have  deemed working parents perhaps unworthy of this moment, and they have  deemed the working- and middle-class American family perhaps at this  moment unworthy.   I don't understand it.   Instead, there has been a lot of talk about this package being too  large and too expensive. But if there was ever a time to go big, this  should be it.   Shouldn't helping struggling American families be worth the size of  this bill?   I seem to recall that my colleagues found that wealthy Americans and  big corporations were worth the size of their tax cut. So why not  working- and middle-class families who are facing a health and economic  crisis unlike anything the Nation has experienced in more than a  century?   I actually have some charts that I think highlight the difference  today. We have two comparisons of who benefits from the American Rescue  Plan and who benefited in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is pretty  apparent and pretty obvious to all who might discern in this moment.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, the benefits that my colleagues across  the aisle will oppose today go directly to working-class Americans.   However, with the next chart, Mr. Speaker, you can look at their  package, and it was nearly the same size. By the way, they borrowed  $2.3 trillion for it. It had overwhelming support from their side of  the aisle. But look who the benefits went to. The evidence is  overwhelming as to who the benefits went to.   This package is nearly the same size as what they did, but the impact  of what we are about to do will be extraordinary.   Multiple reports have highlighted how the tax cuts bill did not, as  proponents claimed, grow the economy or indeed--the great hoax--pay for  itself. That never happened. Yet they continue to stand behind a law  that put the powerful and the wealthy first, and they dismiss what we  are about to do today.   Hardworking Americans have been for too long left behind, and that  ends today. This bill will save lives and livelihoods. We will help  families stay housed, put food on the table, and access affordable  healthcare. Most importantly, this package will help families avoid  impossible choices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to rise to this moment and support  this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is the chairman of the Select Revenue  Measures Subcommittee, which plays a central role in tax policy. And  repeatedly, he assures me that he is of modest income and from  California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), my friend and chairman of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade and a  valued senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), chairman of the Subcommittee on Social  Security and tireless champion of ensuring the delivery of stimulus  checks to low-income retirees.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York, my friend, knows  that that decision was rendered by a federal judge, not by this  Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight, who has led on a  number of provisions, including extending the earned income tax credit  to Puerto Rico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of our House.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad Mr. Hoyer also pointed out that many  of us did support President Bush's rescue package. I voted for it  twice.   We met with Hank Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, in the Ways  and Means Committee library, and he said, ``You have to do this.'' We  followed suit and supported it.   It has come to my attention that there is some uncertainty about the  effective date of one of the provisions in the American Rescue Plan Act  of 2021. In section 9706 of the bill, we allow single-employer pension  plans to measure their liabilities by using interest rates that are  closer to historical norms, rather than the low interest rates that are  in effect today in part because of the pandemic. This provision will  enable both plans and participants to weather this crisis far better.  I'd like to clarify an issue relating to the effective date of this  provision. Plans can choose to have the provision apply starting in  2020. In addition, plans can elect to have the provision apply starting  in 2022, so that it does not apply until 2022. It also is our intent  that plans can elect for the provision to apply starting in 2021. We  believe that is the right interpretation of the language of the bill.  We want to give plans the maximum flexibility in this regard so that  tomorrow's retirees can achieve a secure retirement. My staff has run  this interpretation by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and  they also agree that an election to have the interest rate smoothing  apply starting in 2021 is permitted by the language in the American  Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis), the chair of the Worker and Family Support  Subcommittee, who has been a champion for the expanded childcare credit  in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), who was a lead supporter of expanding the  child tax credit and a longstanding advocate for helping laid-off  workers through COBRA.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who has  been a powerful voice for home-visiting programs and the help they  provide to pregnant women and children.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who  has been a tireless champion for this legislation's historic expansion  of the child tax credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a champion of all things Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee,  who played a central role in shepherding this legislation through 2  days of Ways and Means consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who  has been a leader on expanding the earned income tax credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who  was one of the loudest voices for expanding the employee retention tax  credit and a leader on all provisions that will improve care for  nursing home residents.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez), a valued member of the Ways and Means  Committee, who fought hard to ensure that all mixed-status families are  eligible to receive the economic impact payments and emergency  assistance under this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who has  been a champion for provisions to shore up the multiemployer pensions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining  on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a most significant day, and this legislation  meets the challenge of history and calls Americans to act upon this  crisis. This is the opportunity now, and we should act.   This is not about self-correction. Far too much is at stake.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues and, particularly, the Committee  on Ways and Means' staff, who wore many hats through this, from  crafting this package to the brutal negotiations with the Senate. They  worked long hours while facing the same challenges presented by remote  school, lack of childcare, and concern for family members that  Americans face every moment through this crisis. There are too many  names to include, but I know that their counsel has been unparalleled  and their expertise always unmatched.   Mr. Speaker, over the Speaker's rostrum is a magnificent admonition  from a son of Massachusetts, Mr. Webster: ``Let us develop the  resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its  institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also  in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be  remembered.'' That is what we are going to do in the next few minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the House, whose attention to legislative  detail is extraordinary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
