 Mr. Speaker, I am calling this Special Order hour the  40-year address, not to self-aggrandize, although I am marking that  milestone year on Saturday when the House Chamber is not open and I  will not be able to make such an address, but more so to reflect, to  look back, to comment on how we got here, and on what it means as  Michigan's 11th District has only had in the 187 years of our State's  existence 25 Members of Congress.   I happen to be the 25th Member of Congress to hold Michigan's 11th  District, and I happen to be the first woman to ever represent  Michigan's 11th District and, therefore, the first woman to ever turn  40 in Michigan's 11th Congressional District.   By right, I also claim that I am the first millennial whom Michigan  ever sent to Congress in the year 2018. It was that magnificent year  when many men and women stood up to run for Congress. A lot of us  called ourselves the never evers. We had never ever run for office  before, but we felt a call to serve in the face of what we saw as  leadership taking this country backwards, leadership in the Oval  Office, leadership that was putting forward terminology that was dubbed  the Muslim ban in the early 21st century which was almost inconceivable  particularly for me representing and coming from southeastern Michigan,  a place of great Arab-American presence and all the frustration that we  felt with governance by Twitter and anti-democratic principles, but  more so because of love of country.   I could start with when I got to Congress, but I don't think that  would be totally appropriate because there was a journey to getting  here, and it is a journey we are sharing in this largely empty Chamber  before the C-SPAN cameras and before the folks watching at home of what  brought us here and what brought me here.   I did not come from a family that was preordained to send a daughter  to Congress. I was born in the eighties, a decade I barely remember,  partly because a person doesn't gain full consciousness as a human  being until age 5, so largely the eighties were not that memorable. Of  course, my parents have great memories of that decade and the decade  prior to it.   My parents are surely incredible people, incredibly hardworking  Michiganders. My mom came to Michigan by way of Oakland University. She  graduated a year early. She was always ahead of her time. She worked  her way through school. In the school cafeteria she was washing dishes.  I think she finished school 3 years early.   She probably wanted to do something in the STEM field but,  interestingly, the woman who went on to Congress and founded the Women  and STEM Caucus is the daughter of a woman who was told the only thing  she could study in school was either education or art history. So she  studied art history, and she is to this day, obviously, a masterful  painter.   More than that, my mother's life is determined by very hard work and  exceptional brilliance, tinkering around with electronics and masterful  woodcarving. I have one of the lifelike carved eagles that she did in  the nineties in my office in the Rayburn House Office Building.   She met my father at Oakland University. He was still working on  school, and my dad had started a landscaping business right when he was  out of high school. Again, he was so dogged at that practice of working  with the earth and working with the soil and planting the trees and  knowing every type of plant, bush, and shrub out there, how to design  it and make it look good.   Of course, my parents ended up going into business together. They  were just kids in the seventies. Oh, gosh, they were hippies. I know my  mom has stories, of course, of hitchhiking the country. We do not do  that really today; there is Uber.   She hitchhiked the country. She also marched for women's rights and  protested against the Vietnam war and went on to this endeavor called  Nitro Feed with my father.   They had multiple acres of land out in Macomb County in Utica for  this endeavor of theirs, this landscaping business that became the  first tree spray company in Michigan.   In the winter when we couldn't landscape in Michigan, they would plow  snow. My dad would plow the snow. The inside joke in my family was that  my dad would wake up at any hour to the sound of the snow falling to  make sure that people could get to work and that they could park in  their parking lots. They employed a lot of people, and they had a lot  of fun. Like folks were doing in the eighties and nineties, they were  making a little bit of money.   Of course, my mom went into business with her sister. These are two  female trailblazers. We always say that my Aunt Marcie is sort of the  third parent and matriarch of our family. These two sisters are  daughters of a woman who had four sisters and Italian roots that trace  back to Cleveland, Ohio.   Interestingly, as I am making this address on the eve of my personal  anniversary, my colleague, Congresswoman Shontel Brown who hails from  Cleveland, Ohio, and represents the 11th District of Ohio, and we call  ourselves twin sisters because we share a birthday and we share a  district number.   Then I say: My family came from Cleveland, in Mayfield Heights, in an  old Italian neighborhood. Of course, this is something that sisters  from the Midwest know about hard work and communication.   The business that my aunt and mother got into was communications.  They were in advertising. And, again, a lot of hard work and trials and  tribulations but a whole heck of a lot of fun transforming our State  and the dialogue of healthcare and how women talk about healthcare,  talking about menopause, mammograms, and things that were taboo in the  nineties and that great awakening that we had around mental health.   So some of these life reflections of my family and the things that  they exposed me to are something that is very humbling to share on this  House floor.   I was born in Rochester Hills, Michigan. I like to say that I took my  first breath of air from ZIP Code 48309 at the old Crittenton Hospital.   Of course, Rochester Hills' claim to fame is that is where Madonna,  the singer, the 1980s phenomenon, was from. Her mother, Joan Ciccone,  ran a small daycare that I attended as a toddler and a little bit into  elementary school.   Again, family business, good Italian family business, and there are  stories from the neighborhoods of friends, mothers, or parents who knew  Madonna in high school. We, of course, remember Mrs. Ciccone picking up  the phone and saying: Hello, Madonna. My brother, who doesn't like any  attention, remembers one time that Madonna came to visit. He swears  Madonna came to visit.   That was growing up in Rochester Hills, what was largely known as  exurban, the suburbs outside of the suburbs. Now it is a little more  populated and built up. My mother can certainly remember stories of  sledding down Rochester Road before all the businesses moved in. Of  course, I remember walking down Alston Street with my good friend,  Rachel, to elementary school. She is my dearest--I like to call her my  oldest friend but sometimes oldest feels disparaging, but she is my  longest friend in life.   We would walk down Alston together, and there are a lot of funny  stories about me being fearful of her family dog who barely could move  and me not wanting to ring her doorbell.   The reason I share these personal reflections and these stories is  that I certainly was not afraid to put my hand up and get involved in  student activities and student governments or theater or performances  or things like that, but I also share these stories because nothing in  life is fully ever determined.   We know that we make our own destiny. My running for office  eventually one day in life was not something preordained. It was not a  given that I was going to come to Congress. I know so many of my  colleagues through so many of their personal trials and tribulations  join me in sharing this message to the next generation which is that  life is uncertain and growing up is tough.   This new generation, our Generation Z, who is racked with the unique  challenges of this century, a global pandemic--we just saw the headline  this morning about test scores still being  [[Page H3058]]  behind--and certainly the challenges of climate change and gun  violence, that compels us. When you are young and you are still  dependent and you are maybe just getting out of those teenage years,  Mr. Speaker, into early adulthood and wondering how you are going to  make your way in the world, it is important to recall and to look to  those who have done what no one called to ask them to do, but just what  they felt compelled to do and to make a difference.   I firmly believe that we still need to believe in this place. We  still need to believe in this institution. I could be doing something  else this evening, but I have really believed and thought that it would  be important to give this address in the House Congressional Record  spoken verbally. Sometimes you can write these addresses and just  submit them for the Record, but I wanted to take the time to speak  these words.   It just so happens that speaking these words on this day, June 21-- the solstice--is really actually quite remarkable. The solstice is a  day that comes twice a year. It either comes when it is today when the  sun is reaching its maximum destination or its maximum declining and  the longest or shortest day of the year. My mother was actually born on  the shortest day of the year. Today is the longest day of the year,  and, of course, then it begins the reaching toward the shortest day. It  also marks summer.   I haven't spent too much time outside today here in Washington, D.C.,  in the Nation's Capital. It has been a very unusual late spring, now  first day of summer. It is cold in Washington. It is 60-some degrees  and raining. One reaches for a shawl on weather like today.   I have a friend back home in Michigan whom I asked: What is the  weather like at home?   He shared that it is 80 degrees in my beloved Michigan, and it is the  perfect ringing day to summer.   It is, of course, also unique and special in all of these hyper- partisan times to reflect on the solstice and the marking of summer  because it is man's and human's experience in nature and this  recognition that something exists beyond us and something that got done  right in Washington a long time ago is the House on the hill, the  Capitol on the hill, it is surrounded by nature. It is surrounded by  beautiful trees and green and the Mall that you can walk out on, Mr.  Speaker, and go see the monuments.   Of course, some of us remember the wild fox that was scampering  around. That was last term. We can see some wildlife.   I believe just as many who have been in this Chamber from centuries  ago likely recognize the importance of the role that nature plays in  our life.   The words of the poet William Wordsworth who was not an American but  an English poet speak out:   I wandered lonely as a cloud   That floats on high o'er vales and hills,   When all at once I saw a crowd,   A host, of golden daffodils;   Beside the lake, beneath the trees,   Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.   I am not the only one who speaks poetry in this Chamber, of course.  Mr. Steny Hoyer, our former majority leader emeritus is one to quote  Tennyson on occasion.   It is certainly quite grounding as people of this great country, and  it is elected officials who use our words, who use our words to move,  make change, and bring this Nation to a new place. Sometimes those  words can feel contentious or bottled up on competition or trying to  win something. In other times, the words can bring us together, the  words can call upon us to reflect. The words can call upon us to look  above and look at the beauty all around us even on a cloudy solstice- beginning summer day here in Washington, D.C.                                time  2015    As I have taken some time to reflect a little bit on my life--and I  really can't tell you all how deeply humbling and somewhat  uncomfortable it is to even talk about yourself in this body, this well  of democracy.   I purposely chose to come to the center, the floor of the House, what  I believe is the House floor, the center of gravity of our democracy.   When we have been waging great debates in the Congress over many  years, I have long implored my colleagues to take it off cable news  because that is somewhat filtered, and, of course, doctored.   Our journalists play a great role, but take your discourse to the  well, to the floor of the House, to the center of democracy.   Engage in the great debate of this institution for Americans to see  unfiltered. Somebody at the Juneteenth event in Huntington Woods pulled  me aside, and they said, I am just so exhausted with how polarized it  feels, with how partisan it feels. I can't take it.   I said, well, are you watching the news?   And she said, no, I am not watching the news.   I said, well, tune in to C-SPAN because maybe you can't come to  Washington and join us in the gallery, but come to C-SPAN and watch  your government in action.   Of course, sometimes there is tough debate. As we just saw with my  colleagues passing the suspension bills, one that just passed  unanimously, it is bipartisan. It is coming together to solve problems  and coming together to make a difference.   I certainly do not ever seek to undermine or doubt the intentions of  any of my colleagues, although on occasion, their approach may  frustrate me.   We are all equal as duly elected Members of this Chamber when we come  here to vote. Our Founding Fathers in the era of the Founders and those  who maintained this institution, America, as a fledgling--and we are  still a fledgling democracy, in my opinion.   Our country is about to turn 247 years old. We can look to some of  the most ancient societies, the longest-standing countries in this  world, this world that is also 4\1/2\ million years old, and wonder  what they think and how they are looking to us.   Yet, we can look inward. We shouldn't exclusively look inward, but we  can look inward and reflect that we have accomplished a lot in these  246 years; the governing doctrine of this very Nation that still  determines how an individual like Haley Stevens can get to Congress  every other year.   The incredible voting electorate of Michigan's 11th District, that is  now comprised exclusively of the great Oakland County, in Michigan  takes a vote. They take a vote, and they determine who is going to be  their representative voice in the Congress.   That is why when we have the privilege of being here in Washington,  and, of course, people come and visit--we had a great day, which I will  share a little bit about our day in a moment.   When people come to Washington, and they share their needs, or when I  am home in Michigan, so joyfully visiting the farmers' markets,  visiting the small businesses, doing the manufacturing Mondays--I call  them manufacturing Mondays, by the way.   I visit our manufacturers. I see the innovation, the continued hard  work of our small businesses; men and women who are dedicated to the  production value of this Nation, made in the USA, something that is  demanded and called for throughout the world.   It is something that I am so ever committed to as an elected  Representative and as a former Obama administration official and as  somebody who once worked in a manufacturing research and development  institute.   Today, to share with anyone who might be watching, and to just give a  glimmer of what happens in a day for a Member of Congress, but there's  so much jammed in a day that it is, again, a real privilege to be able  to share and speak from this well of the House floor about what  occurred today.   I went to my beloved Committee on Science, Space & Technology markup.  We marked up three great bills on fire safety, on the utilization of a  mist for fire safety, and construction and management standards for  rebuilding after fires.   We are saying the words climate change in the hearing, in the markup.  We are saying the words climate change. We are recognizing. These are  bipartisan bills.   Again, you might recall that I am a Democrat, and I am in the  minority party, so I am at the whim of the chairman from the Republican  Party for the Committee on Science and Technology.  [[Page H3059]]    Yet, there we sit, chairman and ranking member and participating  members of the committee marking up bipartisan bills.   Of course, I spoke exuberantly on behalf of the bills and am looking  forward to their being passed through committee tomorrow.   We take our votes in committee, and then we are going to have a  hearing on artificial intelligence, which is certainly a topic that has  motivated and compelled the work of the Committee on Science and  Technology ever since I joined the Committee on Science and Technology  in my first term in Congress.   I am very fortunate to have served as the vice chair of the committee  when we were in the majority and the chair for the Subcommittee on  Research and Technology.   Folks might recall that when I helped lead the Congress through the  passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, industrial policy for this great  Nation. Let's make semiconductor microchips in this Nation again  because we innovated these things, and we let some people beat us at  our own game for a little bit.   Then the pandemic hit, the tide rolls out, and we don't have enough  chips. We decided to make chips in this country again by investing $50  billion that since the passage and signing of the bill in August of  last year, $50 billion has already beget $200 billion of private sector  invest.   Astronomical job creation, supply chain value for my State of  Michigan, and it is enormously exciting that we got that bill done.   I am so thrilled to have been a part of that committee, but that was  last year's activity. Of course, we carry the words of the things that  we have done into today.   As I was marking up the bills in committee, I was reflecting on the  bipartisan achievement of the CHIPS and Science Act last term, and we  have more to do on that. I will certainly get to that in a moment.   I also had the privilege of sitting down with a--I believe he calls  himself a president of a company. I don't know if he would want me  sharing this, but of course, I am sharing it. He did come to visit me.   He runs this company called Qualcomm. They are in this chips  business. I think this executive was in Washington today.   Well, he knew I was involved with this CHIPS Act, but they wanted to  share about this competition that we are in with China and the Chinese  Communist Party. This is something that I am very keen to as a  Representative of Michigan and as someone who served in President  Obama's administration as the chief of staff on the U.S. auto rescue,  the initiative that was responsible for saving General Motors and  Chrysler from liquidation and countless, hundreds of thousands of  Michigan jobs and certainly millions throughout this country.   We know the meaning of being able to make products here in the United  States of America and sell them all over the world.   That is the deal, right. That is why the day after the first  impeachment of President Trump in the year 2019, before the word COVID  ever entered our verbiage--true story--we impeached President Trump.   It was really kind of a sad day in this country, and we didn't get  justice that day. The following day we came back into this very Chamber  after it being so contentious and so divisive and so emotional.   Democrats and Republicans came back into this Chamber and passed the  trade deal, USMCA, a renegotiated NAFTA so that we could have a  framework for competing in the 21st century with the rest of the world;  strengthening by American content, plussing up our production value in  a State like Michigan.   By the way, it was endorsed by the critical stakeholders from both  organized labor, AFL-CIO, and UAW, to the automakers because 21st  century challenges beget 21st century solutions of coming together.   Of course, I am still talking about today. I am still talking about  why Qualcomm and maybe some other chip manufacturers are saying, hey,  we need to be able to sell to the world, all right, and we can't cut  ourselves off because some are chest thumping as we have done  throughout this century and the century prior for war.   We can call ourselves hawks. I don't call myself a hawk on China. I  am serious about the competition and the consideration and the  frustrations with the CCP.   I know that the Biden administration is attempting to lead just as  the administration prior and the administration prior did.   Of course, the dynamic has changed in the year 2023, but America has  got to be in the business of de-risking, and America has got to be in  the business of leading through smart power and strong power as an  open, democratic, capitalist society that says every person can succeed  and that we are working toward a more perfect union and the plight of  equality and justice.   I founded the Women in STEM Caucus because we want to bring more  people into the STEM field. It can't be acceptable that 5 percent of  women in STEM careers are Black and Brown.   It needs to be more. It cannot just be a talking point. It needs to  be a way of life. When we talk about expanding and when we work on  expanding the middle class, which had been shrinking, we talk about  uplifting people out of poverty.   It is not because anyone is looking to be endemically poor. That is  not the case. My great mother has shared many times over her thoughts  on this to me, which is that it is expensive to be poor.   It certainly is expensive in this day and age when you go to the  grocery store and when you pay your insurance bill and when you pay  your housing bill and when you pay to clothe and feed the kids and all  of this and that.   It is like you can't catch a breath. We are being squeezed. Instead  of finger-pointing, we need to be committed to the creation of good  jobs.   Good jobs means selling American-built, made, innovated, shipped  products to the world. You can't cut us off. It is not going to work,  right. The automakers will tell you that as well. The suppliers will  tell you that.   We need to be realistic. I am not going to overlook what has gone on  with Russia and Ukraine because I have been battling Putin since I got  into Congress, before I was sworn in.   Paul Whelan, the Novi resident in his fifth year in a Russian prison,  the canary in the coal mine for the lawlessness that Putin has pursued  on a global scale with this unbelievably outrageous, illegal, ongoing  war in Ukraine.   Russia isn't China. We were able to decouple. We brought the West  along with us. We are having the conversation on energy security and  what we need to do.   I am pragmatic and I am realistic about that. I am proud to have  voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, otherwise known as the largest  climate bill in history, clean energy incentives, which are  unbelievably impacting Michigan's economy right now; making batteries,  seeing our manufacturers rise as they do over and over again to the  charge of our time.                                time  2030    I mention Mr. Whelan today because his beloved dog Flora, 15 years  old, as announced by his brother, has passed. So as Whelan is in  prison, we just passed the resolution calling on the Russian Federation  to release Whelan, condemning it. He will come home. I will not lose  hope. I stand by his family every day on this. He will come home, but  he is not coming home to his dog.   These are some of the things that have happened today.   The other thing that happened, which was really quite profound, and I  think I am allowed to show a prop, is that we held a ceremony honoring  the debut of the postage stamp of the Honorable John Lewis. It was  incredibly moving.   Speaker McCarthy had a reception afterward in the Rayburn Room. We  had biscuits and conversation. The minority leader of the Democrats,  the very eloquent and brave leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke, as well. Mr.  Lewis' former chief of staff remembered him.   It was such an honor to be in one of his favorite places in the  Capitol, Statuary Hall, seeing the new postage stamp for John Lewis, a  man I was so privileged to serve with in his final term in office in  the 116th Congress and to be there with so many of my colleagues.   Of course, some other things happened today. We took more votes on  [[Page H3060]]  the House floor. Bizarrely, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle censured--we are still trying to figure out what censuring  means--but they have condemned my colleague from California, Mr.  Schiff. It was really quite emotional for some. I mean, I don't think  people were tearing up, but it was emotional because a good portion of  us serving in the 118th Congress were here on January 6, 2021, and we  would just like to have some basic agreement about facts, right?   Look, you can't dwell and dwell, but we have to have some basic  agreement of facts that those who are seeking to censure, many of  them--and I do not speak disparagingly--I don't think any of them  really joined in the effort to condemn a man in the Oval Office who, as  Commander in Chief, watched this Capitol, a branch of his government,  be attacked.   You take an oath as the Commander in Chief to protect and serve. I am  not out here on what to some is known as or dubbed a witch hunt. I am  here for the truth. I am here for an honest conversation.   Of course, I am also here to make sure that we put into place the  policies that lead to good and great job creation, good and great  futures, because one thing that I have seen campaigning out in the  field in these incredible neighborhoods that comprise Michigan's 11th  District is that people are busy, and they often do not have time for  the blood sport of politics. They are relying on a government that  needs to make sure that they are succeeding and getting out of the way  to make sure that they are succeeding by putting into place policies  that build toward a more perfect Union.   This is what fires me up. This is what motivates me in the charges of  our times. I know so many who do engage in the civil discourse and the  public discourse and show up at townhalls and show up at community  meetings, those who have become a part of the activist organization  Moms Demand Action, calling for more commonsense gun safety  legislation.   Outside my office in the Rayburn Building, I have decided because of  my frustration over and outrage of gun violence in this country that I  have known my whole life, and even my parents have known in ways that  have been unimaginable--and I say ``my parents'' as in their  generation. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated. My father, who  was also an educator, was doing his student teaching in Pontiac,  Michigan, at Bethune Elementary when Martin Luther King, Jr., was taken  from us, as were John Lennon, John Kennedy, RFK. President Reagan was  shot.   Is this part of some sort of dramatic story of our Nation, or is this  a problem that we must fix?   Outside of my office are now the orange ribbons that have marked  every mass shooting just this year alone, and I am running out of space  on the wall for the ribbons. I am running out of space. We are almost  at 300. If you choose to feel, it is unimaginable.   I am on the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the  United States and the Chinese Communist Party, and I don't want America  to appear weak, but this is not happening in China.   When we met with our counterparts in the British Parliament, they  looked at us and said: We had 40 people die from guns--4-0, not 40,000,  4-0 in the last year. We are at tens of thousands. This is human  capital.   We can talk about gun violence and talk about the opioid epidemic,  and we can talk about people dying from auto accidents, and certainly  the million people we lost from COVID-19, and say every life matters,  and we have to be committed to preserving life's existence. We have to  be committed not from a place of despair or frustration, but from a  place of motivation and dogged determination that we will address and  fix the scourge of gun violence in America.   It is clear that shame is not working. Calling out and calling out is  not working. Presenting the facts isn't working, but what will work, in  my opinion, is the arc of time.   Standing here as a woman, as I mentioned at the beginning of this  address, the first woman to represent Michigan's 11th District, it took  100 years to get suffrage achieved, to address the enfranchisement,  enfranchising women to be able to vote, when Congress had the most  number of women ever in history serving in its Chambers, both the House  and Senate.   Now, mind you, I want to concede this: We haven't even ever had 500  women total yet in the whole history of the body. In the 247 years of  America's existence, we have not had 500 women yet serving in the  Chamber, but we had over 100 in the year 2019, for that term, 2019 to  2020, marking 100 years of women's suffrage.   Of course, in 1920, when women's suffrage was achieved, you look back  and squint because 1848 was Seneca Falls. How many women who were at  Seneca Falls got to live to see their right to vote?    I reflected on my colleague who we honored today, Mr. Lewis. His  words that we go back to so many times as a Democratic Caucus ring  forward in this plight to ban assault weapons, to pass universal  background checks, to stop gun violence in America, to change our  culture, which I firmly believe we do by passing laws, not by seeing  children in Sandy Hook taken from us and not doing anything.   Mr. Lewis' words ring out: ``Do not get lost in a sea of despair.''  Let me say that again: ``Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be  hopeful. Be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a  week, a month, or a year. It is the struggle of a lifetime.''   Think of the women at Seneca Falls. Think of our country recognizing  and celebrating the second anniversary of the now-official Federal  holiday of Juneteenth that marked the end of slavery in this Nation.  Think of these long trials and tribulations that our young country has  gone through.   Before we were even erected as a nation, 400 years of slavery, and  only 158 years since it ended, something that was debated in this  Chamber.   Can you even imagine today? Then think of in the 21st century Mr.  Lewis' words. ``It is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid  to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.''   Why take to the floor of the House to speak these words? Why take to  the floor of the House in recognition of a personal milestone and the  achievements that we have made on behalf of Michigan's 11th District?  Why take to the House floor during Pride Month, Equality Month?   I remember coming here in one of the first floor speeches I made for  marriage equality and fairness, letting people just love who they want  to love and be who they are. We have made so much progress that now it  has become another targeted issue for those who do not agree. They are  trying to twist it on its head.   I have so many colleagues this evening at the Equality PAC  celebration honoring Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, one of the original  trailblazers in this body for LGBTQ rights, and we are still going to  have the joy and the pride that comes with Pride Month because love is  louder and joy is more inclusive.   Of course, in Michigan, we are delightfully blessed with the first  statewide elected openly gay official, Ms. Dana Nessel, our attorney  general, who alongside the speaker pro tempore of the senate, Mr.  Jeremy Moss, one of Oakland County's finest, they declared loudly this  month in Michigan that we are the gayest State in the Union and that  all are welcome in Michigan because, again, we thrive when everyone  succeeds.   Of course, for some, this may not be your words or your declaration,  but I speak for so many. I speak for Ferndale. I speak for  affirmations. I speak for those who are watching and listening and  wondering what they are going to do with their lives and what it means.   I represent and speak for disabled individuals and folks who I am  fighting for on the Education and the Workforce Committee to fully fund  IDEA so that our school districts do not need to rob Peter to pay Paul,  so that we can properly educate every student in this country  regardless of ability. That is the purpose of public education.   If you want something else, you can pay for it and go do it, but gosh  darn it, we want everyone to have access to a good, quality education.  That is what pays dividends to our country. That is what pays dividends  back into our Treasury. Speaker Pelosi once shared  [[Page H3061]]  that, and I certainly join her in recognizing that point.                                time  2045    Cost, indebtedness, hard work, how to get ahead, how to catch our  breath, and how to remain optimistic.   Sometimes it feels, to the outside world, maybe because they are not  watching C-SPAN, and they are only watching the news that flies off of  anger politics or divisiveness or red meat, but so much gets done here.   Now, in my fifth year here, I have mentioned a couple of times I  founded the Women in STEM Caucus. I also founded the Plastic Solutions  Task Force, alongside my colleague, Kim Schrier.   I formed the Democratic Manufacturing Working Group, alongside leader   Jim Clyburn, the great statesman from South Carolina, showcasing  delivery and dedication to the manufacturing economy of America. Of  course, I am also working on the bipartisan Manufacturing Caucus,  alongside a colleague from Ohio.   I passed my first bill within my first year in Congress, the Building  Blocks of STEM Act. It was signed on Christmas Eve. I wasn't at the  White House for the signing, but it got signed. It was about STEM  equity, making sure that more girls and girls of color can get included  into the STEM field.   Will our work ever be done in this Chamber?   I hope not, because democracy thrives when people choose to  participate in it. Democracy thrives when people choose to tune in  during the middle of the week, on a rainy solstice day, maybe to  listen, maybe to think, maybe to input. The tens of thousands of  correspondence letters that we reply to in my office, the people  writing in.   The ideas that come from knocking on the door in our neighborhoods.  The Alleviating Intergenerational Debt Act that I introduced because I  knocked on the door of this incredible family in Hazel Park, and mom  and dad introduced me to their kids who were going off to Michigan  State.   Dad said, Haley, it is really expensive. I said, I know, college has  gotten unbelievably expensive. And we are applying for financial aid.  He said, you know, Haley, it's outrageous, we didn't qualify for  financial aid. I am a UAW worker. My wife here is a UAW worker. I have  $90,000 student loan debt myself as a parent and I don't qualify for  financial aid. Why is that?   So I went back, with a very hardworking member of my staff from  Oakland County, Sammi Goldsmith, and we looked at this very diligently,  and we found that this is a loophole in the financial aid formula.   So we introduced legislation to change it so that that family's  daughter doesn't have to have the debt that dad has. Commonsense  solutions, expand Pell grants, expand access to apprenticeship training  programs, showcase our unions which allow you to earn as you learn.   There is so much to be proud of, by the way. So I am not just hemming  and hawing. I am feverishly working on the solutions for tomorrow. I am  feverishly working alongside my colleagues, even on tough days or tough  moments, like with what happened with the censure earlier today, we  remain committed.   We passed the CHIPS and Science Act. We know we need to do more. We  need to fund basic scientific research. I was so proud, as the chair of  the Research and Technology Subcommittee, to pass the National Science  Foundation for the Future Act, that doubled basic scientific research  funding in this country. Except it was just an authorization; it wasn't  an appropriation.   I don't know what the rest of this year has in store. I don't have a  crystal ball.   We didn't default on our debt. Some who sought to undermine the  fiscal integrity of our Union by allowing America to default on its  debt, it didn't happen because a bipartisan group of commonsense  lawmakers came together to say, no, we won't do that.   Now we have to pass a budget. The Federal Government needs to be  funded by September 30. So as the end of the year comes up, we are  going to talk about basic scientific research funding. We are going to  talk about food assistance. We are going to talk about making sure that  students can go to school and get access to food, free and reduced  lunch, a guarantee.   John Kennedy, President John Kennedy, gave an address 60 years ago  this month at my alma mater. He gave a speech about peace. Mr. Kennedy,  President Kennedy, comes from a time when it feels like there were  fewer spoken words. There were certainly less tweets. There was  certainly less cable news. Those words and the quotes, they carried  movement. They carried action. I think sometimes that is what feels so  frustrating about dealing with this scourge of gun violence. It is also  Gun Violence Prevention Month here in June. We can give the best  speech. We can write the most eloquent, smartest tweet. We have made  some change.   We passed a bipartisan bill to award funding to States that have  passed red flag laws, extreme risk protection order laws. Michigan just  did it, under the leadership of our great Governor, Gretchen Whitmer,  in the wake of tragic shootings at Michigan State and at Oxford and the  nearly everyday gun violence in too many neighborhoods across Michigan.  So we did pass that law.   Again, words, the words that I go back to, the words of Mr. Lewis, to  not despair, to be optimistic, because to be optimistic is to stay  active. It is to stay engaged. It is to stay agitated. It is to stay  feverish toward the work that we must do.   Yes, I will speak until my throat runs dry because this moment and  this activity, and my commitment to this democracy and being afforded  this time in this Chamber is too serious to pass it up.   But Mr. Kennedy, 60 years ago this month, you know, as we think of  other trying times, the Bay of Pigs, avoiding nuclear war, engagements  in Vietnam--a war that we did not win, that took too many American  lives, and we are so proud of our veterans and those who served.   Mr. Kennedy stood before American University and he said: ``I speak  of peace, therefore, as the necessary, rational end of rational men. I  realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of  war--and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we  have no more urgent task.''   It is certainly important and symbolic to reflect on those words  today and in these moments that are upon us as a Nation.    I look out and I use that as a rallying call for our work on the  Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and  the Chinese Communist Party, how to bolster American manufacturing,  American competitiveness, how to strengthen southeastern Michigan and  Oakland County, under the leadership of Dave Coulter, someone I am so  proud to work alongside.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 40 years of unimaginable innovation and  activity that has taken place in this Nation: In 1983, Sally Ride is  the first woman into space. 1985, has Microsoft Office first hitting  the stage. 1991, is the time when the world wide web hit our keyboards.   I remember my mother and my aunt taking me to a meeting. What is a  website? If only we could imagine what we would be in now; smartphone  devices connecting us at rapid speed. The way in which humanity evolved  and changed and then yet again, as technology drives us to be together.  The elixir of our alive experience here on planet Earth, and as  Americans, through love, through connection, and through ability. Those  things don't change. The meaning of family doesn't change. The meaning  of friendship doesn't change.   In the 1980s it was a race with the Japanese. Now it feels as though  it is a race with the Chinese. Open society, willingness to change,  commitment to action.   Ben Franklin once said: ``A long life may not be good enough, but a  good life is long enough.'' May we all commit to living the good life.  May we, as public servants, commit to goodness, to one another, to our  fellow Americans, and to this unbelievable and magnificent trajectory  our beloved Nation is on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
