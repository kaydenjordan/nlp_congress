 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today or tomorrow, as part of the  American Rescue Plan, which we will be discussing in the next few days,  which I happen to believe is the most significant piece of legislation  to come to the floor of the Senate in decades in terms of addressing  the crises facing working families--as part of that piece of  legislation, I will be offering an amendment to raise the Federal  minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, which I believe is a starvation wage,  to $15 an hour over a 5-year period--5 years.   I think there has been some miscommunication around here, and there  are people who are saying it is going from 7.25 to 15 bucks an hour in  1 year. Not true. It goes from 7.25 to 9.50, to 11, to 12.50, to 14, to  15 dollars an hour. So anyone who says we are raising the minimum wage  in 1 year, in the midst of a pandemic, to $15 an hour is simply not  telling the truth.   This amendment is similar to a bill which I have brought forth, the  Raise the Wage Act, which I am proud to say has been cosponsored by  some 38 Members of the Senate, and this is also similar to legislation  which has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives. And I thank  them, and I thank my friends in the Progressive Caucus in the House for  doing a great job in pushing this legislation.   I should also add, for my Senate colleagues, that this legislation  raising the minimum wage is supported by some 300 national  organizations, including the 12 million members of the AFL-CIO and  virtually every major union in this country. This is something that  unions like the SEIU, one of the largest unions in this country, have  been fighting for, for a very long time.   I should also add here that while raising the minimum wage is going  to impact every low-wage worker in this country--because African- American and Latino workers often are earning poverty wages--it  significantly impacts the lives of the minority communities as well.  That is why, among so many other organizations supporting this  amendment, it is supported by the Leadership Conference on Civil and  Human Rights; it is supported by the National Organization for Women  because, again, when we talk about low-wage workers, we are talking  about the minority community, we are talking about women; and that is  why it is supported by groups like Unidos, the American Association of  University Women, Indivisible, Justice for Migrant Women, the National  Domestic Workers Alliance, and the National Women's Law Center.   So, once again, this is legislation that will increase wages for 30  million American workers. And if you ask me what the great economic  crisis in our country is today, it is not just high unemployment; it is  not just income and wealth inequality; it is that half of our people  today, and before the pandemic, were living paycheck to paycheck. Their  wages were so low that if they had a problem with their car or their  kid got sick, suddenly they were in financial crisis   And in the richest country in the history of the world, half of our  people should not be facing economic desperation when their car breaks  down. The reason for that is, significantly, that many millions of  workers are earning starvation wages--and I underline that, starvation  wages--in this country.   I would love to hear anybody get up here and tell me that they could  live on seven and a quarter an hour, they could live on 8 bucks an  hour, they could live on 9 bucks an hour. You can't. And I have been  all over this country, and I have talked to workers who are making 10,  11 bucks an hour, with tears streaming down their cheeks, telling me  what it is like to work for starvation wages and try to raise your  kids.   So the time is long overdue. The last time this Congress passed an  increase in the minimum wage was in the year 2007--2007. It is time to  raise the minimum wage. It is time to raise the minimum wage to a  living wage of 15 bucks an hour.   Now, later on today or this evening, as part of my support for this  enormously important piece of legislation--and, as chairman of the  Budget Committee, I will be speaking more about why we need to raise  the minimum wage, but I want to focus on one part of the minimum wage  bill that I have been hearing a little bit about in the last couple of  days from some of my colleagues, and that is the provision to raise the  tipped wage.   Now, the tipped wage, so everybody understands it, is the Federal  minimum wage that applies to waiters and waitresses, barbers, hair  stylists, parking attendants, and others. Fellow Americans, do you know  what that Federal minimum wage today is for that person who waits on  your table at a restaurant? It is $2.12 an hour. Yeah, you heard me  correctly: $2.12 an hour.   And the proposal, as part of the minimum wage bill, the amendment  that I will be offering, is that tipped minimum wage would go up from  $2.12 an hour to $14.95 over a 7-year period, longer than the overall  national minimum wage would go up. And this is something that clearly  is desperately needed.   Now, I know that, here in Washington, anytime we bring forth serious  and important legislation for working people, the Big Money interests  get to work, and all of their lobbyists, who make their six figures or  seven figures a year, they get to work on Congress and tell you why you  can't do anything to protect the most vulnerable and hard-hit people in  this country.   So the National Restaurant Association, they are a very powerful  lobbying organization. I guess they have been enormously successful  because we have not raised the Federal minimum wage since 2007. So the  powerful lobbying organizations are going around, and they are telling  Members of the House and the Senate that raising the tipped wage is  opposed by restaurant workers and it would be harmful to the interest  of waiters and waitresses and other people.   That is not true. That is what lobbyists say, representing Big Money  interests. That is what they are paid to say, but that is not what  workers who wait on tables are telling us.   One Fair Wage, a grassroots organization representing service  employees--waiters, waitresses, and others--has just delivered to the  White House a petition with 140,000 signatures on it from service  workers who are demanding that they receive the same minimum wage as  every other worker in this country. And polling among service employees  and nonservice employees also supports the reality that Americans want  our waiters and our waitresses and other service employees to get a  fair and equal minimum wage, similar to what other low-wage workers are  receiving.   Now, I have heard from some who tell me that people who are waiting  on tables--and, by the way, I was one of the worst waiters in the  history of the country, but I was a waiter a long time ago. I know a  little bit about it. I am hearing from some that waiters and  waitresses, they are doing really well, making a whole lot of money,  and they don't need an increase in the minimum wage.   Let's be clear. When you talk about the restaurant and the hotel  industry, you are talking about mass discrepancies in the kind of  incomes that people receive. I will not deny it for a second. My  daughter worked in a fancy restaurant. She did quite well.   So if you are working in a hotel in a fancy restaurant where you have  a menu that is quite expensive--you have got a $100 meal and your 20  percent is 20 bucks, you are waiting on three or four tables--you are  doing OK. I don't deny that for a second, and I wish those waiters and  waitresses who work so hard continued success.   But let us be clear. Not everybody works in a fancy restaurant or a  big hotel which has a high-priced menu. You have got a whole lot of  people working in diners, working in working-class restaurants where  the menu is not that fancy, and maybe it is $10 for  [[Page S1047]]  lunch or $8 for lunch. Twenty percent of that is $1.60, on an $8 meal.   Let us be very clear that, when we talk about waiters and waitresses,  some 70 percent of tipped workers in this country are women, who suffer  from three times the poverty rate of the rest of the U.S. workforce. In  other words, women who are waitressing have a three times higher  poverty rate than the rest of the U.S. workforce. Their tips are not  keeping up with their needs. These women waitresses use food stamps at  double the rate of other workers in this country.   And, importantly, and increasingly so--amazingly, during this  pandemic--waitresses suffer from the highest rates of sexual harassment  of workers in any industry because they are forced to tolerate  inappropriate customer behavior to feed their families through the tips  that they get.   We are hearing stories where people in a restaurant, guys in a  restaurant say: Well, take your mask off. You want a tip; let me see  how you look.   And, clearly, this is unacceptable behavior.   I also want to point out that the idea of moving tip wages to the  same level over a period--in this case, 7 years--moving it to the same  level as the overall minimum wage is not a radical idea. It ain't a  Bernie Sanders idea. It already exists. I don't know if people know  this. It already exists in seven States. So in seven States, right now,  people who work in the service industry--waiters, waitresses, and  others--are getting the same minimum wage as all the workers in those  States. And those States are California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada,  Montana, Alaska, and Minnesota. Seven States already pay their service  industry workers the same wages as they pay other minimum-wage workers.   And I should point out that all of these States experienced a growth  in the number of small businesses and restaurants after they abolished  the tip minimum wage. So they abolished the tip minimum wage; it did  not drive restaurants out of business. In fact, in those States where  the tip minimum wage equaled the general minimum wage, we saw a growth  in the number of restaurants.   And, furthermore, to respond to another piece of misinformation,  waiters and waitresses in these States received more in tips, not less.  So the mythology that is going around here is that if we raise the  minimum wage for waiters and waitresses, when somebody walks into a  restaurant, they are going to be thinking, ``Oh, my goodness, this  person is making 10, 12 bucks an hour; I am going to leave less of a  tip,'' ain't the way the world works.   Let me also say a word about how the pandemic, which has impacted  workers in every sector--but how it has impacted tip workers. In many  States where the tip minimum wage still exists, tip workers--and this  is rather unbelievable--tip workers did not even qualify for  unemployment. So we are talking now, in this bill, of substantially  increasing unemployment--a $400 supplement--and we are talking about  extending it to late August. But tip workers, whose minimum wage is so  low, do not even qualify for unemployment.   In an industry where more than 6 million workers have lost their  jobs--and, obviously, we all know the restaurant and hotel industry  have been terribly hard-hit by the pandemic--more than 60 percent of  subminimum wage earners could not get unemployment benefits because the  State and Federal Government denied them benefits for not making enough  earned income. You all got that?   So we are talking about the need--and I certainly agree with that--to  expand and extend unemployment benefits, but you have a whole lot of  workers who are earning starvation wages who are not going to be  eligible for unemployment.   At the same time, as restaurants reopen, the CDC has declared  restaurants as the most dangerous place to work. We all know that. It  is obvious. You are coming face-to-face with your customers. And now  servers, in the midst of that, are responsible--you are a waiter, you  are a waitress, and you are now responsible--for telling somebody who  walks into your restaurant that they must socially distance themselves  or wear a mask. It is not necessarily a comfortable position for a  worker dealing with a hostile customer.   I would also add, as all of us are increasingly aware of sexual  harassment in general in this country, that the restaurant industry has  some of the highest rates of sexual harassment. In a workplace where 70  percent of the workers are women and where they rely on their customers  to determine their wages because of tips, women are often expected to  withstand sexual harassment in order to get those tips.   In States where the subminimum wage has been eliminated, sexual  harassment has been cut substantially because women no longer have to  take that. It is not an all-or-nothing proposition.   If you ask me again what the major economic crisis facing this  country is, we know unemployment is sky-high, we know income inequality  is unacceptable, and so many other factors are out there about the  economy, but at the top of my list is the fact that tens of millions of  workers in the richest country on Earth are barely making it. They are  having a hard time feeding their kids. They are having a hard time  paying their rent. Many of them get inadequate or no health insurance  at all.   Now, year after year, the American people--I think, correctly-- perceive that this Congress bows to the wishes of the rich and the  powerful, gives tax breaks to people who don't need it. We deregulate  companies that should be regulated, et cetera, et cetera.   In this moment of economic and health crisis, now is the time for us  to stand with working families, and the most important thing that we  can do is to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. This is what Joe  Biden believes. This is what the Democratic platform stands for, and  this is what at least 38 cosponsors of the Raise the Wage Act also  believe.   So here we are at a pivotal moment. The working class is being  decimated. People are struggling to feed their kids. We have to raise  wages in this country, and we have to raise the wages of tip workers.   I will be back later for more on this.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record a letter dated February 22, 2021, about tip wages, signed  by hundreds of organizations   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  February 22, 2021.        Dear Members of Congress: The undersigned organizations       enthusiastically support the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, as       introduced in the Senate by Senators Bernie Sanders (VT) and       Patty Murray (WA), and in the House by Representative Robert       C. ``Bobby'' Scott (VA).        If enacted, the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 would:        Gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by       2025;        After 2025, adjust the minimum wage each year to keep pace       with growth in the median wage--a measure of wages for       typical workers;        Phase out the egregious subminimum wage for tipped workers,       which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since 1991; and        Sunset unacceptable subminimum wages for workers with       disabilities employed in sheltered workshops and for workers       under age 20.        Since fast-food workers in New York City first walked off       the job in 2012, demanding a $15 minimum wage and the right       to form a union, workers across the country have completely       changed the conversation and politics surrounding the minimum       wage. Yet, 20 states still have not raised their minimum       wages beyond the paltry $7.25 federal minimum wage, and many       more have only marginally higher minimum wages than the       federal floor--despite clearly negative impacts on workers       across the country. Those negative impacts also       disproportionately affect Black and brown workers, who have       historically been segregated into the lowest paying       occupations in the U.S., and who are leading the Fight for       $15 and a union.        Congress should heed the demands of workers of color,       communities, and their constituents and waste no more time in       passing the Raise the Wage Act. Raising the federal minimum       wage to $15 an hour and eliminating subminimum wages for       tipped workers, youth workers, and workers with disabilities       is a long overdue, human rights imperative and a critical       racial and gender justice issue--one that will make a crucial       difference in the lives of millions of workers and in       communities across the country.        Gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025       would lift pay for nearly 32 million workers--21% of the U.S.       workforce. Affected workers who work year-round would earn an       extra $3,300 a year--enough to make a tremendous difference       in the life of a  [[Page S1048]]       cashier, home health aide, or fast-food worker who today       struggles to get by on less than $25,000 a year. A majority       (59%) of workers whose total family income is below the       poverty line would receive a pay increase if the minimum wage       were raised to $15 by 2025.        Raising the minimum wage to $15 and eliminating subminimum       wages will be particularly significant for workers of color       and women workers, who have historically been pushed into the       most underpaid paid jobs through occupational segregation.       Passing the Raise the Wage Act would help narrow both the       racial pay gap and the gender pay gap. Of those whose pay       would increase, nearly 6 in 10 (59%) are women and more than       a quarter (28%) have children. One-third (31%) of African-      American workers and one-quarter (26%) of Latinx workers       would get a raise if the federal minimum wage were increased       to $15. Almost one in four (23%) of those people who would       benefit is a Black or Latina woman. African-American workers       and Latinx workers are paid 10-15% less than white workers       with the same characteristics, so the Raise the Wage Act       would deliver the largest benefits to Black and Latinx       workers--about $3,500 annually for a year-round worker. The       Raise the Wage Act will also deliver increased wages to an       estimated 1.45 million LGBTQ workers and would reduce the       proportion of male same-sex couples living in poverty by one-      third and female same-sex couples by almost one-half. There       would be similar reductions in poverty among LGBTQ people who       are not in same-sex couple households, with the largest gains       for those with the highest rates of poverty--Black, Latinx,       bisexual, and transgender adults.        Raising wages has never been more urgent than during this       pandemic. Essential and frontline workers make up a majority       of those who would benefit from a $15 minimum wage. Members       of Congress should do more than pay lip service to front line       workers; they should make sure they get higher wages. The       median pay is well under $15 an hour for many essential and       frontline jobs; examples include substitute teachers, nursing       assistants, and home health aides. More than one-third (35%)       of those working in residential or nursing care facilities       would see their pay increase, in addition to home health       aides and other health care support workers. One in three       retail sector workers (36%) would get a raise, including 42%       of workers in grocery stores. More than four-in-ten (43%) of       janitors, housekeepers, and other cleaning workers would       benefit. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of servers, cooks, and other       food preparation workers would see their earnings rise by       $5,800 on a year-round basis. For 6 million tipped food       service workers, a majority female workforce, the subminimum       wage for tipped workers is a legacy of slavery that has been       a source of poverty, sexual harassment, and exposure to       health risks and hostile customers during the pandemic. Ten       million workers in health care, education, construction, and       manufacturing would see a raise--representing nearly one-      third (31%) of the workers who would see a raise.        Contrary to what opponents of a living wage would argue,       our economy can more than afford a $15 minimum wage. Workers       earning the current federal minimum wage are paid less per       hour in real dollars than their counterparts were paid 50       years ago. Businesses can afford to pay the most underpaid       worker in the U.S. today substantially more than what her       counterpart was paid half a century ago. The economy has       grown dramatically over the past 50 years, and workers are       producing more from each hour of work, with productivity       nearly doubling since the late 1960s. If the minimum wage had       been raised at the same pace as productivity growth since the       late 1960s, it would be over $20 an hour today.        In fact, an immediate increase in the minimum wage is       necessary for the health of our economy. A $15 minimum wage       by 2025 would generate $107 billion in higher wages for       workers and would also benefit communities across the       country. Because underpaid workers spend much of their extra       earnings, this injection of wages will help stimulate the       economy and spur greater business activity and job growth.        It is long past time to pass the Raise the Wage Act of       2021--and we call on all Members of Congress to finally give       nearly 32 million workers the raise they have fought so hard       to secure.

Madam President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalists' essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 11th annual ``State of the Union'' essay  contest conducted by my office.   The material follows:                                 Finalists                   EH KA LUU, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR         ``Don't hold a guy's hand; you'll get pregnant,'' my mom       informed me as I sat on the toilet, looking at the well       wrapped square. I engraved those words in my mind. My whole       6th grade year, I avoided the hands of the opposite gender,       by keeping my hands in the pocket of my hoodie due to my moms       version of sex education. Yet, in seventh grade I had Health       class, where curiosity got the best of me.        ``Mrs- where do babies come from?'' I looked up and back       down, she smiled and explained everything to me, this was       where things started to make sense. I realized that I've been       lied to by my own mother. I had questions. ``Why do some       parents avoid such topic?'' and ``why do schools not teach       proper sex education?'' In this essay, I'm going to address       the need for parents to educate their kids. Schools teaching       students about sex and being welcoming to every gender.        I think Sexual education should be taught at a very early       age. Most kids start to get sexually actively around middle       school. In my research on ``Sex Positive Families'', I found       that most parents think that if they talk to their kids about       such a topic, their kids will wanna do it. However, this       proves to be incorrect as most of the time, kids will       consider the options and pause on their sexual activity.       Parents need to start normalizing sex and understand that its       an act that will be committed, one day. If youth are given       the accurate information they will better protect themselves.       In my research kids who understand the consequences of being       sexually active. Better protect themselves by using birth       control methods and using condoms so they don't contract       sexually transmitted infections (STI).        In a quiet room filled with my fellow seniors, I broke the       silence with a question. ``Where did you guys learn about       sex?'' It was revealed that most had obtained the information       by either using sources like google or from their peers, but       we have school to teach us right? In high school, it is       expected that you learn about these topics but in this       generation, kids are starting to explore at a much younger       age, the earliest being the start of middle school.        Not all states are required to teach sex education in a       structure way. Some states, such as Alabama and Arizona,       don't even teach the subject at all. They preach abstinence       to their students and tell them to wait till marriage to have       intercourses. Schools should teach safe sex and ways on how       to prevent STIs. Schools should talk about different types of       birth control that are available. It's also important to       include information for students with different sexuality. In       a video by Above the Noise, ``Sex education in America: The       good, The bad, and The ugly'', high school students shared       their thoughts on the current Sex Education. One student       talked about how it doesn't include people in the LGBTQIA+       community. School needs to provide to students that have       different sexuality, they shound teach sex between non       heterosexual people as well. It's very important to help kids       understand safety no matter their sexual orientation.        The topic of sex should be normalized and talked more about       to people at a very young age. To help kids understand the       changes in their body and explore their sexuality. Parents       should have conversations about sex and the human body to       their kids. School should include people with different       sexuality. If we do these things, teenager would have the       knowledge and ability to protect themselves and weigh their       options when it come to safe sex.                 KADA ORLOW, BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, FRESHMAN         My sister and I were very little when my mom became our       only parent. She was all by herself, with no ``safety net'',       as she calls it. We were left with nothing but each other.       She struggled with lack of money, food scarcity, and       sometimes there were issues with places to live. As I grew       older, I began to see the struggles that not only my mom, but       many other families face when trying to raise a family and       dig themselves out of a hole. I've listened to my mom explain       to me many times, how impossible it is for one person to       raise a family, to have to be in two places at once, while       trying to get us off to daycare or school, and to try and       hold down a regular job (no longer a career as she may have       had long before), and to just keep going no matter what,       because you can't stop. Stopping or resting is never an       option. Some of the issues that my mom recently was asked to       speak about at a press conference have to do with exactly       that. My mom spoke for, and represented those people, that       typically are not heard; the single parents and the sole       parents. She offered solutions that would help make things       easier, better for others, if only they could be put into       practice everyone would benefit. Now, it is my turn to speak       up for an issue I believe needs to be addressed in our       society.        The system itself for single mothers is like quicksand, it       doesn't matter how hard you try, you just get exhausted. You       will never get out of it, but you just keep pushing. My mom       resigned her promotion and went back to working part-time so       that she and her family could survive. This shows that       parents are forced to practically choose between  [[Page S1118]]       providing for their children, and being with them. With no       other options, parents are prevented from raising their       children, just so they don't lose the benefits for their       kids. Even when single parents work, the wages are not enough       to support a family. Working full-time for $10 an hour is       only about $19,000 a year. This fact explains many single       parents' realities that are never ending. Minimum wage jobs       do not pay enough to support a family. However, single       parents can prevail. My mom shared that ``The single moms I       know are some of the most mentally-strong people I've ever       met, and no matter what, they prevail.'' This piece of       evidence shows that there is no option to give up, you have       to keep pushing no matter what the circumstance is. In the       end, there really is no way of getting out of this       everlasting loophole, unless you are thrown a lifeline.        Technology provides many of the answers to these problems.       The solutions are there, they would benefit not only single       parents, but eventually in the long run, it would benefit       everyone. An online database and one-stop shop: housing,       services, food, healthcare. Just one simple example of a       solution that can be extremely beneficial because it can be       used for different things and in different ways. All the       government assistance programs being in one, easy to access       place would make it simpler for single parents to get the       support they need, and that tax dollars are paying for.       Technology could help in other ways as well. Imagine you are       a single mom,there is no one else at home to leave your other       child(ren) with, while you rush the sick one to the emergency       room. --If you could use an app like pingmd.com app, all you       would have to do is ``ping'' your doctor directly, share       photos, and list out the symptoms. This would save time       before scheduling an appointment and visiting a doctor (time       the parents are usually at work), and take some of the       expenses out of visiting a doctor. There are new solutions       being made everyday in order to make life for single       parent's easier, this being one of them. Parent's that       don't have enough time in the day to record everything       that their child is doing, ex: soccer games,       presentations, first day of school experiences, etc. This       is now being solved with a page called Kidlee. This is       another example that will help not only single parents       right now, but even parents that just don't have time for       it.        These solutions are only the beginning, if only they were       acted upon, single parents could get the assistance they       need.          ELLA PARTLOW, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR         At such a significant time in their lives for personal       development, teenagers are one of the most vulnerable age       groups when it comes to mental health. According to the       National Institute of Medicine, twenty-five percent of       Americans experience at least one depressive episode prior to       adulthood. More concerning, however, is that the World Health       Organization found that many such conditions are ignored; an       estimated fifteen percent of teenagers' mental health       conditions go ``underdiagnosed and undertreated''. This       elucidates that adolescent mental health is not often made a       priority. The mental health of American teenagers needs to be       taken more seriously.        When teenage mental health is neglected, it becomes an even       more pressing issue. Reflecting the detrimental effects of a       poor mental health care system, the rates of self harm and       suicide in America have increased in recent years. The       General Hospital of Psychiatry says that in the past two       decades emergency room visits in America for self inflicted       harm in all age groups have increased; albeit, these visits       were most common among ages fifteen to nineteen.       Additionally, data from the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention explains that there was a thirty percent increase       in suicides from years 2000 to 2016. This illuminates that       ignoring the mental health of America's youth puts their       safety and lives in jeopardy.        In order to solve this problem, it is vital that funding       for mental health education programs and support services are       increased. The Journal of Adolescent Health identifies       ``insurance restrictions, poor funding, and low priorities       for resources'' as the ``key obstacles'' preventing teenagers       from seeking necessary help. A widespread lack of education       regarding mental health also contributes to this problem,       says The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychology.       A step towards prioritizing teenage mental health, increased       funding and education would result in teenagers feeling       supported and having better access to mental health services.        Furthermore, better funding and education will allow for       the improvement of on campus mental health service. First, it       is necessary that the presence of these services on school       campuses are increased. In a report from the National       Research Council and Institute of Medicine, adolescents were       more likely to receive mental health services when on site       services were easily available. Second, diversity, identified       by the report as a key component to effective on campus       mental health services, should be considered; a more diverse       group of health care professionals leads to lower dropout       rates in mental health programs, and misdiagnosis of mental       illness decreased when there were fewer cultural differences       between provider and patient. Ameliorating on campus services       by increasing and diversifying them will encourage teenagers       to seek help and normalize doing so, creating an atmosphere       where youth can comfortably discuss their mental health       without fear of being treated as insignificant.        Moreover, improving the funding, education, and available       services surrounding teen mental health will allow us to make       this issue a larger priority in America. In doing this, we       take care of our youth and improve their quality of       life.                            ____________________
