 Madam Speaker, congratulations to Staff  Sergeant Dakota Bowen, who serves with Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion,  39th Infantry Regiment, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. He is the  Army's 2019 Noncommissioned Officer of the Year.   The NCO of the Year is the Army's top soldier, with competition  annually on a variety of tasks testing their knowledge, skills, and  abilities. Staff Sergeant Bowen emerged as the top NCO of the  competition to win soldier of the year as this year's top NCO.   General Joseph Martin, the Army Vice Chief of Staff, calls NCOs the  heart and soul of the Army. ``When the Army desperately needs  leadership, we turn to you, and you have never failed us,'' he said in  a keynote speech at the awards ceremony.   As a 30-year Army veteran myself with three sons who have served in  the Army, I know firsthand that this analysis is correct.   South Carolina is grateful for Staff Sergeant Dakota Bowen and his  commitment to American families, promoting the truth that freedom is  not free.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th, or the anniversary today of the Beirut bombing,  murdering 241 servicemembers, in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
