 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, Republicans and Democrats can agree more than they  disagree on the issue of net neutrality parameters to protect a free  and open internet for consumers.   The net neutrality bright line rules Republicans support are simple,  and they are actually pretty easy to understand, Mr. Chairman: no  blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization--period. And no  government takeover of the internet by Washington bureaucrats.   Unfortunately, for the last few years, Democrats have caved in to the  idea that only putting unelected bureaucrats in charge of every facet  of the internet is the answer. And they know what all Americans know:  The bill before us today is opposed by the President, and the leader of  the Senate says it is dead on arrival there, so it will not become law.  This is the end of its journey.   They also know the internet grew up under very light-touch  regulation, which Republicans favor and which even President Clinton  favored. That is what allowed the bright innovators in our Nation's  Silicon Valley and across the world to experiment and to invent the  great services we all enjoy today. You see, they did not have to come  to Washington, D.C., to some agency and get a permit or permission  first. They didn't have to get second-guessed later, either.   Unfortunately, the regime that my friends across the aisle seek to  saddle the internet with was only in place for less than 2 years. Less  than 2 years, that is it.   Some argue that during that period, investment broadband build-out  actually declined. We had testimony at the Energy and Commerce  Committee from an internet service provider in rural Oregon who spoke  to that very fact.   This bill, called Save the Internet Act, is another plank in their  socialist agenda that would regulate the internet as if it were a  monopoly utility under the title II section of the Communications Act  of 1934. That is the law originally used to govern monopoly telephone  companies in the 1930s.   This legislation imposes that heavy hand of Washington's regulatory  bureaucracy over the single most vibrant and important driver of the  economic growth in America and the world: job creation, better quality  of life, information sharing. We call that the open internet that we  enjoy today.   I would admit, no one fully understands the implications of this  legislation, the scope of what it entails, and the impact it could have  on consumers. There is much debate on this point in the committee.   Does this bill empower the FCC to dictate where and when new  broadband networks can or must be deployed? We think it could.   Will this bill provide the authority for a government takeover and  management of private networks? We think it could.   Would this bill allow government taxation of the internet? It could.   Could it lead to government regulation of speech on the internet?  Yep.   And will this legislation limit the full potential of 5G and impede  the development of the next wave of innovation in internet services?  Most outside experts think it could.   So Republicans attempted to get to the bottom of these questions  through our hearings and our markups. The answer to all of these  questions was, regrettably, yes.   Now, we offered amendments, Mr. Chairman, at the full committee to  close the doors to these and other powers that are granted to the  Federal Communications Commission under this bill, powers that are  completely unrelated to net neutrality. Every one of those amendments  was rejected.   Supporters claim the bill locks into law more than 700 instances  where the Federal Communications Commission forbore from taking action  under title II, but supporters cannot provide Members of Congress with  a list of those 700 forbearances--nope. We have asked; no list. The  Democrats won't or can't even tell us precisely what they are putting  into law if we can't see that list.   But we even offered an amendment to truly lock in this forbearance  and prevent the FCC from imposing similar regulations in the future or  through other provisions in statute, and that, too, was rejected.    We offered an amendment protecting the next generation of wireless  networks, 5G, from the incompatible regulatory regime. That, too, was  rejected on party-line votes.   So, disappointingly, the Democrats went back on an agreement I helped  negotiate in each of the last two Congresses to relieve some of our  rural internet providers from some of the most burdensome reporting  requirements of the FCC's 2015 order.   Twice we passed that relief, and we did so unanimously in this House,  and it was bipartisan, obviously. They more than cut the relief in  half, putting costly bureaucratic reporting requirements ahead of small  internet service providers investing in connecting Americans to high- speed internet services.   It doesn't have to be this way. It should not be this way.  Republicans have put forth serious proposals. We put forth a menu of  options as a starting point for true bipartisan net neutrality  legislation.   I have introduced a bill that codifies the FCC's bright-line rules  prohibiting blocking and throttling and paid prioritization for  internet traffic, and that would require that ISPs, internet service  providers, be transparent in their network management practices and  prices.   Two of my Republican colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce  Committee have introduced legislation that should also gain Democratic  support.   Representative  Bob Latta, who is our top Republican on the  subcommittee, has legislation drawn from a proposal introduced in 2010  by the previous Democratic chairman of the full Energy and Commerce  Committee, Henry Waxman of California.   If Democrats don't believe Mr. Waxman's plan is a good starting  point, then Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers has introduced  legislation that is drawn directly from a bill that passed in  Washington State's Democratic-controlled legislature and was signed  into law in 2018 by a Democratic Governor.   So what do all three of these proposals have in common? They are  rooted in the shared principles of net neutrality that will protect  consumers, but without putting unelected bureaucrats in control of the  internet.   So I remain committed to a bipartisan solution, to preserving a free  and open internet. I actually believe it is achievable, and I want to  express to my friends on the other side of the aisle--and they are my  friends--that our work and our efforts together are genuine and have  been made in good faith.   The fact is we can permanently address blocking, throttling, and paid  prioritization. We could do so in a bipartisan way, and we all believe  in open and free internet. We believe in net neutrality.   But net neutrality is not title II, near limitless government  management of the internet. Net neutrality does not need the harmful,  heavy-handed approach of title II. Net neutrality does not require a  government takeover of the internet.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is my honor to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip of the  House and a terrific member of our Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am now privileged to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), the ranking Republican on the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say, when it comes to  5G, Republicans had an amendment to keep 5G from being regulated by  1930s law called title II.   My friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to get into a  big discussion about the huge regulatory door they are opening in  section 201 and section 202 that allows the FCC to basically run amok  with rules. They will claim that they are locking down what the FCC did  in 2015 but, in fact, while they may close one door--although we don't  even know all those 700 rules they are forbearing against that are  going to go into statute, they can't even provide that list and this  bill isn't going anywhere--they are opening this other authority-- unlimited authority, frankly--to the FCC to regulate all these forms of  technology.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, again, I would say Republicans are for  stopping any kind of action that throttles or blocks even paid  prioritization on the internet. We share that common view of net  neutrality.   But I would remind my colleagues that the legislation before us does  not in any way provide any regulatory oversight over where you go when  you get off the ISPs, get off that freeway, if you will, into places  like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. They are great American companies.  But what I hear from my constituents is they are concerned about pay  prioritization, the security, the trust, the data, and all of that that  the edge providers are a huge part of this ecosystem.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg).                                time  1600     Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess) for his work on this amendment, and the Democrats for  accepting this very thoughtful approach.   Americans are more and more concerned about the role that tech  companies play in this Information Age. You  [[Page H3180]]  read about how content gets blocked, gets prioritized, or in some cases  allegedly shadow banned.   We increasingly see these tech giants' inability to curb harmful and  illicit behavior online while they monetize our personal information.   Now, these are incredibly important platforms as well, they are great  American companies, but in most cases, they come about as close to a  monopoly as I have ever seen.   Meanwhile, these edge providers get special protection under section  230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and they are not covered by the  net neutrality rules that we are discussing today. They are not covered  at all.   This bill does nothing to protect consumers from online abuses.   When Republicans were in the majority, I personally presided over  hearings with the heads of some of the most important tech companies in  America. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter came  before our committee, sat inside the Rayburn hearing room, and talked  to us for hours.   Our majority enacted landmark protections against online human sex  trafficking that received the support of both sides of the aisle. We  moved forward with that legislation. It is now law.   Just as the internet has not stopped working from rescinding the 2015  order, the internet has not stopped working because we enacted  protections like FOSTA and SESTA. The internet still works.   But more improvements can be made in how we bring responsibility to  this sector of the internet. We should review all participants in the  virtuous cycle of the internet ecosystem, and that is the aim of this  amendment.   The amendment calls on the Government Accountability Office to  recommend solutions in dealing with edge providers, so they do not  abuse their special privileges that the 1996 act gave them.   This is our third revision of the amendment to make it acceptable to  move forward with the majority. I certainly had hoped we wouldn't  outsource this responsibility to the GAO over the FCC, not to mention  the Energy and Commerce Committee and Congress, but I certainly believe  we must make progress on this issue for the benefit of all American  consumers and for the health of the overall internet ecosystem.    Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. Latta for bringing this  very thoughtful amendment to the House floor, and I want to thank my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who, I believe, agreed to  accept it, if I heard that correctly.   The bill would codify the forbearance of 700 regulations into law, as  you probably heard, Madam Chair. However, we just don't know what those  700 provisions that are being forborne upon are.   We have repeatedly asked for that information in the subcommittee, in  the full committee, and every step of the way.                                time  1645    In fact, I don't think the authors of this legislation could tell us  today what those 700 provisions are, although they get referenced from  time to time. We are told that is really the underpinning and crux of  this legislation, that, in all these areas of law, the FCC said, ``We  are not going to, basically, regulate in this area,'' and they said  there are about 700 of these.   So I think it does matter, if you are in business or just whatever  you do in your life, to not know what the government--a pretty big,  powerful government here in Washington--is going to enforce or not  enforce or regulate or not regulate, and we don't know. But we are  being asked today, in this bill, to enshrine in Federal law the whole  700 of these that the FCC--not this one, not a future one, we are  told--would ever regulate in.   So we want the list. That is what this amendment asks for.   But wouldn't it be better when we legislate to actually know what we  are legislating on before we vote? That is a pretty simple concept in  good legislating, I think, and that is why we repeatedly asked for it;  and, obviously, we have not been able to get it, so it is a bit of an  irony.   Now, at the same time, they say don't worry because the FCC--you can  trust us. The FCC is never going to regulate in this area. And, in  fact, we are going to take these forbearances and lock them into  statute and they can never come back and everything is locked down  solid, boom. But that is like locking the front door of your house  while you open the backdoor.   And the backdoor is another part under title II. This is the argument  on the floor today. It is not about blocking, throttling, or paid  prioritization. You have heard us go back and forth, and we both agree.  We can stop those bad behaviors, and we should, and that could become  law. This bill will not become law.   But they open the backdoor and say to the FCC: You have got the  right, under sections 201 and 202, to basically do anything you want  through a rulemaking. So all the agency has to do is do a rulemaking,  and basically they can do everything they have done before and more.   It is that uncertainty of regulation on the internet that we have  referred to as the heavy-handed government. And this could be about  taxing the internet, fees on the internet, et cetera, et cetera.   So I am glad we are doing this amendment, and I am glad the majority  is going to accept it. I only wish it were a list before us in the  Record today, Madam Chair.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Chair, I appreciate that from my good friend.   If it were that easy to get that list, why didn't they get it for us  from the Chairman of the FCC before we went through this whole process?  We shouldn't have to vote on the bill to find out what is in it.
