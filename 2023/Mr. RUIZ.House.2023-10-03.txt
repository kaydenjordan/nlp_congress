 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and memorialize our  fallen heroes from CAL FIRE who gave their lives to serve our  communities. Assistant Chief Josh Bischof, Fire Captain Tim Rodriguez,  and pilot Tony Sousa, all sacrificed their life to protect their  community while battling a fire in Cabazon.   Assistant Chief Josh Bischof was a devoted and loyal firefighter,  husband, and father who never stopped serving others even in his last  moments. He started his career in the fire service as a volunteer  firefighter in Mountain Center at Volunteer Fire Station 78 and worked  his way up through hard work, loyalty, and commitment.   In recent months, before his tragic death, Josh had been promoted to  assistant chief with CAL FIRE Southern Region headquarters where he  oversaw the training program before transferring to the tactical air  operations.   Josh loved his wife of 24 years beyond measure and lived to make his  children's dreams come true no matter the cost.   Josh was always up for an adventure and was known for his willingness  to help others and was loved and respected by his friends, family, and  community.   Now, Fire Captain Tim Rodriguez loved being a firefighter more than  anyone could imagine. He was raised in Hemet and graduated from West  Valley High School in 1997. He started his fire service career as a  firefighter I, serving at Fire Station 41 in Mecca, and was soon  promoted to firefighter II at Fire Station 79 in Coachella.   Captain Rodriguez married his wife, Dorothy, in 2001 and had three  children: Josh, Haley, and Alexis. He will be remembered for the  immense love he had for his family and his passion for staying active  by hiking, camping, snowboarding, kayaking, and mountain biking.   Lastly, pilot Tony Sousa of Red Bluff, California, was fulfilling his  lifelong dream of being a pilot before the tragic accident.   Before fulfilling his dream, Tony was a dairy worker, a sales  representative for Outlaw Kart, a custom harvester, an avid water- skier, and finally a pilot.   In 2022, Tony played a pivotal role in implementing the CAL FIRE  Helicopter Coordinator training program. Through this program, Tony  guided and mentored a huge cohort of fellow aviators to help them  obtain certifications for their aviation careers.   Pilot Sousa is survived by his wife, Rachelle; sons, Connor and  Carson; father, Ed; and mother, Sharon.   These men were husbands, sons, fathers, who now leave behind loving  and caring families. Their bravery, courage, and devotion to duty will  always be remembered.   Madam Speaker, I ask everyone present on the House floor to join me  in a moment of silence for the CAL FIRE members--Assistant Chief Josh  Bischof, Fire Captain Tim Rodriguez, and pilot Tony Sousa.                            ____________________
