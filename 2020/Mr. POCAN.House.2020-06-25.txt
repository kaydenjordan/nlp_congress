 Mr. Speaker, look, I can't tell you specifically what it  must be like to have the police called on you at your home or a  friend's house or a business simply because of the color of your skin.   I can't tell you personally what it must feel like to know that just  because of your race, you are significantly more likely to get killed  by police simply by encountering them.   But all of these mere facts should bring rage to all of us. We must  rethink public safety in America.   Police shouldn't respond with violence just because they can. And  unfortunately, impunity has empowered a militarized police force.  [[Page H2434]]    The ugly reality is, we have a criminal justice and policing system  that disproportionally targets and kills Black people. And when a  system isn't performing for the people it is supposed to serve, it is  time to fix it. In fact, it is way overdue for that change.   Today, we can do more than just give lip service to the words ``Black  Lives Matter.'' We can give those words meaning. We do that by passing  the Justice in Policing Act today.
