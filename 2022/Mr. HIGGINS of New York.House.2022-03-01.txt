 Madam Speaker, last week the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention lifted many mask wearing mandates due to  the positive trends in the fight against COVID-19. Effective today,  Canada's Ontario Ministry of Health is removing capacity limits and  vaccination requirements for all settings.   Increased vaccination rates in the United States, Canada, and around  the world show that communities who have done the right thing and  followed the science can return to a watchful sense of normalcy.   Today, I am calling on the United States and Canadian Governments to  follow the science-based directives of their health agencies and to  fully reopen the Canadian border to travelers without COVID  restrictions.   Two years ago, the border between the United States and Canada closed  with devastating consequences for both countries, economically and  emotionally. Incredible progress has been made in the fight against  COVID. It is time to move the remaining disjointed and prohibitive  restrictions at the U.S. and Canadian borders.                            ____________________
