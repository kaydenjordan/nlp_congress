 Madam Speaker, this morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross, the Marie Antoinette of the Trump administration, said he  ``doesn't understand why Federal workers need to go to food banks.''  Oh, my God. He might as well have said: Let them eat cake.   This President and his Cabinet are so out of touch, it is pathetic.  Here are just a few emails I have gotten this week.   A law enforcement officer in my district says: ``We struggle, but  pinch pennies so our child can attend a good school. My mortgage  company put us in no-pay status. The shutdown is putting us at risk of  losing our home.''   A Customs and Border Patrol employee says: ``We have bills to pay,  like nursery school and daycare. What's going to happen to us? I am  sick over this.''   A Fish and Wildlife Service worker writes: ``I am proud to serve the  American public. But right now, I can't even serve my family dinner.''   Madam Speaker, President Trump's publicity stunt is hurting America's  hardworking public servants. It is cruel. Shame on him and shame on  Majority Leader McConnell for refusing to end this shutdown. He, along  with the President, need to grow up. They need to do their job, and  they need to reopen this government now.
