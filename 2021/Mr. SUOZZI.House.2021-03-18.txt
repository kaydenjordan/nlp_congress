 Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, my father was born in a small  medieval village in the mountaintops of southern Italy.   He came to America as a young boy, and in his St. Dominic's High  School senior yearbook, he wrote that his goal in life was ``to become  a real American.''   Twenty-seven years ago, I served as the young mayor of my hometown of  Glen Cove. I addressed the issue of a growing population of new  immigrants from Central and South America who gathered on street  corners looking for daywork by creating the first day-worker site  anywhere on the East Coast of the United States of America.   Today, those same men who gathered on street corners have their own  businesses, own their own homes, and their children went to school with  my children.   One Dreamer from El Salvador, who graduated high school with my  daughter, went on to graduate from college with a degree in biomedical  engineering, got a master's in biomedical engineering, and is now  pursuing a doctorate in the same subject.   Today, I will support the American Dream and Promise Act, for Mario,  for Nelson, and for all the other Dreamers whose goal is, like my  father's, to become a real American.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, 100 years ago my father was born in a  small medieval village in the mountaintops of southern Italy.
