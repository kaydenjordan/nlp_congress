 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to thank the  Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Maine for this reason: They  are following a long and venerable tradition in the United States  Senate that too many Senators do not follow. They are allowing--despite  their final view on the substance of an issue--the full Senate to make  a decision on an important issue.   It used to be that a motion to proceed to an issue was routine. It  used to be that after a certain period of time, we would cut off the  vote so we could have an up-or-down vote, 51, on an important issue.   We have gotten away from that, but Senator Collins and Senator  Murkowski have been among the most consistent Senators who would say,  absent extraordinary circumstances, ``I am going to vote to allow the  vote to come to the floor so the full Senate can make its decision,''  and I thank them for that.   Madam President, as to Mrs. DeVos, I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record, following my remarks, an article about why the  Senate should promptly confirm Betsy DeVos as U.S. Education Secretary,  which I believe it will do so.   Mrs. DeVos will be an excellent Education Secretary. She has  commitment to public education. She has said that. There is no better  example of that than her work on the most important reform of public  schools in the last 30 years, which is charter schools.   Charter public schools are the fastest growing form of public  education to give teachers more freedom and parents more choices, and  she has been at the forefront of that public school activity. Second,  she has spent her time truly helping to give low-income parents more  choices and better schools for their children, but is that a reason not  to support her? I would be surprised if any President supported an  Education Secretary who didn't support charter schools. I would be  surprised if a Republican President nominated an Education Secretary  who didn't believe in school choice.   What I especially like about Mrs. DeVos is that she believes in the  local school board, instead of the national school board. She has made  it clear that there will be no mandates from Washington to adopt Common  Core in Arkansas or Tennessee if she is the Education Secretary, there  will be no mandate in Washington to evaluate teachers in Washington  State this way or that way if she is the Secretary, and there will be  no mandate from Washington to have vouchers in Maine or Alaska if she  is the Secretary.   She believes in the bill we passed in December of 2015, with 85  votes, that restores to States and classroom teachers and local school  boards the responsibility for making decisions about standards, about  tests, about how to help improve schools, about how to evaluate  teachers. That passed because people were so sick and tired of  Washington telling local schools so much about what to do.   She will be that kind of Education Secretary. She will be an  excellent Education Secretary. The two Senators have followed a  venerable and honorable tradition in the Senate by saying they will  vote to allow the full Senate to consider her nomination, and when we  do, I am confident she will be confirmed.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows: [Jan. 24, 2017]                 Senate Should Promptly Confirm Betsy DeVos                         (By Sen. Lamar Alexander)         Democrats desperately are searching for a valid reason to       oppose Betsy DeVos for U.S. Education Secretary because they       don't want Americans to know the real reason for their       opposition.        That real reason? She has spent more than three decades       helping children from low-income families choose a better       school. Specifically, Democrats resent her support for       allowing tax dollars to follow children to schools their low-      income parents' choose--although wealthy families choose       their children's schools every day.        Tax dollars supporting school choice is hardly subversive       or new. In 2016, $121 billion in federal Pell Grants and new       student loans followed 11 million college students to       accredited public, private or religious schools of their       choice, whether Notre Dame, Yeshiva, the University of       Tennessee or Nashville's auto diesel college. These aid       payments are, according to Webster's--``vouchers''--exactly       the same form of payments that Mrs. DeVos supports for       schools.        America's experience with education vouchers began in 1944       with the GI Bill. As veterans returned from World War II,       federal tax dollars followed them to the college of their       choice.        Why, then, is an idea that helped produce the Greatest       Generation and the world's best colleges such a dangerous       idea for our children?        Mrs. DeVos testified that she opposes Washington, D.C.,       requiring states to adopt vouchers, unlike her critics who       delight in a  [[Page S552]]       National School Board imposing their mandates on states, for       example, Common Core academic standards.        So, who is in the mainstream here? The GI Bill, Pell       Grants, student loans, both Presidents Bush, President Trump,       the 25 states that allow parents to choose among public and       private schools, Congress with its passage of the Washington,       D.C. voucher program, 45 U.S. senators who voted in 2015 to       allow states to use existing federal dollars for vouchers,       Betsy DeVos--or her senate critics?        The second reason Democrats oppose Mrs. DeVos is that she       supports charter schools--public schools with fewer       government and union rules so that teachers have more freedom       to teach and parents have more freedom to choose the schools.       In 1992, Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party created a       dozen charter schools. Today there are 6,800 in 43 states and       the District of Columbia. President Obama's last Education       Secretary was a charter school founder. Again, who is in the       mainstream? Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party,       Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama; the last six U.S.       Education Secretaries, the U.S. Congress, 43 states and the       District of Columbia, Betsy DeVos--or her senate critics?        Her critics dislike that she is wealthy. Would they be       happier if she had spent her money denying children from low-      income families choices of schools?        Mrs. DeVos' senate opponents are grasping for straws. We       didn't have time to question her, they say, even though she       met with each one of them in their offices, and her hearing       lasted nearly an hour and a half longer than either of       President Obama's education secretaries.        Now she is answering 837 written follow up questions from       Democratic committee members--1,397 if you include all the       questions within a question. By comparison, Republicans asked       President Obama's first education secretary 53 written       follow-up questions and his second education secretary 56       written follow-up questions, including questions within a       question. In other words, Democrats have asked Mrs. DeVos 25       times as many follow-up questions as Republicans asked of       either of President Obama's education secretaries.        Finally, Democrats are throwing around conflict of interest       accusations. But Betsy DeVos has signed an agreement with the       independent Office of Government Ethics to divest, within 90       days of her confirmation, possible conflicts of interest       identified by the ethics office, as every cabinet secretary       is required to do. That agreement is on the internet.        Tax returns? Federal law does not require disclosure of tax       returns for cabinet members, or for U.S. Senators. Both       cabinet members and senators are already required to publish       extensive disclosures of their holdings, income and debts.       Cabinet members must also sign an agreement with the Office       of Government Ethics to eliminate potential conflicts of       interest.        One year ago, because I believe presidents should have       their cabinet in place in order to govern, I worked to       confirm promptly President Obama's nomination of John King to       be Education Secretary, even though I disagreed with him.        Even though they disagree with her, Democrats should also       promptly confirm Betsy DeVos. Few Americans have done as much       to help low-income students have a choice of better schools.       She is on the side of our children. Her critics may resent       that, but this says more about them than it does about her.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the  committee rules for the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS                         Lamar Alexander, Chairman               RULES OF PROCEDURE (AS AGREED TO JANUARY, 2017)         Rule 1.--Subject to the provisions of rule XXVI, paragraph       5, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, regular meetings of       the committee shall be held on the second and fourth       Wednesday of each month, at 10:00 a.m., in room SD-430,       Dirksen Senate Office Building. The chairman may, upon proper       notice, call such additional meetings as he may deem       necessary.        Rule 2.--The chairman of the committee or of a       subcommittee, or if the chairman is not present, the ranking       majority member present, shall preside at all meetings. The       chairman may designate the ranking minority member to preside       at hearings of the committee or subcommittee.        Rule 3.--Meetings of the committee or a subcommittee,       including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the       public except as otherwise specifically provided in       subsections (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of       the Senate.        Rule 4.--(a) Subject to paragraph (b), one-third of the       membership of the committee, actually present, shall       constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business.       Any quorum of the committee which is composed of less than a       majority of the members of the committee shall include at       least one member of the majority and one member of the       minority.        (b) A majority of the members of a subcommittee, actually       present, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of       transacting business: provided, no measure or matter shall be       ordered reported unless such majority shall include at least       one member of the minority who is a member of the       subcommittee. If, at any subcommittee meeting, a measure or       matter cannot be ordered reported because of the absence of       such a minority member, the measure or matter shall lay over       for a day. If the presence of a member of the minority is not       then obtained, a majority of the members of the subcommittee,       actually present, may order such measure or matter reported.        (c) No measure or matter shall be ordered reported from the       committee or a subcommittee unless a majority of the       committee or subcommittee is physically present.        Rule 5.--With the approval of the chairman of the committee       or subcommittee, one member thereof may conduct public       hearings other than taking sworn testimony.        Rule 6.--Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the committee or a subcommittee if the absent       member has been informed of the matter on which he is being       recorded and has affirmatively requested that he be so       recorded. While proxies may be voted on a motion to report a       measure or matter from the committee, such a motion shall       also require the concurrence of a majority of the members who       are actually present at the time such action is taken.        The committee may poll any matters of committee business as       a matter of unanimous consent; provided that every member is       polled and every poll consists of the following two       questions:        (1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the proposal; and        (2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal.        Rule 7.--There shall be prepared and kept a complete       transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record       the proceedings of each committee or subcommittee meeting or       conference whether or not such meetings or any part thereof       is closed pursuant to the specific provisions of subsections       (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       unless a majority of said members vote to forgo such a       record. Such records shall contain the vote cast by each       member of the committee or subcommittee on any question on       which a ``yea and nay'' vote is demanded, and shall be       available for inspection by any committee member. The clerk       of the committee, or the clerk's designee, shall have the       responsibility to make appropriate arrangements to implement       this rule.        Rule 8.--The committee and each subcommittee shall       undertake, consistent with the provisions of rule XXVI,       paragraph 4, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, to issue       public announcement of any hearing or executive session it       intends to hold at least one week prior to the commencement       of such hearing or executive session. In the case of an       executive session, the text of any bill or joint resolution       to be considered must be provided to the chairman for prompt       electronic distribution to the members of the committee.        Rule 9.--The committee or a subcommittee shall require all       witnesses heard before it to file written statements of their       proposed testimony at least 24 hours before a hearing, unless       the chairman and the ranking minority member determine that       there is good cause for failure to so file, and to limit       their oral presentation to brief summaries of their       arguments. Testimony may be filed electronically. The       presiding officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the       time of each witness appearing before the committee or a       subcommittee. The committee or a subcommittee shall, as far       as practicable, utilize testimony previously taken on bills       and measures similar to those before it for consideration.        Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the       full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the       chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and       report that fact to the full committee for further       disposition.        Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing       at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full       committee. No more than one subcommittee executive meeting       may be held at the same time.        Rule 12.--It shall be the duty of the chairman in       accordance with section 133(c) of the Legislative       Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended, to report or cause to       be reported to the Senate, any measure or recommendation       approved by the committee and to take or cause to be taken,       necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote in the Senate.        Rule 13.--Whenever a meeting of the committee or       subcommittee is closed pursuant to the provisions of       subsection (b) or (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of       the Senate, no person other than members of the committee,       members of the staff of the committee, and designated       assistants to members of the committee shall be permitted to       attend such closed session, except by special dispensation of       the committee or subcommittee or the chairman thereof.        Rule 14.--The chairman of the committee or a subcommittee       shall be empowered to adjourn any meeting of the committee or       a subcommittee if a quorum is not present within fifteen       minutes of the time schedule for such meeting.        Rule 15.--Whenever a bill or joint resolution shall be       before the committee or a subcommittee for final       consideration, the clerk shall distribute to each member of       the committee or subcommittee a document, prepared by the       sponsor of the bill or joint resolution. If the bill or joint       resolution has no underlying statutory language, the document       shall consist of a detailed summary of the purpose and impact       of each section. If the bill or joint resolution repeals or       amends any statute or part thereof, the document shall       consist of a detailed summary of the underlying statute and       the proposed changes in each section of the underlying law       and either a print of the statute or the part or section       thereof to be amended or replaced showing by stricken-through       type, the part or parts to be omitted and, in italics, the       matter proposed to be added, along with a summary of the       proposed changes; or a side-by-side document showing a       comparison of current law, the proposed legislative changes,       and a detailed description of the proposed changes.        Rule 16.--An appropriate opportunity shall be given the       minority to examine the proposed text of committee reports       prior to their filing or publication. In the event there are       supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate       opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the       proposed text prior to filing or publication. Unless the       chairman and ranking minority member agree on a shorter       period of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three       business days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional       views for inclusion in a committee report from the time the       majority makes the proposed text of the committee report       available to the minority.  [[Page S579]]         Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue       subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear       subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has       been authorized by majority vote of the committee.        (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn       testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the       committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum:       provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking       minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single       member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.        (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the       authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee       or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such       chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking       minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any       other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding       the identity of the person to whom it will be issued and       the nature of the information sought and its relationship       to the authorized investigative activity, except where the       chairman of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation       with the ranking minority member, determines that such       notice would unduly impede the investigation. All       information obtained pursuant to such investigative       activity shall be made available as promptly as possible       to each member of the committee requesting same, or to any       assistant to a member of the committee designated by such       member in writing, but the use of any such information is       subject to restrictions imposed by the rules of the       Senate. Such information, to the extent that it is       relevant to the investigation shall, if requested by a       member, be summarized in writing as soon as practicable.       Upon the request of any member, the chairman of the       committee or subcommittee shall call an executive session       to discuss such investigative activity or the issuance of       any subpoena in connection therewith.        (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any       witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel       of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness       is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.        (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential       material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of       the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made       public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary,       unless authorized by a majority of the members of the       committee or subcommittee.        Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of       their background and financial interests, including the       financial interests of their spouse and children living in       their household, on a form approved by the committee which       shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The       committee form shall be in two parts--        (I) information relating to employment, education and       background of the nominee relating to the position to which       the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public;       and,        (II) information relating to financial and other background       of the nominee, to be made public when the committee       determines that such information bears directly on the       nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the       individual is nominated.        Information relating to background and financial interests       (parts I and II) shall not be required of nominees for less       than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or       boards when the committee determines that some or all of the       information is not relevant to the nature of the position.       Information relating to other background and financial       interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when       the committee determines that it is not relevant to the       nature of the position.        Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or       meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation,       shall not be initiated until at least five days after the       nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the       chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority       member, waives this waiting period.        Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the       committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the       committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at       any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire       membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice,       or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.        Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is       even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules       and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for       purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for       quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.        Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the       chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session. The       chairman shall promptly distribute all filed amendments       electronically to the members of the committee. The chairman       may modify the filing requirements to meet special       circumstances with the concurrence of the ranking minority       member.        Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of       the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the       Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization       Act of 1946, as amended.                            *    *    *    *    *    Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters                                   HEARINGS         Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act       requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce       the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least       one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.        The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice       to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time       and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of       section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the       committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the       development of hearings:        1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of       each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in       the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement       of such hearing.        2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each       committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should       provide notice to the minority of the time, place and       specific subject matter of such hearing.        3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing,       the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a       list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited       to appear.        4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the       maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of       the committee rules as it relates to the submission of       written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance       of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony       even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received       in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as       appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to       each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and       distributed electronically.            EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS         In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to       assist each member of the committee so that there may be full       and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a       subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be       followed:        1.
