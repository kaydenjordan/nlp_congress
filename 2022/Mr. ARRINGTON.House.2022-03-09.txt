 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately President Biden continues  to be inexcusably feckless in his response to global threats from our  adversaries.   Now, in the moment of truth, when America can send a clear and  unequivocal message to dictators and democracies alike by banning  Russian oil imports to the United States, the President has failed once  again to rise to the occasion.   This anemic response would remove the commonsense conditions for  lifting the ban like Russia's full and immediate withdrawal from  Ukraine and their ceasing to threaten other NATO countries.   The most egregious aspect of this proposal is that the President and  the Democrat leadership refused to revoke Russia's permanent normal  trade relation status, which will continue to allow them low-tariff  access to the United States market--a privilege only allies of freedom  should receive.   Consistent with Biden's timid response, I fear that these half- measures will not only fail to deter Vladimir Putin, but will invite  other tyrants around the world to follow suit.   Mr. Speaker, we must unload the full arsenal, the full force of  America's economic arsenal on the Russian Federation and their rogue  leader.
