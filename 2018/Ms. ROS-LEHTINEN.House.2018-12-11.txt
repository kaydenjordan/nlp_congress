 Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise today in honor  of Judge Caryn Canner Schwartz upon her retirement from the Eleventh  Judicial Circuit Court of Florida where she has proudly served since  1993.   Throughout her long and distinguished career as a judge, she has  worked in the Civil and Criminal Divisions of the Miami-Dade County  Court and as an Acting Circuit Court Judge in the Civil, Criminal,  Domestic Violence and Family Divisions of the Circuit Court.   When Caryn is not sitting on the bench, she volunteers her time and  experience through many different charitable and educational  organizations, including mentoring law students and young attorneys. In  fact, for the first 10 years of her career, Caryn taught high school  students science and math and worked tirelessly to educate our Nation's  youth.   Our south Florida community has benefited substantially from Judge  Schwartz's leadership and her public service; and for this I truly  thank her.   Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to join Caryn's family, her  friends, and her peers as they honor the many accomplishments of her  outstanding career. I wish her and the entire Schwartz family all the  best in this new exciting chapter of her life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my friend  Steve  Chabot's resolution, H. Res. 1091, which calls for the release of two  Burmese journalists who were unjustly imprisoned for what crime?  Courageously reporting on the genocide against the people known as the  Rohingya.   In September, I joined Jan Schakowsky and  Steve Chabot in sending a  letter to Secretary of State Pompeo expressing our grave concern for  the 7-year sentence given to these brave journalists. Unfortunately,  the stories of these men are just two of the many, many sad examples of  the erosion of press freedom and other basic rights in Burma.   At a time when these brave men should be rewarded for helping make  the evidence available to the U.N. commission investigating these  crimes, they get jail time. This resolution sends a strong message that  the world is paying attention.   In 2012, I was worried that it was too soon for the Obama  administration to ease sanctions on Burma. Unfortunately, it has proven  to be too soon. In the aftermath of the massacre of the Rohingya, we  must hold all individuals responsible for these crimes against humanity  accountable. I call on the Burmese Government to release these  journalists and reform the law so that freedom of the press is not  obstructed.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, once again, our chairman, Ed Royce, and  Eliot Engel for their continued commitment to bringing forth bipartisan  and important bills to the floor.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Chabot's resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel for their leadership in bringing this bipartisan measure  to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to especially thank the author of this  important resolution, my Florida colleague, Brian Mast, for his efforts  in calling attention to the bloody Assad regime. What a highly valued  member Mr. Mast is to our committee and to this institution. He is an  American hero and an American treasure.   There is no one more responsible for what is going on in Syria, as  Mr. Mast  [[Page H10072]]  has pointed out in his resolution, than Bashar al-Assad. Who is the one  responsible for this massacre of his own people? Al-Assad.   Assad brutally repressed peaceful Syrians who were demanding change  in their country. Assad unleashed thousands of terrorists from the  prisons into Iraq in 2003, helping to create the precursor to ISIS, and  he did so again during the Syrian protests of 2011, leading to the  founding and growth of ISIS.   And Assad, with his brutal and insidious tactics, is responsible for  the hundreds of thousands of murders, for war crimes, for crimes  against humanity. He continues to be responsible for the daily terror  occurring in Syria to this day. Bashar al-Assad is the one responsible.   This is not a man who can lead a country. So we must use every tool  at our disposal to put pressure on Assad and his backers, including  pressure on Iran, pressure on Russia. They are the ones who are backing  him. We have got to pass my good friend Mr. Engel's bill, the Caesar  Syria Civilian Protection Act, and the bill that he puts forth with Mr.  Royce, the No Assistance for Assad Act. These are important bills, and  they are still pending in the Senate, as all good bills go, pending in  the Senate.   We must ensure that Assad is not allowed to participate in any future  election in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Mast of Florida, for authoring  this important resolution. I urge all of my colleagues to give it their  support.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the Committee on  Agriculture and the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Russia's ongoing aggression has taken many forms, from  outright invasion and annexation of territory in Ukraine to  cyberattacks and other assaults against the U.S. and our NATO allies.   One of the most powerful weapons in its armory is its export of  energy, especially oil and gas. The Nord Stream II pipeline from Russia  to Germany will hand Moscow another source of influence to wield  against our NATO allies and Ukraine. The result will be to undermine  Europe's energy security and perhaps the will to resist Russian  aggression.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution and urge  the President to use all of the means at his disposal to prevent this  pipeline from being constructed. Only then can U.S. interests in  Europe, including the integrity of the NATO alliance, be made secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree  to the resolution (H. Res. 1162) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives with respect to Ukraine, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1162         Whereas the United States is committed to supporting       international norms and agreements governing the peaceful       relations between countries;        Whereas the Russian Federation has repeatedly violated       international norms and agreements by its continuing       aggression against Ukraine, including directing and arming       separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and forcibly occupying       and illegally annexing the Ukrainian territory of Crimea;        Whereas the Russian Federation continues to foment conflict       in Ukraine in order to undermine the Ukrainian Government and       economy;        Whereas these actions have caused tremendous suffering for       the Ukrainian people, with thousands of Ukrainians killed       both in battle and in their homes, and hundreds of thousands       made refugees;        Whereas the Russian Federation continues to deny any       responsibility for the destruction of Malaysian Airlines       flight 17 over Ukraine, which killed 298 innocent civilians;        Whereas the Russian Federation has continuously failed to       meet its commitments under the Minsk II agreement;        Whereas the United States and its allies and partners       around the world continue to support the Ukrainian people in       their efforts to strengthen their government, economy, and       military in order to bring peace and prosperity to their       country and to the surrounding region;        Whereas the United States and its allies and partners       around the world have imposed punitive sanctions and other       measures against the Russian Federation for its continued       aggression against Ukraine, including its occupation of       Crimea;        Whereas the Russian Federation continues to expand its       aggression against Ukraine, including militarization of the       Azov Sea and blockading the Kerch Strait in contravention of       international norms and agreements;        Whereas, on November 25, 2018, the Russian Federation fired       upon and rammed Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through       the Kerch Strait and seized the Ukrainian vessels and their       crews: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the Russian Federation's firing upon, ramming,       and seizing Ukrainian vessels and crews attempting to pass       through the Kerch Strait on November 25, 2018, as violations       of binding international norms and agreements;        (2) calls on the Russian Federation to immediately return       the Ukrainian vessels and their crews to Ukraine;        (3) calls on the Russian Federation to cease its violation       of Ukraine's sovereignty and its efforts to prevent Ukrainian       vessels from transiting the Kerch Strait, as is Ukraine's       right under international norms and agreements;        (4) reaffirms the United States commitment to provide the       people of Ukraine with political, economic, and security       assistance to enable them to secure their independence,       democracy, and prosperity; and        (5) encourages the President and allies and partners of the       United States to hold the Russian Federation accountable for       its ongoing aggression against Ukraine.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and esteemed Ranking  Member Engel for their swift action in putting this important and  timely resolution together in support of the people of Ukraine.   For far too long, we have witnessed Putin's increased aggression  against Ukraine, directing and arming separatist forces on Ukraine soil  and forcibly occupying and annexing the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.   More recently, Russian forces were firing upon, ramming, and seizing  Ukrainian vessels and crews attempting to pass through the Kerch  Strait, in clear violation of international norms and agreements.   The 2014 destruction of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 that killed close  to 300 people also demonstrated the threat to civilians in this  conflict. Until this day, Putin continues to deny any responsibility  for that heinous act. Meanwhile, thousands of Ukrainians continue to be  killed fighting for their basic freedoms that we as Americans hold  dear, while hundreds of thousands flee looking for a safe haven.   Mr. Speaker, Putin's actions are simply unacceptable, and the United  States and our allies must stand strong against Russia. That is why  this resolution is so important. We must make it clear that we truly  support the people of Ukraine and their aspirations for a free and  democratic society.   For that, it is crucial that the United States provides the kind of  assistance--politically, militarily, and economically--that will allow  Ukraine to fight Russia's increasing coercion. We must also use all of  the tools at our disposal, because these are not isolated issues, to  ensure that Putin and his regime pay a heavy price for Russia's  aggression.   Through this resolution and other measures, we can demonstrate to  Putin and the world that we are paying close attention, that we will  continue to support the people of Ukraine and do what is necessary to  protect Ukraine and other countries threatened by his imperial  ambitions, and to ensure that they can live in peace and live in  security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to condemn  Putin's despotic rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who is our esteemed chairman  of our Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Ukraine remains under assault from Moscow, which is  betting that the West is tiring of the struggle and that it is free now  to expand its aggression. Silence on our part at this critical moment  invites miscalculation and an escalation of the conflict.   We must demonstrate by our words and actions that we remain fully  committed to assisting the people of Ukraine to defend their country,  including by providing them with the weapons they need to defeat  Russia's continuing aggression. A slap on the wrist at this point will  not restrain Putin and may guarantee the expansion of hostilities that  we hope to avoid.   We strongly encourage the President to use the authority that  Congress has provided to impose sanctions on Russia and to take action  to make clear that we remain committed to the sovereignty of the  Ukrainian people and a Ukraine that is whole and free.   I want to thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Engel) for authoring  this very important measure and, most importantly, for his consistent  leadership on Ukraine. At the end of my service in this body, I thank  him for the many years of friendship and cooperation as we worked  together to promote the interests and the values of the American people  around the world.   It has been a real joy, and I thank Mr. Engel for sharing that ride  with me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
