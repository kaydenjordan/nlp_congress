 Mr. Speaker, every day, constituents in my district are  asking when the $1,400 survival checks are coming and when they can get  help with their rent so that they don't become homeless. They are  suffering, and they need help now.   Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is a real plan to crush the  virus by speeding vaccine distribution and increasing access to  healthcare. This will not only mean safer families but also safer  classrooms for teachers and students. It means a continuation of $300- a-week checks in unemployment insurance, and it supports our businesses  so they don't close.   Mr. Speaker, with over half a million dead, we need a way to end this  crisis and help our people. That is exactly what today's bill will do.  I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.
