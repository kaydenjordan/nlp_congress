 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to praise  what must be two corporate CEO superstars based on just how much they  have made in compensation.   The first is Irene Rosenfeld who was CEO of Mondelez/Nabisco. Over  the last 5 years she was paid over $100 million, and her successor--who  makes Ms. Rosenfeld look poor by comparison--Mr. Dirk Van de Put in 41  days was paid $42 million.   Now, $42 million for 41 days of work, $105 million for the last 5  years' worth of work, you must think: What superstars these two are.  What great achievements or great invention did these two CEOs come up  with?   Here is what they have done leading Nabisco.   They closed the factory in Philadelphia in my district that employed  hundreds of people for over 60 years. They closed a similar plant in  Chicago that employed over 600 people. By the way, when I say employed,  I am not talking about minimum wage jobs. I am talking about good,  family-sustaining jobs.   Now, where did these jobs go?   To what other part of the United States did they go?   Salinas, Mexico, where workers, instead of getting family-sustaining  wages, are getting paid approximately $1.50 an hour. That is wrong.  When you wonder why there is such angst in our  [[Page H554]]  economy today, despite the historically low unemployment rate, this is  why.   In case you think that Philadelphia and Chicago might be exceptions  to this Nabisco business model, they have also done it in Pittsburgh,  Houston, Niles, St. Elmo, Buena Park, and as I have mentioned, of  course, Philadelphia and Chicago.   This is greed on steroids.   So the next time you crave an Oreo or crave Chips Ahoy!--both Nabisco  brands--Madam Speaker, I urge you to take a look at the back of the  package and see whether or not it was still made in the United States  or if it is one of the products that is now made in Mexico.   Madam Speaker, I also urge you to do this: contact your Member of  Congress and say that you are not going to accept trade deals and tax  policies that allow this sort of disgraceful behavior to happen--the  hollowing out of American middle class jobs.   It is wrong, and we the elected officials of this country have to  stand up for the American worker.                            ____________________     BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I applaud the  gentleman from California for leading on this issue.   I find that there is a false perception when it comes to Federal  workers that they are all based in the Washington, D.C., area. We even  heard some comment to that effect from the President not so long ago.   In fact, so much of our Federal workforce is spread throughout the  country. In the Philadelphia metro area that I represent, we have the  fifth highest number of Federal workers in the country. Furthermore,  there are all those who actually are impacted in some way by this  government shutdown, not just the 800,000-plus who are going right now  without a paycheck.   My ask is very simple. I want the Senate majority leader to allow a  vote on the same bill that passed unanimously--unanimously--in the  Senate just a few weeks ago.   On that Wednesday, it passed on voice vote unanimously in the Senate.  We were here on Thursday morning, prepared to vote on that same  legislation.   But what happened between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning?  The President received a great deal of criticism from his base, and  then suddenly the bill that passed unanimously from the Senate less  than 24 hours prior was not good enough, and now here we are, stuck in  the longest government shutdown in American history.  [[Page H587]]    I also want to make this point, because all of us in government so  often have gone from crisis to crisis to crisis. This is a real  systemic problem in which we--all of us, regardless of party--are  shooting ourselves in the foot and actually reducing now the economic  projection of our GDP growth over the next year, completely needlessly.  Almost every Western democracy does not do it this way.   Once we get beyond the shutdown, a bipartisan group of legislators  should look for a systemic fix to this and the other sort of major way  in which we shoot ourselves in the foot, which is when we actually come  into danger of not raising the debt ceiling and playing really with  fire.   These are mechanisms that most other Western democracies don't have.  They certainly have their partisan fights; only, instead of two  parties, often, it is more than two major parties.                                time  1645    So I do think that once we get beyond this crisis, we do need to  figure out a way to prevent this from ever happening again.   There are going to be different legislators in these seats,  inevitably all of us will be gone. There will be the switch of party  control that has happened multiple times in this century and will  continue to happen.   We need to figure out a way to avoid these needless government  shutdowns in the future that are only costly. They hurt real people who  are living paycheck to paycheck--people, by the way, who are Democrats,  Republicans, Independents, and nonvoters. And there is really nothing  to be gained out of these government shutdowns.   So let us work together to end this government shutdown. It is  completely unnecessary. It could end tomorrow if there were willingness  in the White House and on the Senate side. And then let's also work  together to ensure that this is not only the longest government  shutdown in American history, but also the last.
