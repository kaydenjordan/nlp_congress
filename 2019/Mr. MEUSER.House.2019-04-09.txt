 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and  to H.R. 1644, also known as the government-controlled internet act.   Once again, House Democrats are putting Federal Government control  over freedom and bringing to the floor yet another partisan, central  command government bill.   H.R. 1644, or the government-controlled internet act, which,  fortunately, has no chance of being signed into law, goes against  everything that made the internet what it is today.   There is a reason the United States is home to the top internet  companies in the world. This doesn't happen by accident. It is because  of the laissez faire approach that allows for an environment of  economic growth, competition, and innovation.   Instead of building on the pro-innovation approach that has  revolutionized how we communicate, work, and stay connected, this  legislation would impose heavy-handed, top-down regulations that would  box the internet into outdated rules written in the 1930s.   Why is the Democratic majority supporting a bill that will take the  internet backwards?   This bill is the quintessential solution in search of a problem. If  we want to protect constituents, promote investment, and encourage  innovation, H.R. 1644 is not the solution.   If my colleagues across the aisle are serious about protecting  consumers and ensuring access to a free and open internet, then we need  to find bipartisan consensus on net neutrality principles that address  blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. We need a modern  framework that allows for continued American innovation and investment,  not another Federal Government regulatory takeover.   H.R. 1644 is not a serious solution to protecting our constituents  and advancing American ingenuity. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  effort and send a clear message that we need to move the internet  forward, not backward. I hope they will oppose this rule and the  underlying legislation.
