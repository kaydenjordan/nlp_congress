 Mr. Speaker, I speak today and rise in support of the  rule for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling also for moving this  very important bipartisan piece of legislation through the House  Financial Services Committee.   Additionally, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who supported my bill last year. Unfortunately, it got stuck in  the Senate, so we are doing it over again this year in the House.   Mr. Speaker, the primary responsibility of every Member of Congress  is to help keep our families safe. Embedded with that promise is to  support and defend our Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, moms and dads in Maine and across America are  increasingly alarmed by the frequency of terrorist attacks here at  home, with another attempted attack 2 days ago in New York City.   Mr. Speaker, today, there are 1,000 ongoing investigations of  terrorist activity by the FBI in all 50 States.   Mr. Speaker, that is why H.R. 1638 is so important. It is a  commonsense bill that will help keep our families safe and free. In  doing so, we should never make this a political issue.   Mr. Speaker, the Iranian Government is one of the chief sponsors of  terrorism and instability throughout the world. Their senior political  and military leaders and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps train,  arm, and fund terrorist organizations around the world. They have  become experts at using the internet and social media to radicalize, to  recruit, and to direct terrorist attacks around the globe, including  here in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, the Iranian Government has American blood on its hands.   Now, there are approximately 70 to 80 top political and military  leaders in Iran that control about one-third of its entire economy.  They use their power to corrupt the telecommunications, the  construction, and other important industries in that country.   A recent investigation by Reuters found that the Supreme Leader in  Iran alone has accumulated tremendous personal wealth through a  foundation claiming to help the poor. So while the corruption has  grown, the average Iranian citizen earns the equivalent of $15,000 per  year.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, the citizens of Iran and the people of the  world should know how much wealth has been accumulated by these chief  sponsors of terrorism and what the money is being used for.   Companies across the globe looking to possibly do business with Iran  should also understand what they are dealing with before they invest.   That is why my Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act is a  straightforward, main, commonsense bill. It simply requires the U.S.  Treasury Department to collect, to maintain, and to post online the  list of these 70 or 80 senior political and military leaders in Iran,  their personal assets, and how that money was acquired and what it is  being used for.   My bill requires the Treasury Department to post this information on  their website in English as well as the three major languages that are  used and spoken, rather, in Iran: Farsi, Arabic, and Azeri. The  information should be available, easily downloaded, and shared by  everyone who wants to see this.   Mr. Speaker, I might also add that this information comes from  publicly available sources. It is not classified information.   Now, I have heard folks say: Well, this is not a good idea to expose  the Iranian Government's corruption in their funding of terrorism,  because, if you do, we might not be able to work with these people.   Are you kidding me?   These are the radicals who regularly chant ``Death to America.'' It  doesn't make sense to hope that they will abandon their support for  terrorism by not shedding light on their corruption. Mr. Speaker, hope  is not a national security strategy.   My bill helps make sure Congress gets its priorities straight when it  comes to this issue. Protecting American families here at home and  helping to safeguard our troops overseas, where they are fighting for  our freedom, is the right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, so let's use one click of a computer from any corner of  the globe to help expose the illicit activities of the chief sponsor of  terrorism in this world. Secrecy and corruption breed more terrorism by  governments like those in Iran.   Let us stand up, Mr. Speaker, for every peace-loving nation around  this world, and let's stand up to protect our families here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the time and the consideration.  Please vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset  Transparency Act.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on  behalf of my bill, and I am grateful to you for moving this very  important bipartisan bill through the House Financial Services  Committee.   I also want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  supported this bill last year. Unfortunately, it got stuck in the  Senate, so we have got to do it again this year, but I am thrilled to  be here.   Mr. Chairman, the primary responsibility of every Member of Congress,  whether you are on the left side or the right side of the aisle, no  matter what State you are from, what part of the country you are from,  the major responsibility, the primary responsibility is to support and  defend our Constitution. To me, that means protecting our families and  those American citizens abroad.    Now, our moms and dads in Maine, Mr. Chairman, and across this  country, are increasingly alarmed by the frequency of terrorist attacks  here at home; another attempted 2 days ago in New York City. Today, Mr.  Chairman, there are 1,000 investigations dealing with terrorist  activities across this land in all 50 States. That is why H.R. 1638 is  so important. This bill will help keep our families safe and keep them  free.   In doing so, we must make sure this issue is not a political issue.  National security never should be a political issue. Mr. Chairman, the  Iranian Government, as Mr. Hensarling just mentioned, is the chief  state sponsor of terrorism and instability in this world.   These senior political leaders and their military leaders, including  the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, they train, they arm, and they  fund terrorist organizations around the world. They have become experts  at using the internet and social media to radicalize, recruit, and  direct terrorists around the globe, including here in the United States  of America.

Mr. Chairman, the citizens of Iran and the people of this world  should know how much wealth has been accumulated by those that sponsor  terrorism and what that money is being used for.   Companies across the globe that are looking to do business with Iran  should understand what they might be getting into. So I disagree with  my colleague from California, the ranking member, who says that this is  going to possibly create confusion; that it will possibly cause  businesses around the world to hesitate from investing in Iran.   Well, guess what, Mr. Chairman. That is a good idea.   My Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act is a straightforward,  main, commonsense bill. It simply requires the Department of Treasury  to collect, to maintain, and to post online the list of these 70 to 80  senior political and military leaders and the assets, their personal  assets, how this money was acquired, and what it is being used for.   As Mr. Hensarling mentioned, it will require the Treasury Department  to post this on their website in English as well as in Farsi, Arabic,  and Azeri, the three languages that are mostly used in that country.   I might also add that my colleague on the other side of the aisle  might be a little bit confused about this issue, but the information  posted on this website will be that that is publicly available. There  will be no information that should not be posted there that only  Congress should have access to.   I have heard, Mr. Chairman, critics of this bill saying: Well, you  know, it is not a good idea to expose the Iranian Government's  corruption in funding of terrorism because, if you do so, well, the  Iranian political and military leaders might not want to work with us.   Are you kidding?   These are the radicals who regularly chant ``Death to America.''   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Hoping that these folks also abandon their support of  terrorism by not shedding light on their corruption doesn't make any  sense. Hope, Mr. Chairman, is not a national security strategy.   My bill makes sure that Congress gets its priorities straight.  Protecting American families here at home and safeguarding our troops  around the world who are fighting for our freedom is what we should be  doing every way we can, and that is what this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that using one click of a computer  from any corner of the globe to help expose illicit activities by the  chief state sponsor of terrorism is a very, very good idea.   Let's stand up for all the peace-loving nations in the world. Let's  stand up to help our families protect their kids. Let's stand up to  protect our homeland. I ask everyone, Republicans and Democrats, please  vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency  Act.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), who is a member of the  Financial Services Committee and who is my friend.    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maine  to respond to that description of what this bill is all about.    Mr. Chairman, to the gentlewoman from California and to  the other side of the aisle, I do want to make sure I make a few things  clear.   First of all, I am not sure if it was the gentlewoman or someone else  saying: Why in the dickens would we divert resources away from fighting  terrorism to post this information on the Treasury website? It costs  too much.   Well, with all due respect, the CBO estimates it will cost $500,000  to do this for 2 years. The United States Treasury Department has a  budget of $14 billion per year. That is number one.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, I thank you for  wanting to talk about something else, but I yielded to you to see if  you could help me with information about what was stated that the  gentleman who spoke before you said that this bill had nothing to do  with the agreement.    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Is the gentleman prepared to respond  to the question that I have raised?   If you are going to talk about what this bill has to do with the  agreement, when the gentleman said it has nothing to do with the  agreement, then I yield to the gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Chairman, the dangerous Iran nuclear deal that was  put together a year and a half or 2 years ago has absolutely nothing to  do with exposing the wealth that has cumulated through corruption by  the top 70 to 80 Iranian political and military leaders and posting  that for the world to see. I am sure the ranking member knows this has  zero to do with the Iran nuclear deal.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, we know that  there are individuals who are sanctionable in the deal.   What I thought you were attempting to do is to expand that and to  identify more leaders and try and understand where the assets come  from, what they use them for, whether or not they are involved in money  laundering. But the gentleman said it had nothing to do with the deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The Chair would  remind all Members to direct their remarks to the Chair, please.    Mr. Chairman, I did want to respond to the gentlewoman  from California and to other folks who are on the other side of this  bill.   First of all, I think it is very clear to the world that the Iranian  Government has been cheating on the nuclear deal almost since day one.  I think it was within months, Mr. Chairman, that they test-fired both  medium-range and long-range ballistic missiles, in violation of an 8- year ban on developing those conventional weapons.   So I think it is kind of silly for us to be debating here about a  government that sponsors terrorism and vows to wipe Israel off the face  of the Earth and kill as many Americans as they can, as a leadership  regime that is going to abide by this agreement when they have proven  they are not.   Second of all, as I have mentioned several times, my bill has nothing  to do with this agreement. But, then again, someone on the other side  of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, also said: Well, we think American  officials, American leaders, should be responsible for disclosing that.   Well, here is the difference: America does not sponsor terrorism. The  Iranian Government does.   That is exactly what we are trying to get at, Mr. Chairman. I am  trying to understand what folks who will not support this bill are  going to say when they go back home at Christmastime, when they had an  opportunity to shed sunlight on the top political and military leaders  in Iran who are ripping off the Iranian people and who are sponsoring  terrorism, why it is a bad idea to make sure this information is public  to the world as well as to the Iranian people. I would like to  understand what they are going to say when they go back home and talk  to their constituents.   Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for this opportunity. This is a terrific  bill. It does something very common sense: put pressure through  sunlight, through transparency, on the chief sponsor of terrorism in  the world--the Iranian regime.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the  information that is being shared by my colleague, Mr. Poliquin. I am  going to yield more time to him to explain to me: The missiles that he  is describing in Iran, that are not a part of the deal, of the plan,  are they similar to the missiles that are being fired with nuclear  warheads from North Korea.  [[Page H9874]]         Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Chairman, can the gentlewoman repeat the question  again? I didn't understand it.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I said: The missiles  that he is referring to, that he is concerned about with Iran, that are  not a part of the plan, are they similar to the ballistic missiles that  are being fired from North Korea with nuclear warheads possibly on  them?    Mr. Chairman, the missiles that I was referring to are  very clear to the gentlewoman from California. They deal specifically  with the Iran nuclear deal, which is a dangerous deal for this world  and for this country. It has nothing to do with any issue dealing with  North Korea.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Are they more dangerous than the  missiles from North Korea?    What difference does that have to do with the----        Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming       my time, I will tell Mr. Poliquin what difference it makes.   Here we are with threats from North Korea and the President of the  United States unwilling to be involved with diplomacy, who, rather,  would like to basically mimic and mock the leader of North Korea by  calling him ``Little Rocket Man,'' and by telling the Secretary of  State: Don't talk to him. It is no use to talk with him.   So here we have North Korea, who has already indicated that they have  missiles that will reach us right here in the United States, anywhere  in the United States, and Mr. Poliquin is telling me about his concern  about missiles in Iran that are not a part of the nuclear deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
