 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to proactively prevent human rights abuses against LGBTQI  individuals.   As the Congresswoman representing the LGBTQI capital of the South,  this amendment is just another way that my district is leading the way  to achieve human rights and equity for all. Decades of advocacy, from  Atlanta's first gay pride march in 1971, to annual events like Black  Pride and Southern Fried Queer Pride have made Atlanta the city ``too  busy to hate.''   Atlanta gets a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign, and the  community that the Black and LGBTQ-plus activists have created in  Atlanta is the kind of world that we want everywhere. At home, we have  a saying, ``Atlanta influences everything,'' and my amendment is  designed to do just that by extending human rights protections beyond  my city and our Nation's borders.   With my amendment, the State Department will study how it can better  coordinate internationally to prevent international human rights abuses  based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics  before those abuses occur. This will create a better world for everyone  no matter where they live, who they love, or how they identify.
