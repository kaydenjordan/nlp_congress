 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have now  crossed $28 trillion in debt. We borrow more than $2 million every  minute. The deficit last year was over $3 trillion. The deficit this  year will be over $3 trillion. There is a $1 trillion wish list out  there for everybody. Everybody wants something.   Somebody says: Oh, there is money in the Treasury. Guess what. There  is not. There is a big hole, a big black hole in the Treasury, 28  trillion dollars' worth.   So we do have this one asset, and when we sell it, we should do it to  pay down the deficit. We shouldn't do it to expand government further.   So I object to this because we are $28 trillion in debt. We don't  have any money, and we should be fiscally conservative as we profess to  be.   I object.
