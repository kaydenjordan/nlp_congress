 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1430, the  HONEST Act, sponsored by the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, Chairman Lamar Smith.   Let's all go back to the fifth grade, where we learned about the  steps of the scientific method and do a quick review.   After we formulated our question and came up with our hypothesis,  what did we do?   We tested that hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting  the data in a reproducible manner.   Data isn't reproducible if it isn't even made available. Now, Mr.  Speaker, transparency and reproducibility are basic tenets of science  that every elementary school student learns and values. Yet our very  own Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulation after  regulation using studies and data that are not available for public  review, despite the very serious ramifications of that very data.   In 2012, President Obama's own chair of the Science Advisory Board  testified ``that literature and data used by the EPA be peer-reviewed  and made available to the public.''   This is common sense, Mr. Speaker: let's make public policy using  public data and use public data for public policy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for leading this initiative.
