 Mr. Speaker, a lot can happen in a year: a woman  can deliver a newborn; a child can learn to walk; and a small virus  leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, can go around the globe and cause a  global pandemic.   While the first two are joyous, the latter, and the 1-year  anniversary of the Biden administration, is nothing to celebrate. We  have the highest inflation in 40 years, and you don't need a graph to  show that. We see it each day when we go to fill up our tank or go to  the grocery store.   We have the end of American energy independence and a plea to OPEC to  increase petroleum production; record-high numbers of illegal border  crossings; almost double legal immigration, with no COVID-19 testing;  record-high illegal drug crossings, especially synthetic fentanyl, with  record-high overdoses, especially in our young population, 18 to 45;  record-high homicides and crime in blue States; a disastrous withdrawal  from Afghanistan, Saigon 2.0, with a loss of billions in equipment and  the lives of 13 of our servicemen and -women.   The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has led to increased  instability with Russia and China.   We have a vaccine mandate that ignores science, which shows that both  the delta virus can transmit, even if vaccinated and boosted, and  omicron wanes within 1 month.   My advice to this administration: End the vaccine mandate; stop what  you are doing; and go on vacation.  [[Page H256]]                                ____________________
