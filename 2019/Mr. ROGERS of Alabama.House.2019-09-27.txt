 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   In the last year, nearly 1 million illegal immigrants attempted to  cross our southwest border. Let me put that into perspective for you.   One million is more than the population of Delaware, or South Dakota  or North Dakota or Alaska or Vermont or Wyoming. One million is  approximately the population of Austin, Texas; San Jose, California; or  Jacksonville, Florida.   For months, migrant families and children arrived at the border in  droves thanks to sophisticated smuggling operations. Coyotes told  vulnerable populations that a child was their ticket into the United  States--whether or not it was their child. The massive groups of  migrants overwhelmed our border patrol facilities, leading to  overcrowding and unacceptable conditions for migrants and law  enforcement alike.   At the high-water mark of this crisis, more than 50 percent of the  border patrol agents were pulled off the front lines to process,  transport, and care for the record numbers of migrant children and  families. The men and women of CBP have worked hard to manage this  crisis while Democrats in this House were busy talking about a fake  emergency at our border.   The administration has taken extraordinary steps like the migrant  protection protocols, DNA testing to catch child smugglers, and  interpreted new rules to reduce abuse of our asylum laws.   While the President is doing everything in his power to manage the  crisis, House Democrats have done nothing. They steadfastly refuse to  do anything to fix our broken immigration system, to protect vulnerable  families and children from human smugglers, to reduce the asylum  backlog, or expand migrant processing and long-term housing. Now they  want to take away the President's authority to respond to this crisis  and prevent another one from happening. It is disgraceful.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.    Madam Speaker, today I ask for the House's  attention to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Talladega 500  Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama.   In the mid-1960s, NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr., envisioned a  bigger and faster track on the NASCAR circuit. After meeting with local  race car driver and fan Bill Ward of Anniston, Alabama, the location  was selected for the track, and the groundbreaking ceremony for the  Alabama International Motor Speedway--today known as the Talladega  Superspeedway--took place on May 23, 1968.   The first race, the Talladega 500, was held on September 14, 1969,  with Richard Brickhouse winning that race. I had the good fortune to be  in attendance that day with my dad. The race played a major role in  NASCAR's history, as many of the top stars of the sport walked out the  day before the race due to concerns over tire wear on the 200-mile-per- hour track. Mr. France said the race would go on and recruited drivers  from the smaller NASCAR Touring Series, the Bama 400, the day before to  replace them.   The Talladega Superspeedway is the most competitive racetrack on the  NASCAR schedule, the highest banked, and the longest, as well as the  most fan friendly.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing the anniversary of the  Talladega Superspeedway.                            ____________________
