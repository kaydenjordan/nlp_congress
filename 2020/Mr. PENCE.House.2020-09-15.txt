 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my wholehearted  support for our Nation's law enforcement community. Members of this  very Congress have called to defund the police, and when they say  ``defund police,'' they mean it literally. They want to strip away  support for the officers who keep our communities safe.   Our men and women in blue deserve the utmost respect as they put  their lives on the line every day to protect and serve their  communities. We witness now, more than ever, just how dangerous this  job is.   We are a nation of law and order, and that is why I will always back  the blue.                    President Trump Supports Our Veterans     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a veteran of the United  States Marine Corps to thank President Trump and his administration for  all the outstanding work he has done for our veterans and the members  of the military. During a time when our country has needed it most,  President Trump has shown robust support for our brave men and women in  uniform.   Our Armed Forces serve our Nation with honor, and it is our duty to  provide them with the resources they need to keep Americans safe. We  are building our military and making sure it comes to be the strongest  force in the world.                       Truck Drivers Appreciation Week     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Truck Drivers  Appreciation Week.   As a Representative from the ``Crossroads of America,'' I know  firsthand just how important truck drivers are to our community and to  our Indiana economy. Over 80 percent of Hoosiers depend on the trucking  industry to keep their businesses moving.   As a businessman, I understand the important role trucking plays in  the American economy, and it is my hope that Truck Drivers Appreciation  Week brings attention to driver safety and financial support for this  working community.                         Richard G. Lugar Post Office     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3105, a bill to  designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located in  Indianapolis as the Richard G. Lugar Post Office.   Senator Lugar was a true statesman who led a life of honor and  service to Indiana and this country. As mayor of Indianapolis, Dick  Lugar's vision transformed our State's capital city. As an Indiana  Senator, he left a lasting legacy on domestic and global affairs.   The Hoosier State is greater and our Nation is stronger because of  Richard G. Lugar. I am proud and humbled to stand with my colleagues to  honor the life of this great Hoosier.                     Infrastructure Improvements to I-70     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to important  and positive news regarding infrastructure in the Hoosier State.   The U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding a grant of $22.5  million to the Indiana Department of Transportation to improve the  infrastructure on I-70.   Hoosiers deserve the best infrastructure, and that means making sure  our interstates are as safe and efficient as possible. I hear from  constituents frequently about I-70, and I am glad to announce a huge  improvement is heading toward the Sixth District.   Thank you to the Trump administration for continuing to be committed  to improving the infrastructure of our Nation.                         Recognizing Hoosier Farmers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the amazing Hoosier  agricultural community.   Farmers across our Nation work hard each day ensuring our friends,  family, and neighbors can put food on the table. This devoted community  has recently been put to the test with COVID-19, and they have stood up  to the challenge to keep America fed.   I recently had the privilege of holding a farmers roundtable in my  district to hear directly from this community how I can better  represent them in Congress. As Indiana's Sixth District Representative,  I will always support Hoosier farmers and our ag and ethanol  communities.                        Congress Must Get Back to Work     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Congress to get back to  substantive work in our Nation's Capital.   The definition of Congress is ``a national legislative body,  especially that of the United States, which meets at the Capitol in  Washington, D.C.''   Last week, I was the only one to physically attend a Transportation  Committee hearing on rail workers affected by COVID-19.   I believe the proper way for Congress to represent our constituents  is in person in our Nation's Capital. It is imperative we simply get  back to work for our constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, September 15, 2020, I was honored  to attend the Abraham Accords Signing Ceremony at the White House. This  historic peace deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel  demonstrates President Trump's commitment to bring stability to the  region. For the above reason, I was not recorded for roll call vote 185  and 186. Had I been present, I would have voted Nay on the Previous  Question on H. Res. 1107 and Adoption of H. Res. 1107.                             personal explanation
