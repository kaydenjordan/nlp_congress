 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would like to begin today with a  few words about the late Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.   Justice O'Connor was a transformative figure in the history of our  country and of our highest Court. She was a trailblazer in both  legislative politics and constitutional jurisprudence, and I am  grateful for her extraordinary life and for her dedicated service.  [[Page S5701]]    I know our colleagues join me in offering our deepest condolences to  Justice O'Connor's children, grandchildren, and the entire O'Connor  family.
