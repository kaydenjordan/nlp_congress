 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote for rollcall  vote Nos. 710 through 717. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall vote No. 710, ``nay'' on rollcall vote No. 711,  ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 712, ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 713,  ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 714, ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 715,  ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 716, and ``nay'' on rollcall vote No. 717.                            ____________________
