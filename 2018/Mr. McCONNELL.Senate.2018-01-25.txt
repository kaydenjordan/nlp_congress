 Mr. President, this week, the Senate has moved past a  partisan paralysis and checked off several important items for the  American people.   On Monday, we passed the bipartisan measure that funds the government  through February 8. But that bill didn't only end the shutdown, it also  extended the State Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 years.  That is long-term security for millions of vulnerable children and  peace of mind for their families. And the bill delayed three onerous  taxes that ObamaCare would otherwise have imposed on the American  people.   Yesterday, I filed cloture on commonsense legislation to protect  unborn children who can feel pain. There are only seven countries left  that still permit elective abortion after 20 weeks, including us,  unfortunately, China, and North Korea. On issues of human dignity, this  is not the company we ought to keep. I look forward to voting to  advance this bill next week.   We also made important headway in another vital area--the personnel  business. We confirmed three of President Trump's highly qualified  nominees for important posts. We have a new Chairman of the Federal  Reserve, Mr. Powell. We have a new Secretary of Health and Human  Services, Mr. Azar. And we have a new Ambassador at Large for  International Religious Freedom, our former colleague Sam Brownback.  Here in the Senate, Mr. Brownback championed legislation to combat  human trafficking and work to facilitate cooperation on issues facing  vulnerable children. As the voices of religious minorities are being  suppressed around the world, I am glad they will have Ambassador  Brownback to speak up for them.   Of course, a great deal of work lies ahead of us. In the near future,  we need to make bipartisan progress on areas such as immigration and  border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and securing adequate  funding for our Armed Forces. It is my strong preference that Senators  reach bipartisan agreements on these issues in advance of the February  8 deadline. Fortunately, with the government shutdown behind us,  serious discussions have resumed on all these matters. A bipartisan,  bicameral group, including Senators Cornyn and Durbin, is hard at work  on immigration. We will also hear from the White House on Monday, and I  look forward to the framework they will present.   I am optimistic these ongoing negotiations will lead to results;  nonetheless, I came to the floor on Sunday night and again on Monday to  restate a possibility I had previously discussed with Members with  diverse views on immigration policy. I restated that if the February 8  deadline for the current funding bill passes and a long-term agreement  still eludes us, as long as the government remains open, the Senate  will proceed to a variety of priorities on the subject of immigration,  including border security, the DACA issue, and other aspects of  immigration policy.   The bill I choose to introduce for debate will have an amendment  process that will ensure a level playing field at the outset. The  amendment process will be fair to all sides, allowing Members to offer  their own legislation for consideration and votes. While I obviously  cannot guarantee any outcomes, let alone supermajority support, I can  ensure the process is fair to all sides.   I am glad that my restating this simple position helped my Democratic  colleagues to persuade their leader to abandon his filibuster and  permit the government to reopen. The American people are waiting for us  to act as soon as possible, so I hope that hard work and honest  discussions will yield agreements before February 8.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, on Tuesday,  President Trump will deliver his first State of the Union Address. He  will have good news to deliver on a variety of fronts. I am  particularly looking forward to his remarks on our economy.  [[Page S508]]    Consumer confidence is up. Unemployment is down. Markets are breaking  records. From small businesses to our largest job creators, pay raises,  bonuses, and plans for new investments are all in season.   Of course, the engine of American prosperity is the American people,  but smart policy can help by getting the government out of their way.   Last December, Republicans in the House and the Senate joined the  President to deliver once-in-a-generation tax reform. Every day, more  evidence piles up that tax reform is already working for the American  people. The headlines are full of major employers announcing pay raises  and bonuses for workers, as well as new investments.   For example, Brown-Forman--a global spirits company headquartered in  my hometown of Louisville that employs more than 1,000 Kentuckians-- announced yesterday that tax reform will help the company to start a  new charitable foundation for community investment and commit $120  million to fund employee pensions.   Soon, thanks to tax reform, a Main Street small business owner will  finally be able to realize her dream to expand into the vacant shop  next door. Of course, that will mean hiring more help.   Soon, thanks to tax reform, a father-and-son manufacturing plant will  be able to afford the new equipment they have been eyeing and give  their workers new skills in the process.   Stories like these may not make waves here in Washington, but believe  me, they will be front-page news in communities all across our country.  From coast to coast, Americans' lives will improve as Main Street  businesses operate for the first time under a 21st-century tax code.   This is not just a tax law for the big guys. Now even the smallest  businesses will be able to take a significant deduction on their  business income, giving them more money to buy new equipment, hire new  employees, or provide health coverage for their team.   So much focus has been on bonuses, pay raises, and 401(k) matches,  and for good reason. But we should not forget all of the jobs that will  be created when businesses decide to invest more because they can  immediately deduct their capital expenditures. I am already hearing  from small business owners this law was designed to help.   Before tax reform, one franchise restaurant owner in Kentucky wrote  me to say that ``the current high tax rate that I pay as a pass-through  entity reduces the amount of earnings I can reinvest into my business,  employees, and community.'' She went on to say, ``I am very encouraged  that tax reform is under way in Congress and hope that it can be  accomplished in a timely manner.'' Well, Republican majorities in  Congress and the President did just that.   In Nicholasville, KY, another constituent of mine operates a rental  business for event equipment. He recently explained that ``the relief  that will be provided by the new tax bill gives companies like mine the  capital to purchase new inventory . . . as well as hire additional  employees.''   Summing it up, American enterprise is thriving. Tax reform helped  make it happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
