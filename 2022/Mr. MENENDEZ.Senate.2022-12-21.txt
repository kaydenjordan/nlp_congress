 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able       to complete my remarks before the vote.         Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight       the importance of the confirmation vote on Lynne Tracy, our nominee to       be Ambassador to Russia.        Today, on the 300th day of Putin's heinous, unjustified war against       Ukraine, I am humbled that we will welcome President Zelenskyy to       address Congress later tonight. As President Zelenskyy will no doubt       underscore, Putin's war is one of the greatest challenges we face       today.        Putin is targeting Ukrainian civilians. He is bombing their       electricity grid and their water supplies as winter sets in. That is,       in essence, from my perspective, a war crime.        We haven't seen anything like this in Europe since the Second World       War. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, for their freedom, for       the future of their country and their children. But even as Putin       presses forward with this brutal war, the United States needs an       Ambassador who can represent us in Moscow, and that is why we need       Ambassador Lynne Tracy to assume her post without delay.        She is a career diplomat with an exceptional record of leadership and       public service. She has the courage to carry out her duties in the face       of a hostile government and represent America beyond the Kremlin walls,       and she has the experience to lead the mission in one of the most       challenging and difficult places our diplomats work today.        Our personnel in Moscow are braving harsh conditions, separation from       their families, and are largely cut off from the world--all to serve       their country, to serve Americans who need them. And in spite of that,       we have diplomats who are raising their hands saying: Send me.       Ambassador Tracy is one of them.        Our Nation needs a strong voice to stand up for our values. From the       larger Russian public, many of whom feel isolated and betrayed by their       leader's war of aggression, to the American detainees who Putin still       holds in his prisons, to the Russian opposition activists who are       fighting for a different way forward in Russia, Ambassador Tracy will       not shy away from confronting Putin's abuses. America needs her in her       post. Europe needs her in her post. Ukraine needs her in her post. So I       urge this body to confirm Ambassador Tracy today.        I yield the floor.                                          Vote on Tracy Nomination               I ask for the yeas and nays.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, we all know the phrase ``Justice       delayed is justice denied.'' It is a concept that appears in the Magna       Carta, and the words can be found in Martin Luther King's ``Letter from       Birmingham Jail.''        Today, as I come to the floor, I am appalled at how the Senate has       treated the Latino community in the final days of the 117th Congress. I       cannot help but think that justice is being both delayed and denied for       millions of Americans. There is just simply no way around it.        Every year, with its last votes before leaving town, Congress reveals       where its priorities lie. With so many key issues and such precious       little time to insert them into the omnibus, we negotiate to deliver       wins for our constituents before the Senate adjourns. It is only when       the final bill text is revealed that communities learn just how hard we       fought for them.        This year, on issue after issue, Latino communities have learned that       some of their top priorities were forgotten or ignored, especially       after a Congress in which we mustered the political courage to pass       once-in-a-generation legislation like the American Rescue Plan and the       Inflation Reduction Act. It is a slap in the face to Latinos across our       country to exclude them from this latest must-pass legislation. It is       an outrage.              I come to the floor today to set the record straight on how this       Chamber has often stood in the way of meaningful equality for the       Latino community.        Take for example an issue that I have been leading for almost three       decades--the National Museum of the American Latino.        Two years ago, this Chamber passed bipartisan legislation to       establish this museum along with the American Women's History Museum.       As part of that historic bill, we gave the Smithsonian a deadline of       next week to make final designations on where they will be built. It is       a deadline they were on schedule to meet after announcing two optimal       sites on the National Mall just a few months ago, but when the       Smithsonian Board of Regents indicated they would need a legislative       fix to proceed before meeting the deadline, Members of this body       decided to stall the effort in its tracks.            [[Page S9745]]              Let me be clear. The legislative fix requested by the Smithsonian       would have added zero dollars to our Federal spending--zero. It would       have circumvented none of the processes that we follow under regular       order. Rather, it would simply permit the museums to be built where the       Smithsonian considers to be the best location--on the National Mall.        So I ask my colleagues: Why? Why? Why are we letting opaque, closed-      door negotiations get in the way of finally telling the story of       millions of Latinas and Latinos in this country? Why are we telling       them they don't deserve to be on the National Mall, where our most       iconic monuments and museums are?        Make no mistake, we belong on The Mall. We belong alongside the       National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of       African American History, and we belong in the place where millions of       visitors come to learn about their histories and their pasts.        The importance of these museums and their locations cannot be       overstated. This is about standing shoulder to shoulder with more than       60 million Latinos across this country. It is about standing shoulder       to shoulder with the tens of thousands of Latinos who have worn the       uniform of the United States, like the Borinqueneers--an all-Puerto       Rican regiment that fought in the Korean war and earned the       Congressional Gold Medal--as well as many in business and science who       have added greatly to our national success. It is about telling them,       no matter their politics, their backgrounds, or their stations in life,       they deserve to be recognized as part of our American story.        I, for one, simply cannot understand how it is that Congress has       jeopardized their museum site selections just days before the deadline.        Another glaring omission of concern is the lack of equity in this       year's omnibus bill for the people of Puerto Rico.        Throughout my 30 years in Congress, I have fought to address the       systemic injustices that Puerto Ricans face when they try to access       Federal programs. It is unconscionable that I should have to say it,       but the residents of Puerto Rico--3\1/2\ million of them--are U.S.       citizens. They are American citizens, full stop. As American citizens,       they deserve the equality of the same earned benefits as those on the       mainland.        Particularly when it comes to Medicaid, I have repeatedly fought for       more than the smaller term patches that have typically funded these       programs. Now, I am glad we were able to include a temporary fix for       the next 5 years in the spending package to be considered by the Senate       soon, but make no mistake, it is the bare minimum of what we should do.        As I have said before, short-term solutions do long-term damage to       beneficiaries, especially since Federal dollars would allow the island       to stabilize their healthcare system--a healthcare system that, in       addition to having received inadequate funding, has had to endure       earthquakes, hurricanes, and constant power outages.        So if this body is going to acknowledge the reality that Puerto       Ricans are American citizens and if they believe that Puerto Ricans       should be able to retain their healthcare providers while receiving       high-quality care, then they will work with me to enact a permanent fix       to Medicaid. It should not matter whether you live on the island or on       the mainland. I will not rest until we have secured a full commitment--      a permanent commitment--for the American citizens of Puerto Rico.        I implore my colleagues to stand with me and, most importantly, to       support the residents of Puerto Rico when we reconvene in the next       Congress.        Last but not least is an issue that for so many Latinos in the Nation       invokes the legacies of our own families who migrated to the United       States--the continuous mistreatment of migrants at the southern border       under title 42.        Title 42 is a disastrous relic of the Trump administration and       Stephen Miller's racist immigration policies. It is grounded in the       callous ideology that somehow Latino refugees who come to the southern       border don't deserve humanitarian protections under our laws--the same       protections, by the way, that my family received, that some of my       fellow colleagues' families received, that millions of immigrant       families have received for generations.        Title 42 rejects immigrants at the border under the guise of ``public       health,'' which we all know was a shoddy excuse by the Trump       administration to achieve their goal of shutting down our asylum       system.        Under the Biden administration, it is as callous today as when it was       first enacted in March of 2020. Why? Because title 42 is an affront to       our Nation's values. It goes against every word that is etched on the       Statue of Liberty. Yet, as it works its way through the courts, I have       been hearing my colleagues, including some on this side of the aisle,       defend it. But they are wrong for two reasons: Title 42 has made border       security--an issue that Latino communities care deeply about--far worse       at our southern border. Two, it has denied access to our asylum system       for refugees fleeing persecution and torture.        What are the three biggest groups that you find today at the southern       border? They are not Mexicans. They are not Central Americans. They are       Cubans, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans. Why? Because they are fleeing       oppression in those countries.        The only individuals who benefit from extending title 42 are the       smuggling networks that exploit migrants, predominantly Black and Brown       migrants whom we turn away before adjudicating why they chose to       migrate.        But beyond failing the migrants themselves, title 42 is a failure by       the very metrics it seeks to affect. Supporters of title 42 like to say       that somehow we are being ``invaded'' at our southern border. It is the       favorite talking point of rightwing media pundits who claim that the       United States is facing an invasion of migrants who want to change our       way of life. To back it up, they point to data released by Customs and       Border Protection showing that there has been an increase in the number       of migrant encounters on the southwest land border. But what their dog       whistles and scare tactics ignore is the reason for this increase.        Simply put, title 42 has become the revolving door that allows       migrants to try and try and try again if they are apprehended by       immigration authorities. It circumvents our legal asylum process, where       we should be adding resources and manpower to come to a final       determination--yes, you qualify under our law, you are welcome; no, you       don't qualify under our law, you are deported--and end the revolving       door. But all title 42 does is to push people back over the border, and       they go and try again. So when you see those numbers, it could be the       same person trying 10 times--a process that would determine if someone       is eligible for asylum or not, and if not, seek permanent deportation       instead of having them return through the revolving door.        Considering an amendment to prolong the damage of title 42 is the       last thing this body should be doing in order to advance the omnibus       spending bill. Considering an extension of title 42 when we have       millions of Dreamers, young people who know only the Pledge of       Allegiance and the flag of the United States as their flag, who know       only the national anthem of the United States as their national anthem,       and who still cannot become U.S. citizens, and the millions of people       waiting to legally be reunified with their families in the United       States or our U.S. citizens, is the greatest failure of all.        Finally, we come to the issue of Latino representation in our       leadership offices and on the Senate floor. The lack thereof shows the       incredible disregard for our community.        These are just a few examples of how the Senate has failed the Latino       community in this last bill of the year: relegating the Latino museum       as something less than worthy of being on the National Mall; failing to       deliver equal and permanent parity for the 3\1/2\ million U.S. citizens       who call Puerto Rico their home; seeking to prolong title 42's harmful       impact on our country; and failing to have us represented in our       leadership operations.        I recognize the fact that some of my colleagues may disagree with       some of the points I have made, but you cannot ignore them.        For 30 years in Congress, I have been speaking up for the equal       opportunity, equal justice, and equal dignity that Latinos deserve. I       have no plans of stopping anytime soon. For as long as I am here, I       will be speaking truth to            [[Page S9746]]            power for a community that too often has been told to wait your turn,       wait your turn; to be thankful for whatever you are given; and to not       rock the boat--``basta, basta ya.'' This is not ``feliz Navidad''; it       is more like bah humbug.        Latinos are a community of more than 60 million Americans strong. We       contribute more than $2 trillion to the gross domestic product of this       country. We have worn the uniform of the United States in incredible       numbers, disproportionate to our size of the American population, and       we have shed blood and given our lives for the country, and we will not       be cast aside and ignored by the powers that be.        You cannot appeal to us at election time and forsake us the rest of       the time, not as long as I am in this seat, not as long as I have this       desk, with this voice, and this fierce urgency to do what is right for       Latinas and Latinos in this country as full citizens of the United       States.        With that, I yield the floor.
