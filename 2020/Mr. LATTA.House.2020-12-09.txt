 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 549. This  resolution reaffirms the importance of having diverse representation  across the media to better reflect their audience and serve the public  interest. I urge my colleagues to support this pledge to eliminate  barriers to media diversity and to reinforce our commitment to  encourage diversity in media policy.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to spend the remainder of my time to  commend the leadership of my good friend, the ranking member, Mr.  Walden. Unfortunately, Leader Walden has decided to make this his last  term in Congress, but his work at the Energy and Commerce Committee and  his service to the people of Oregon will continue to positively impact  our Nation for decades to come. It is going to be hard to imagine going  to the committee without him at the helm on our side.   You have been a steady force, just as your family, who has been a  steady force when they took those wagon trains to Oregon on that trail  back in 1845. You have never forgotten your roots, and you show that  every day. I appreciate it because I know, under your leadership, you  have helped many of us in committee. And I know, as your vice chair,  you had a lot of confidence in me when you let me take over the helm on  many a day and run the committee.                                time  1300    But as one of your subcommittee chairs on Digital Commerce and  Consumer Protection and this Congress being the ranker on  Communications and Technology, I appreciate that.   And I know that, again, when I think about all of the things that you  have worked on, especially in the last Congress and with the opioid  epidemic, which claimed over 73,000 lives in this country, and you were  at the helm of H.R. 6 and brought together all those bills, over 60  pieces of legislation to help people in this country. And that is going  to be a lasting legacy that we are going to have.   So, again, we are going to appreciate you, but we also hate to see  you leave.   And also, with all your telecom work, to have someone with that  experience, as you mentioned in your opening remarks about you and your  bride of 38 years, Mylene, owning the radio stations and being able to  get out there and get the work done.    Mr. Speaker, again, it has been a tremendous run with all  the work that you have done. You have been a gentleman and a good  friend.   Something I learned from my dad from his 36 years in public service,  and I will say it again on this floor. He said there is a difference  between people who are politicians and public servants. He said a  politician is a person who sees how much they can take from the people  they represent for their own benefit, while a public servant sees how  much they can give of themselves back to the people they represent.   For what you have done for not only your constituents of your great  State but also here in this body, we are going to miss you.   So, Greg, and that is the first time I have ever used a first name on  this floor, we are going to miss you. I am going to miss you, but we  wish you all the best in the years to come.
