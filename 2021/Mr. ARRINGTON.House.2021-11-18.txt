 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State  of Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have said a lot about the disastrous effects of this  gargantuan tax and spend bill on the heels of an economy that is  sputtering on account of massive spending, which is driving inflation,  and on the unemployment policies that have locked labor on the  sidelines, and you have got vaccine mandates coming down the pike. This  is the proposal from my Democrat colleagues and my friends.   What I can't understand, for the life of me, Mr. Speaker, is that in  this bill, that is supposed to go after the inequity gap in our  country, they have the largest spending program as a giveaway to  millionaires from high-tax States like New York and California, $280  billion. There are special interest carve-outs. This looks like a  Christmas tree of giveaways to political allies, unions, plaintiffs'  attorneys, and media corporations.   That is all in this bill, Mr. Speaker. I plead with my colleagues:  Relent.
