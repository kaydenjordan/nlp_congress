 Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying I certainly and clearly  disassociate myself from the remarks of the previous speaker. I  absolutely, wholeheartedly disagree with him and do not concur with  him.   Mr. Speaker, in 1999, my son Huey became a victim of gun violence  when he was murdered in an aborted robbery attempt as he was bringing  groceries into his apartment on the South Side of Chicago.   Tragically, Mr. Speaker, my son's death was not unique because  literally  [[Page H7779]]  hundreds of men, women, boys, and girls are dying every day in our  Nation due to gun violence.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost  40,000 Americans have died as a result of gun-related injuries in the  year 2017, which is the most recent year for which complete data is  available.                                time  1015    Almost 40,000 Americans have died as a result of gun-related injuries  in the year 2017. In the city I love, the city I live in, the city of  Chicago, over 279 citizens of our Nation have been murdered within the  last year due to gunfire.   Mr. Speaker, these statistics should be a clarion call to action by  this Congress, by this Nation, by this administration. That is why, Mr.  Speaker, the committee that I am proud to serve on, the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, and the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health  will finally meet in my district on October 3 to convene a hearing to  examine gun violence as a national public health issue. This is a  hearing that I have been consistently calling for ever since 2017.   This hearing will convene community members, national experts,  victims, academia, and law enforcement. All these individuals will  gather in my district in the city of Chicago for one purpose and one  purpose only: to discuss how we can better protect our Nation, our  people, our boys and girls, our schoolchildren, our church-going  citizens, our mosque-going citizens, our citizens who worship in  synagogs all across this Nation, our movie theater-going citizens, our  citizens who are in malls across this Nation enjoying themselves and  shopping.   We need to have protection for all of our citizens driving along the  highways. All of our citizens need to be protected, and this hearing  will have the purpose of discussing how we can better protect our  citizens and our communities from this epidemic, this widespread  epidemic of gunfire, gun violence. As with any epidemic that this  Nation faces, we will have experts come and speak to us.   Mr. Speaker, we must stop the violence. Save the children. Save the  families.                            ____________________
