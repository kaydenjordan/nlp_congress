 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to H. Res. 70 and the joint resolution for which it would  provide consideration, H.J. Res. 38, expressing disapproval of the  Stream Protection Rule submitted by the Department of the Interior,  Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.   The Stream Protection Rule is a critical update to a decades-old  regulation that provides clear and established requirements for  responsible surface coal mining while protecting vital community health  and economic opportunity across the United States.   The rule, crafted in an extensive and transparent public process,  includes reasonable reforms to avoid and minimize impacts on surface  water, groundwater, fish, wildlife, and other natural resources.  Grounded in sound, peer-reviewed scientific evidence and modern  technological advancements, the rule modernizes 33-year old regulations  to keep pace with modern mining techniques and incorporates in its  guidance a broader scientific understanding of the deleterious effects  caused by unmitigated surface coal mining activity.   During the development of this critical rule, the Department of  Interior received over 150,000 public comments, hosted 15 open houses  and public meetings, and engaged in broad outreach to stake holders  nationwide. This rule was carefully developed and thoroughly considered  with all stakeholders provided a seat at the table.   Ultimately, H.J. Res. 38 would undermine the Stream Protection Rule  and begin the process to undue monumental steps in the right direction  to protect the health, well-being, and economic prosperity of countless  Americans living near coal mining sites. I strongly urge my colleagues  to reject H. Res. 70, providing for the consideration of the harmful  H.J. Res. 38. Any effort to undermine this important health, economic,  and environmental protection results in a lose-lose situation for the  American public and I oppose it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 70 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled       ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States'' (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or       effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the       Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 724.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
