 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. COVID-19 has been the  worst pandemic we have had in this world in 100 years. It is a medical  issue to be addressed by doctors and not a political issue.   Today, my colleagues are asking us to support a bill to terminate the  COVID public health emergency, yet the Biden administration's current  extension of the public health emergency is a rational one. It is  rational in the way we exit from this emergency declaration: We let our  healthcare system adjust from this tremendous terrible pandemic that  continues to evolve in our society. I would say a politically driven  end to COVID-19 is not the way to run our healthcare system.   Furthermore, while my colleagues are saying there is no need for a  public health emergency, they want to keep title 42 at the border  because of its public health emergency implications.    My colleagues, I say to you, if you truly believe the pandemic is  over, then you can't say that title 42 is still needed at the border  because of a healthcare crisis.
