 Mr. Speaker, last year, California set a record for the  most acres burned in a single year, 4.1 million acres.   Already in 2021, devastating fires have burned through 1.6 million  acres of our State. Hundreds, if not thousands, of residents are  currently under evacuation orders, uncertain if they will have a home  to return to once the orders are lifted.   With another heat wave on its way, fighting the flames will be even  more challenging, and the risks are even greater.   Each year, California wildfires destroy our communities and put first  responders and our firefighters in danger. As these men and women  sacrifice their safety, it is imperative we provide firefighters with  the latest and  [[Page H5103]]  most advanced firefighting technologies.   Containerized aerial firefighting systems provide ground crews with  dependable cover from the air by providing a rapid surge of retardant  to attack these fires from multiple points of contact.   These fires can spread and expand at alarming rates, making rapid and  aggressive containment strategies absolutely critical.   We must provide firefighters with the tools and resources to do their  courageous work effectively and safely.   Billions of dollars are spent each year on recovering and restoring  the environment and helping to rebuild communities after wildfires.   By investing in technology to increase our capacity to fight fires,  we can reduce the recovery spending and preserve California's renowned  parkland and countless families' homes and irreplaceable belongings.   As California faces several devastating wildfires burning through our  communities and beloved forestland, I ask my colleagues and the U.S.  Forest Service to consider investment in containerized aerial  firefighting systems and other technologies and resources.   We have a responsibility to protect our communities, our environment,  and the firefighters who run toward danger and sacrifice their safety  for the safety of others.   To do so, we must equip these brave men and women with the tools they  need.   Again, I ask the Forest Service and my colleagues to examine the  latest aerial firefighting capabilities as well as additional resources  to protect our state and communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for the last six weeks, I was working in my  district, meeting with constituents and local officials. The top issue  of concern was overwhelmingly centered around California's drought. But  this is not a concern to my community alone.   Our farmers cannot continue to grow food for the American families  without water. The consequences of this drought and for our entire  Nation cannot be understated. Even leaders outside of California are  taking notice.   House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Bruce Westerman, as  well as USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, visited the Valley in August to  witness the absolute disaster at hand. It is critical that the House  majority follow the lead of those who have seen the suffering firsthand  and act immediately by supporting legislation such as my bills, the  RENEW WIIN Act and the NEED Water Now Act.                            ____________________
