 Madam Speaker, President Trump was in my  hometown of San Diego this week. He went to inspect prototypes for his  proposed border wall, a wall California doesn't want, doesn't need, and  is an overly simplistic approach to a complex issue.  [[Page H1618]]    The President was in San Diego for just a few hours and missed a real  opportunity to hear from locals about what Americans in California  actually need. Had he taken the time to actually listen, he might have  learned how connected Mexico and the United States are and how  important the cross-border economy is to our region. He might have  learned about our infrastructure needs, about the contributions of our  immigrant communities, or the environmental issues facing our region.   Instead, he flew 3,000 miles on the taxpayers' dime for a photo-op  for his political base, that achieved very little. Something is wrong  when a President doesn't listen to the American people.                            ____________________
