 Mr. President, through the summer and fall, in the  growing town of Cedar City, UT, hundreds of people will fill the seats  of the Engelstad Shakespeare Theater, modeled after the Globe, to enjoy  a showing of Pericles, Prince of Tyre by William Shakespeare. Families  will cry and cheer, gasp and giggle as they enjoy a Utah tradition: the  annual Utah Shakespeare Festival.   Each year, for the last six decades, families from around the world  have flocked to the campus of Southern Utah University to enjoy  productions of the Bard's best works. Founded in 1961, the Utah  Shakespeare Festival is a prime example of how private initiative can  catalyze growth and unite community. Nobody embodies this story more  vividly than Fred C. Adams, the festival's founder.   As a young man, Fred made acting look easy. Not only did he develop a  passion for the world of theater, he also demonstrated a knack for  stagecraft. Over time, his talent and passion developed from a hobby  into a career.   Years before the Utah Shakespeare Festival put on its first show,  Fred served his country from the Pentagon. During the Korean war, he  was in charge of entertainment and morale. Having grown up acting, he  dedicated himself to the work of production and performance, bringing  joy and brilliance to those who served with him.   After his service during the Korean war, Fred returned to his home in  southern Utah in 1961. At that time, hundreds of thousands of tourists  visited each summer to see the area's national parks by day, but by  night, there was little to do. It was around that same time that a new  freeway exit was planned along I-15, Utah's primary interstate highway,  right in the heart of Cedar City. Excited by the prospect of growth,  Fred saw an opportunity.   One day, while he and his girlfriend Barbara, who later became his  wife, were in the Fluffy Bundle Laundromat, daydreaming while waiting  for their laundry to dry, the two thought up an idea. Both Fred and  Barbara were passionate about theater, and Fred even taught theater  classes at the local College of Southern Utah. ``Why not start a  Shakespearean festival in Cedar City?'' they thought. With a bit of  funding and the help of friends, the idea seemed like it could become a  reality. Eager to learn more about how such a festival might come to  be, Fred left the laundromat, packed up his bags, and headed to  Ashland, OR, where the Oregon Shakespeare Festival takes place each  year.   When Fred got to Oregon, he was befriended by Angus Bowmer, the  founder of the Oregon Shakespearean Festival. After a few days of  observation there, Fred returned to Cedar City and then set out with  Barbara, Barbara's mother Louise, and two theater students to visit  theaters in Canada and Connecticut. On the road, the Utah Shakespeare  Festival was born.   Fred eagerly approached the Cedar City Council and the Chamber of  Commerce to tell them about his plan to attract people to Cedar City.  Their reaction was dismal. Fred once recounted: ``the idea went over  like a pregnant pole vaulter . . . they thought it was a dumb idea,  really dumb.'' Despite the lack of enthusiasm, however, the local Lions  Club agreed to underwrite his plan with $1,000 after he told them the  festival expected to recover all of the money in ticket sales. Hopeful  and excited about the first season of the Utah Shakespeare Festival,  Fred set out to show just how significant the economic impact of the  festival could be on Cedar City.   To demonstrate the reach of the festival, Fred went out and got  hundreds of silver dollars upon which he painted a red line. The stage  was set. Each time someone paid for a ticket at the festival and needed  change, the ticket counter would give them a painted silver dollar.  Little by little, the dollars began to enter circulation and people in  the city wondered where the painted coins were from. Just 3 weeks after  Fred began painting coins, he attended a chamber of commerce meeting in  Cedar City. In the meeting, he was asked if he knew anything about the  silver dollars with a red line on them. He laughed and responded,  ``that is the economic impact of the Shakespeare Festival in Cedar  City!''   That first season of the festival saw productions of ``The Taming of  the Shrew,'' ``Hamlet,'' and ``The Merchant of Venice,'' performed by a  small company of Fred's students, friends, and neighbors. Over 3,000  people attended the shows during the 2-week-long season. After paying  off their debts, the festival had also raised an impressive $2,000 to  help put on a second season the following year.   Since that first year, the Utah Shakespeare Festival has grown to  serve more than 110,000 patrons, who view nearly 300 plays each year in  three theaters over a 16-week season. The festival has become a year- round operation with over 30 full-time employees and a budget of over  $7 million. Fred's work catalyzed tremendous growth.   The festival has received many national awards, including the 2011  Emmy Award for its production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the  2001 National Governors Association Award for Distinguished Service in  the Arts, and most notably the Tony Award for Outstanding Regional  Theatre in 2000. Fred's work united the community to accomplish  something truly remarkable.   After 44 years as executive producer, Fred retired from an active  role with the festival but, despite his retirement, could never fully  step away. Not a day went by that he wasn't seen at the festival either  directing shows, acting onstage, raising funds, or pulling weeds in the  Shakespeare statue garden. Fred loved his work and those he worked with  dearly, cherishing them all his life.   In February of last year, after a 22-year battle with cancer, Fred  was reunited with his late wife Barbara. Together, he and Barbara had  dreamed up the Utah Shakespeare Festival and made their dream a  reality. Surely, he and Barbara are now working hard to put on heavenly  productions with the help of angels.   Fred's life story is a testament to how personal initiative can  catalyze  [[Page S5929]]  growth and unite community. He tirelessly worked to see his dream of a  Utah Shakespeare Festival realized and tirelessly loved his family, his  friends, and his community along the way. And as a result, Cedar City  has grown, the festival has drawn international praise, and we all  benefit from the example he has left behind.   So when times are tough, when work seems monotonous, and when dreams  seem far-fetched or far-gone, remember Fred. His story can inspire us  all.                            ____________________
