 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Concord, NC, Police Officer Jason Shuping, who was tragically killed  in the line of duty this week.   Officer Shuping was only 25 years old and had served the Concord  Police Department for 1\1/2\ years with honor and distinction.   Officer Shuping and Officer Kaleb Robinson were responding to a 9-1-1  call for a car crash and an attempted carjacking. Officers Shuping and  Robinson located the suspect and were prepared to bring him to justice.  However, when Officer Shuping, Officer Robinson, and a third ALE  officer approached, the suspect immediately began opening fire.   Officers Shuping and Robinson were both shot. Additional officers  arrived on the scene and took out the suspect.   While Officer Robinson is, fortunately, expected to make a recovery,  Officer Shuping, tragically, passed away from his injuries.   Jason Shuping was an outstanding police officer who courageously ran  to danger to protect residents of Concord.   He was also a loving son and a husband to his wife Haylee. He was  active in his community since his childhood. He attended East Rowan  High School in Salisbury, and he was an honor student and track and  field athlete at UNC-Pembroke.   He was a young man with a bright future ahead of him, described by  those who knew him as a ``gentle soul who made an impact.''   His hometown paper, the Salisbury Post, noted: ``Whether it was  staying after practice to provide coaching to a youngster or coming  back home from college to play the handbell in his church's ensemble,  you could always count on Jason Shuping.''   It is no surprise to see the outpouring of love coming from the  community of Concord to honor his life and service. There have been a  candlelight vigil and a touching law enforcement escort that brought  many residents and a long line of American flags proudly displayed.   As we gather with our families this Christmas, my thoughts and  prayers will be with the family of Officer Shuping, as well as the  families of Mount Holly Police Officer Tyler Herndon and Nash County  Deputy Sheriff Jared Allison, who also lost their lives this month in  the line of duty.   Those families are going through an unimaginable period of grief, but  they should know that the people of North Carolina are forever grateful  for the selfless service of their loved ones, and I will never forget  the ultimate sacrifice that they made in answering the call to protect  others.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Burr for his leadership  and leaning into this for many years before I even joined the Senate.   I thank Senator Dole for filing this bill that actually even had  Senator McConnell's cosponsorship many, many years ago.   I thank the Lumbee people for their patience, but, quite honestly,  when you are talking about the ninth largest Tribe east of the  Mississippi River--I am sorry--the ninth largest in the Nation and the  largest Tribe east of the Mississippi River, a Tribe that has been  seeking recognition since 1888--they were recognized as Indian by the  State of North Carolina in 1885. In 1956, they were partially  recognized.   We heard a unanimous vote coming out of the House. They were prepared  to provide recognition. In November, we heard President Trump and Vice  President Biden both say they support recognition. So we are so close.   There is a compelling case. It is a century in the making. And the  fact that we couldn't get this through today when it passed unanimously  out of the House just a month ago I think is a shame.   I appreciate Senator Burr for his patience and his tenacity. We are  not going to let this go. Hopefully, it gets done tonight, but we have  to recognize that the Lumbee people deserve recognition, they deserve  respect. They have been fighting for it for a century, and I am going  to fight for it as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I want to say a word about the need  to revise title 18 so that criminal commercial enterprises that stream  pirated content to users are subject to the same felony penalties as  criminal commercial enterprises that distribute to users or reproduce  pirated content. The provisions of the Protecting Lawful Streaming Act  target clearly criminal conduct committed with criminal intent. Lawful  internet and streaming services, licensees, other mainstream  businesses, and users engaged in ordinary activities do not risk  prosecution. Most importantly, businesses engaged in those activities  are clearly excluded by the requirements that a defendant be engaged in  conduct that is primarily designed, intentionally marketed, or has no  commercially significant purpose or use other than for use in illegal  streaming. Nor do those engaged in noncommercial activities risk  prosecution under this statute. Noncommercial activities are explicitly  excluded by the terms of section 2319C(a). It is intended that none of  these activities shall be subject to any risk of criminal prosecution  under this bill.   More generally, it is well established that criminal penalties are  the exception rather than the rule in cases of copyright infringement.  As the Department of Justice itself has noted, criminal sanctions are  appropriate only with respect to certain types of infringement-- generally when infringer knows the infringement is wrong, and when the  infringement is particularly serious or the type of case renders civil  enforcement by copyright owners especially difficult. As such, criminal  prosecution has been and is appropriately reserved for serious forms of  large-scale, commercial infringement, not as a means of targeting  ordinary business disputes between legitimate companies or those which  are otherwise adequately addressed through civil litigation. The new  section 2319C, in particular, requires willfulness, which means that  the statute does not apply in the absence of an intentional violation  of a known legal duty.   Consistent with this, a provider of broadband internet access service  would not be subject to prosecution under this statute, for example,  based merely on the attributes or features of its service, nor could  prosecution be predicated on the misuse of its service by its customers  or others in furtherance of an infringement scheme, where the service  provider does not itself share the requisite criminal intent of the  underlying substantive offense and act with specific intent to further  it. In this regard, offering high-speed connections that allow its  customers to access the internet, failing to block or disable access to  particular online locations, or failing to take measures to restrict  the use of or deny its customers access to such service would not be  sufficient to demonstrate the requisite criminal intent under the bill.  This conduct would also not otherwise meet the prerequisites under the  aiding and abetting statute, regardless of whether the broadband  internet access service provider might be civilly liable in such  circumstances under the differing standards for contributory or  vicarious liability.   A person who willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or  private financial gain offers or provides to the public a digital  transmission service violates the statute under section 2319C(a)(3)  when that person intentionally promotes or directs the promotion of its  use in publicly performing works protected under title 17 without the  authority of the copyright owner or the law. The language of section  2319C makes clear that it is the offering of an illicit digital  transmission service, as defined by section 2319C(a)(1)-(3), that is an  offense, not the marketing activities done by or at the direction of a  person offering an illicit digital transmission service, as referred to  in section 2319C(a)(3). Thus, an entity that provides only commercial  online marketing services and does not itself also provide an illicit  digital transmission service would not be subject to prosecution under  section 2319C(a). Further, it is not the intent of this legislation to  create potential aiding and abetting liability for mainstream third  party ad networks or marketers. An online marketing services provider  could be liable for aiding and abetting an unrelated entity providing  unlawful streaming services only where the online marketing services  provider shared the same requisite criminal intent of each element of  the underlying substantive offense and acted with specific intent to  further it. Thus, an online marketing services provider which places an  advertisement for an entity that is violating section 2319C(a) would  face aiding and abetting liability only if the online marketing  services provider was itself associated with the criminal venture of  the illicit digital transmission service to such an extent that it  shares the criminal intent of the person offering the service and acted  with the requisite specific intent to commit or facilitate the  underlying offense.   Similarly, a service that streams content uploaded by users would not  be subject to prosecution merely because some users might upload  infringing content. The service would be subject to criminal liability  only if it had the requisite criminal intent and acted with specific  intent to further it.   The provisions of this statute also do not apply to any person acting  in good faith and with an objectively reasonable basis in law to  believe that their conduct is lawful. Thus, a bona fide commercial  dispute over the scope or existence of a contract or license governing  such conduct or a good-faith dispute regarding whether a particular  activity is authorized by the Copyright Act would not provide a basis  for prosecution. For example, neither a cloud-based DVR service nor an  application provided by a multichannel video programming distributor,  MVPD, to enable such MVPD's customers to access its video service  utilizing a mobile device, which were the subject of prior civil  copyright infringement challenges based on good faith disagreements  regarding the scope of rights under the Copyright Act, would be  actionable under this provision if the provider offering such services  met this standard. By contrast, a party that merely asserts an  applicable contract, an exception, or a belief that the person's  conduct was lawful, in a case where the assertion is not made in good- faith, is merely a pretense, or is otherwise not based on an  objectively reasonable interpretation of the law, would not avoid  prosecution on that basis.   The statute provides for an enhanced penalty in section 2319C(b)(2)  for someone who knowingly commits an offense in connection with 1 or  more works being prepared for commercial public performance. The  ``should have known'' standard in section 2319C(b)(2) applies only  after a finder of fact determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the  person committed an offense under subsection (a). The ``should have  known'' standard should not be conflated with the standards of  willfulness, not primarily designed, no commercially significant  purpose, and intentionality set forth in section 2319C(a), all of which  define the underlying offense and are intended to protect lawful  internet and streaming services, content licensees, and noncommercial  users.   Finally, the statute in section 2319C(d)(3) defines a work being  prepared for commercial public performance, based on the definition of  ``work being prepared for commercial distribution'' in section  506(a)(3) of the Copyright Act, while updating that definition to  account for the challenges of piracy in the modern streaming  environment. Section 2319C reflects the  [[Page S7932]]  fact that infringement threatens unique harm when it occurs prior to or  in the earliest windows of commercial availability. The definition in  2319C(d)(3) recognizes that in the modem streaming environment, not all  motion pictures are developed for theatrical distribution. The updated  definition of a ``work being prepared for commercial public  performance'' affords appropriately enhanced penalties for violations  of the statute involving pre- and just-released film and television  content, whether in a first theatrical window or immediately upon  release to the public via a streaming or other platform. The  legislation does not make corresponding changes to the definition of  ``work made for commercial distribution'' in section 506(a)(3). Whether  it is appropriate to harmonize the definitions is a question that is  beyond the scope of this particular legislation, which does not  otherwise make changes to title 17. Section 2319C(d)(1) defines  ``motion picture'' as defined in the Copyright Act, which includes  nontheatrical motion pictures, television shows, and broadcasts of live  events.                            ____________________
