 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the new coronavirus has spread from  China throughout the world, and it is challenging our Nation in new  ways. Across our country, daily routines are being disrupted, families  are grappling with school closings and changes to childcare, major  American companies and institutions are literally modifying how they do  business, and a growing number of Main Street small businesses face the  possibility of significant disruptions as more and more communities  begin to ``hunker down,'' as Dr. Fauci put it, on the advice of public  health experts and local leaders.   As an aside, I have noticed that a lot of the discussion in the media  has focused on individuals who may be temporarily transitioning from  office work to working from home. So I want to especially acknowledge  the many other hard-working Americans for whom telework is not an  option. Now, more than ever, we are reminded who really keeps this  country running: the hard-working men and women who grow things, who  make things, who drive trucks and move goods across the country, who  mine coal or otherwise produce domestic energy and, literally, power  our communities, who run the stores and shops we rely on, who serve our  communities as police and first responders, and, of course, especially  the dedicated frontline healthcare professionals, who work tirelessly  to heal and protect all the rest of us.   To all Americans--but, most especially, to those hard-working people  whose efforts are going to get our country through this challenge--I  have one message: The Senate stands with you. We stand with American  workers and families, we stand with American businesses, and we stand  with the public health experts and the heroic frontline medical  professionals whom our Nation seems poised to lean on as heavily as we  have at any point in recent memory.   The Senate is committed to meeting these uncertain times with bold  and bipartisan solutions. That is what we did a little more than a week  ago, when the Senate passed billions of dollars in emergency funding  for health and small businesses with an overwhelming bipartisan vote  and put it on the President's desk. That is what we are going to keep  doing this week, particularly if the House of Representatives can  actually complete its work and transmit a finished product of its  relief over to us. And it is what we are going to keep doing in the  days and weeks ahead.   With respect to the House-passed legislation, I understand the House  chose to proceed with their planned 1-week recess, despite not having  finished processing their bill. As of this afternoon, we are still  waiting for the House to reach a decision on possible technical  corrections and to submit a final  [[Page S1748]]  product to us here in the Senate. We cannot consider the legislation  until we get it, but I know that Senators on both sides have spent the  last several days carefully studying the House proposal, and I know  that all of us are eager to act quickly to support American workers,  families, and small businesses.   Even more broadly, Senate Republicans are absolutely convinced that  the House's bill can only be the beginning--just the beginning--of  Congress's efforts to secure our economy and support American families.  This is a unique challenge--a unique challenge. Unlike in any other  tough circumstances, our short-term goal is not simply to bring  economic activity right back to normal starting tomorrow. Instead, our  task is to secure the historically strong foundation of our Nation's  economy and support Americans during this period when public health may  require that some normal activities simply be scaled back.   I have spoken with countless colleagues and committee chairmen over  the last several days. We agree there are three major areas where the  Senate must continue to develop bold and bipartisan action:   No. 1, we will need to take further steps to assist individual  Americans and families with financial challenges in the weeks and  months ahead.   No. 2, we will need to further significant actions to secure our  Nation's economy--particularly Main Street small businesses--and  safeguard our historically strong economic foundation through this  period.   No. 3, we will need further steps to ready our healthcare system and  support our Nation's medical professionals.   The Senate majority is already working toward next steps on all three  of those fronts. I hope further bold action can be just as bipartisan  and collaborative as the process by which we passed the first set of  additional funds. We must work with each other in the bipartisan spirit  this moment demands--and with the administration and the House--to  deliver results for our country.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one other important matter,  late last night, several critical authorities that law enforcement uses  to keep Americans safe lapsed into expiration. Barring Senate action,  these important tools, which help protect the homeland from terrorists  and counter foreign intelligence activities on U.S. soil, will remain  offline.   Fortunately, in the weeks leading up to this deadline, the Attorney  General engaged in extensive bipartisan talks with Members of the  House--of both parties--to try to reach a solution. The resulting  legislation, which the House passed last week by large margins within  each party, strikes a key balance. It reauthorizes the tools which our  national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms  which basic accountability demands.   We can't let the relative success of these tools at preserving the  safety and security of our country mislead us to believe they are  unnecessary. It is just the opposite. Terrorist organizations still  search constantly for opportunities to strike on American soil. Hostile  foreign intelligence services--whether Chinese, Russian, or Iranian-- still seek to conduct operations within our borders, to recruit assets  and agents among our population.   These threats will not wait around if the United States delays  restocking our toolbox, so the Senate should not wait to act. I  sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against  the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities  and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 6172 be  withdrawn.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3501, submitted earlier  today.    I ask that the bill be considered read a third time  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  H.R. 6172. I further ask that there be 10 hours of debate, equally  divided between the proponents and the opponents of the bill, with an  hour of debate under the control of the sponsors of each amendment, or  their designees, and with Senators Leahy and Wyden controlling 1 hour  each. I further ask that the only amendments in order be three  amendments to be proposed by the following Senators or their designees:  Lee, on amicus reforms and exculpatory evidence; Paul, on rights of  Americans; Daines, on section 215 web browser/search history data  collection prohibition; and three side-by-sides to be proposed by  Senator McConnell, or his designee, on the same topics, with all  amendments and the bill subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold for  passage; finally, that upon the use or yielding back of that time and  upon disposition of the amendments in the order listed, the bill, as  amended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate vote on  passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
