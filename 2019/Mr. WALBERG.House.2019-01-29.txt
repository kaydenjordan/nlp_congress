 Mr. Speaker, over the past month, we saw President Trump  put forward one offer after another to secure our southern border. They  were reasonable offers that sought common ground, but every step of the  way, Speaker Pelosi was unwilling to participate in any type of good- faith negotiations.   Now the President has given the Democrats yet another opportunity.  The government is fully reopened and workers are receiving their  paychecks. We can all agree that that is a good thing, but we still  need a long-term solution to address the humanitarian crisis at our  southern border. We need more technology, more border agents, and more  physical barriers.   Now is the time for Speaker Pelosi to stop stonewalling. Let's get  serious about negotiating a deal. Let's make sure our southern border  is secure, and let's make sure our citizens are safe. That is what the  American people want us to do, and it is time to get it done.                            ____________________
