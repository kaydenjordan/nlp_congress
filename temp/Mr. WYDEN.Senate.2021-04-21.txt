 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of Oregonians in  every nook and cranny of our wonderful State, to thank my friend Chris  Maier for more than three decades of stellar public service.   Chris is retiring this month as a superhero who has been cutting  through redtape and defeating bureaucracy for so many Oregonians who  turned to her nights and weekends and all hours. She helped with  emergency immigration and State Department needs, passports, visas,  immigration questions, and so much more.   As a casework manager and constituent services representative in my  office for more than a decade, Chris brought an unfailing  professionalism, determined follow-through, and ``Oregon Way'' focus on  smart solutions when tackling all of those duties.   Chris came to our Portland office in 2009, after a decade of working  for my friend Senator Gordon Smith. Before that, she had worked a total  of 11 years in the offices of Senator Mark Hatfield, Congressman Denny  Smith, and State Representative Chuck Carpenter. If those names that I  just mentioned were an answer on jeopardy, the question would be: Who  are four prominent elected Republicans in Oregon history?   The Senate heard that one right. Chris is retiring after a career of  working for elected officials from both political parties. On one  level, she worked for all of us as elected officials, but on a larger  level, she worked for everybody in Oregon, regardless of their  politics. And on that larger level, Chris epitomizes so many other  public servants in Oregon and our country whose names just never get  celebrated in headlines or tweets or news coverage.   The word ``bipartisan'' gets tossed around a lot, but Chris lived  that ethos every single day of her public service career. When she was  responding to the uncounted number of calls and email inquiries she got  over the years, she never said: So tell me a little bit about your  politics. Her response was always: How can I help? And she always  applied her common sense and the deep reservoir of good will she earned  nationwide to move the levers of government quickly and successfully.  And as I alluded to at the outset, those queries and her responses  never corresponded to an 8-to-5 schedule because she was always on the  phone to a U.S. Embassy somewhere thousands of miles away.   Chris's duties went into overdrive in the first few weeks this past  year during COVID. Oregon parents called Chris frantic to get their  kids home from overseas study programs. Oregon families and friends  would email Chris desperate for information about family members abroad  on travel that they had saved a lifetime for. And we had businesses  from all over Oregon text Chris about their U.S. employees who were  working in other countries.   On the other end of all of those calls, emails, and texts was Chris  Maier, always responding with her experience and empathy to figure out  solutions. I can't even begin to calculate the number of times  Oregonians would come up to me in our iconic ``Fred Meyer'' stories,  and they would say: Ron, let me tell you about how Chris Maier went to  bat for me and my family.   So today we are very grateful for her ``Chris Maier'' brand of  tenacity with a smile, because she was steering so many Oregonians  through the unprecedented trials of the past year.   I have been thinking about all the challenges she has been helping  Oregonians with over her entire career, and she was helping all those  people when she was in our office every single day, bringing relentless  good cheer, an overflowing candy bowl, and a love bordering on  obsession for University of Oregon football. We Ducks take our football  seriously, but certainly nobody more than Chris Maier.   I am going to close with a final thought as I send Chris off to a  very well-earned retirement with her husband Brad and their daughter  Katherine, back home on the east side of my hometown, Portland. As  Chris's fellow Oregon football fans know, the pregame pageantry at home  games in Eugene always included the tradition of one joyful shout in  unison: ``It never rains in Autzen Stadium.''   If I may paraphrase that thought today in talking about my friend.  Her optimistic outlook and legacy of success means that all of us are  joyful because ``It never rains in Chris Maier's world.''   So, Chris, on behalf of Oregonians and communities small and large,  we are so grateful for all the time you went to bat for the people of  our State and for the people of this country. For that we say thank  you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 11 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
