 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  House to discuss why we need to focus on our country first. We are  seeing rapidly rising inflation. It is completely out of control.   While here in Congress and in the Washington bubble, which is  disconnected with the rest of America, all we are hearing is potential  war with Russia over the country of Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO  member ally, and President Biden had told them that we would be only  standing with our NATO member allies.   All we are hearing on the news is Ukraine. Yet, here in America, what  real Americans care about are gas prices they can't afford, inflation  that goes up and up to where grocery bills are unaffordable, and they  are very concerned about our out-of-control, open border.   Crime is out of control, yet Washington is completely disconnected  and seems to care more about sending our sons and daughters to a  potential war where they do not belong.   I urge my colleagues here in Congress, instead of working on a future  COVID bill, spending billions of dollars on COVID that doesn't exist,  let's care about our border and let's care about working to have energy  independence to lower gas prices for Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about  America in crisis, and it is crisis after crisis.   The American people can hardly get their feet underneath them. You  see, after riots, the next thing that came was COVID, and then  elections, and now more COVID mandates, masks, more COVID, and now,  potentially, the thoughts of war.   But there is a lot more happening on top of that. We are in a real  crisis in America, especially with American energy. You see, right now,  the number one call I receive in my office from my constituents--and it  is mainly the only thing they are calling about--is the price of gas.   The price of gas, the average right now, is $4.32. People calling my  office are saying they can hardly afford to fill up their tank. They  are not sure if they are going to be able to fill up their tank to take  their kids to school, to be able to go to the grocery store and afford  the high cost of food now. They are just not sure where this is going.   They also call and say they don't understand why the Biden  administration, why Congress, why our Federal Government isn't doing  anything to help Americans be able to pay for gas at the pump.   You see, it wasn't too long ago that we were energy independent in  America. There was a different mindset in charge. There was a mindset  of putting our country first, our tax dollars first, putting Americans  first, and considering ramping up energy in America and growing energy  in America instead of declining and killing energy in America.   But now, that seems to be the way of our government. It is hurting  Americans, and people cannot afford it. This should not be a political  issue. This is an issue for every single person that drives a car and  truck.   Now, it seems to be the goal is to make every single American drive  an electric vehicle. If that is the goal, there is a big problem here.  It is not up to the government, the United States Government, to force  people to buy an electric vehicle. It should be up to the United States  Government to do things like take care of our national security, secure  our border, help oil companies produce more oil to increase energy  independence, increase natural gas production, continue to build more  nuclear, to grow energy in America. But that doesn't seem to be the  way.   No, we are looking at the third straight week in a row of over $100 a  barrel of oil. Currently, it is at $112.12. This is a disaster.   In March 2020, President Trump directed the Department of Energy to  purchase 30 million barrels to begin filling our strategic reserves.  But President Biden announced in his State of the Union that he would  once again tap the strategic reserves and release 30 million barrels of  oil in a desperate attempt to reduce gas prices here at home.   Now, Biden is considering releasing even more. This follows an SPR  release of 50 million barrels of oil in November 2021, which did  nothing to prevent the spike in gas prices. And, no, it is not what is  happening in Ukraine. This was happening before Ukraine.   The SPR is supposed to be used for national security emergencies and  major weather events. These are our emergency oil supplies. But that  doesn't seem to be the case here. It seems to be the continuing plan to  reduce America into being dependent on foreign countries.   You see, the biggest problem started on day one when the Keystone XL  pipeline was completely stopped. That would have supplied 830,000  barrels of oil from Canada to U.S. refineries. That would have helped  Americans once that was finished. But, no, that was an executive order  by President Biden to suspend it, to suspend all oil and gas leasing on  Federal lands and waters. That was a continued America last energy  plan.   While a Federal judge ruled the leasing bans to be illegal, the Biden  administration has issued zero new leases on Federal lands. That is not  helping Americans.   Another issue that happened in May 2021, President Biden removed  sanctions against Nord Stream 2, which were previously put in place by  former President Trump. In February 2022, President Biden reversed  course and reimposed the Trump sanctions, noting the overwhelming  incentive to move away from Russian gas.   President Biden's far-left socialist agenda, Build Back Better, was  an effort to cripple domestic energy by increasing oil and gas  production payments to 20 percent, increasing bonding and surety  requirements to more than 15 times their current levels, imposing a new  severance tax, and establishing new annual fees of $10,000 per mile for  offshore pipelines.   President Biden's fiscal year 2022 budget request explicitly opposed  funding the construction or maintenance of projects that would lower  the cost of gas, diesel, or energy derived from fossil fuels.   Biden's Department of Energy has slow-walked liquefied natural gas  exports that could reduce Europe's dependence on Russia.   These are all the things that have led to the increase of the price  of gas at the pump that is hurting my constituents in my district in  northwest Georgia. This is hurting Americans. None of these things have  helped us.   Now, here is what we have to consider. We also have bigger problems.  The Consumer Price Index, which is a key inflation index, hit a 40-year  high in February. The CPI increased to 7.9 percent over the past 12  months, and this is inflation that happened before Russia invaded  Ukraine. You can't blame Putin for that one. This is all happening  right here at home.   Let's talk about inflation and how it is hurting Americans. Here is  one thing that everyone can understand. Used cars and trucks are up  41.2 percent; 41.2 percent is unbelievable.   If you have been on vacation lately, you know that if you try to rent  a car or truck, they are very hard to find.   Gasoline is up 38 percent.   Lodging away from home, going to a hotel while you are trying to go  on vacation, or, say, people that are traveling for business, that is  up 25.1 percent.   Now, if you are cooking at home and trying to save money making a  meal  [[Page H3823]]  for your family, bacon is up 18.8 percent. Peanut butter, for those  great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that moms and dads make for  kids' lunches, is up 15.6 percent. Pork is up 14 percent.   Clothing is up. Dresses are up 13.5 percent.   Airline fees are up 12.7 percent.   The cost of a new vehicle is up 12.4 percent. If you are in the  market for a truck, well, guess what? You will have a hard time getting  one, or an SUV, because many of them are sitting on the lots, still  waiting for microchips.   Eggs are up 11.4 percent. Coffee is up 10.5 percent. Baby food is up  8.4 percent.   Transportation services are up 6.6 percent.   Beer is up. You know there is a problem when the cost of beer is up  5.3 percent.   Now, 2021 went down as the worst year for inflation since 1981, but  it looks to be 2022 is going to be worse. The problem for Americans is,  it is not that anyone is increasing their wages. They are actually  being hurt by all of these economic forces that are hitting American  families hard.   Don't forget, the same people that were big Democrat voters, which  are those people suffering with big student loans, these are people  that are working their jobs, trying to pay their student loans, trying  to afford their car payments. They can't afford gas at the pump, and no  one seems to be helping them.   Inflation is a tax on everyone, and no one is exempt. That is what  people are complaining about here in America, not what the people that  run around Washington think. It is a lot different when you talk to  people on the ground.   Now, another thing people are very upset about is what is happening  at our border. We have a true border crisis, and it is time to start  caring about it.   Listen, it is an insult to all border communities because President  Biden visited Texas but continued to refuse to visit the southern  border or other surrounding communities that his failed open border  policies have endangered.   The real issue is, while President Biden is more interested in  working with Iran, Russia, and China to go reenter an Iran nuclear  deal, he doesn't seem to care about what is happening at the border.   According to Customs and Border Patrol data, there were 153,941  migrant encounters at our southern border in January. That is a 96  percent increase from the previous year. This was the second-worst  January on record. Of the 153,941 illegal immigrants encountered at the  border, the Biden administration released 62,573 of them into the  United States.   This new data comes at a time when ICE deportations are down 70  percent from 2020, the fewest number of deportations in 5 years. This  equates to an average of just 100 deportations a day, even as Border  Patrol agents encountered up to 7,000 illegal immigrants daily.   But only 100 get deported? Why? You have to ask why.   Since Biden took office, over 2 million illegal immigrants have been  apprehended at our southern border. Biden has still not visited the  border even during this historic crisis. It doesn't seem that President  Biden even cares.   Border officials have estimated that nearly 400,000 illegal  immigrants have escaped into the United States without being caught  under President Biden. But we don't even know if that is the right  number. That is just an estimate.   Out of 104,171 migrants issued notices to report by ICE between the  end of March and the end of August 2021, 47,705 failed to report. They  just don't bother showing up.                                time  1830    There were 10,763 arrests of migrants with criminal convictions in  fiscal year 2021; that is up 2,438 from fiscal year 2020, and that is  up 4,269 in fiscal year 2019.   But here is the real issue. Fentanyl is flowing across our borders.  Seizures of fentanyl increased by 134 percent in fiscal year 2021 under  President Biden's watch.   Now, fentanyl is the number one reported reason of cause of death for  young people ages 18 to 45. What are we doing in our country when this  deadly drug is flowing across our wide-open border that our President  doesn't even seem to care about, that no one is interested in closing  the border or securing the border?   How are we failing Americans and failing young people, where fentanyl  that comes over from China is so easily flowing across the border? This  is a disaster. It is a complete disaster.   Now, what I find absolutely mind-boggling is how here in Congress we  passed a $1.5 trillion omnibus bill last week that was 2,741 pages, and  we didn't even have 24 hours to read it. That is a complete failure to  the American people and the American tax dollars who are the ones  paying the $1.5 trillion for the omnibus bill.   There is not a company or a small business in the private sector that  operates this way. But our Federal Government is reckless and out of  control, and the American people are feeling the consequences. You just  have to ask the question: Why? Why does Congress work this way? It is  just not working. It is not working for the American people.   Now, this week we were addressed by President Zelenskyy and the  crisis that the Ukrainian people are going through. It was heart- breaking to hear the stories he told, the video that he showed, the  tragedies that we are hearing about over and over, but we also aren't  given enough information.   Last week, Congress approved $13.6 billion to go to Ukraine. Now,  this is after years and years of sending billions of dollars in aid to  Ukraine and funding all kinds of things in Ukraine. Who does Congress  work for? I think that is the greatest question. What is the purpose of  this institution where we take American taxpayers' dollars and send it  to countries all over the world? We send money to all kinds of foreign  countries and fund all kinds of things.   Now, one of the most fascinating stories that went on and on across  the internet and news companies--you heard it on TV and saw it on  social media everywhere--was this big discussion about biolabs. Now, I  thought it was pretty fascinating, a lot of people were interested in  it, but we were all told no, no, no, you can't talk about biolabs  because that is fake news, that the United States doesn't fund biolabs  in Ukraine--the United States wouldn't do that.   Well, come to find out, in fact, it is true. The same news companies  and the same sources are telling us that it is not true that the United  States funds biolabs--you could also look up their older news stories  from years ago where, in fact, they were talking about the United  States funding biolabs. So the misinformation going on is real and the  American people deserve to know what they are paying for.   This comes on the heels of after 2 years--and this is just so  tragic--that not only the United States but the entire world has been  dealing with COVID-19. Now, it has been a true tragedy what has  happened with COVID. Over 968,000 Americans have died--that is  according to The New York Times today--over 6 million people have died  worldwide. That is according to The New York Times today.   For the last 2 years, Americans have dealt with the consequences of  U.S. funding these labs and funding the gain of function research. Now,  it is something that we really have to recognize and we have to talk  about, but our government did fund the gain of function research. We  know that to be true through EcoHealth Alliance.   The gain of function research is what allowed the virus that is  transmitted between bats to be turned into a virus--like a Dr.  Frankenstein virus--that can be transmitted between humans. We have to  ask the question: Why would the United States Government engage in  funding something as horrific as that? How is that science? It is a  good thing to ask these questions.   Now, here is what else is interesting. Just today Dr. Fauci, who  happened to be the one to help fund the gain of function research,  decided to come out and say that mask mandates should be brought back.  This is at a time where we are finally getting rid of mask mandates. He  is also recommending a fourth COVID vaccine shot.   Now, I don't know about you guys but many of us were vaccinated as  kids against polio, we had our MMR, and I have never seen the CDC  coming out,  [[Page H3824]]  saying, oh, you got to get your second polio shot, you got to get your  third, you got to get your fourth, and this may continue to keep going.   I think the question we all should ask is: When does it stop and when  are enough vaccines enough? We don't have that question because now  Congress is discussing and debating a future COVID bill, an emergency  bill. This is a future COVID bill to fund future variants and future  vaccines. And not only future vaccines for the United States, but  future vaccines for the entire world because somehow the United States  is responsible for vaccinating the world against future COVID variants  that we haven't even seen yet.   And somehow Congress thinks that we should do emergency funding,  possibly up to $22 billion to study and prepare for future COVID  variants and future COVID vaccines, and as many things as we need to  do, but yet we aren't seeing them. How is that necessary to have  emergency funding at $22 billion to fund something that we don't know  is going to happen and shouldn't happen and would never have happened  without the U.S.-funded gain of function research to the Wuhan lab? I  think these are questions worth asking.   Now, another thing I would like to point out is President Trump had  asked Congress for $22 billion to build a wall down at the southern  border. Imagine if Congress had found it important or recognized the  important need to go ahead and fund $22 billion back in 2017 or 2018,  that wall would have been built.    I can tell you right now, I don't think we would be seeing and  hearing about the numbers of illegal immigrants coming across our  border and deadly fentanyl coming across like this. Imagine if Congress  had taken seriously border security under President Trump and funded  that $22 billion then that now Congress is considering funding for  future COVID that we don't even have yet. These are good questions to  ask.   These are the kind of questions that the regular American people ask,  not the ones that live here in the Washington D.C. bubble; they are  very disconnected here with real America.   Now, this is the thing that I just find so amazing. As we consider  funding future COVID and future COVID vaccines, we have people at home  that are sick and tired of their children being masked in school. They  do not want to be forced to take a vaccine that they feel they should  have the ability to decide about their own health, if they want to take  it or not.   We are still trying to get back on track with not having to wear  masks on airplanes, not having to send our kids to school to be masked,  and not have to be shut down anymore. We have not recovered yet from  the COVID crisis of the past 2 years. But, no, we have to consider more  future COVID variants and future vaccines, and vaccinating the world  against future COVID everything.   It never seems to stop, it is crisis after crisis. Unfortunately, a  U.S.-funded gain of function research in a U.S.-funded lab in China  gave birth to COVID-19 that has hurt the entire world.   Here is what we need to discuss. We need to ask the question: What is  happening in these U.S.-funded labs? And we need to be willing to talk  about it. We also need to ask the questions about the VAERS statistics.  What if there are vaccine injuries? What if there are vaccine deaths?   It is okay to ask these questions because these may have affected  people's lives, and that is important to do, right? But when we are  talking about biolabs, we do know for a fact that the U.S. has funded  the contracts not only to take over the labs, reconstruct them, but  also build them. This goes through grants through private companies at  millions and millions of dollars.   Now, what if these biolabs are handling very dangerous pathogens that  may lead to the deaths in people in the areas. There are reports of  possibly deadly pathogens escaping these biolabs in places like  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, that is responsible for killing people.  What if that is true? I think these are questions that we should ask  because no American citizen wants to be held morally and ethically  responsible, and the U.S. Government should not be funding something  that is killing people in a country that is not even our own, let alone  here at home.   These are worthy questions. For that reason, because it has become  such an issue and because it upsets so many people that I talk to  constantly, I have introduced a bill to stop taxpayer funding for  bioweapons and eliminate these programs from the Federal Government  because no government should be creating bioweapons. That is evil and  wrong.   Now, the name of this bill is the Stopping the Spread of Taxpayer- Funded Bioweapons Act. What if strange outbreaks surrounding U.S.- funded biolabs are the result of these labs and the work that is taking  place in them? What if these labs are creating viruses just like COVID- 19?   This is something that all of us should be against. That is why it  would be so important to pass this bill and make sure that our United  States Government is never funding anything deadly and never funding  something like COVID-19. These are consequences that we cannot take and  we should not handle and we should not ever consider.   Now, as we go further, we have a lot of issues to consider. We have  an economy that is definitely in trouble. We have hyperinflation and  gas prices out of control. We are looking at what is going to happen in  Ukraine with Russia and what is going to happen in the world with all  these sanctions. There are some issues to consider.   Now, the value of our dollar is extremely important. The value of our  dollar affects our entire economy. If the value of our dollar were to  go down suddenly, that would affect all Americans. Right now we are in  a critical time where Saudi Arabia is discussing with China--talking to  them about possibly switching from the petrodollar to trading with  China's currency.   We have sanctioned Russia. And as Russia is looking at taking Ukraine  and they are invading Ukraine and killing people in Ukraine, Russia has  turned to China. Just recently Russia made a $117.5 billion deal with  President Xi of China. That deal is to sell oil and gas to China.   Now with sanctions tightening on Putin and Russia, will we see Russia  turn to China and switch to China's currency? What if Russia and Saudi  Arabia switch from the dollar to China's currency? Then think further,  what happens if countries like Venezuela or Cuba or any other country  turns to China's currency?   If we go into a situation where we have two world competing  currencies, the dollar is going to be hit very hard, and that is going  to hurt America's economy, that is going to hurt every single one of  us. If we think we are suffering under high inflation right now and  high gas prices, well, we haven't seen anything yet. This is a  dangerous situation and these are the things that I don't hear being  talked about here in Congress very much.   These are not the things that our leaders are considering when they  are beating the drums of war--wanting to go in and go to war with  nuclear Russia. These are not the things that are being considered for  our children and for our country's future, but these are the most  important things they should be considering. Unfortunately, they are  not.                                time  1845    Now, what we all should be doing is encouraging President Zelenskyy  and President Putin to get to the negotiating table and stop people  from being killed. That should be the most important thing we care  about.   Sanctions are being put in place, and we should be considering what  are going to be the real human costs when we are stopping countries  from trading very important products like grain, fertilizer, and energy  because it may be a punishment to those governments, but the real  punishment is to the people in other countries and our own.   So my questions for our Congress--our United States Congress--are:  Which country do we honestly serve? Which country do we honestly care  about? And which people do we care about?   Because this body right here is funded by the American people and  their hard-earned tax dollars, and the American people and their hard- earned tax dollars are the people we should consider first.   It is the United States of America we should consider first. It is  the United  [[Page H3825]]  States currency, the dollar, we should consider first, and it is the  United States economy we should consider first, our small businesses,  our big businesses, and our border that should matter.   Now, Mr. Speaker, tonight, I will finish with this: I think it is  important for the United States Congress to talk more, to slow down in  our decisions, to read our bills--every single one of us has the time  to read them--and for every single one of us to vote in person--not by  proxy--and not simply by saying ``yea'' or ``nay''.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
