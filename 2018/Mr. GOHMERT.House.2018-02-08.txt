 Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my new friend, Mr.  Leonard Lance, from New Jersey for his great help in marshaling this  bill, and I appreciate the bipartisan support. I understand there is  another element regarding location and there is some disagreement. I  see the merit. I understand some have concerns.   But what we found out, just to go back, people have talked about how  Kari Hunt was viscously attacked by her estranged husband, and her  little 9-year-old daughter calling 911. The way that was learned was-- and by the way, she was not only stabbed 21 times, she was repeatedly  struck. This is an attack that went on over several minutes.   Her brutal, mean-spirited estranged husband now says from prison:  Well, I don't think it would have mattered if a 911 call had went  through.   He was attacking her for several minutes. The police could get there  in Marshall in a couple of minutes. It would have made all the  difference.                                time  1245    But the way it was learned was that Hank had his little 9-year-old  granddaughter in his lap after Kari was pronounced dead and was trying  to console  [[Page H994]]  her. She was weeping and said to her grandfather:   I don't know what happened. I kept dialing 911 and nothing ever  happened. I would hang up, and I would dial 911, and nothing happened.   That is when Hank began to look into it and found out the situation.  Then, after he brought it to my attention, we got to looking into it.  The hotel associations and the other groups have been very helpful.   It turns out that it is not an expense. All it takes is the  government directing to make sure these phones are programmed so that  when you dial 911, it goes straight out. It won't cost anything. The  programmers themselves have said: Hey, if you have a problem, let us  know. We will come out and fix that for free.   So all it takes is this government saying: Just do it, so when a  child or adult or anyone dials 911 it goes out.   I thank my friend, Marsha Blackburn; I thank Senator Klobuchar for  her work; and my staff, Caralee Conklin and Andrew Keyes, particularly,  for working on this.   Tomorrow, Kari would have turned 36. I believe that this will prevent  any other Karis in the future from having their birthday celebrated  after they are deceased. This will be a legacy for Kari and for Hank,  who are the family, and for her daughter.   I thank everyone involved in making this happen, and I thank my  Democrat friend for working with us.
