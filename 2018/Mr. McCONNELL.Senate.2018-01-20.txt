 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, here we are. Here we are, day one  of the Senate Democrats' government shutdown. We did everything we  could to stop them. We put forward a noncontroversial bill that  contains nothing--nothing--they even claim to object to. It would  continue funding the Federal Government and secure the future of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program for the vulnerable families  who rely on it.   The bill passed the House, the President said he would sign it, and a  bipartisan majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for it. The  votes were there, the President was ready, the solution to this  manufactured crisis was inches away, but then the Democratic leader  took the extraordinary step of filibustering this legislation,  preventing it from passing, and plunging the country into this totally  avoidable mess.   The House of Representatives, the President, and a bipartisan  majority of Republican and Democratic Senators all agreed on a  compromise bill that would have prevented a shutdown. It would enable  Congress to do the commonsense thing--keep negotiating other issues  while also providing for our troops, our veterans, and literally  millions of vulnerable Americans--but the Democratic leader instead  chose to filibuster the bipartisan bill.   So here we are, day one, and already funding is in jeopardy for our  veterans because the Democratic leader filibustered a bipartisan  compromise that a majority of Senators supported and chose instead to  shut down the government. Of course, low-income families across America  woke up today without the knowledge that their children's healthcare is  safe, all because the Democratic leader filibustered a bipartisan  compromise that a majority of Senators supported and chose instead a  government shutdown.   Yesterday, my friend the senior Senator from New York tried to insist  a shutdown was anybody's fault but his own--anybody else but me, he  said. He blamed President Trump because the President wouldn't resolve  months of ongoing negotiations over massive issues in one brief meeting  and give the Senator everything he wanted. He blamed Republicans in  Congress, as though everybody didn't know the Senate rules allow the  minority party, if they choose, to obstruct the American people's  business and filibuster for their own political purposes. It is  possible, but in this instance, foolishly done.   These rhetorical gymnastics are simply not persuasive. The American  people see right through all this bluster.  [[Page S360]]  They see right through all this bluster. Like the President, like the  House, and like a bipartisan majority of Senators, the American people  want long-term solutions on immigration policy, on government spending,  and on all the major issues we have been discussing literally for  months and will continue to discuss.   Like the President, like the House, and like a bipartisan majority of  Senators, the American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate  Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down  until he gets his way on illegal immigration.   The American people cannot comprehend why the senior Senator from New  York is advising his party to keep the government shuttered for  American troops, American veterans, American military families, and  vulnerable American children until he gets exactly what he wants on the  issue of illegal immigration, a situation which does not even become  urgent until March. All these other matters are indeed urgent. They  need to be dealt with right now. This particular issue does not become  urgent until March.   I hope Senate Democrats are starting to realize all this. I hope they  are starting to realize their constituents, the President, the House,  and the majority of the Senate are on one side of this. On the other  side--all alone--is the Democratic leader who invented this unfortunate  hostage situation and led his party into this untenable position.   The solution is to end the foolishness. It is hurting millions of  Americans who have done absolutely nothing to deserve this. I invite  all of my colleagues across the aisle to join together and do what is  obviously responsible and right for the people we represent. It is  pretty clear. Let's reopen the government. Let's resume the bipartisan  discussion on funding our troops, DACA, on government spending, and on  all the other priorities all of us can work together to resolve.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Thanks to the Democratic leader's decision, along with  my good friend from Michigan, to filibuster an extension of the State  Children's Health Insurance Program, low-income families are going to  slip closer to losing health coverage for their kids. In many States,  it is already an emergency.   There was a carefully crafted compromise that she and every Democrat  on the committee supported. The Senate has not reviewed this new  proposal currently being offered today, but Members are serious about  funding CHIP.   There is a bill before us that reauthorizes the program for a full 6  years and can be signed into law today. The only thing preventing  CHIP's reauthorization from being signed into law today is the  Democratic filibuster of the House-passed bill. Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, the House of Representatives, the  President, and a bipartisan majority of Republican and Democratic  Senators all agreed on a compromise bill that would have prevented a  shutdown. We can pass this bill today and have it signed into law so we  can end this nonsense. There is one way to do all of this, and it is  right in front of us--the pending measure.   It would enable Congress to do the commonsense thing: keep  negotiating other issues while providing for our troops, our veterans,  and millions of vulnerable Americans, but the Democratic leader chose  to filibuster that bipartisan bill.   So here we are. Day one, and already funding is in jeopardy for our  veterans and our troops. Funding for a 6-year children's health  insurance bill is sitting here because the Democratic leader  filibustered a bipartisan compromise that a majority of Senators  supported and chose instead to shut down the government.   Thanks to the Democratic leader's decision to filibuster an extension  of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, low-income families  will slip closer to losing healthcare coverage for their kids. In many  States, this is already an emergency.   Again, we can do all of this today. We have a way forward. It is  right in front of us and ready to go.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, the Senate immediately vote on the motion to invoke cloture on  the motion to concur with amendment, which funds CHIP and reopens the  government; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time  be considered expired and the Senate immediately vote on the motion to  concur with further amendment.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the men  and women of our armed services should not be left to suffer at the  hands of political obstruction. These troops are deployed in harm's  way, and left behind are their families and colleagues training to  replace them. It is irresponsible that their pay, to include imminent  danger pay, would be delayed because the Democrats are insisting that  we deal with illegal immigration exclusively on their terms.   Let me remind the Senate that we have an All-Volunteer Force that  doesn't ask much of us, but we are obliged to pay and support them. We  owe them the certainty of a full-year funding bill. Therefore, I  object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301;  that the McConnell amendment at the desk, which provides for full  funding for authorized activities in the National Defense Authorization  Act, be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, the United States is 1 day into a  government shutdown that Senate Democrats have forced on our country.  Let's take a look at where we are.   Last night, a bipartisan majority of Senators--Republicans and  Democrats--voted to avoid this. A bipartisan majority voted to advance  a noncontroversial bill that has already passed the House and which the  President has already said he will sign.   Of course, like any compromise, this funding bill cannot be all  things to all people. But this bipartisan bill does what we need to do  right now. It ends this pointless--pointless--irresponsible shutdown,  funds the government for our troops, our veterans, and millions of  vulnerable Americans, and extends health coverage for millions of  children in low-income families.   None of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can point to a  single thing in the bill that they oppose. Not one thing. That is why a  bipartisan majority voted for it last night. It would have passed  smoothly and been sent for the President's signature, except that the  Democratic leader took the extraordinary step of filibustering this  bipartisan bill and initiating his own government shutdown.   Why? Because, he explains, the President would not give him  everything he wants on the issue of illegal immigration in one  afternoon in the Oval Office. That is it. That is it.   The leaders from both parties have spent months negotiating long-term  fixes for immigration policy, government spending, and other important  priorities. Senators on both sides want a bipartisan solution to DACA  and other immigration issues. Senators on both sides want long-term  funding for our troops. Bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on these  matters have been under way for months.   Here is the difference between the Democratic leader and the rest of  us tonight--the difference. He wants to keep the government shut down  for hundreds of millions of Americans until we finish negotiating on  the subject of illegal immigration. He wants  [[Page S388]]  to keep the government shut down until we finish a negotiation on the  subject of illegal immigration--shutting down the government over  illegal immigration.   Look, those discussions on the immigration issue continue. We don't  have to shut down funding for our veterans, military families, opioid  centers, or anyone else who relies on the Federal Government over the  issue of illegal immigration. The occupant of the Chair is one of the  people involved on that very subject. There is a lot of interest here  on both sides of the aisle in dealing with it. But it is not an  emergency. All of these other issues, which are affected by the  government's shutdown, are emergencies, particularly the children's  healthcare issue.   Look, the American people know what is going on here. They have this  figured out. The survey this week shows that a majority of Americans  say that funding the government is more important than passing  legislation on DACA--legislation, by the way, that doesn't really  exist, which the Democratic leader cannot present to us. We hear a lot  of talk about it, but we haven't seen it.   Fewer than half of Democrats--in this poll I am talking about--say  that dealing with DACA is more urgent than keeping the government open.  These numbers came in before Americans picked up their newspapers this  morning. When they did, they read from the Associated Press exactly who  is responsible for this chaos. From the AP: ``Democrats blocked a four- week stopgap extension in a late-night vote, causing the fourth  government shutdown in a quarter of a century.'' You might say that  they pinned the tail on the donkey.   The New York Times, not exactly a bastion of rightwing sentiment, put  the blame exactly where it belongs. ``Senate Democrats blocked passage  of a stopgap spending bill to keep the government open.''   Senate Republicans remain ready and eager to end this totally  manufactured crisis. This is not a crisis. This is a manufactured  crisis. We voted to avoid it entirely in our bipartisan vote last  night. We are ready to vote again. All the country needs is the  Democratic leader to withdraw his filibuster and let a bipartisan  majority pass this bill and reopen the U.S. Government.   Earlier today, I asked for consent to move up a vote on this  bipartisan solution and to end the craziness today. The Democrats  objected. That will not work forever. If they continue to object, we  cannot proceed to a cloture vote until 1 a.m. on Monday. But I assure  you, we will have the vote at 1 a.m. on Monday unless there is a desire  to have it sooner.   In the meantime, shutdowns have consequences. The Democratic leader  may be playing for political points. But the rest of us understand the  readiness of our Armed Forces, health coverage for poor children, and  survivor benefits for families of fallen servicemembers are the  furthest thing from a game--playing with all of those lives over the  issue of illegal immigration.   Congress has a lot of work to do. We need to provide for our war  fighters, secure the border, resolve the DACA issue, continue work on  healthcare, and attend to many other key priorities. I want to move  forward on all these issues, and we can when the Democratic leader's  filibuster comes to an end. These talks are only being delayed--not  advanced, but delayed--by the Democrats' filibuster and the Democratic  shutdown it has created.   I want to assure the American people that we will be right back at  this tomorrow. I say again to the American people, we will be right  back at this tomorrow and for as long as it takes. We will keep at this  until Democrats end their extraordinary filibuster of government  funding and children's healthcare and allow a bipartisan majority of  Senators to reopen the Federal Government for all Americans and to get  Congress back on track.   The Democratic leader may put his personal political priorities ahead  of everything else, no matter the cost, but Republicans stand with the  American people.
