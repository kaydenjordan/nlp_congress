 Mr. President, I am pleased to support Noel Francisco  to serve as the next Solicitor General.   Mr. Francisco comes to us with impressive credentials. He graduated  from the University of Chicago Law School and clerked for Judge Luttig  on the Fourth Circuit and Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. He has  spent time in both the private sector at prestigious law firms and in  the public sector as counsel to the President at the White House and in  leadership roles at the Department of Justice.   Mr. Francisco has impressive experience arguing before the Supreme  Court. His client won in each of the three cases he argued there. He  has been named one of Washington, DC's ``Super Lawyers,'' as well as  one of the ``100 Most Influential Lawyers in America.''   It is vital for the Office of the Solicitor General to have its  leader in place, so I am pleased that, after waiting for over 3 months  on the Senate floor, we are finally voting on this nominee today.
