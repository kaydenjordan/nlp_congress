 Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the conference  report for H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I have waited a long time  to give this final statement in support of tax reform legislation.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)    Mr. President, this fellow has a very interesting way of  trying to get his point of view across. It shouldn't be done here in  this august body.   Let me just start again.   The Senate will soon vote on the conference report for H.R. 1, the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I have waited a long time to be able to give  this final statement in support of tax reform legislation.   I have been in the Senate for a little while. I have been party to a  number of major legislative achievements, like the passage of the  Americans with Disabilities Act, the creation of the CHIP program, the  Child Health Insurance Program, and the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act, to name just a few. These are landmark bills, and I have had a lot  to do with them.   The legislation before us is as important and as far-reaching as  anything I have been privileged to work on. It is beyond gratifying to  see the Senate reach this point, and I look forward to finally seeing  real tax legislation signed into law.   I apologize for this type of intemperate action and mouthing off  inside of this august Chamber. People feel very deeply about these  things on both sides of the issues.   Passage of this important bill will be historic. It is the  combination of years of work by people in both parties, in both  Chambers, and on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue. Many of us in this  body have been waiting for years for this opportunity, and millions of  Americans outside of this body have been waiting even longer.   It is no secret that our Tax Code is broken. Members of both parties  have acknowledged this. If you walked across the country and asked  Americans of all backgrounds and ideologies, you wouldn't find many who  would be willing to defend the status quo. I don't think you would find  anybody.  [[Page S8092]]    There is one apt phrase my good friend Senator Wyden uses to describe  our Tax Code. He calls it ``a dying carcass.'' Indeed, our Tax Code is  dying and rotting. It has hampered job creation, wage growth,  investment in the United States, and it has chased American companies  to foreign shores. I don't know how it could be more harmful than it  has been. It has also given foreign companies a leg up on U.S.  businesses in the global marketplace, leading to a record number of  foreign takeovers and inversions. The bill before us will address these  problems and help us turn the ship around.   Our legislation will reduce the corporate tax rate to 21 percent-- something that is long overdue--the lowest level in the modern history  of the United States, placing our country slightly below the average of  industrialized countries. These changes will once again give American  companies a competitive edge and bring more businesses back home  instead of losing them the way we have been.   Hundreds of economists have said that our bill will boost economic  growth, and numerous companies have indicated that once our bill  becomes law, they will invest heavily in expansion and job creation  right here in the United States of America.   In addition, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has made clear,  reducing the corporate tax rate has distributional effects that go  beyond the companies themselves, their high-ranking officers, or even  their richest shareholders. In fact, JCT--the Joint Committee on  Taxation--estimates that workers bear 25 percent of the corporate tax  rate and other economists have found that this number can reach as high  as 75 percent. This means that no matter how you slice it, Americans  will see their wages go up when corporate tax rates go down.   Further, over the last few decades, we have seen a massive expansion  of pension and retirement assets, much of which are invested in  corporate stocks. While many of my colleagues like to decry any  business from merely earning a profit, the truth is that the continued  rise in corporate profits has significantly expanded the wealth of  middle-class workers and taxpayers who have continually set aside funds  for the future.   A representative from the Tax Policy Center testified before the  Finance Committee in the spring of last year. At that hearing he stated  that 37 percent of corporate stock ownership was held in retirement  plan accounts--37 percent. That was the largest share of overall stock  ownership, and that statistic syncs up with the distribution tables put  out by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.   For all of these reasons, lowering the corporate tax rate has been a  bipartisan goal for over a decade now. I have said it before:  Presidents Clinton and Obama, Senators Wyden and Schumer, and most of  the other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee have at some point  in the recent past endorsed a significant reduction in the U.S.  corporate tax rate.   Our bill will achieve this bipartisan goal and place our country well  within the mainstream among our international competitors. This is a  good thing--not just for businesses and rich stockholders but for  working, middle-class families as well.   Let's be clear. This bill's chief focus is about helping the middle  class. I know there is a tendency among some in this Chamber to act and  speak as though all money in this country inherently belongs to the  government. I won't speak for everyone, but those of us who have worked  on this bill tend to think differently.   Aside from business reforms that will grow our economy, increase  wages, and create jobs, our bill will lower individual tax rates across  the board, allowing hard-working Americans to keep more of their money.  In our bill, we also nearly double the standard deduction for  individuals and married couples. This feature will significantly reduce  the burden of tax filing for millions of middle-class families and  decrease even further the overall tax liability of millions more. For  the first time in more than 30 years, nearly every American will get  more money back by just filing out an EZ form. This, without a doubt,  fulfills our goal of simplifying the Tax Code.   For individuals who are concerned about being able to itemize--again,  we believe the number of people with this concern will decrease  dramatically under our bill--we retain a number of key provisions that  benefit many in the middle class. For example, this historic  legislation will allow individuals and families to continue to claim  deductions for State and local taxes, up to $10,000 a year. It will  keep in place, with relatively minor adjustments, the deduction for  mortgage interest. And Americans who itemize and want to deduct their  charitable deductions will be free to do so. This has made America  great, and it has helped us at the same time to be more charitable. We  are also expanding the child tax credit with this bill, doubling it  from $1,000 to $2,000 per child and making the credit far more  refundable than ever before. The adoption credit will stay in place.  The deduction for medical expenses will still be available. Credits and  assistance for students and their families will be untouched. We have  made all of these changes and, when necessary, preserved current law,  with an eye toward helping the middle class.   I know a number of my colleagues like to argue that this bill will  have different results. Let's look at the numbers.   Under this bill, a typical family of four, earning the median family  income of $73,000, will see their taxes go down by more than half-- about 58 percent. That number means something more than just a simple  percentage; it means that an average American family will be able to  keep $2,058 more of their own earnings next year. That is a mortgage  payment, a downpayment for a car, or several months' worth of  groceries.   What about a single parent? Under our plan, a single parent with one  child, making $41,000, will see their taxes slashed by nearly 73  percent. That is almost a three-quarter reduction in tax liability.  That means a savings of more than $1,300 over the course of a year.  That could be a month of daycare expenses, multiple car payments, or a  family vacation.   These are things that matter to American families, and they well  should. But our friends on the other side have been so caught up in  partisan politics that they decided to ignore the Americans who will  benefit from this legislation. I think it started with the election of  President Trump and the retention of Senate control by Republicans.  Their base protested, occupied, and disrupted the transfer of power  from President Obama to President Trump. Here on the Hill, the  ``resistance'' was in full effect right off the bat, with a coordinated  effort to stall nominations in committee, which included unprecedented  boycotts and refusals to meet with nominees. It has only gone downhill  from there.   While we heard words from our friends on the other side about  participating in tax reform, their actions showed otherwise. I don't  know how they can stand here and make some of the arguments they do.  Unprecedented process demands were made. Resistance was the plan, and  that plan was carried out. Now we hear about massive tax cuts for the  very rich and huge breaks for corporations, but these claims fall apart  when you look at the facts.   Again, this isn't unchartered territory for my friends on the other  side. Accusing Republicans of hating the poor and loving the rich is  one of their go-to moves. I have seen it for over 40 years. Every time  you turn around, there is one of their go-to moves, and it has nothing  to do with reality. I do think they are getting more desperate and  vicious in their attacks because they regret their own decisions to sit  out of this endeavor. That is precisely how it happened. Our colleagues  were apparently so preoccupied with denying President Trump and  congressional Republicans any success, they chose not to engage and  instead to sit in the peanut gallery throwing out baseless attacks.   As I have said literally dozens of times over the past few years, I  wish the Democrats had joined us in this process, put aside their  ultimatums and preconditions, and helped to advance policies that they  have claimed to support for years now. But we are where we are, and  while the bill before us includes a number of ideas and proposals  Democrats have supported, we are prepared to pass it without their  [[Page S8093]]  votes, if that is what it takes. There have been some Democrats who  have worked with us, but they have been few and far between.   Once again, this is a historic bill. I am proud of the work we have  done in the Finance Committee, here on the floor, and in conference to  get us to this point. I again invite our friends on the other side to  also support the bill. I am proud of our colleagues who have put in so  much effort to get us here. I am proud of the staff on Capitol Hill who  have labored day and night to assist in this endeavor.   As I said, this legislation has been years in the making. I urge all  of my colleagues to support the conference report and help us send it  to the President's desk. You will not regret it. Those who support this  will not regret it.   I think we ought to get rid of this hatred for Donald Trump that  currently exists in this country and in this body. I think we should  give the man a chance. He hasn't even been President for a year yet.  Give him a chance. Even though he hasn't been President for a year yet,  we have had some amazing changes in this country for the better, and I  think we could have many more.   What really interests me is that Donald Trump, 6 or 7 years ago, was  working with Democrats as well as Republicans. He offered to work with  the Democrats on these matters, and they have not taken up the offer.  Instead, it is as though they are still bitter because he beat their  candidate for President.   I would like to have us get over that type of petty politics and see  what we can do to work together. Heaven knows, on the Finance  Committee, I believe we have good Democrats on that committee, as well  as good Republicans, and I think we can work together. I have to say, I  don't think we have as well as we should, but I think we can, and I am  hopeful that we will.   This is an important bill. It is a bill that really does need to  pass. It is a bill that will help this country. It is a bill that will  help the middle class. In fact, it is going to help everybody, but it  will certainly help the middle class most of all.   I hope our colleagues put aside their petty politics on both sides  and come together to support this bill, which literally can help save  this country an awful lot of pain over the next number of years and  give the government the kinds of resources that it needs to be able to  do what the Federal Government needs to do for its people. I think we  can.   People in this body know that I have spent years here. I am the most  senior Republican. I have been here longer than any other Republican  that I know of, and I have the legislative record to back it up--a  record that has included working with Democrats almost every step of  the way. I am offering to make sure we work together, but I haven't  seen it on the other side. Can they get over the bitterness they have?   We heard this loudmouth in the Gallery who has no good sense and a  total lack of etiquette and a total lack of respect for this government  and this Senate. If I were on his side, I would be humiliated because  he was just a big loudmouth who didn't mean a doggone thing.  Unfortunately, I think there are more people like that who are so  bitter that they will raise these types of issues without really trying  to work together.   I am one who has a reputation for working together. I am chairman of  the Finance Committee. I have enjoyed my work with the distinguished  Democratic leader on the Finance Committee, Senator Wyden. I care for  him. I care for the other Democrats on the committee, as well as all of  our Republicans. We work pretty well together. It is getting harder and  harder to work together when all we see are screaming and shouting  because they can't get their way because they are no longer in the  majority. I hope they get over that, and I hope they start working with  us. If they will, we can do an awful lot of good things for this  country, and we can bring people together across this whole country-- people who right now are divided because they don't know what to do.  They see us screaming and shouting around here and a total lack of  willingness to get together. I would like to change it. I am open to  changing it.   This bill that we have is a very, very important bill, and we need to  pass it. My friends on the other side need to realize that, and I hope  we will get some of them to vote for it. They know it is right. Deep  down, they know it is right. It might not be everything they like  themselves. It is not everything I myself would like. But it is a  doggone good bill, and it is something that could really help this  country pull out of the mess that it is in.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have listened to the comments of my  friends on the other side for several hours. Frankly, it has tried my  patience.   If you boil down the inaccurate assertions, you come up with two  basic points. One, that the bill before us cuts taxes for wealthy  taxpayers proportionately more than it does for middle-income  taxpayers. Two, this bill raises taxes on middle-income taxpayers.   Nothing like some old-fashioned nonpartisan light to cut through the  partisan fog created by my friends on the other side.   I refer to a set of tables developed by the nonpartisan official  congressional tax scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which I  will ask consent to have printed in the Record.   The tables show significant tax cut for middle-income taxpayers.   Let's take a look at taxpayers in which the median U.S. income  reside. I am talking about taxpayers at income levels between $50,000  and $75,000. In 2019, two-thirds of taxpayers receive a tax cut of  greater than $500. In 2021, 61.7 percent receive a tax cut of greater  than $500. In 2023, 54.8 percent of taxpayers will receive a tax cut of  greater than $500. In 2021, 53 percent of taxpayers receive a tax cut  of greater than $500. The individual income tax cuts sunset in 2026.   Let's take a look at another middle-income group, those in the  $75,000 to $100,000 cohort. In 2019, 77.8 percent of those taxpayers  receive a tax cut of greater than $500. In 2021, that figure is 72.2  percent. In 2023, that figure is 63.1 percent. In 2025, that figure is  61.4 percent. The individual tax cuts expire in 2026.   I ask my friends on the other side to shut down their rhetorical fog  machine. Stop the phony characterization of this bill as a tax cut for  the wealthy. Recognize it for what it is, a tax cut for Americans that  is focused on middle-income families.    Mr. President, I agree.    The Senator is correct. The conference report language for  the bill does not change or modify the intended scope of the statement  he cites. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service  should interpret the stock attribution rules consistent with this  explanation, as released by the Senate Budget Committee. I would also  note that the reason his amendment No. 1666 was not adopted is because  it was not needed to reflect the intent of the Senate Finance Committee  or the conferees for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I thank my friend from Georgia for his leadership on this issue to  ensure that the stock attribution rules operate consistent with our  intent and do not result in unintended consequences. I look forward to  continuing to work with him on this important issue.    Mr. President, I, personally, congratulate the  distinguished Senator from Ohio. He is one of the most intelligent  people in this body. He has had all kinds of experience outside of the  Senate. He is a person whom everybody should listen to. He makes a lot  of sense. He is one of the most valued members of a very strong  committee, with all kinds of valued members on it, but he is one of  those valued members on the Senate Finance Committee, and I have  nothing but respect for him.   Everything he has said here this evening is true. It is mind-boggling  to me that we even have arguments from the other side. We are talking  about pulling this country out of the mess it is in, and it is going to  take this.   I just want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Ohio. He is  a terrific human being, with a tremendous ability, who has had a lot of  experience outside of the U.S. Senate, and who has been successful  everywhere he has gone. He is one of the most distinguished members of  the Senate Finance Committee. He is not talking politically; he is  talking factually. I just wish everybody in this body were on the floor  to listen to him. I have tremendous respect for him. That is one reason  I am getting up here right now.   We can turn this mess around, but if we don't do it soon, it may be  impossible to turn it around. We have been spending this government  into bankruptcy. That is where we are. We keep making excuses so we can  go back and beat our breasts and claim we are doing so much for the  people when we are just spending them right into bankruptcy. It is  making it more difficult for the committees to do their work. I just  wish we could get both sides together once in a while instead of having  all of this inner conflict on everything that comes up.   It is almost like, if a Republican says something, it has to be  contradicted, and I might add, if a Democrat says something, he has to  be contradicted. I don't mind good arguments. I don't mind people  having different points of view. That is what makes this place a great  place. That is what helps the United States of America to be a great  country and a great government, but we don't even listen to each other  anymore.   Where is this bipartisanship that this country really, drastically  needs?   We happen to be in the majority right now. It seems to me that a  decent minority would want to find ways to work with the, hopefully,  decent majority. I think we can be very decent on our side, and I  believe my colleagues on the other side can be very decent. Let's get  rid of the politics, and let's do what is best for America. Let's get  this country out of the mess it is in. The distinguished Senator from  Ohio has shown us some ways here.   Our tax policy is for the birds. We know what we need to do, but  every time you raise a solution, you have somebody saying: Well, that  is not the answer. Then we have the conflicts between the two Houses.  That is good because that is what helps us to refine some of this  legislation.   All I can say is, I just wish all of us would put the country first,  put politics second, be politically astute but at least be open to  rational reasoning, whether it comes from the other side or our side. I  am just amazed at how we can sit and belabor these things day in and  day out and never really get together. We are hurting the country  because we are unwilling to get together. We are hurting the Congress  of the United States because we are unwilling to get together.   I could go on and on as to our unwillingness to get together. I think  it is time for us to wake up and start saying: Look, let's find common  ground. Let's find ways of getting together instead of constantly  fighting each other on every stinking issue that comes up. There are  reasons for differences in politics and reasons for differences in tax  policy, but we ought to be able to at least discuss these differences  without there being total partisanship, which is what we are,  unfortunately, suffering from. I believe we can turn this mess around.  If we do, it will be a banner for everybody to march behind, and it  seems to me it will be an example for the whole world. I would like to  see us do it.   I know there are people on the other side who cannot stand the  President. Yes, he won an election they didn't think he should have  won, but he did win. He has thrown his hands open to the other side  and, I believe, would do more. It was only 7 or 8 years ago when he was  much more moderate than he is now. I think all they need to do is to  reach out and grab his hands and say: Look, we will find some common  ground here in the best interests of our country and in the best  interests of everybody.   It is not bad to fight things out. I don't have any problem with  that.  [[Page S8121]]  That is part of this body, part of what we do. But we actually have to  come to some conclusions that will push the country forward, and we are  not doing that, except on a limited basis that really doesn't amount to  all that much.   We are coming to the end of a very difficult year. The Democrats  thought they were going to win the Presidency, and they didn't. They  especially feel badly about losing to somebody like Donald Trump, who,  I think, has held out his hands and his arms to them and would do so if  they would just embrace a little bit more of what he is trying to do. I  would like to see us do this. I believe he would throw his arms out to  whomever in this body would work with him, and by working with him, we  may be able to get some of our ideas on both sides actually put into  law that may help this country.   I really particularly enjoyed and appreciated the comments from the  distinguished Senator from Ohio. I think he is one of the most  distinguished people in this body. Earlier, I heard the distinguished  Senator from Pennsylvania. He is a brilliant guy who works his butt off  to try to get us into good places. We ought to listen more to these  folks. There are folks on the other side who are brilliant, too, who, I  think, make a real difference.   I particularly enjoy my counterpart on the Senate Finance Committee,  Senator Wyden from Oregon. We are different. We have different  philosophies, but I have never seen a day when he wasn't willing to sit  down and work out our problems, and that to me is pretty important.   Our leaders are good people. I have watched Chuck Schumer for all the  years he has been in the Senate and before, and he is a better leader  than what we are getting here lately. I have watched Mitch McConnell.  Mitch is one of the shrewdest people I have seen in this body since I  have been a Member, and he is open. I would like to see our leaders get  together a little bit more. I would like to see a little less fighting  and a little more constructive work together. I don't expect miracles  because I have been here only 41 years, but I do expect that we can do  much better than what we are doing, and it is going to take both sides  getting together to do it.   We happen to be in the majority right now, and the Democrats should  give us an edge. We should give them the edge when they are in the  majority. I think that I, for one, have done that.   I hope we can put aside our differences and start working together in  the best interest of the country. I believe in this country. It is the  greatest country in the world. People all over the world are praying  that the United States will get it together. They know that we can  lead. They know that we have leadership in the Congress of the United  States. We can get it together if we will.   I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate  that we have differences. I appreciate that sometimes those differences  put us into pitched battles. That is not all bad, either. But it is bad  if we don't work things out and if we don't look for the good on the  other side in both ways.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate for a  long time, and I have to admit it has been interesting, but it has been  prolonged way beyond where it should have been.   My friends on the other side make much about this process, demeaning  the Members and staff who really put it together.   This bill was marked up in the Finance Committee. It is the first  reconciliation bill to be processed in committee in the Senate in over  12 years. During that period, Democrats held power for 8 of those  years; Republicans, 4 of those years.   The reconciliation bill that made up part of the Affordable Care Act  never went through the Finance Committee. That reconciliation bill  never went through any real Senate process. To be fair, the Affordable  Care Act repeal bill that my side proposed didn't go  [[Page S8134]]  through the Finance Committee either. As difficult as it was, as  chairman, I put out a chairman's mark, modified it, permitted debate  and amendments, and put it to a vote, all in conformity with committee  rules. We had a full Senate debate, amendments, and votes. So I don't  want to hear tonight or at any time that the process deteriorated. It  didn't deteriorate.    No, not just yet. I am going to finish these remarks.   I am going to insert in the Record an analysis of winners and losers.  The analysis is dated today. It was produced by the nonpartisan Joint  Committee on Taxation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the  Record.    I have the floor.    Mr. President, then I will withhold the unanimous consent  request.    Mr. President, I have just withdrawn the request. I will  insert it later when it is more expeditious to do it.   The announcements I have been talking about is dated today, and it  was produced by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. I would  like to put it in the Record. We will do that, if we can. I hope my  colleague will allow me to do that, and I will ask consent that it be  put in the Record.   That analysis shows that middle-income taxpayers are winners. That  nonpartisan data shows--sorry, my writing is not too good here--well,  it shows that they are winners, and that is the clear impact of this  bill. That data cuts through the rhetorical fog generated by my friends  on the other side.   My friends on the other side focus on the year 2027--10 years from  now--when, guess what, that is the year past the sunset of tax cuts on  the individual side. Focus on the years the cuts are in effect, and you  will see the middle class are really winners. There is no question  about it if you focus on it.   I ask unanimous consent that this report, ``A Distribution of Returns  by the Size of the Tax Change for the Conference Agreement for H.R. 1,  the `Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,' '' by the Joint Committee on Taxation be  printed in the Record.
