 Madam Speaker, don't ask the President. Ask the people  of Texas and they will tell you the truth. Biden's unilateral actions  are the cause for this unprecedented crisis.   My Democrat colleagues' response to their fellow Americans: An  amnesty that will only add fuel to the fire of the burning chaos at the  southern border.   Madam Speaker, how did we go from America first to America last in  just days?   Taken together, these perverse incentives will further encourage  lawlessness, enrich cartels, enable the abuse and exploitation of the  most vulnerable people, cheat those who have respected our process,  compromise the health and safety of the American people, and undermine  the sovereignty and security of our great Nation.   Madam Speaker, don't ask the President. Ask the people of Texas and  they will tell you the truth. The cartels are in control at the border  and the left is in control of the Democrat party.
