 Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of H.R. 1, the For the  People Act. H.R. 1 will restore our democracy.   We need a comprehensive bill, Mr. Chairman, that takes action on what  the people sent us to Congress to do: to work on their behalf and to  ensure that government is truly for, by, and of the people; and we must  demand it immediately.   We know that today many people, especially those at home in my  congressional district in the 13th, various communities of color across  this country, continue to face voter disenfranchisement while trying to  exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard. We must  acknowledge this injustice and remedy it immediately.   We need to have stricter rules, Mr. Chair, rules of conflict of  interest when it comes to the offices of the President, the Vice  President, and the appointees, including the reaffirmation of the  requirement to divest in business interests. We do that with H.R. 1.   I commend my colleagues for the additional language requiring both  that language for the executive branch, trading individual stocks, and  so forth.    Mr. Chair, we can't allow our democracy to be tainted. We  must demand that our government is stronger, more transparent, and more  accessible for all of our Americans.
