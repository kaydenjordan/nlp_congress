 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an  American hero, Robert Pioli, of Marietta, Ohio.   Only 19 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked, he stepped up to  fight for his country. Robert requested to be a bombardier because it  had the shortest training, and he was ready to fight.   In April of 1944, his B-17 was hit over Hungary. He was captured by  the Nazis and became a POW, first sent to Poland and then eventually to  Moosburg, Germany.   It was in Moosburg, in April 1945, that tanks under General Patton  rolled over the gates and liberated the camp. Then came what Lieutenant  Pioli said was the most memorable and dramatic  [[Page H2677]]  moment of his life: The American flag was slowly raised over the town  of Moosburg. There wasn't a dry eye in the camp.   Robert recently passed away, peacefully, with his family at his side.   I am honored to have gotten to know this brave American and his  family. He didn't like to be called a hero, but that doesn't change the  fact that he certainly was one.   God rest in peace, Robert Pioli.                            ____________________
