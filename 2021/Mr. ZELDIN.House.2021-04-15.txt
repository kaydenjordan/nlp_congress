 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Ziggy Wilinski, who recently lost his battle with pancreatic cancer.   A Vietnam War veteran and USPS postmaster and general manager, Ziggy  loved our country and community more than anything. Ziggy was an icon  in the town of Riverhead, which boasts a large Polish-American  population.   You could often find Ziggy planning and organizing events at the  Riverhead Polish Hall, which was used to gather the community for  parties, performances, and other gatherings. He was also instrumental  in planning and organizing the iconic annual Riverhead Polish Town  Festival. Speaking from experience, it is a fantastic event that draws  thousands of people every year.   Thank you to Ziggy, his wife, Wanda, and his entire family for their  service to our community. Ziggy was a great guy. He will be greatly  missed, but I have no doubt his legacy will live on for generations to  come.                            ____________________
