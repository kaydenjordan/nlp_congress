 Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History Month. I would  like to take this time to honor a notable woman from my district, Ms.  Anne Beiler, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.   Anne is well known in our community but is also well known and  beloved throughout the world, since she is the founder of Auntie Anne's  pretzels. She was born into an Amish family, and her parents became  members of the Amish Mennonite church when she was 3 years old. She was  a baker and a bread maker and worked at a waitressing job, which taught  her the values of hard work and customer service. She learned to make  pretzels when she worked at a food stand in a farmer's market.   Eventually, she started her own pretzel business. In 1989, she opened  the first franchises throughout central Pennsylvania. Auntie Anne's  unmistakable pretzel aroma can frequently be smelled in malls around  the country and the world, and I am very honored to recognize her hard  work here today.   Anne has also been instrumental in supporting many organizations and  causes in our community. Currently, she serves on the board of the  Museum of the Bible here in Washington, D.C. I am honored to recognize  Anne Beiler on Women's History Month.                            Honoring Marilyn Ware     Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History Month. I would  like to honor a notable woman from my district, Ms. Marilyn Ware, of  Lancaster, Pennsylvania.   Ms. Ware was CEO of American Water Works. During that time, she grew  that company to a market cap of $8.3 billion.   Marilyn was also involved in the local community, serving as chair of  the Lancaster County GOP from 1978 to 1980. She was a pioneer in  fundraising and cared deeply about the direction of our State and our  country. She was always doing all that she could to make sure our  country was on the right path. In our local community, she was a  lifetime advocate of farmland and open space preservation.   From 2006 to 2008, Marilyn served as Ambassador to Finland. She was  passionate and hardworking, always looking to make a difference and to  recruit young people into the world of politics.   Unfortunately, Marilyn passed away in 2017, but she left a lasting  legacy for women and for people all across my district. It is an honor  to recognize her on the House floor today.                           Honoring Jackie Pfursich     Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History Month. I would  like to honor a notable woman from my district, Ms. Jackie Pfursich, of  Lancaster, Pennsylvania.   Jackie currently serves as the Lancaster County clerk of courts,  where she has served since 2016. Since then, she has improved the court  system by modernizing the criminal court with an electronic filing  system. This allows attorneys and case participants to file documents  electronically and helps speed up our court process and make it more  efficient.   Jackie began her legal career as an assistant attorney for the  Pennsylvania Office of General Counsel, Department of Labor and  Industry, where she prosecuted those who violated the Commonwealth's  labor laws.   She resides in East Hempfield with her husband, Ed; and children,  Ella, Nathan, and Tyler. Jackie is an example of a strong, innovative,  and hardworking woman. I am honored to recognize her on the floor of  the House today.                           Honoring Peggy Steinman     Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History Month. I would  like to honor a notable woman from my district, Ms. Beverly ``Peggy''  Steinman, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.   Peggy served as the chairwoman for Steinman Communications. Her  family's business history in our area actually began not long after the  founding of the country. They were responsible for publishing many of  the local papers in our area, including our daily newspaper, the LNP,  and Lancaster Farming. Peggy took helm of the companies in 2010 and did  an extraordinary job of leading Steinman Communications.   More importantly, Peggy is a leader in our community in philanthropy,  always working to make Lancaster County a better place. She served on  the leadership boards of the United Way of Lancaster and, currently,  works with the Steinman Foundation to improve the quality of life for  people in our community. She loves our community and is always giving  back. For that reason, I am honored to recognize her on the floor of  the House today.                            ____________________
