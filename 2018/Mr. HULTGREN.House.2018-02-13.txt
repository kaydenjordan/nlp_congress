 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday morning, Ron Parish of  Yorkville, Illinois, passed from the loving arms of his wife, Becky,  into the open arms of Jesus.   Ron was a lifelong salesman whose career included RC Cola, Nabisco,  McCormick spice company, and more. After he retired, he faithfully  served our community's homeless at Kendall County PADS.   Ron's people skills served him well in business and in his  relationships. He was always reaching out to friends and strangers  alike. He would ask how they are doing, how he could help, and he was  always pointing them to Jesus.   In fact, Ron and Becky introduced my family to their church, Harvest  New Beginnings, and they were the very first to greet us on that God- ordained day 3 years ago when we first visited Harvest New Beginnings.  It has become our home church.   Ron was 75 years old and is survived by Becky; two children, Ron,  Jr., and Rhonda; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and  many other relatives and friends.   I know you are smiling down on us now, Ron. Well done, good and  faithful servant.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4377) to direct the Secretary of Energy to carry out certain  upgrades to research equipment and construct research user facilities,  and for other purposes, as amended.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and       this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise available for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4377, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for H.R. 4377, the  Accelerating American Leadership in Science Act.   This legislation is another key component in today's package of bills  that maintains the American commitment to the basic scientific research  necessary to advance our economy and maintain our national defense.   I commend Chairman Smith for his work on these bills and his support  for the underlying bill. I also thank my colleagues from Illinois for  their bipartisan support of this legislation, as well as the ranking  member for her support.  [[Page H1093]]    The Department of Energy operates and maintains a number of user  facilities open to the broader research community which no one  university or business could ever bring together. I have seen firsthand  in Illinois the impact of these kinds of investments that they provide  to the American public.   It was at Fermilab that the magnets were developed for the modern MRI  machines we have all taken advantage of, and this was just an  unintended by-product of basic scientific research by physicists trying  to examine the smallest building blocks of matter.                                time  1645    This legislation authorizes funding for the Long-Baseline Neutrino  Facility, going between Fermilab and the Sanford Lab in Lead, South  Dakota, more than a mile underground.   This project is an important milestone in American science, serving  as the first major internationally hosted facility in the United  States.   Having already gained the support of more than 1,000 scientists from  30 different countries, this is a successful model for how large  science will be done in the future.   Not only have we gained the support of the broader scientific  community, but we have seen the investment from CERN for the first time  outside of their lab, and the U.K. has already pledged $88 million to  be a part.   When America chooses to lead in these scientific fields, we bring the  world with us and remain the single location for the best and brightest  to continue doing their groundbreaking work.   It has been inspirational just to be a part of this process.   This legislation also authorizes funding for upgrades at the Advanced  Photon Source at Argonne National Lab.   I have had the pleasure to see the work happening at this lab, which  my two colleagues and cosponsors from Illinois represent.   The Advanced Photon Source is the premier facility for X-ray science  in the United States. Nearly 6,000 researchers access this facility  every year to do the kind of research that cannot be done at university  campuses or industrial research facilities.   Every year, more than 1,000 researchers from Illinois alone access  this facility.   With the wide-ranging applications for this facility, research coming  from APS has led to two Nobel Prizes in chemistry and new treatments  for HIV.   The work they are contributing on to better understand the materials  for new batteries are chipping away at the energy storage advancements  we need for newer, zero-emission energy sources to reliably come  online.   These are the success stories we should be championing in Congress,  and these are the kinds of results I want to continue seeing for future  generations here in the United States.   Another facility which this legislation authorizes upgrades for is  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Spallation Neutron Source.   Similar to the two previous projects, this has received unanimous  support from the research community with the DOE's Basic Energy  Sciences Advisory Committee calling these upgrades ``absolutely central  to contribute to world-leading science.''   With the most intense pulsed neutron beam in the world, the  Spallation Neutron Source will continue probing material properties at  the atomic level so that we can build better materials, with uses from  better batteries, more target cures, to cleaner water.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chairman of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber), the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I again want to reiterate my support for  this important legislation to keep the United States at the forefront  of discovery and fundamental research.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support. I encourage  passage of H.R. 4377, and I yield back the balance of my time.
