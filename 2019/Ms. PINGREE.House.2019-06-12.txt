 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague and friend, Chairman  McGovern, for yielding me this time.   Mr. Chair, I rise to support Chairman McGovern's amendment.  [[Page H4532]]    As members of the Food is Medicine working group, one of our  priorities has been highlighting the benefits of medically-tailored  meals.   Many of us know the importance of a nutritious, balanced diet, but we  also know that many face significant hurdles in finding, buying, and  preparing healthy food.   For people with chronic and acute disease, these challenges can lead  to major health complications and major hospital bills. That is where  medically-tailored meals come in.   Study after study show that participants with access to medically- tailored meal programs had fewer hospital inpatient admissions and  fewer emergency department visits.   That is a big potential cost savings for programs like Medicare and  Medicaid, but more importantly, it is a critical tool for keeping  vulnerable Americans, like our seniors, healthy and independent, which  is exactly in line with the goals of the Older Americans Act.   The gentleman's amendment would allow more seniors to access  medically-tailored meals through OAA programs. I think this is an  important step towards strengthening health outcomes and quality of  life, and I urge its passage.
