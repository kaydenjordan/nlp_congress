 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 375th  anniversary of the incorporation of Kittery, ME. The oldest town in  Maine has a history that is as fascinating as it is long. It is a  history that exemplifies the determination, resiliency, and courage of  my State and our Nation.   For thousands of years the rich fishing grounds where the Piscataqua  River meets the sea sustained the Native American tribes. The first  European settlers, drawn by the abundant natural resources, arrived in  1623, just 3 years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. Built on a  foundation of forestry and fishing, the growing community was  incorporated in 1647. With a protected natural harbor and ample  supplies of lumber, Kittery soon became a key Colonial center for  seafaring trade and shipbuilding.   Kittery's maritime heritage is inextricably linked to our Nation's  independence and its ongoing defense of freedom. During the American  Revolution, warships for the fledgling U.S. Navy were built at Kittery,  including the Ranger, commanded by John Paul Jones. Kittery is the  birthplace of General William Whipple, a ship's captain who was the  only Maine native to have signed the Declaration of Independence and  was later a hero of the Battle of Saratoga. Kittery also is the  hometown of Captain Jeremiah O'Brien, who led American forces to  victory at the Battle of the Margaretta at Maine's Machias Bay in 1775,  the first naval battle of the American Revolution.   The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, our Nation's oldest continuously  operating Navy yard, was established in Kittery in 1800. Its first  commander was Commodore Isaac Hull, who achieved fame as captain of the  USS Constitution--Old Ironsides--in the War of 1812.   The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard rebuilt Old Ironsides during the Civil  War and constructed the USS Kearsarge, celebrated for its role in  clearing the seas of Confederate raiders. During World War I, the  shipyard took on the new task of constructing submarines, in addition  to the overhaul and repair of surface vessels. Over the course of World  War II, more than 70 submarines were constructed there, with a record  four submarines launched on 1 day. Today, the Portsmouth Naval  Shipyard, considered the gold standard of our public shipyards,  continues its tradition of excellence by maintaining, modernizing, and  refueling the Navy's submarine fleet.   The people of Kittery cherish their history and work to preserve its  treasures. Some of the earliest homes in  [[Page S5536]]  New England are found there, lovingly restored and maintained. The  First Congregational Church, built in 1730, is the oldest church  building in continuous use in Maine. Two historic seaside forts now  offer hiking trails, parkland, a museum, and spectacular ocean views.   As the gateway to Maine from New Hampshire and points south, Kittery  has much to offer visitors and residents alike. From extensive  shopping, excellent restaurants, and a vibrant arts scene to a wealth  of outdoor recreation opportunities, there is something for everyone.  The wide range of events held during this landmark anniversary year  demonstrates the civic pride found throughout the community.   For 375 years, Kittery has grown and prospered for the future while  honoring its past. The story of Kittery is an important part of  America's story, written by committed citizens working together. I  congratulate the people of Kittery for their accomplishments and wish  them all the best in the years to come.                            ____________________
