 Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to  speak to the CRA legislation before us that would overturn the  Department of Labor rule designed to help Americans save for  retirement, but before I speak to that, I just want to join all of my  colleagues on the floor in applauding what has happened to support the  miners and to get them health benefits and to thank my colleague Joe  Manchin for his leadership.   I know how personally he has fought for this, as so many people who  spoke on the floor have. You know, we don't have any coal miners in New  Hampshire, Joe, but we have hard workers. We have people who understand  that when you make a promise to them, you need to keep that promise.  Thank you for leading this fight and to everyone who made this happen  because we need to reassure Americans that when we say we are going to  do something, we actually follow through and we do that. So thank you  for making that happen.   Now, Mr. President, it is disappointing that actually on the issue  that is before the Senate right now, this effort to change the labor  rule on retirement, that we are actually going to take something away  from Americans. States across America have been developing and  implementing innovative, low-cost retirement savings options to improve  their citizens' retirement security.   That is really important at a time when we have so many people who  have not been able to save for retirement, who are worried about what  might happen if something happens to them and they can't work into the  retirement age. Sadly, the misguided legislation that is before us  would shut down these efforts and effectively take away from States the  right to establish retirement options for workers.   Now, across the country we have had Republican and Democratic State  treasurers join with groups, including the AARP and the Small Business  Majority, to oppose this effort. I want to join them in asking two what  I think are obvious questions.   First, why do the sponsors of this resolution want to deny Americans  new, attractive retirement savings options?   Second, why in the world are they doing this at a time when the  United States faces a growing retirement savings crisis--a crisis that  threatens to strand millions of seniors without any personal savings  and at risk of falling into poverty? And why do this when it doesn't  include any mandates and there is no cost to taxpayers either at the  Federal level or, in most States, at the State level? This is something  that is paid for by people who are looking to get a pension.   Facts matter, and we shouldn't ignore them. Some 55 million Americans  lack access to a workplace retirement plan, and 45 percent of  households don't have any retirement account assets--zero savings.  Polls show that more than three-quarters of private sector workers fear  not having enough money to live comfortably in retirement.   To address this nationwide crisis, many States have stepped up to the  plate, experimenting with public-private partnerships to help small  businesses provide low-cost, turn-key payroll deduction options. The  legislation being debated today would abruptly compromise the future of  these State initiatives.   In my State of New Hampshire, nearly 99 percent of our employers are  considered small businesses. That number is hard to believe. They  employ over 50 percent of New Hampshire's workers.  [[Page S2704]]  Nearly 43 percent of Granite Staters work for an employer that does not  offer a retirement plan.   As the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I talk to  small business owners regularly, and as a former small business owner  myself, I understand the challenges they face. For many, it is a  challenge just to meet payroll and to keep the doors of their  businesses open. I know that many of them would like to offer a company  retirement plan because they want to do right by their employees, but  they just can't afford it.   A Pew Foundation survey found that three-quarters of owners of small  and medium-sized businesses across the country support the idea of  these State-run options because they offer a way for employees to save  for retirement at little or no cost to the employer.   So these programs are sort of like starter plans for small  businesses. A company that is still trying to gain its financial  footing can offer this option to its employees. Then, once the company  gets on more solid ground and it needs to attract and retain talent, it  can transition to a more ambitious retirement plan that allows it to  contribute to its employees' retirement savings.   It is especially troubling to me that the Senate is even considering  whether to deny Americans this retirement option at the same time that  we are seeing leaders on the House side trying to pass a healthcare  bill that would make it more expensive for many preretirement seniors  and for people with preexisting conditions to purchase health coverage.   Again, I would ask: Why would we want to deny this new, innovative  retirement option to millions of employees who work for small  businesses without retirement plans? Why would we want to deny small  businesses the choice of offering these options? Why should the Federal  Government stand in the way of States and small businesses that want to  take positive steps to address the retirement crisis and help their  citizens?   I think this legislation is misguided. It is legislation in search of  a problem, and, worse than that, it would put a massive roadblock in  the way of States and small businesses that are striving to solve the  real and growing problem of inadequate retirement savings.   So I urge my colleagues to really take a look at what would happen in  their home States. I urge them to stand up for America's small  businesses, to vote no on this legislation. Let's ensure that Americans  have more, not fewer, options to save for retirement.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with the Senator from Idaho.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                         National Small Business Week     Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today  to join my colleague, who is the chair of the Small Business  Committee--and I am the ranking member--to celebrate National Small  Business Week.   This is an opportunity for all Americans, regardless of party  affiliation or geography, to come together and support the small  businesses that drive  [[Page S2708]]  the American economy and make such an enormous contribution to our  local communities and culture.   I am pleased to be able to work with Senator Risch. We have enjoyed a  terrific working relationship. We are there, at this moment in the  committee, to try to make a difference for the small businesses of not  only our States of New Hampshire and Idaho but throughout the entire  country.   I ask my chairman if he would like to start out and then turn it back  to me, and we can talk a little bit about what we see happening on the  Small Business Committee.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Risch.   As you point out, we were both Governors, so we had a chance to see  small businesses from the perspective of the States and how States can  be involved in supporting small businesses. But we also have been small  business owners and operators ourselves. My husband and I had a family- owned seasonal retail business, and you operated a family-run ranch in  Idaho. So I am sure you share with me the challenges of small business  owners, the things that kept me awake at night and that I know keep  other small business owners awake: meeting payroll, balancing budgets,  attracting workers, finding customers, and complying with local, State,  and Federal regulations.   As you pointed out, and I certainly agree, our committee works in a  bipartisan way not only on supporting public policy to help small  businesses but also supporting the Small Business Administration, which  has programs that help nurture our small businesses and address their  unique concerns.   On Monday, I visited one of those small businesses. I was kicking off  Small Business Week in New Hampshire, and I visited a company in Dover,  which is a neighboring community to where I live. The company is called  Popzup, spelled just like it sounds. It is a family-owned business that  created an innovative microwave popcorn box without harsh chemicals,  plastic, or silicon. The company's popcorn that goes in that box is  environmentally friendly. It comes from American farms that don't use  GMO products. It is great. They also have all of these seasonings that  go on the popcorn, everything from a seasoning called Everything Bagel  to one that is maple syrup. So it is a unique company.   Its founders, Julie and Marty Lapham, launched the company in 2015.  They have received a lot of support from the Small Business Development  Center in New Hampshire. In fact, Julie told me about preparing for a  ``Shark Tank''-style competition she was participating in and how she  got tremendous help from the SBDC in her presentation. She said:  Without that help, I wouldn't have been able to do it. She actually won  first prize in the competition--$10,000--because the SBDC had helped  her sort through financing options, and she and her husband continue to  work with them as they grow the company.   As we look at Small Business Week this week, it is important to also  recognize the great work SBA does with outstanding entrepreneurs from  all 50 States and territories.   I know you have some similar examples of small businesses in Idaho.    Mr. President, I very much thank Senator Risch. I share  his enthusiasm for the Office of Advocacy and all of the programs SBA  administers and appreciate the good work of the new Administrator  there, Linda McMahon.   You bragged a little bit on your Small Business of the Year in Idaho,  and I would like to do the same. Our New Hampshire Small Business  Person of the Year is Dr. Jake Reder, who is the cofounder and CEO of  Celdara Medical in Lebanon, NH.   I think it is important to point out that small businesses create 16  times per employee the number of patents that large businesses do, and  Celdara Medical is a great example of that. They were founded in 2008.  They are a biotech startup that identifies early-stage medical  technologies and provides financing and business guidance to move  lifesaving products from university laboratories to high-potential  medical companies. They really show that entrepreneurship can be a  positive force to cure disease and save lives.   During their startup, Celdara secured funding through the SBA's SBIR  Program, the Small Business Innovation Research Program, which was  extended last year--thanks in large part to the work of the committee-- for 5 years because of its great track record, enabling entrepreneurs  across the country to participate in R&D to keep us at the vanguard of  innovation. They were also assisted by the SCORE counseling network,  which provides mentors to small businesses.   There are so many things we can do to support our small businesses,  and that is the goal of the Small Business Committee. We also want to  continue to support a modern and flexible SBA that can respond quickly  to economic conditions that confront small businesses in this global  economy.   Like you, I thank all of our colleagues who are going to help us  recognize small businesses throughout the country. I also thank the  Appropriations Committee for its bipartisan work on the omnibus bill to  fund the SBA and our critical rural development programs. We have heard  about many of them at the rural hearing you talked about. Hopefully the  spirit of cooperation we share on the committee will spread throughout  the Congress.   So happy Small Business Week to all of our small businesses, and I  thank all of the entrepreneurs in New Hampshire and Idaho and across  the country for their hard work, for their innovation, and for their  grit. They have our gratitude and our respect.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the good work we will  continue to do for small businesses in this country.    I yield the floor.
