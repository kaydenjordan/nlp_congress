The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as financial service products continue to merge with the  ever-evolving world of technology, the opportunities to reach unbanked  and underserved households also continue to increase. According to the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 7 percent of the U.S. population  is unbanked, and 19.9 percent is underbanked.   The FDIC has concluded previously that mobile banking is well  positioned to meet the day-to-day financial service needs of  underbanked consumers as well as consumers at risk of account closure.  Providing mobile financial services products to these households has  shown to improve their financial outcomes by giving consumers more  control over their finances, which helps households avoid burdensome  fees and allows them to manage necessary payments more conveniently.   Further FDIC research suggests that nearly three-quarters of all  underbanked households have access to a smartphone and that more than  one-third of underbanked households used mobile banking in the past  year. In particular, the FDIC found that mobile financial services  improved account stability by helping underserved consumers  successfully manage and maintain bank accounts.   Unfortunately, access to mobile financial service products is not  equal across the United States. The Making Online Banking Initiation  Legal and Easy Act remedies this lack of parity by establishing a  uniform policy nationwide, allowing a financial institution to record  personal information from a driver's license for the purpose of opening  a bank account with a scan or copy.   The MOBILE Act creates uniform access to helpful financial products  and provides certainty to financial institutions to offer their full  range of mobile banking products to all consumers nationwide.   While the MOBILE Act creates a consistent law across the United  States, it is careful to protect consumer privacy information and  existing State privacy laws. The bill requires financial institutions  to delete all copies of a driver's license and personal identification  after having used them for the permitted purposes of opening an  account.   The legislation is also careful not to reduce any financial  institution's commitment to comply with Federal and State laws aimed at  preventing identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, or know  your customer and Customer Identification Programs.   A Federal Reserve report from 2016 found that mobile banking use was  rising at relatively fast rates, reporting that 43 percent of all  mobile phone owners with a bank account had used mobile banking in the  past 12 months, up from 39 percent in 2014 and 33 percent in 2013.   Following this trend, the use of mobile banking will continue to  grow, and the MOBILE Act ensures that every consumer across the country  who wants to use a mobile banking product is able to do so. This bill  was passed out of the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous,  bipartisan vote.  [[Page H645]]    The MOBILE Act provides consumers easier access to the highly  regulated financial services industry by simplifying their ability to  open an account through the process of scanning or copying their State- issued identification card. As one State banking association wrote to  me:         This legislation is mutually beneficial to both financial       institutions and their customers. The MOBILE Act will help       expand access to critical banking services for underbanked       populations by offering similar retail services through       mobile technology.    Increasing access for mobile financial services products also means  giving rural communities, like many of the small towns I represent in  Colorado, access to financial success. While many of us can drive a  short distance, walk into a bank, and open an account, there are rural  communities where physical bank locations are few and far between. By  allowing those with smartphones to essentially have their bank accounts  in their pocket, geography is no longer a constraint to accessing  financial services products.   All families should have the tools they need to be able to achieve  the financial stability and the prosperity the MOBILE Act will provide.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important for the future financial  health of our Nation's customers. I urge its passage here today, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1457, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1426) to amend the Home Owners' Loan Act to allow Federal  savings associations to elect to operate as national banks, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1426         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Savings Association       Charter Flexibility Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. OPTION FOR FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS TO OPERATE AS                     A COVERED SAVINGS ASSOCIATION.         The Home Owners' Loan Act is amended by inserting after       section 5 (12 U.S.C. 1464) the following:       ``SEC. 5A. ELECTION TO OPERATE AS A COVERED SAVINGS                     ASSOCIATION.         ``(a) Definition.--In this section, the term `covered       savings association' means a Federal savings association that       makes an election approved under subsection (b).        ``(b) Election.--        ``(1) In general.--Upon issuance of the rules described in       subsection (f), a Federal savings association may elect to       operate as a covered savings association by submitting a       notice to the Comptroller of such election.        ``(2) Approval.--A Federal savings association shall be       deemed to be approved to operate as a covered savings       association on the date that is 60 days after the date on       which the Comptroller receives the notice under paragraph       (1), unless the Comptroller notifies the Federal savings       association otherwise.        ``(c) Rights and Duties.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law and except as otherwise provided in this       section, a covered savings association shall--        ``(1) have the same rights and privileges as a national       bank that has its main office situated in the same location       as the home office of the covered savings association; and        ``(2) be subject to the same duties, restrictions,       penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations that       would apply to such a national bank.        ``(d) Treatment of Covered Savings Associations.--A covered       savings association shall be treated as a Federal savings       association for the purposes--        ``(1) of governance of the covered savings association,       including incorporation, bylaws, boards of directors,       shareholders, and distribution of dividends;        ``(2) of consolidation, merger, dissolution, conversion       (including conversion to a stock bank or to another charter),       conservatorship, and receivership; and        ``(3) determined by regulation of the Comptroller.        ``(e) Existing Branches.--A covered savings association may       continue to operate any branch or agency the covered savings       association operated on the date on which an election under       subsection (b) is approved.        ``(f) Rulemaking.--The Comptroller shall issue rules to       carry out this section--        ``(1) that establish streamlined standards and procedures       that clearly identify required documentation or timelines for       an election under subsection (b);        ``(2) that require a Federal savings association that makes       an election under subsection (b) to identify specific assets       and subsidiaries--        ``(A) that do not conform to the requirements for assets       and subsidiaries of a national bank; and        ``(B) that are held by the Federal savings association on       the date on which the Federal savings association submits a       notice of such election;        ``(3) that establish--        ``(A) a transition process for bringing such assets and       subsidiaries into conformance with the requirements for a       national bank; and  [[Page H646]]         ``(B) procedures for allowing the Federal savings       association to provide a justification for grandfathering       such assets and subsidiaries after electing to operate as a       covered savings association;        ``(4) that establish standards and procedures to allow a       covered savings association to terminate an election under       subsection (b) after an appropriate period of time or to make       a subsequent election;        ``(5) that clarify requirements for the treatment of       covered savings associations, including the provisions of law       that apply to covered savings associations; and        ``(6) as the Comptroller deems necessary and in the       interests of safety and soundness.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, and mutual  savings and loan associations are essential community-based financial  institutions that have a long history of serving their neighbors and  promoting small-town economic growth.   However, many of the benefits once given to Federal savings  associations, also known as thrifts, that encouraged community growth  and financial well-being have been stifled by changes initiated under  the Dodd-Frank Act. While Dodd-Frank eliminated many of the benefits  provided to Federal savings associations, the HOLA restrictions,  unfortunately, remain.   These restrictions have left Federal savings associations at a  disadvantage and without the flexibility needed to adapt to meet  community needs and, as a result, are forcing many mutual banks to  either close or merge with other institutions, meaning fewer and more  expensive choices for consumers hoping to finance important purchases.   H.R. 1426, Mr. Rothfus' bipartisan legislation that passed out of the  Financial Services Committee unanimously, would help to preserve these  important community financial institutions by providing mutual banks  with a framework to become covered savings associations. This process  would provide thrifts the ability to operate with the same rights and  duties as national banks without subjecting them to a complex, time- consuming, and costly charter conversion process.   Providing thrifts the flexibility to exercise national bank powers  without changing their charters would give institutions the ability to  exceed the commercial and consumer loan limits that apply under the  Home Owners' Loan Act but continue to benefit from their structure for  purposes of consolidation, merger, dissolution, conservatorship, and  receivership.   Because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency already  supervises both national bank and Federal savings association charters,  it is uniquely positioned to provide the structural framework for the  election process that would transition the rights and duties of a  national bank to a thrift.   Mr. Rothfus' bill instructs the OCC to develop a series of  rulemakings to outline this election process, while also requiring  safeguards to prevent malpractice in the transition process, as well as  abuses in the new structure once it has been instituted.                                time  1800    Community financial institutions should be given the tools they need  to lend effectively to their communities, and this bill creates the  legislative landscape for savings associations to do just that.   Ultimately, the bill creates opportunities for families and small  businesses to access financing for their important purchases, from  buying a home to expanding a business.   Federal savings associations have a long, proud history of being  responsive to their communities' needs, and this legislation will help  them to enhance and continue that record.   I cannot give more emphatic support for this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. He is also  the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1426.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2255), to clarify that nonprofit organizations may accept  donated mortgage appraisals, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak on  behalf of these important bills today.   While low-income applicants and homebuilders seek to provide  affordable, decent housing opportunities to qualifying individuals and  families, these nonprofits rely on the generosity of others in their  communities to accomplish their mission. These groups also heavily rely  on meticulous budgets, and a change in the input costs can have serious  implications for a project's success as well as the number of families  a group can serve.   The Dodd-Frank Act increased requirements for real estate appraisers  and transferred rulemaking authority for residential mortgage  appraisals to the CFPB. Under Dodd-Frank, professionals who furnish  appraisal services for a fee are able to receive a payment that is  ``customary and reasonable'' for the market area where the appraisal  services were performed. However, the CFPB has not defined find the  terms ``customary'' and ``reasonable,'' which has left nonprofit  housing organizations with the serious concern that they violate the  law when the work of appraisers is donated.   If nonprofit housing organizations are required to start paying for  appraisal services, which could cost over $1,000 per appraisal, the  Dodd-Frank statute could unintentionally limit the number of families  in need that these nonprofit organizations can serve.   Mr. Trott's legislation, the Housing Opportunities Made Easier Act,  would remedy this uncertainty by amending the Truth in Lending Act to  allow mortgage appraisal services to be donated by fee appraisers to an  organization that is eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable  contributions.   This simple fix will ensure that housing nonprofit organizations can  continue to provide their incredibly important services for as many in- need families in our communities as possible, and I commend Mr. Trott  for this legislation.   I would also like to voice my support for H.R. 4281, the Expanding  Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act.   As a former small-business owner in a rural part of Colorado, I know  firsthand how important access to capital is for the success of a small  business. The majority of capital for small businesses is concentrated  in urban areas, and access to capital for rural small businesses can be  difficult to come by.   H.R. 4281 would require the SEC's Advocate for Small Business Capital  Formation to identify any unique challenges that rural-area small  businesses have in securing access to capital and require the Small  Business Advocate to provide updates on its findings in its annual  report.   Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities across our country,  providing jobs and services to those they serve, and this legislation  will help hardworking small businesses in rural communities to continue  to create jobs and grow their businesses.   I would also like to give my support to Representative Sinema's and  Representative Poliquin's bill, the Senior Safe Act, here today. H.R.  3758 takes important steps to safeguard our senior citizens from fraud  and abuse by encouraging covered financial institutions to train  supervisors, compliance officers, or legal advisers on how to spot and  report predatory activity against senior citizens.   This legislation also protects banks, credit unions, investment  advisers and  [[Page H649]]  broker-dealers and their employees from civil or administrative  liability when reporting fraudulent activity related to senior citizens  if an employee is properly trained and reports such activity ``in good  faith'' and ``with reasonable care.''   This group of bills will make important and impactful changes for our  communities, and I am pleased to see them considered here on the floor  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Financial Services  Committee and the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4292) to reform the living will process under the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4292         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Institution Living       Will Improvement Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. LIVING WILL REFORMS.

[[Page H651]]         (b) Treatment of Other Resolution Plan Requirements.--        (1) In general.--With respect to an appropriate Federal       banking agency that requires a banking organization to submit       to the agency a resolution plan not described under section       165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act--        (A) the respective agency shall ensure that the review of       such resolution plan is consistent with the requirements       contained in the amendments made by this Act;        (B) the agency may not require the submission of such a       resolution plan more often than every 2 years; and        (C) paragraphs (6) and (7) of such section 165(d) shall       apply to such a resolution plan.

(D) Other banking terms.--The terms ``depository       institution holding company'' and ``insured depository       institution'' have the meaning given those terms,       respectively, under section 3 of the Federal Deposit       Insurance Act.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act, or any       amendment made by this Act, shall be construed as limiting       the authority of an appropriate Federal banking agency (as       defined under subsection (b)(2)) to obtain information from       an institution in connection with such agency's authority to       examine or require reports from the institution.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the living wills process, as mandated under the Dodd- Frank Act for systemically important financial institutions and  designated nonbank financial companies, has become a heavily burdensome  process for the institutions subjected to it.   Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies  with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to annually  submit detailed plans to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation that describe the company's strategy for rapid  and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of its  material financial distress or failure.   The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have near total discretion in  deciding whether a plan is acceptable, and, therefore, whether an  institution will be subject to heavy penalties.   Mr. Zeldin's legislation, the Financial Institution Living Will  Improvement Act, will do just that: improve the regulatory process for  both sides of the living will assessment. This bipartisan legislation  will provide needed change by limiting the frequency of the living  wills process to a 2-year cycle, requiring regulators to publicly  disclose the framework used to be able to review resolution plans, and  requiring feedback on resolution plans within 6 months of the date they  were submitted.   Mr. Speaker, the regulators themselves--members of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC--have suggested  before Congress that reforms should be made to the living wills  process. Recognition from those running the process that the living  wills framework needs to be reformed demonstrates the necessity of Mr.  Zeldin's bill.   Mr. Zeldin's legislation, which was voted out of the Financial  Services Committee unanimously, takes steps toward effectiveness and  efficiency in this process, and I urge my colleagues to support this  measure here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4292, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4792) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to expand  access to capital for small businesses affected by hurricanes or other  natural disasters, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4792         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Access to       Capital After a Natural Disaster Act''.       SEC. 2. EXPANDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES                     IMPACTED BY A NATURAL DISASTER.         Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.       78d) is amended--        (1) in subsection (j)(4)(C), by striking ``minority-owned       and women-owned small businesses'' and inserting ``minority-      owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and       small businesses affected by hurricanes or other natural       disasters''; and        (2) in subsection (j)(6)(B)(iii), by striking ``minority-      owned and women-owned small businesses'' and inserting       ``minority-owned small businesses, women-owned small       businesses, and small businesses affected by hurricanes or       other natural disasters''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses across the country are especially  vulnerable to natural disasters. Recent natural disasters like  Hurricane Harvey in Texas and the wildfires in California have left  small businesses torn apart in their wake.   Nationally, there has been a survey of 500 small businesses. In 2015,  they found that 75 percent of small businesses do not develop plans to  be able to prepare for disasters. This means that small businesses are  nationally unprepared for natural disasters and are likely to  experience a fair amount of difficulty in reopening their doors, a  concerning economic challenge in the aftermath of an already  challenging time.   Ms. Velazquez's bill, the Small Business Access to Capital After a  Natural Disaster Act, would help alleviate some of these challenges by  requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission's Advocate for Small  Business Capital Formation to identify any unique challenges in  securing access to capital for small businesses that have been affected  by hurricanes or natural disasters.   As a former small-business owner and co-chair of the Small Business  Caucus, I know firsthand the positive economic impact a small business  can have on regional and local economies that they serve. In the wake  of a natural disaster, small businesses that reopen and rebuild can  have a major impact on helping the local economy recover.   Mr. Speaker, as the small business advocate is already involved in  communicating with small businesses, requiring the SEC to study issues  with access to capital after a natural disaster and report annually on  its finding is common sense.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Ms. Velazquez for taking the initiative on  this important issue, and I encourage my colleagues to support her  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rutherford). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4792.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
