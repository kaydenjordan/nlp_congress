 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Meeks for  his friendship and mentoring, and I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking  Member Meeks for setting the gold standard of bipartisanship here in  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler) for his  legislative partnership and leadership.   If there is one cause that should transcend partnership, it is the  cause of peace in the Middle East.   Building a bridge between Israel and the Arab world is neither a  Democratic value nor a Republican value. It is an American value.   The Abraham Accords is both an affirmation of Arab-Israeli peace and  a rejection of BDS as a relic of the past.   Indeed, the three noes of the Khartoum Resolution have been replaced  by the three yeses of the Abraham Accords: yes to recognition of  Israel, yes to negotiations with Israel, and yes to peace with Israel.   The Abraham Accords is an achievement so monumental that it demands  and deserves its own special envoy whose sole and singular mission is  to build on the inexorable progress of peace in the Middle East.   Today, we in the United States Congress are bending the long arc of  the Middle East exactly where it belongs, toward peace and prosperity  for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The children of Abraham are finally  standing together as one, divided no longer.                                time  1700
