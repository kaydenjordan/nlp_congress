 Mr. Speaker, today, I am proud to renew our fight to  designate Lebanon for Temporary Protected Status to prevent Lebanese  nationals in the United States from being forced back to the dangerous  crisis facing their home country.   Between the pandemic, the aftermath of the Beirut Port explosion,  economic devastation, and the ongoing political crisis, Lebanon is  experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises globally, resulting  in widespread lack of access to medical care, clean water, food, and  electricity.   According to the United Nations, Mr. Speaker, over 3.5 million  Lebanese people are estimated to live in poverty and 1.38 million  people are experiencing extreme poverty. The Presidency has been vacant  since last October and the parliament just extended the terms of local  officials without elections to avoid a complete collapse at the local  level.   Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of the doctors there in Lebanon have left the  country and we continue to see huge amounts of illnesses spreading  throughout on top of the pandemic.   Our country must not retreat from its long tradition of providing a  safe haven for those that need it the most. Temporary Protected Status  for our Lebanese neighbors is critical to prevent more hardship. I call  on my colleagues to support this legislation.              Celebrating Lee Vernon Newby, Jr.'s 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lee Vernon Newby,  Jr. He is a veteran of World War II, and a longtime resident of Detroit  in Michigan's 12th District Strong. He is celebrating 100 years of  life.   Mr. Newby is a United States Marine Corps veteran who served from  April 1, 1943, until January 8, 1946. He served and was wounded during  World War II, where Mr. Newby was one of our courageous Montford Point  marines and one of the first barrier-breaking African Americans to  enlist in the United States Marine Corps.   He fought against prejudice and hostility while serving our country.  Mr. Newby, Jr., proudly serves as a member of the Montford Point  Marines of America, the Detroit chapter, and was awarded the  Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest civilian award in the Nation,  under President Obama's administration.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in commending Mr. Lee Vernon Newby, Jr.,  [[Page H1956]]  for his outstanding service to our country as we celebrate his 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
