 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Ryan-McConnell tax  scam bill. This bill should be named the ``Republican Donor Class  Relief Act'' because that is what it is, and several of my Republican  colleagues and many in the media have admitted as much.   This tax scam represents a grotesque set of priorities revealing deep  depravity of American values. One of the first  [[Page H10209]]  principles of our Judeo-Christian value system is grounded in what we  do ``for the least of these.''   From the outset, this bill violates that principle by lowering the  marginal tax rates on the wealthiest among us by 2.6 points, while  raising those rates on the least among us by 2 points.   This tax scam bill adds insult to that injurious act by doubling the  estate tax exemption from $11 million to $22 million.   The Republicans add further insult to injury by lowering the tax  rates for corporations by 14 points while raising tax rates on 86  million middle-income families. It makes the tax cuts for corporations  permanent and the miniscule individual cuts temporary, while also  kicking 13 million people off their health insurance and increasing  premiums for millions more.   The tax scam caps deductions for State and local taxes and home  mortgages and adds over $2 trillion to the deficit. Our children and  grandchildren will be left with the bill.   Mr. Speaker, history will not treat kindly the crass cruelty of this  so-called Christmas gift for hardworking Americans.
