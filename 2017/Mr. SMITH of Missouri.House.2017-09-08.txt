 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available under this Act       may be used to pay legal fees pursuant to a settlement in any       case in which the Federal Government is a party that arises       under--        (1) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);        (2) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251       et seq.); or        (3) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et       seq.).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment.   In recent years, we have seen a sharp increase in a practice called  sue and settle. This happens when a Federal agency accepts a lawsuit  from an outside advocacy organization and then, rather than defend  itself, proceeds to settle that lawsuit in a closed-door agreement,  with the end result being new and more costly regulations. If that  isn't bad enough, taxpayers are responsible for footing the legal bill  for the attorneys of the radical organizations who filed the suit.   My amendment is simple. It prevents American taxpayer dollars from  being used to pay the legal fees of outside advocacy groups for  settlements under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the  Endangered Species Act. Litigants can still sue, but they will no  longer be financially rewarded by the taxpayers for their efforts. This  practice is an abuse of our regulatory process and must be stopped.   Nowhere are these settlements more costly in their outcomes than in  the environmental regulatory context. According to the Chamber of  Commerce, between January of 2013 and January of 2017, the EPA chose  not to defend itself in 77 of these lawsuits with outside environmental  advocacy groups. Overall, during the 8 years of the prior  administration, the EPA entered into 137 of these settlements. The  result of these lawsuits is hundreds of new regulations and tens of  millions--even billions--of dollars in compliance costs.   Further, as part of the agreements, agencies are often required to  reprioritize their agendas, allocating limited resources to the  priorities of these interest groups rather than priorities designated  by Congress or ones that have received public and stakeholder input.   The American people are tired of our unaccountable Federal  Government, and we have the opportunity to do something about it. This  is a simple and necessary step to rein in overregulation and bring  transparency back to the regulatory process.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, the gentleman's agreement is an extraneous  amendment that puts the same parameters on attorneys' fees under the  Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, and the Federal Water Pollution  Control Act that are already in place for attorneys' fees under the  Equal Access to Justice Act. In other words, the attorneys' fees are  already set for this. The Equal Access to Justice Act caps the hourly  rate and requires that the parties be the prevailing party--so the fees  are capped.   Maybe the gentleman is not aware that the Equal Access to Justice  Act, as I said, caps the hourly rate for attorneys' fees unless the  court--this is up to the court--unless the court determines an increase  in the cost of living--a special factor, such as limited availability  for a qualified attorney for the proceedings involved--justifies a  higher fee. So the court would look at this very, very carefully, take  everything into account, and then only when the court would see a need  to make sure that we have paid an attorney fairly for their time.   So the gentleman's amendment is already codified and is not needed.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Chair, the sue-and-settle practice cuts  stakeholders and the public out of the regulatory process. It  undermines the Article I authority we hold here in Congress.   By restricting the payment of legal fees, we protect taxpayer  dollars, reduce Federal spending, take away the incentive of these  environmental advocacy groups to sue the Federal Government, and  protect public input in the rulemaking process.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, once again, I rise to object to this.   The Equal Access to Justice Act already caps the hourly rate--it  already  [[Page H7203]]  caps it--and requires that the parties be paid a prevailing wage.   Madam Chair, I believe we do not need this redundant provision to a  bill that is already overburdened with harmful legislative riders.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to reject the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 73 Offered by Mr. Mullin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 73  printed in House Report 115-297.
