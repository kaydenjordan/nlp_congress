 Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority is COVID  crazy, it is January 6 forever, January 6 crazy, climate crazy,  everything is racist, everything is seen through a transgender lens.  Then there are their policies. Their policies that are wreaking harm on  the American people, and that the American people don't want.   They have done so much harm to the country in the last year and half  as they have had the majority, along with the White House. It is hard  to put your finger upon what is the worst thing that has happened to  the country. Is it the rapidly rising violent crime?   The undermining of our police?   Putting criminals ahead of victims?   Putting criminals ahead of police?   And just now figuring out that if you cut police, if you defund  police, if you don't support police, then, of course, you get more  crime.   Is it what they are doing to our military, wokeifying, wussifying our  military with these radical policies. These diversity equity inclusion  policies that think our military is a social experiment. Kicking out  military members because they don't get a vaccine. We got 100,000  troops that are at risk of being dismissed from the military when we  are at 40 percent of our recruiting goals.   Is it what we are doing at the border?   Gosh, we could go on and on about the border, once again.   Is that the worst crisis that the Democrats have created with their  policies?   What this President had to do to keep a secure border was nothing.  Continue the policies of the previous administration and we would have  a secure border. Instead, we have allowed some 4 million--now averaging  about 10,000 a day--illegal aliens crossing into our country. Over 3  million--acknowledged by border patrol--encountered at the border, most  of them released into the interior of the country, and then some  800,000 criminal got-aways, the ones who, you know, don't want to be  taken into our custody, don't want to be given free healthcare, don't  want to be given free education, free social services, free  transportation wherever they want to go, without a quarter to appear.   The ones who are evading capture because they are trafficking drugs,  humans, sex trafficking, child trafficking across our border. The ones  with terrorist ties and criminal ties who will do irreparable harm in  the days, weeks, and months ahead.   Then you look at the energy policy, which is driving--along with the  rapid spending--it is driving the inflation in this country. Energy  policy. What did we need to do when this President took over a year and  a half ago to remain energy independent for the first time in history?   Nothing. Continue the policies. But this President, during the  campaign, promised to declare war on fossil fuels to end American  energy essentially--oil and gas production in this country. That is a  promise that he has kept in the way that he has willfully put  regulatory burdens, restrictions on the energy industry.   Now he goes essentially with a big gas can, carrying it over to the  Middle East, begging these other world producers--who don't produce  energy as cleanly as we do--to produce more energy to try to bail him  out of his failed policies.   Meanwhile, what do we have?   His transportation secretary, who has no experience in  transportation, by the way, says: Hey, the more pain that we can cause,  the more benefit. The more pain we can cause with rising gas prices,  the more benefit. Memo: Most Americans can't afford a $70,000 electric  vehicle.   Most Americans don't have somebody driving them around in a big SUV  so they can get out of the SUV right before the photo op and get on  their bicycle and just bike the last block to work. Most Americans  don't have that option.   This administration, this Democrat majority is out of touch with the  American people. They are hurting the country. These policies are being  rejected. You are going to see in 111 days from today the  representation of that--the demonstration of that on November 8.    I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding  time.   Mr. Speaker, I had a constituent say to me from Bedford County, just  outside of Lynchburg where I live, nothing this President and this  majority in Congress is doing makes sense unless they hate the country.  Nothing they are doing makes sense unless they hate the country.   What would you do differently over the last year and a half if it was  your purpose, your desire, your intention to ruin the country?   Maybe you would undermine police. Maybe you would reduce funding for  police. Maybe you would stop arresting violent criminals. Maybe you  would stop prosecuting violent crimes. Maybe you would allow violent  criminals to have no cash bail. Maybe we would release violent  criminals from our prisons.   You know what? All of those things are happening, and the Democrats  seem surprised that crime has gone up across the country. Violent crime  is up some 30 percent in the last year across the country.   American cities, unrecognizable. People don't want to go there  anymore because of these policies. Maybe the American people don't want  4 million illegal aliens coming into the interior of their country in  the past year and a half.   Maybe we have a shortage of funding to take care of Americans, to do  the things that we would like to do, to take care of our veterans, to  take care of those most in need, to help our farmers, to help hard- working Americans, to maybe give them a little bit of their resources  back, to reduce the regulations and the oppression upon them.   Maybe we don't need to bring in 4 million illegal aliens in a year  and a half, 10,000 a day now, the average is, give them free social  services, free healthcare, free education, free travel, with no  requirement to even appear in court. Maybe the American people want  their border secured.   Maybe the American people don't want massive inflation, 40-year  record inflation, caused primarily by the massive spending, the  reckless spending, and the energy policies.   Think about where we might be if this Democrat majority had gotten  their $6 trillion build back bankrupt bill through Congress. $20,000  per American citizen. They like to say sometimes, oh, some of this  stuff is popular. It polls well. People want this.    $6 trillion is what they have tried to spend, and they are still  trying to backdoor it in over these remaining months that they may have  power.   How would it poll, do you think, if we said, American citizen, do you  want this so-called benefit, this so-called perk, what have you, but  your share of the cost is $20,000. So a family of three, your share is  $60,000. How many would vote for these policies?   Not to mention what they are doing on energy by design, on purpose,  the dishonest attack on the fossil fuel industry, the dishonest  narrative that we are not the cleanest, large energy producers in the  world; the damage that has been done to the economy; the damage that  has been done to the way that American people live their lives.   What are they doing? They are bragging about the pain that they are  causing. The more pain, the better, they are saying. That is what the  President has said. Hey, we are halfway through a transition. If we  could just get through to the other side, it is going to be so much  better, you know.   As you said in candy land and unicorn land, we are going to have all  these jobs and all this prosperity because we went through all this  pain.  [[Page H6916]]    But the fact is, the fossil fuel industry has been used to bring more  prosperity to third world countries than any other development in  industrial history.   This assault on our freedoms, our economic freedoms, our healthcare  freedoms, as you mentioned, whether it is the mask, whether it is the  vaccines, our individual freedoms with the Second Amendment assault.   This body is going to try to pass two more bills to take away and  restrict Second Amendment rights. That is going to happen in this  House, we are told. The continued assault on the Second Amendment  right.   You know, I have right here--I don't do this very often, but I have  some quotes from the Founders as it relates to the Second Amendment  right.   As I was looking for quotes, you know, I couldn't find anything that  talked about that people could keep and bear arms so they could target  practice; that people could keep and bear arms so they could hunt; that  people could keep and bear arms for sporting purposes.   These quotes that I have here from the Founders explaining why they  wrote into the Constitution the Second Amendment as they did was to  ensure we remain free.   Freedom has a cost. Most of the world does not live free to the  extent that we still live free, as you often enunciate.   Whether the majority of this Congress likes it or not, we have a  Constitution. I happen to like it. I know you do as well. The framers,  in their wisdom, made it possible to change the Constitution, but they  made it difficult by design.   They said, hey, if you want to change the Constitution, you have got  to have super majorities of both Houses. You have got to have super  majorities of the State legislatures in order to bring transformational  change to the country and amend the Constitution.   But, instead, they want to undermine the Constitution, undermine our  freedoms, and attack the rights guaranteed to Americans in our  Constitution.    70,000 bucks. Go ahead.    Well said by the gentleman from Texas.   Their solution, this President's solution, this majority's solution  to the economic wreckage they have created is to spend more money.   You just ask yourself. You're baffled. Is it malicious intent, and  they recognize the harm that they are doing; and how they are causing  the harm; and they are doing it by design; and they are doing it on  purpose; or are they that economically illiterate, and they really are  clueless and have no idea what they are doing?   Because we have record inflation, 40-year high inflation of 9  percent, which essentially means every American is working for 1 month  free this year. One month out of the year they are essentially not  getting paid with the loss of purchasing power they have experienced  because of the inflation.   So what is their answer to that? Well, if we could just spend more  money, if we could just get more of our agenda passed and spend  trillions of dollars more, then that will help the problem rather than  make it worse.   It is like the person who says, hey, I am trying to lose weight and  then they would say, well, the solution is to eat more. That is the  solution that they propose, to do more harm, and you just wonder, is it  just that illiterate, that ignorant, or is it willful and devious and  malicious?    Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment in our  Constitution is the amendment that guarantees or ensures all the other  freedoms that we hold dear in this country.   The right to defend oneself is a God-given right, but we are unique  among the nations of the world in that that right is protected for us  and enshrined in our Constitution based on the wisdom of the Founders.   There is a mechanism for changing the Constitution, but it is  difficult. Yet, what this body wants to do is to find ways to do what  the Constitution clearly says, which is that the Congress has  absolutely no constitutional authority to restrict the rights of law- abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.   I am going to read a few quotes from the Founders from about 250  years ago, and the reason why we go back to the Founders is to  understand what they intended with the Constitution. We have the  Federalist Papers, of course, and then other writings by the Founders.   Alexander Hamilton said: ``The best we can hope for concerning the  people at large is that they be properly armed.''   Samuel Adams said the Constitution shall ``be never construed to  authorize Congress to infringe . . . or to prevent  [[Page H6917]]  the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from  keeping their own arms.''   James Madison, the first Congressman from my Fifth District and our  fourth President, said: ``The Constitution preserves the advantage of  being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every  other nation,'' where ``the governments are afraid to trust the people  with arms.'' Still true today.   Noah Webster said: ``Before a standing army can rule, the people must  be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. . . . A  military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but  such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they  will possess the power . . . to resist the execution of a law which  appears to them unjust and oppressive.''   Thomas Jefferson, from my home district in Virginia, from where the  gentleman from Texas went to school, said: ``What country can preserve  its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this  people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.''   Thomas Jefferson also said: ``No free man shall ever be debarred the  use of arms.''   Back to James Madison: ``The right of the people to keep and bear . .  . arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of  the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural  defense of a free country.''   George Mason said: ``To disarm the people--that was the best and most  effectual way to enslave them.''   Patrick Henry said: ``Are we at last brought to such humiliating and  debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our  defense?'' ``If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in  whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to  us, as in our own hands?''   Samuel Adams said: ``The said Constitution be never construed to  authorize Congress to . . . prevent the people of the United States,  who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.''   Thomas Paine: ``Arms discourage and keep the invader and the  plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world. . . . Horrid  mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of  them.''   Patrick Henry also said: ``Where and when did freedom exist, when the  sword and purse were given up from the people?''   We are doing that right here in this body. We are taking the sword  and the purse away from the people.   He said: ``Unless a miracle in human affairs shall interpose, no  nation ever did or ever can retain its liberty, after the loss of the  sword and the purse.''   ``The great object is that every man be armed.''   ``Everyone who is able may have a gun.''   Final quote from Thomas Jefferson, then I will defer to the gentleman  from South Carolina: ``Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . .  disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit  crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for  the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than prevent homicides,  for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an  armed one.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South  Carolina.   Ronald Reagan, to paraphrase, said: Freedom is only one generation  away from extinction, and it must be fought and preserved from one  generation to the next, and no nation having lost its freedom in  history has ever regained it.   You think about how, in the past year and a half, we have seen our  most basic, most essential freedoms trampled upon by those who would  also trample upon our Second Amendment rights. They have moved to  restrict our own healthcare decisions about whether or not we have to  take a vaccine that we may not want or may not need. They have  restricted our ability to travel and to move, where we want to go,  whether or not we can assemble, whether or not we can worship, whether  we can go to work, whether we can operate our business, whether or not  we can earn a living. They want to trample upon our rights to defend  ourselves.  [[Page H6918]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Cawthorn).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, can you confirm how much time we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Greene), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Georgia.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), the chairman  of the Freedom Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Perry.   Chairman Perry, have you ever been asked by the media about a police  officer killed in the line of duty? Have they ever asked you about that  shooting?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry)  for the purpose of a colloquy.    I am never asked about the 100 police officers  killed last year in the line of duty.    I am never asked about the police officers who  are shot in America's largest cities, as you have mentioned. I am never  asked by the media about that.   I am never asked about the hundreds of shootings that take place  every weekend in America's largest cities, these war zones, these crime  zones that are under Democrat control.   There is always a connection here. These are cities that have been  controlled by Democrats. These are Democrat policies carried to their  conclusion.   What they are trying to do to the entire country, which has been in  place much longer in these major cities--you mentioned Baltimore,  Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, on and on, New Orleans, and so forth. That  is where most of the crime is in this country. That is where most of  the shootings take place in this country, and they don't care about  that.   Do they want to harden our schools? Do they want to do what is  necessary to keep our kids safe?   I have long been an advocate in my home State of Virginia, the  community where I served as a county supervisor, in allowing armed  personnel within the school system who are trained and want to carry  concealed and be part of a rapid response team, teachers and staff, to  be armed in the schools to keep the children and the staff safe. The  Democrats are against that.   We all know the truth. Mr. Norman from South Carolina mentioned this  a moment ago. The best response to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy  with a gun. The best response is more good people with guns, more law- abiding citizens with guns, as the Founders wrote and intended and as  the Founders recognized 250 years ago when we didn't have this violent  crime in America's largest cities.   If the Second Amendment is not safe, then no other right is safe.  There is a reason why the Second Amendment comes right after that First  Amendment guarantee to speech, free speech, to free assembly, to free  worship, to petition our government for our grievances. It is that  Second Amendment right to keep us safe, to ensure we remain a free  people.   If you look around the world, if you look at the nation of Ukraine,  Ukraine would be a different place today if the citizens were armed and  permitted to be armed the way we are here in this country. Taiwan would  be a much safer country today from the threat of its large enemy on its  border if their citizens were armed the way our citizens are armed  today.   The Founders recognized in their wisdom that not only did we possess  a God-given right to defend ourselves, to keep ourselves and our  families safe, but also that we would be unique among the nations of  the world in enshrining that in our Constitution and protecting that  right and saying that Congress has no authority to infringe on that  right for law-abiding citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his comments.   The first 10 amendments to the Constitution were intended to protect  the individual, the people, from the government. The Constitution  protects the individual, the minority, from the tyranny of the  majority.   There is a reason why we are not a democracy. We are a representative  republic based on the rule of law, based on a Constitution that would  ensure that we remain free, that would ensure that we protect the  rights of the individual.   The number one job of the Federal Government, that we have gotten so  far away from here in this body, is to keep us safe and secure. Part of  that is to ensure that our rights are safe and secure, and that  includes the right to defend ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
