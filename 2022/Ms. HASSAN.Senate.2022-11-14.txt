 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Steven  Fiore of Atkinson as October's Granite Stater of the Month. This  Halloween, 17-year-old Steven set up an elaborate haunted house to  raise money for the Alzheimer's Association in honor of his late  grandmother.   A Halloween enthusiast from a young age, Steven has collected various  Halloween props, from fog machines to animated creatures, over the  years. His grandmother, who he was close with, was one of the main  contributors to the collection and would gift him props for Christmas.   After Steven's grandmother passed away from Alzheimer's in 2021, he  decided to honor her memory by bringing his passion project to life.  Utilizing his props and decorations, Steven set up a hair-raising  haunted house for the weekends of October 21 and 28, with proceeds  going to the Alzheimer's Association.   I especially admire Steven's creativity and drive in setting up a  haunted house that has also brought together the Atkinson community and  am glad that more guests will experience the thrills of the haunted  house. By taking a difficult situation--experiencing the loss of his  grandmother--and turning it into a positive force for helping others,  by raising money for the Alzheimer's Association, Steven exemplifies  the Granite State spirit, and I am proud to recognize his  efforts.                            ____________________
