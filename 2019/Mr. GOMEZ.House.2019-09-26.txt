 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Juan Jose  Diaz, a valuable member of the East Los Angeles community and a  lifelong resident of California's 34th Congressional District. He was  taken from us far too early this July at the age of 24.   He was full of potential and an inspiration to the people around him.  His sense of duty extended beyond his uniform, being deeply engrained  in him from a young age.   Growing up in Cypress Park, he had a profound understanding of his  community and the problems they faced. He wanted to be a police officer  since he was in preschool, the kind that young men of color, like  himself, could reach out to for help, someone they could trust.   Officer Diaz put his life on the line to better his community and  protect those who call it home.   One night, as he was at a taco stand in Lincoln Heights with his  girlfriend and her brothers, he saw a man tagging gang graffiti on a  wall nearby. Officer Diaz took his duty to serve and protect seriously,  so even though he was not on the clock at that particular moment, he  confronted the man and told him to stop.   Ultimately, this man who was doing the tagging left and returned and  shot at Officer Diaz and his friends. Even in his last moments, this  young hero, this officer, looked out for the people around him, helping  his friends and others escape the gunfire. But Officer Diaz was shot  and killed. You don't see that kind of commitment and courage every  single day.   I mourn the passing of Officer Juan Jose Diaz with his family, his  community, and his colleagues on the force. His legacy will live on  with those who were lucky enough to have known him and with all the  people who he inspired by his bravery and dedication to the people of  East Los Angeles.                            ____________________
