 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 21, which would  prevent increased drilling on Federal lands under this act until the  Secretary of Energy certifies that it would not perpetrate  environmental injustice.   Let me just thank, first of all, Ranking Member Pallone for his  leadership and support in advancing this amendment.   My amendment is very simple. It prohibits increases in the percentage  of Federal lands leased for oil and gas production under this act, if  that new drilling would perpetuate environmental injustice.   Environmental justice is the right to a safe, healthy, productive,  and sustainable environment for all, regardless of race, class, income,  or background.   For too long, we have overlooked the impact of environmental issues  on underserved communities in this country. EPA data shows that people  of color are much more likely to live near polluters and breathe  polluted air. For instance, asthma, which is often caused by a  particular pollution, impacts approximately 13.4 percent of African- American children, compared to only 7.3 percent of White children.   But all low-income people and communities, and especially in poor  communities, all communities deserve to be safe from environmental  health impacts, and people of all races confront environmental  injustice.   Rural communities are also adversely impacted by mining pollution and  contaminated air and groundwater. Environmental injustices impact all  of us; from urban centers to rural regions.   In my home State of California, we are experiencing the climate  emergency firsthand. We know that these unprecedented fires are driven  by climate change. Preventing harmful oil and gas drilling, especially  when it harms those already most vulnerable, will help get us back on  the path to justice.   This amendment builds off of the A. Donald McEachin, our beloved late  colleague, his Environmental Justice for All Act, that I am proud to  co-lead with Ranking Member Grijalva, which sets the stage to begin  addressing the long history of environmental racism and injustice in  the United States.   Mr. Chairman, this fight for environmental justice is also very  personal for me. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, under the  shadow of the smokestacks of the Asarco copper smelter. Myself, my  friends, my neighbors, we were constantly exposed to toxic chemicals. I  watched so many people close to me, including family members, suffer  with major health challenges because of lead that spewed from that  plant.   In the 1970s, the CDC found that 62 percent of children under 10  living near the plant where I lived had toxic levels of lead in their  blood. Even after the smelter was shut down, I think it was, like,  2013, it took decades before any of the residents harmed saw any sort  of justice.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an article titled: ``Before  Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown.''                         [From NRDC, Nov. 29, 2016]          Before Flint, Before East Chicago, There Was Smeltertown                           (By Lauren Villagran)         After a 1970s CDC study showed that the mostly Mexican-      American population of this Texas town had dangerously high       blood lead levels, its buildings were demolished and its       residents were booted.        The Smelter Cemetery sits high atop a desert arroyo between       Interstate 10 and the Mexican border in El Paso. Its wind-      worn wooden crosses are almost all that remain of a community       that sprang up more than a century ago next to an Asarco lead       smelter on the banks of the Rio Grande.        The stone-pile graves bear testament to the history of this       place called Smeltertown. At one time it was a village of       more than 2,500 people, most of them Mexican immigrants who       built their lives on company land in the shadow of the       smelter's smokestacks that would poison their air, their       land, and their children. And almost as soon as the       contamination became known in the 1970s, the community of       Smeltertown was erased: its buildings demolished, its people       forced out.        Now, the men and women who lived and worked in Smeltertown,       their children, and their children's children reunite each       year. Many still live in El Paso, in neighborhoods that       cropped up as Smeltertown was torn down. Others travel from       California, the East Coast, and abroad. They come together to       reweave the social fabric of Smeltertown by sharing memories       and retelling stories they all know by heart. They celebrate       their old hometown despite the dangers it posed to their       families.        Seminal research done on Smeltertown in the 1970s by the       Centers for Disease Control found that 62 percent of children       10 and under living within one mile of the smelter had blood       lead levels considered to be ``evidence of undue lead       absorption.'' The residents of Smeltertown would be the first       American community to face the grim prospect of lead exposure       and its consequences--but they wouldn't be the last. The       communities of Flint, Michigan, the West Calumet Housing       Complex in East Chicago, Indiana, and the schools in Newark,       New Jersey, are just three of the most recent examples. But       the CDC estimates that at least half a million children in       the United States have elevated blood lead levels--and many       of them may not even know it.  [[Page H402]]                                     A Company Town         The American Smelting and Refining Company owned a smelter       in El Paso that, starting in 1910, refined hundreds of       thousands of tons of lead and copper harvested from its mines       in Mexico. It did so with the help of ``an army of Mexican       contract workers,'' according to University of Houston       associate professor of history Monica Perales in her book       Smeltertown: Making and Remembering a Southwest Border       Community.        Mexican workers who labored in Asarco mines began migrating       north, lured by that new operation on the U.S. side of the       border. Many settled on company land below the foothills of       Mt. Cristo Rey. In the early years of the 20th century,       Smeltertown lay outside El Paso city limits, a few miles from       the city's downtown. Divided into an upper section, El Alto,       where the Anglo managers lived, and a lower section, El Bajo,       where the Mexican workers lived, Smeltertown had its own post       office, butcher shop, bakery, cantinas, a theater, San Jose       Catholic parish, a YMCA, a public elementary school, and the       Smelter Vocational School.        Smeltertown was a quintessential company town, in which the       company could be both benefactor and tyrant. Former residents       say Asarco paid well, better than many other employers of the       working class. And yet poverty in Smeltertown could be       extreme. Residents built and invested in their homes, but the       company owned the land; few families could afford cars; many       relied on outhouses into the 1960s. ``As in other single-      industry towns, Smeltertown's residents fashioned their own       way of life in the world the company made, one marked by       inequality, racial segregation, and corporate paternalism,''       Perales writes. The community would flourish for 70 years       under the plumes of the smelter's twin smokestacks, ignorant       of the pervasive danger.                             ``A Silent Poison''         In March 1971, a team of Epidemic Intelligence Service       officers from the CDC arrived to investigate lead exposure       connected to the Asarco smelter.        Dr. Bernard Rosenblum, the El Paso City-County health       commissioner, had called the CDC after his department       discovered that Asarco was discharging large quantities of       lead and other metallic wastes into the air. Between 1969 and       1971, the smelter's stacks had spewed more than 1,000 tons of       lead, 560 tons of zinc, 12 tons of cadmium, and 1.2 tons of       arsenic into the atmosphere. Soil studies showed the highest       concentrations of lead and other metals in surface soil       closest to the smelter--essentially, in Smeltertown. The city       of El Paso was suing Asarco on the basis of those findings       alone, but Rosenblum wanted to know more. He was worried       about the health of the kids. (OnEarth made several attempts       to reach Asarco and its parent company, Grupo Mexico, for       comment without success.)        The CDC team, led by a 29-year-old pediatrician named       Philip Landrigan, began to explore a subject about which       precious little was known: lead toxicity, especially its       effects on children. Landrigan, now a pediatrician and       epidemiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, says,       ``The notion that lead could be toxic at lower levels was       extremely new at that time. Up until 1970 and continuing for       years, people believed you didn't have to worry about lead       unless it was so high that it made a child seriously sick.       The whole idea that lead in the body could be a silent poison       was a new concept.''        Landrigan and the CDC team first looked at whether       environmental contamination would be reflected in human blood       lead levels over three months. The results were startling:       Although they found no cases of overt lead poisoning, 43       percent of people in all age groups and 62 percent of       children 10 and under living within one mile of the smelter       had blood lead levels of at least 40 micrograms per       deciliter. That's eight times the level at which the CDC       recommends a full-fledged public health response today.        Landrigan quickly followed up with a second study in       Smeltertown in 1972, examining the health consequences of       lead exposure in children. The CDC team administered IQ tests       and a finger-tapping test of physical reflexes to the       Smeltertown kids with elevated blood levels; a control group       of children with blood lead levels below 40 micrograms per       deciliter was also tested. The study found that children with       elevated blood lead levels tested as many as seven points       lower on the IQ test than the control group; they also showed       much slower reaction times on the physical reflexes test.     I am not going to quit until all of my  colleagues understand the human consequences of environmental  discrimination. I ask my colleagues to consider the people, the  families, who every day bear the unequal and unjust consequences of our  addiction to fossil fuels.   As President Biden has said, justice must be at the heart of our  response, and my amendment does just that.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
