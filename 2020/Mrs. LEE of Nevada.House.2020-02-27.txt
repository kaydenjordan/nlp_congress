 Mr. Speaker, today I am here on behalf of the  people of Nevada's Third Congressional District, and I rise to  recognize the Miller Middle School eighth grade class, with whom I met  earlier this week on their trip to Washington--and the timing couldn't  be better since it is Public Schools Week.   We talked about topics from STEM education to encouraging creativity  in the classroom. They had some terrific questions, but one really  stuck out. One student asked me: Is investing in public education  really worth it?   It is a tough question, a fair question, especially coming from a  Clark County student. But the answer for me is overwhelmingly,  undoubtedly yes. I just had to look around that room and see each of  those students, whether they came from different backgrounds, having  access to education.   And the answer is not just about investing, but it is about if we  invest in public education as the national priority that it should be.  In a time when public schools are being called upon to help kids beyond  the classroom, investment in education should be our national priority.                            ____________________
