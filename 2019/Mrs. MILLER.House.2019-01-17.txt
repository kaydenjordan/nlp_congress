 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Hershel ``Woody''  Williams for his service and commitment to the ideals that make our  Nation great.   Woody was stationed in the Pacific theater during World War II. A  young marine, he fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal and in Guam,  before landing in Iwo Jima on February 21, 1945.   On the day the flag was raised, Woody's unit was surrounded. Under a  barrage of enemy fire, Woody charged ahead, flamethrower in hand,  attacking the enemy and opening a gap in their defenses that enabled  his fellow marines to forge on. We won.   For his display of heroism, President Truman awarded Williams the  Medal of Honor. As part of his ongoing legacy, the U.S. Navy christened  the USNS Hershel ``Woody'' Williams in 2017, and the VA named their  Huntington medical facility in his honor. He also flipped the coin at  the 2018 Super Bowl. What a guy.   A lifelong West Virginian who resides in Ona, Woody continues to  advocate for Gold Star families throughout the country. I am proud to  call Woody a friend, and I thank him for his service.                            ____________________
