 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support as well of H.R. 923, the Georgia  Support Act.   Since Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, Putin has illegally occupied 20  percent of Georgia's territory, embroiling Georgia in an existential  battle for its sovereignty.   The ongoing, flagrant invasion of Ukraine proves that Putin will stop  at nothing to accomplish his heinous goals. Our allies in Georgia need  strong U.S. support now more than ever. It must be made abundantly  clear to Putin that the American people stand with Georgia and will not  tolerate a further incursion into Georgia's territory.   This bill will reaffirm U.S. support for Georgia's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity by authorizing a review of  security assistance to Georgia to determine key capability gaps, as  well as looking at U.S.-Georgia cybersecurity cooperation and  assistance to combat Russian disinformation.                                time  1345    Russian meddling in Georgia's political processes and active  disinformation campaigns continue to threaten Georgia's democratic  trajectory.   But critically, the bill also addresses the need for Georgia to  maintain its focus on democracy and governance development in order to  stay on its Euro-Atlantic path.   Finally, this bill authorizes the President to impose sanctions on  individuals responsible for human rights abuses in Georgia's occupied  territories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.   By erecting and constantly moving the border further into Georgia's  territory, restricting freedom of movement and conducting arbitrary  detentions, killings, and kidnappings, Putin has jeopardized the lives  of all Georgians on both sides of the boundary line with his occupied  territories.   Passing this bill is a timely opportunity to show support for an ally  that has been on the front line of Putin's belligerence for well over a  decade.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow Putin to believe he can turn to Georgia  next after his despicable invasion of Ukraine. Georgia, a longstanding  U.S. partner in a tough neighborhood, has for too long been on the  front line of Putin's unchecked aggression.   This bill passed in the House the last two Congresses by an  overwhelming bipartisan majority, and I urge my colleagues to support  our Georgian allies yet again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H. Res. 833, which expresses support for  Moldova's democracy, independence, and territorial integrity and calls  for strengthening U.S. and Moldova relations.   Needless to say, this is an especially opportune time to consider  this resolution; not only because this year marks the 30th anniversary  of diplomatic relations between our two countries, but also given the  ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine and the challenge it poses  to other countries in the region, including Moldova.   Moldova's humanitarian response to Russia's full-scale invasion of  Ukraine and its generosity have been truly remarkable. For example,  Moldova has accepted nearly 434,000 Ukrainian refugees. To put that  into perspective, that is around 5 percent of Moldova's entire  population.   Not only does this resolution commend Moldova's strong support for  Ukraine, but also commits the U.S. to continue to assist Moldova in  addressing the economic impacts of the crisis, its energy security, and  advancing democratic reforms.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to  show that the U.S. Congress is committed to a long-term partnership  with Moldova.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Representatives Price and Pfluger  for their work on this resolution.   Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is making the whole of  Europe less secure. U.S. support for our allies and partners must  therefore extend to Ukraine's neighbors, like Moldova.   The ominous threat made by a Russian general last week that the  Kremlin aimed to seize a land bridge from the Donbas to Odesa and then  to Transnistria, the Russian-supported breakaway region in Moldova,  shows why the U.S. must pay close attention to Moldova and its  security.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution to demonstrate the U.S. Congress' strong support of our  friends in Moldova.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan bill, the  Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act. This legislation  authorizes the U.S. Development Finance Corporation to provide  financing for secure 5G and future generations telecommunications  infrastructure development projects in select Central and Eastern  European countries with upper-middle-income economies or high-income  economies.  [[Page H4541]]    This authorization aims to push back against CCP efforts to dominate  the 5G and future generations telecommunications networks of our  strategic allies and partners in the region, many of whom are NATO  allies.   Ensuring the security of the telecommunications network of our NATO  allies and partners in Central and Eastern Europe is unquestionably in  the U.S. national security interest.   Moreover, this bill targets the majority of countries in the Three  Seas Initiative. Launched by 12 of our close friends in Central and  Eastern Europe, the Three Seas Initiative seeks to expand cross-border  energy, transportation, and digital infrastructure, as well as boost  economic development in the region. Though it is a regional initiative,  it has global implications that serve not only European but U.S.  security and economic interests.   We in Congress have expressed great concern that CCP is exporting  corruption, debt traps, and poor labor and environmental standards to  Europe and across the world through its 17+1 and Belt and Road  initiatives. The Three Seas Initiative seeks to address these concerns  by providing positive alternatives to PRC investments in the region,  including in its 5G and future telecom networks.   The last administration successfully convinced most of Central and  Eastern Europe to opt not to use high-risk Chinese suppliers in their  telecommunications networks. Supporting the Three Seas Initiative's  efforts to expand secure digital infrastructure in Central and Eastern  Europe will carry forward this major foreign policy success and ensures  the transatlantic community remains united in its clear-eyed assessment  of the threat the CCP poses to telecommunications security.   In addition, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine must serve as a  wake-up call to the dangers of allowing our adversaries to expand their  influence in critical sectors of our economies. In particular, Europe's  energy dependence on Russia has made it difficult to rally the  continent around tougher sanctions and is funding the Kremlin's war  machine to the tune of about $1 billion every day. This is not in  Europe's or the United States' national security interests.   We cannot wait for a potential conflict over Taiwan to assist our  closest allies and partners in Europe and beyond in cutting out the  CCP's malign influence now that it has been used to gain leverage over  our democratic allies. This bill would help ensure we learn from our  collective past mistakes.   Lastly, this bill is important because it directs the Secretary of  State to appoint a campaign director among existing personnel for the  upcoming election at the International Telecommunications Union, the  ITU, which sets global standards for technologies such as 5G.   Russia's campaign to elect a Russian national who is a former Huawei  executive to serve as the secretary general of the ITU is indicative of  Russia's and China's efforts to use international organizations to  promote their interests and malign influence.   The United States should ensure that we are coordinated in driving  support for the U.S. candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, for the secretary  general of the ITU, but the State Department should also engage on the  important down-ballot races at the ITU.   There are four other posts of significance within the ITU's  leadership structure, including the director of the ITU Development  Sector, the ITU-D. The ITU-D plays a particularly vital role in  supporting multilateral cooperation for fair and open internet  governance through trustworthy deployment of digital technologies in  the developing world.   The U.S. must be doing everything we can to ensure Russian and  Chinese malign influence does not grow. This bill would help.   The Three Seas Initiative seeks to address threats posed by the CCP  by providing positive alternatives to PRC investments in the region,  including in its 5G and future telecoms networks.   We must support our allies in Central and Eastern Europe as they  seek, through the Three Seas Initiative, to reduce their dependence on  Moscow's and Beijing's economic overtures. Only together can we face  the threats posed by the authoritarian regimes in China and Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7311 to require the State  Department to develop a strategy to counter Russian malign influence in  Africa.   As the world continues to watch Russia commit unspeakable atrocities  and war crimes in Ukraine, the U.S. and our allies and partners must  fully assess the threat posed by Russian activities around the world.   This bill requires the State Department to assess the threat of  Russia's engagement in Africa and create a plan to counter the Russian  Federation's growing influence on the continent. In particular, the  bill requires a specific focus on extractive industries, security  assistance, and strategic basing agreements.   In Sudan, Russia is pursuing an agreement to establish a military  base on the Red Sea. Russian mercenaries are also active in the Central  African Republic, Mali, and Libya. While they claim to support  stabilization efforts, in reality, they are committing gross violations  of human rights and exploiting natural resources.   Just last month, Russian mercenaries were implicated in a massacre of  over 200 people in Mali. This was the worst attack in Mali in over 10  years. Further reports indicate that they attempted to blame the  atrocities on French forces after French intelligence footage showed  Russian mercenaries burying victims' bodies outside of a former French  military base.   Putin's complicity in these atrocities and war crimes around the  world, and disinformation campaigns to avoid accountability, cannot go  unanswered. I strongly condemn these attacks and the destabilizing role  of Russia across the continent and the world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member  McCaul, as well as Chairwoman Bass and Ranking Member Smith on the  Subcommittee for Africa, Global Health, and Global Human Rights, for  offering this important measure.   The assessment and strategy required by the bill is an important  first step, but the U.S. must do more to counter Russian malign  activity wherever it is present, and the atrocities and war crimes  ongoing in Ukraine further underscore the urgency.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues again to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, narcotics trafficking and illicit money from the  Caribbean is fueling America's drug crisis and is destabilizing the  Western Hemisphere. The same groups that traffic narcotics, weapons,  and humans also spread misery throughout the region and into the U.S.  homeland.   At the same time, malign actors like the Chinese Communist Party  spread their web of influence in the region. This problem is especially  troubling since the Caribbean is home to a large concentration of  Taiwan's diplomatic allies.   As evidenced by Nicaragua's recent decision to sever long-standing  ties with Taiwan, the CCP is employing a range of tools to advance its  malign agenda in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America.   Congress must remain committed to working with our allies to address  shared security threats, cooperating on regional challenges, and  promoting democratic governance. That is why I am supporting the  Caribbean Basin Security Initiative Authorization Act.   As the CCP exerts its malign influence and drugs flow into the United  States, now is the time to work with our allies in the region to ensure  our national security interests are protected.   This legislation will expand our Caribbean partners' ability to  surveil illicit actors in the water and in the air, improve local law  enforcement's ability to intercept narcotics trafficking, strengthen  local criminal justice institutions, and support natural disaster  response efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the U.S. and our partners must seriously  confront the growing threat posed by the CCP in the Caribbean and  beyond.   As the situation at our border gets worse, deadly drugs like fentanyl  are surging across our southern border from illicit actors in Latin  America. We must address the issue immediately. We cannot ignore the  Caribbean, America's third border.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Espaillat, Mr. Meeks, Mr. Sires, Mr. Green,  and Mr. Connolly for leading this measure. I urge my colleagues to join  us in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Iran and its proxies continue to threaten U.S. troops and our  partners throughout the Middle East with drones. Iran-backed militia  groups attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria with UAVs throughout  2021. Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia doubled over the first 9 months of  2021 compared to 2020, which included frequent UAV assaults.   Where do the Houthis get most of their dangerous UAV technology?  Iran.   And Iran continues to use UAVs to threaten Israel, including in its  deadly attack on an Israeli-owned tanker last summer. This is exactly  why I am opposed to striking another bad nuclear deal with Iran that  would line the regime's pockets with cash. We need to be constraining  Iran's resources, not filling its coffers. The more money Iran has, the  more it will spend on threats to the U.S. and our partners. Period.   This situation is intolerable. The people of the Middle East,  including Americans living there, cannot live in freedom, stability, or  prosperity under assault by Iran's drones. We have to limit Iran's  ability to build and supply drones.   This crucial legislation will take the necessary steps to help reduce  the threats of Iranian drones. It clarifies that our existing sanctions  on Iran's conventional weapons program include the supply, sale, or  transfer to or from Iran of combat UAVs. And it codifies that it is  U.S. policy to prevent Iran and its proxies from acquiring UAVs that  can be used in attacks against the U.S. and our partners.   With this legislation, Congress is telling the world that the U.S.  will use every tool to cut off Iran's UAV supplies and that we will  punish those who continue to supply Iran with UAVs and parts despite  their destructive impact.   Iran has long demonstrated its commitment to destabilizing the Middle  East with its malign activities, but we are committed to countering  Iran's attacks and keeping our partners safe. We will continue to adapt  to this UAV threat. That includes robust sanctions enforcement against  Iran's UAV program and proliferation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   In closing, Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism that oppresses its  own people and poses a grave threat to the U.S. and our allies in the  Middle East, and the Iranian regime is using drones to expand that  threat. Just last month retiring CENTCOM Commander General McKenzie  told Congress that he was very concerned about the remarkable growth in  number and efficiency of Iran's UAV program and long-range drones. We  have a responsibility to our men and women in uniform to do everything  we can to counter Iran's dangerous UAVs.   I am pleased we are taking this step today to clarify our sanctions  laws and make it clear that they cover Iran's drones.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we can continue the long history of  bipartisan cooperation to respond to Iran's threats, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we speak, millions of women and children are on the  brink of starvation around the world. An estimated 3.1 million children  perish every year due to malnutrition. In fact, almost half of the  deaths among children under the age of 5 are linked to malnutrition,  mainly in low- and middle-income countries. In the 21st century this  tragedy should be prevented.   This bipartisan bill will support efforts to scale up targeted and  effective nutrition programs in countries most at risk for severe  malnutrition. That will help us have a real impact on people's lives  around the world.   Fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the administration's  chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan have compounded global  humanitarian crises. Coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than  ever we must do everything we can to advance lifesaving nutrition  programs, and that starts with a strong and effective USAID who has the  tools it needs to ensure no child dies from malnutrition.   Every parent wants to be able to put food on the table, nourish their  families, and provide for themselves. Support for low-cost, effective  nutrition interventions mean an investment in the health, development,  and productivity of the next generation of children, and I urge my  colleagues to support this important measure.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, in addition to the crises in Ukraine,  Afghanistan, and Ethiopia, the COVID-19 pandemic has erased years of  progress towards ending extreme poverty. It has pushed more people into  severe food insecurity and malnutrition and has destabilized fragile  states. This legislation will help us reclaim lost ground in the battle  against hunger and malnutrition.   USAID plays a pivotal role in helping nations across the globe combat  hunger and poverty. The agency, alongside our NGO and private-sector  partners, has helped secure nutrition stability for expectant mothers  and young children along with countless others in need, but more must  be done to truly end starvation.   I want to thank members of the advocacy community, especially Bread  for the World and RESULTS, for their continued support of this  legislative effort.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful we can continue the long history of  bipartisan cooperation to help those in need around the world, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 812, directing the Secretary of State to  develop a strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World  Health Organization.   This bill has passed the House in each of the last three Congresses,  so I am glad the two Chambers have finally come together to send this  bill to the President's desk before the World Health Assembly next  month.   I thank Representative Young Kim for introducing the House version of  this bill early last year and former Representative Ted Yoho for his  work on this issue in previous Congresses.   Taiwan is a model contributor to global health, and Taiwan's  exclusion from the WHO isn't just unfair; it is dangerous.   The world is still paying the price of the Chinese Communist Party's  coverup of the original COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Taiwan's exclusion  from the World Health Organization made the situation even worse by  depriving the world of Taiwan's early warning.   Unfortunately, Xi Jinping and the CCP are continuing to jeopardize  global health by marginalizing Taiwan. The CCP is hijacking the WHO to  advance its own political agenda. Taiwan has been totally excluded from  participating in the WHO's annual World Health Assembly since 2016.   Despite the CCP's interference, Taiwan is a model democracy that  makes the world a better place. The people of Taiwan deserve to  participate in the World Health Organization, so I urge my colleagues  to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, diseases and pandemics know no borders.  Taiwan is a critical player in global health, and it is a global  transportation hub. In blocking Taiwan from the WHO, the CCP is placing  the world at risk to soothe their own insecurities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
