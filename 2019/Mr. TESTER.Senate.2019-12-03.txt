 Mr. President, I will be brief.   Every one of us can stand here and talk on the floor about Johnny  Isakson ad nauseam.   By the way, I have been watching this on TV, and I appreciate your  stick-to-itiveness in your being on the  [[Page S6818]]  floor, listening to this. You are a great man.   The fact doesn't escape me that we are standing in the U.S. Senate, a  body that has seen so many great Senators over the years. We can go  back and have a history lesson on Clay, Calhoun, La Follette, Murray,  Wheeler, Mansfield, Metcalf, and all of these folks. The truth, though,  is the reason we are all here, talking today, is that Johnny Isakson is  a very special guy, and he is special for a number of reasons.   He treats everybody with respect, and because of that, everybody  treats him with respect. His word is his bond, and his handshake is  worth something in this body, which is not something you see all the  time. Johnny is somebody who can get things done. I speak from  experience in being the ranking member on the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs. He has shepherded through many, many very difficult pieces of  legislation, and he has done it because he has developed trust.   If we ever get in a foxhole together, Johnny, I will have your back.  Do you know what? I know you will have mine because you have exhibited  it before. It has been such an incredible pleasure to be in this body,  serving with you. You are one of those guys who doesn't have to be  disagreeable, but if you disagree, you can disagree. Thank you very  much. It has been a pleasure to serve with you.   Godspeed to my friend Johnny Isakson.   I yield the floor.
