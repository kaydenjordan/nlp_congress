 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership  and his partnership in this vital $715 billion INVEST in America Act.  This bill will modernize our Nation's roads, bridges, transit, rail,  water systems, and hasten the transition to carbon-free mobility and  resilience to climate threats in America.   My amendments to the bill ensure that projects will be built by well- paid American workers with American made services and products. It does  extend the NEPA timelines to ensure a timely project completion, and it  also prioritizes evacuation routes and invests in corrosion resistance.   This bill also invests $27 billion for roads and transit in  California over the next 5 years and three critical projects in my own  district: $8.5 million for the 505 highway over crossing in Winters,  California; $4 million for a multimodal transit/highway improvement in  Vacaville; and a $7\1/2\ million project in Fairfield, and--I would  dare say, for my colleagues on the Republican side--a whole lot of  their community-based projects which apparently they want us to vote  for but they don't have the willingness to vote for on their own.
