 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, the majority frog-marched the Agriculture  Committee through a Potemkin markup. It was a legislative charade  designed to give this process a veneer of regular order.   The truth is that this bill was drafted behind closed doors by the  Democratic leadership, without input from the many rural stakeholders  who have been begging this Congress for help. The result is a bill that  spends too much on flawed priorities and fails to meet the needs of  rural communities.   Agriculture Committee Republicans offered amendments to provide much- needed funding for rural hospitals, schools, and businesses;  telemedicine services; broadband connectivity; and critical disaster  relief.   Surprising no one, these were defeated on a partisan basis. For the  one that did pass in our committee, it was stripped from the bill  before reaching the floor.   It is astonishing, Mr. Speaker. Despite the wish list of political  giveaways and excessive spending in this bill, the majority somehow  managed to forget rural America.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill. I believe that we can do better than  this. In fact, we must do better than this.
