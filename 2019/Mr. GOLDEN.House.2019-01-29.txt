 Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a commonsense,  bipartisan bill with Congressman Crenshaw and Congressman Rose. It is  called the Solidarity in Salary Act. It is a simple bill that says if  Federal employees aren't getting paychecks because of a shutdown,  Members of Congress and the President shouldn't get their paychecks.   People back in Maine have heard me talk about when I was a young  private first class joining my unit in the Marines at mealtime out in  the field when they brought a hot meal out, we had a simple rule that  we followed. What we would do is the private first class and lance  corporal would go first to eat followed by the NCOs and staff NCOs,  after that, the officers.   The idea was that good leaders should take care of other people  before stopping and thinking about themselves. That is the principle  behind this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to join Congressmen Crenshaw  and Rose and me in supporting this legislation.                            ____________________
