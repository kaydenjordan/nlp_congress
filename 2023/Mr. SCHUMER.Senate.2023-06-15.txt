 Mr. President, first, a little housekeeping.   I understand there is a bill at the desk that is due for a second  reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, 6 months into the 118th Congress, the  tale of two parties continues.   This week, House Republicans advanced a massive tax package, showing  precisely where their loyalties lie--in helping large, multibillion- dollar corporations, Big Oil polluters, and those at the very, very  top.   Today, the President is reminding the American people where  Democrats' loyalties lie--with ordinary families who want to lower  costs and who have had it with junk fees that nickel and dime people  every single day.   President Biden used his State of the Union Address to call out  companies that exploit consumers through surprise fees on everything  from credit cards, bank overdrafts, hotel resort purchases, and air  travel. Today, he is holding a roundtable discussion with companies at  the White House on the progress they have made in eliminating surprise  fees.   I cannot tell you how many times people have come up to me in New  York, exasperated by junk fees, oftentimes at the last minute. Many  times, they know nothing about them until they are asked to pay them.  It is precisely the kind of abuse that frustrates Americans to no end  and which the Federal Government can address.   It is why, in the House, I authored legislation to protect Americans  from surprise expenses on their credit card bills by requiring credit  card companies to clearly break down all fees and interest rates. They  call it the ``Schumer Box''--a nickname I am proud has stuck.   And junk fees are everywhere. You want to switch your cell phone  company? A termination fee can cost you $250 or something exorbitant  like that. Many people think the phone companies ask for it so you  don't switch even if you are dissatisfied with their service.   You want to book a hotel room listed at $300? Good luck. You will get  the bill and discover the real price is much higher. More than a third  of hotel guests have reported paying some kind of hidden fee.   The kind of abusive behavior from some large companies is exactly  what Americans want to focus on, and it is the major difference between  the two parties.   Republicans think it is best to spend time on cutting taxes for the  very largest, billion-dollar corporations--that often don't pay their  fair share--and on stoking the fires of the culture wars.   But Democrats want to focus on things ordinary families have to deal  with every single day. We can all relate to the frustration of hidden  fees. We can all relate to driving to work on dilapidated roads and  crumbling bridges. We can all look out the window and see that  wildfires, flooding, and extreme weather events are getting worse and  harming our communities. These are the issues Democrats have legislated  on over the past few years, and we are going to keep going.  [[Page S2106]]                                ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on nominations, well, it has been a  busy week for nominations here on the floor. This morning, the Senate  will confirm Nusrat Choudhury, whom I was proud to recommend to  President Biden to serve as district judge for New York's Eastern  District.   When President Biden listened to my recommendation and nominated Ms.  Choudhury, she made history as the first Bangladeshi American ever to  be nominated to the Federal bench, and, today, Ms. Choudhury will make  history as the first Bangladeshi American ever to be confirmed to the  Federal bench. Ms. Choudhury will also be the first Muslim American  woman and only the second Muslim American ever to serve as a Federal  judge. It shows she is a history maker in more ways than one.   Ms. Choudhury is also a shining example of the American dream: the  daughter of immigrant parents, a graduate of Columbia, Princeton, and  Yale Law School. Ms. Choudhury has dedicated her career to making sure  all people can have their voices heard in court.   It is a great day for our country. Our courts are at their strongest  when they mirror the diversity and dynamism of our democracy. We have a  vibrant Bangladeshi community in New York and in the United States. I  am confident Ms. Choudhury will make an excellent judge.   Yesterday, the Senate also confirmed another excellent judge, Dale  Ho, whom I was proud to recommend to be district judge for the Southern  District of New York. As voting rights continue to come under attack,  it is only fitting that we elevated one of the country's top voting  rights experts to the bench to safeguard our democracy and preserve our  most fundamental right as citizens.   With Mr. Ho and Ms. Choudhury, we will have confirmed 21 Asian  Americans to the bench. Let me say that again. With these two new  nominations, we will have confirmed 21 Asian Americans to the bench, a  demographic that has been historically underrepresented in the  judiciary.   I am proud of this majority's record of increasing both the  demographic and professional diversity on the bench. This is how we  strengthen the public's trust in our judiciary. And our work will  continue.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 30.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Executive Calendar No. 1, Treaty Document 112-8.    I ask that the treaty be considered as having advanced  through the various parliamentary stages up to and including the  presentation of the resolution of advice and consent to ratification.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, June 15, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator  from Illinois be given 10 minutes to speak immediately and, following  her, 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.    I yield the floor.    Just parenthetically, true to Trish's dedication to the  job, she just sat down and whispered to me: We are not in a quorum  call. That will probably be one of the very last of about 10,000--maybe  100,000--proper, right instructions she has given me over the years  that she has been here--or given all of us. So I thought that was a  moment to remember.   Anyway, today, I want to take a moment to honor one of the--the--the  most beloved members of the Senate team, and that is Trish Engle, who  will be leaving the Democratic cloakroom after 26 years of service.   That means you started about a year before me, 1998--1997. I came  here in early 1999.   Trish is the proud mom of two boys, William and Garrison.   Wave to us, William. Who is older--William or Garrison? William. Very  nice. Both are in their nice blue shirts.   They are here with us today, and I am sure they are looking--are you  looking forward to spending more time with your mom? You are saying you  are. I am not quite sure, at your age, that is exactly the case. But I  am sure it is good quality time, knowing Trish.   Trish's mom, Melva Ongstad, is here in the Gallery.   Hello, Melva.   I am glad her family could be here, and I know how proud everyone is  of Trish. We all are.   We all know that Trish is one of the most familiar faces in the  Senate, but even then, it is easy to miss just how important, just how  critical she has been to making the Senate agenda come to life. There  are so many--and Trish is at the top of the list--of these unsung  heroes who make the place work. No one notices them, no one praises  them, but without them, this place would collapse.   Without Trish, the Democratic caucus wouldn't have accomplished a  fraction--that is true--a fraction of all the amazing things we have  gotten done over the years: drug reform, infrastructure, CARES Act,  ACA--the list goes on and on. The list of bills she has had a hand in  literally spans decades.   Every Senator on our side of the aisle, every single one, and many of  those who have retired, can think of some accomplishment we have been  proud of at one point or another. You can bet that Trish was the one  who helped make that accomplishment happen on the floor because it is  Trish who comes up with these brilliant parliamentary maneuvers to  achieve our mission. She is always writing the scripts that speed up  the voting process. She is something truly unique, a legislative artist  who knows the inner workings of this body like few others in the  country. There are probably maybe fewer than 10 people who know as much  about the Senate as Trish of the whole--how many?--8 billion people on  Earth, approximately 8 billion people on Earth. That is pretty good.   Over the years, she worked wonders serving--I met her when Daschle  was leader. He loved her and depended on her. She worked her magic  under Harry Reid. He loved her and depended on her.   Today, I want to express how grateful I am for all the good work you  have done during my time as leader.   Like so many parents around here, Trish had to juggle a very  demanding job where she is almost on call all the time while making  sure her wonderful family got all they needed. If that wasn't  challenging enough, during all this time, she is like Superwoman. She  earned an M.B.A. and M.A. from Johns Hopkins while working on the  Senate floor. And to do that from any college is amazing; to do it from  Johns Hopkins--wow. No slouch are you, Trish. Doing it all. Doing it  all.   But these are only some of the wonderful reasons we will miss her. We  will miss her because of her wonderful sense of humor. We will miss her  because few people put up with Senators so regularly and never--I don't  think I ever saw you get mad. Anybody? Oh, you got mad at Amy once. OK,  I understand.   We will miss her because she is a wonderful person to work with no  matter the day, no matter the issue, no matter the outcome. She is the  best.   On behalf of the Senate, Trish, of all of us, the whole big Senate  family, we thank you for everything you have done for this institution  and derivatively for our country. We love you. We will miss you. And  you will always have a home here in this Chamber. We wish you and your  wonderful family the very best.   I yield the floor.
