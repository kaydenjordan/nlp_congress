 Madam President, I rise to talk about a topic that is  boring at times but is absolutely critical, as you just heard in the  last few minutes. My good friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, is a  certified public account. He lived in the real world before he came  here, like I did. He is chairman of the Budget Committee. When he  speaks about this, he speaks with the level of experience and current  information that we all should listen to.   I want to highlight some things he has already talked about but then  talk about the potential we are looking at this week in terms of having  our 187th continuing resolution since the 1974 Budget Act was put into  law. Why is this important? As Senator Enzi just pointed out, our  problem in America is twofold; one, we have a global security crisis,  and we have a financial crisis. I use the word ``crisis'' in both  because the world has never been more dangerous in my lifetime.   Today we have $22 trillion in debt. Let me put a little history  behind it. In the year 2000, we had $6 trillion on about a $12 trillion  economy. At the end of President Bush's time, it went to $10 trillion  of debt--again, on something like a $14 trillion or $15 trillion  economy. At the end of President Obama's term, it went to $20 trillion.  Under that administration, this government doubled America's debt to  $20 trillion. After just a couple of years of President Trump, we are  now at $22 trillion.   The projection is very draconian over the next decade, even though,  by growing the economy in the last couple of years, the Trump  administration has actually lowered the debt curve by an estimate that  CBO says is about $3 trillion over the next decade. That is not good  enough. That is only a fraction of our problem.   This chart on the right talks about the problem. I call it the Lamar  Alexander chart because when we talked about it 2 years ago, we started  bringing this chart up. Working on the budget process is one of the  ways we deal with this. This burgeoning debt that we have to talk about  is really made up of one major contributing factor; that is, mandatory  expenses.    This chart tries to explain that. It shows that the top line here is  total U.S. spending. Today we spend about $4.5 trillion--a little bit  more--but about $4.5 trillion funding the Federal Government. That  includes everything: Military, Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid--the  whole bit. The Federal Government spends about $4.5 trillion on  everything.   The red line is today. Today, however, we only spend $1.3 trillion on  discretionary spending. Yet in terms of the total, in 2000 we spent  less than $2 trillion. Now we are spending more than $4 trillion. That  has doubled in the last two decades. These are constant 2019 dollars.   In the next 20 years, this is projected to go from $4 trillion to $12  trillion per year, each year. In 1 year projected out here, we would  almost double the amount of debt we have. This is untenable under  anybody's estimate. It can't happen. It will not happen. Here is why.  The world can't let it happen.   Today we have about $200 trillion in total debt. Only $60 trillion of  that is sovereign debt, which is government debt. We have one-third of  that. This says that because of mandatory spending, primarily, we will  go to almost half of the world's debt with 5 percent of the population.  That is not going to happen.   Yet what will happen to keep us from doing that or becoming that will  be really draconian unless we act today. Senator Enzi is right. The  sooner we act, the more alternatives and options we have. Let me try to  explain the situation. We are actually spending less today in  discretionary spending at $1.3 trillion as a percentage of our economy  than we did in 2011. In 2011, we were spending 9 percent of our total  GDP on discretionary spending.   What is in discretionary spending? That is the military, most of the  VA, and all discretionary spending, such as Health and Human Services,  Labor, Agriculture, Justice Department, Treasury. All of the above are  included in that. That is $1.3 trillion today, which is about 6  percent. We have gone from 9 percent GDP to 6 percent GDP.  Discretionary spending has actually been brought down.   What is the problem? The problem is in mandatory. What is in  mandatory? As Senator Enzi just said, mandatory is Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, pension benefits on Federal employees, and the  interest on the debt. Just in the next 2 years alone, mandatory  spending goes up $420 billion. I can project that. That is within range  of understanding. What I don't understand is how this really explodes  out of control. This is because the baby boomers are maturing and going  into the later years of their lives. As you just heard, both Social  Security and Medicare--major trust funds--go to zero in a very short  period of time. Medicare happens in 2026 and Social Security in 2032.   I am here to tell you this is the crisis of our time, and we have to  deal with it. Yet today we are about to go into our 187th continuing  resolution. Why? Because we don't have an agreement to fund the  government. We are at the end of our fiscal year, which is September  30. We have 2 working days left, the way the Senate works, before that  happens. It could still be fixed, but the reality of today is that we  have not appropriated one dime for the Federal Government yet.   Last year, going into August break on July 31, we had only funded 12  percent of the Federal Government. Because we stayed here in August, we  funded up to 75 percent of the government. That was the first time in  22 years that we had gotten that far. As a matter of fact, in the last  45 years, this Congress has only funded the Federal Government on time  four times. We have actually shut the government down 21 times because  of the lack of funding. That is almost once every 2 years. It is  unbelievable.   This year, in July, we had an agreement. We did a caps deal between  the Democrats and Republicans. It was a bipartisan deal. Everybody went  kumbaya and said: Yes, this is what we agreed to. We agree to this  topline number. Appropriators had already been working all year. We had  agreements in committee. All we had to do was come back in September  and appropriate these bills, go to conference on the NDAA, and get the  Defense Department funded along with the other major departments and go  ahead down the road and get the government funded.   Here we are at the end of September. That obviously did not happen.  Why? Our good friends across the aisle violated what we thought was a  good-faith agreement in July that there would be no poison pills when  we started appropriating. We see clearly now that wasn't the case. They  are holding this up over $5 billion that the President wants to move  from military spending over to border security spending. It is almost  like they want open borders. I just don't understand this.   We know President Obama built 135 miles of wall, and we know one  thing now. We know that where President Obama built a wall, where  President Bush built a wall, where President Clinton built a wall,  where President George H. W. Bush--in every single case, illegal  crossings at the border went down 95 percent.   By voting no on this spending bill, we are now getting into a  situation where we have to go into a continuing resolution. Last week,  we voted on the Defense bill, and Democrats voted it down. They voted  against a 3.1-percent pay increase for our military brethren.   What is even worse than that, by going into a continuing resolution  and by voting no last week, the Democrats are encouraging the Defense  Department to actually spend $4 billion. We did an audit last year. It  was the first one in the history of the United States. President Trump  ordered it. We had a law in 1991 that required it. Now we had that  audit. This is the first pass. This is the tip of the iceberg. Because  of that, we know that we found at least $4 billion that they don't want  to continue spending, yet are going to be obliged to continue to spend  against those obsolete programs under a continuing resolution, in  addition to not  [[Page S5646]]  getting a pay raise to our people in the military.   We should not have been here in the first place. We had a joint  select committee last year, and we have been working on this for 5  years. It is time to fix this budget process once and for all. We have  to hold Congress accountable, though. In most States, we don't have  this problem. In 44 States, No. 1, you have a balanced budget law, but  more importantly than that, in States like Georgia, if the legislature  doesn't fund the government by the end of the legislative session, by  law, the legislators don't go home.   Senator Lankford and I and others have bills that would require the  same thing here. As a matter of fact, some of us have actually put in  bills that would stop the pay for staff and employees and would stop  Members' compensation until we get this done. A requirement of our job  here is to get the government funded.   It is very simple. It is time for Congress to do its job. I am  chagrined that we face another continuing resolution that we have  educated people about and will cost hundreds of billions of dollars  over a decade because of the damage it will do to the supply chain when  we are trying to get readiness and recapitalization back in our U.S.  military and talk about rationalization. It keeps us from doing each of  those three things right now.   Anybody in the military who is before us in committee tells us over  and over and over of the damaging effects a continuing resolution has  on our military at the very time when we are trying to stand up to peer  pressures in a unique, new way. We have five threats across five  domains. We have never faced that before. Yet here we are, hamstringing  our military once again.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, sadly, the State of Georgia has  said goodbye to one of its finest sons, COL (ret) Gary Allen Jones of  Columbus.   Bonnie and I offer our deepest condolences to Gary's family, friends,  and colleagues.   Gary served as a member of my Georgia strategic military advisory  group, where he provided me and my staff with valuable insight, advice,  and encouragement.   I first met Gary during a visit to Fort Benning in 2016, and I had  the good pleasure of meeting him many times after that. I was always  struck by Gary's warmth, his wisdom, and his stalwart dedication to  service. No matter who you are, Gary treated you like a friend. He  always went out of his way to help.   Gary was the epitome of a servant hero.   Like many brave Americans, Gary heeded the call of duty and entered  the Armed Services. While in the Army, he received many prestigious  awards, including the Silver Star, for his bravery and dedication to  service. In 2018, Gary  [[Page S5663]]  was awarded the Fort Benning Commanding General's Award for Public  Service.   Gary's dedication extended far beyond his time in the military. He  was always a tireless advocate for his community, holding leadership  positions in organizations like the Greater Columbus Chamber of  Commerce, the Historic Chattahoochee River Club, and the Columbus  Uptown Board, among many others. In addition, Gary was a leader in his  local church.   The Columbus area and the entire State of Georgia have been made  better thanks in large part to people like Gary.   As we mourn Gary's passing, we should recognize his incredible  legacy. It is one of warmth, decency, service, and honor.                            ____________________
