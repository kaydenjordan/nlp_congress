 Mr. President, earlier this week, I offered thanks to  a long list of Senate officers and staff who helped this body fulfill  our unique constitutional responsibilities in recent weeks, but we are  soon saying goodbye to one of those distinguished servants of the U.S.  Senate. So I would like to begin this morning by sharing my gratitude  and the whole Senate's gratitude for Bob Swanner.   Bob first joined the staff of the Senate Recording Studio more than  two decades ago. Back then, he was already somewhat of an expert in  designing and constructing television and radio studios. In fact, I  understand that his record was so impressive that he was offered the  job on the spot, and as anyone knows who has worked with Bob for even a  few minutes, he has spent every day since then demonstrating how lucky  we were to have him on board.   By his second year on the job, Bob had already successfully  spearheaded the transition of Senate broadcasts to high-definition TV,  and he didn't stop there. Over the past two decades, Bob has guided the  overhaul of the camera and audio systems in every Senate hearing room.  He masterminded the design of the new Senate Recording Studio's  facilities in the Capitol Visitor Center, and he has made sure that  speeches here on the floor are delivered under only the best TV  lighting.   Let's face it--Hollywood, this place is not. Frankly, capturing a  U.S. Senator's ``good side'' is not always an easy assignment, but as  Bob knows better than anyone, our audio-visual capabilities in this  institution are not about glamor; they are about civics. They are about  making sure the American people can look and listen to their  government.  [[Page S1052]]    Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the small fact that Presidential  inaugurations take place here on the Capitol grounds as well. Not long  after Bob was promoted to general manager of the Recording Studio came  the 2017 inauguration--one big professional challenge after another and  one success after another on behalf of the institution that Bob has  served.   It is no surprise that Bob's colleagues at the Recording Studio are  sorry to see him go. The Senate is better for his dedicated efforts  over these many years, but he will begin his well-deserved retirement  with our sincere thanks for a job well done.                                 Impeachment    Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, it has been 1  week since the Senate concluded the third Presidential trial in  American history.   Things move quickly in Washington, as always, so it is natural that  our focus is now shifting to the many policy subjects where we have  more work to do for families all across our country.   But when the Senate acts, we do not only address the particular issue  before us; we create lasting precedent. This is especially true during  something as grave and uncommon as an impeachment trial. Just as  citizens, scholars, and Senators ourselves studied the past precedents  of 1868 and 1999, so will future generations examine what unfolded over  the past few months.   So before we adjourn for the upcoming State work period and leave  impeachment fully in the rearview mirror, I wanted to speak about it  one more time--not about the particulars that have been so exhaustively  discussed and debated but the deeper questions, to record some final  observations for the future.   The Senate did its job. We protected the long-term future of our  Republic. We kept the temporary fires of factionalism from burning  through to the bedrock of our institutions. We acted as Madison  wished--as an ``impediment'' against ``improper acts.'' The Framers'  firewall held the line.   But in this case, all is not well that ends well. We cannot forget  the abuses that fueled this process. We cannot make light of the  dangerous new precedents set by President Trump's opponents in their  zeal to impeach at all costs. We need to remember what happened so we  can avoid it ever happening again.   As we know, the leftwing drive to impeach President Trump predated-- predated--any phone call to Ukraine--and, in fact, his inauguration.  This isn't a Republican talking point; it is what was reported by  outlets like POLITICO and the Washington Post. House Democrats barely  tried to hide that they began with a guilty verdict and were simply  shopping for a suitable crime.   So, unfortunately, it was predictable that the House majority would  use the serious process of impeachment as a platform to politically  attack the President. It was less predictable that they would also  attack our Nation's core institutions themselves. But that is what  happened.   First, the House Democrats chose to degrade their body's own  precedents. The majority sprinted through a slapdash investigation to  meet arbitrary political deadlines. They trivialized the role of the  House Judiciary Committee, the body traditionally charged with  conducting impeachment inquiries. They sidelined their own Republican  minority colleagues and the President's counsel to precedent-breaking  degrees.   All of this was very regrettable, but from a purely practical  perspective, breaking the House's own china was Speaker Pelosi's  prerogative. What was truly outrageous is what came next--a rolling  attack on the other institutions outside the House.   To begin with, the recklessly broad Articles of Impeachment were an  attack not just on one President but on the Office of the Presidency  itself.   Their first article criticized the alleged motivation behind a  Presidential action but failed to frame their complaint as definable  ``high Crimes [or] Misdemeanors.'' This House set out into unchartered  constitutional waters by passing the first-ever Presidential  impeachment that did not allege any violations of criminal statutes.   Clearly, they owed the Senate and the country a clear limiting  principle to explain why removal on these grounds would be different  from the malleable and subjective ``maladministration'' standard, which  the Framers rejected as a ground for impeachment. But they offered no  such thing.   And their second article sought to criminalize the normal and routine  exercise of executive privileges that Presidents of both parties have  rightly invoked throughout our history. This was, in effect,  criminalizing the separation of powers themselves.   So the House articles would have sharply diminished the Presidency in  our constitutional structure. To extract a pound of flesh from one  particular President, House Democrats were willing to attack the office  itself.   But it did not stop with the House and the Presidency. Next in the  crosshairs came the Senate.   The very night the House passed the articles, the Speaker began an  unprecedented effort to reach outside her own Chamber and dictate the  contours of the Senate trial to Senators. The bizarre stunt of  withholding the articles achieved, of course, nothing, but the irony  was enormous.   The House had just spent weeks jealously guarding their ``sole  power'' of impeachment and criticizing other branches for perceived  interference. Indeed, this reasoning was the entire basis for their  second Article of Impeachment, but their first act out of the gate was  to try to bust constitutional guardrails and meddle in the Senate.   When that stunt went nowhere and the trial began, House Democrats  brought their war on institutions over to this Chamber. From the very  first evening, it was clear the House managers would not even try to  persuade a supermajority of Senators but simply sought to degrade and  smear the Senate itself before the Nation. Senators were called  ``treacherous'' for not structuring our proceedings to the managers'  liking.   Finally, when the trial neared its end and it became clear that  bullying the Senate would not substitute for persuading it, the  campaign against institutions took aim at yet another independent  branch--the Supreme Court--in particular, the Chief Justice of the  United States.   A far-left pressure group produced ads impugning him for presiding  neutrally--neutrally--and not seizing control of the Senate. One  Democratic Senator running for President made the Chief Justice read a  pointless question gainsaying his own ``legitimacy.''    So, in summary, the opponents of this President were willing to throw  mud at the House, the Presidency, the Senate, and the Supreme Court-- all for the sake of short-term partisan politics.   The irony would be rich if it were less sad. For years, this  President's opponents have sought to cloak their rage in the high- minded trappings of institutionalism. The President's opponents profess  great concern for the norms and traditions of our government. But when  it really counted--when the rubber met the road--that talk proved  cheap. It was they who proved willing to degrade public confidence in  our government. It was they who indulged political bloodlust at the  expense of our institutions: reckless--reckless--insinuations that our  2016 election was not legitimate; further insinuations--right here on  the floor--that if the American people reelect this President in 2020,  the result will be presumptively illegitimate as well; bizarre  statements from the Speaker of the House that she may simply deny  reality and refuse to accept the Senate's verdict as final.   There has been much discussion about the foreign adversaries who seek  to reduce the American people's faith in our democracy and cause chaos  and division in our country--rightly so--but we must also demand that  our own political leaders exercise some self-restraint and not do the  work of our adversaries for them.   The critics of our Constitution often say that because our Framers  could not have imagined modern conditions, their work is outmoded. We  hear that the First Amendment or the Second Amendment or the separation  of powers must be changed to suit the times.   But the geniuses who founded this Nation were actually very  prescient. Case in point: The reckless partisan crusade of recent weeks  is something they predicted more than two centuries  [[Page S1053]]  ago. Hamilton predicted ``the demon of faction will, at certain  seasons, extend his scepter'' over the House of Representatives. He  predicted that partisan anger could produce ``an intemperate or  designing majority in the House of Representatives,'' capable of  destroying the separation of powers if left unchecked.   The Framers predicted overheated House majorities might lash out at  their peer institutions and display ``strong symptoms of impatience and  disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as if  the exercise of . . . rights, by either the executive or judiciary,  were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity.''  They knew the popular legislature might be ``disposed to exert an  imperious control over the other departments.''   They predicted all of this. They predicted it all.   So they did something about it. They set up a firewall. They built  the Senate.   This body performed admirably these past weeks. We did precisely the  job we were made for.   We did precisely the job we were made for, but impeachment should  never have come to the Senate like this. This most serious  constitutional tool should never have been used so lightly--as a  political weapon of first resort, as a tool to lash out at the basic  bedrock of our institutions because one side did not get their way.   It should never have happened, and it should never happen again.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the clerks  be allowed to make technical corrections to the engrossing of the  amendments to S.J. Res. 68.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 384.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 491.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 420.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 17.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I withdraw the motion to proceed.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 569.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  and consider Calendar No. 416.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls with respect to the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, today it is a privilege for me to join  Kentuckians in Lee County in marking 150 years of their distinguished  history. Found in Eastern Kentucky, where tall hills meet dense  forests, Lee County is home to a special rural heritage. I would like  to spend a few moments today to look back at the area's wonderful  traditions and to celebrate its great potential for the future.   To fully understand Lee County's history, we must appreciate its  geography. The county seat, Beattyville, sits at the birthplace of the  beautiful Kentucky River. The Commonwealth's  [[Page S1067]]  namesake waterway has historically provided Lee County residents a  shipping avenue and a scenic venue for outdoor recreation. Lush valleys  led local farmers to grow a wide range of crops, including tobacco,  corn, and apples. The Daniel Boone National Forest, which covers  thousands of acres of the county, provides an abundant source of  hardwood. Taking advantage of the beautiful Appalachian Mountains, coal  operations in the county have been a historic aspect of this region.   Formed in the years following the Civil War, Lee County did not take  long to become a center of regional ground and water transportation. At  the beginning of the 20th century, the Louisville and Atlantic Railroad  extended its line to Beattyville, encouraging new opportunities for  local growth. The following decades saw a strengthening economy and  growing population.   As the county developed, so did its rural traditions. One of them,  the local Woolly Worm Festival, celebrates Lee County's mountain  culture. Each October, the community gathers for a variety of events,  including a pet show, a parade, and a pageant. The most interesting day  is the Woolly Worm Races, where young people see whose banded woolly  worm is the fastest to climb a string. The winning worm is given the  responsibility of predicting that year's upcoming winter based on its  body's coloration. This is just one example of the pride every Lee  County resident can enjoy in their home county.   I frequently get the chance to visit with families in Lee County and  consistently work to advance their priorities in the Senate. For  example, I have partnered with local officials to secure millions of  Federal dollars to upgrade their water infrastructure and to build a  hiking and mountain biking trail. It has also been a privilege to  support the brave drug eradication efforts of law enforcement and the  Kentucky National Guard in the Daniel Boone National Forest. Answering  the call of Kentuckians is one of the best aspects of my service in the  Senate, and I look forward to continuing to deliver for communities in  Lee County and across Kentucky.   Lee County will kick off its year of festivities on March 1, the same  day the county was established in 1870. In addition to many community  events, the county is also presenting an oral history project,  featuring community members discussing local artifacts and historical  events. There is certainly a lot to celebrate about the last 150 years.  I am delighted to join all the families throughout Lee County in  marking this impressive milestone, and I urge my Senate colleagues to  join me in paying tribute to this wonderful Eastern Kentucky community.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.
