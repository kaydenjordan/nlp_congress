 Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we mourn with Gold Star  families, but we cannot feel their pain. There is nothing anyone can  say or do to really comfort families suffering the loss of a loved one.  But there is a lot people can say or do to cause grieving families  additional pain, as we have seen over this past week.   As Members of Congress, we are there for our constituents. They are  our families. It is our obligation to speak up when they are hurt.   The loss of American servicemembers should not be politicized. Our  fallen heroes should be honored.   Sergeant La David Johnson is an American hero.   Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Johnson is an American hero.   Staff Sergeant Bryan Black is an American hero.   Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright is an American hero.   The 28 men and women who lost their lives in service to their country  this year are all American heroes. Let us honor their sacrifices and  comfort their families, as has been the tradition in this country until  last week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would first like to start by thanking my  colleague, Congressman Garamendi from the great State of California,  for hosting this afternoon's Special Order hour on the Republicans'  massive tax giveaway to the rich.   Mr. Speaker, the American people want a tax plan that creates jobs,  builds infrastructure, helps out the poorest among us, strengthens the  middle class, and requires billionaires to pay their fair share.   Unfortunately, the Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan puts billionaires  first and working class people last. The Republicans' tax plan will cut  taxes for the wealthiest 1 percent, and it will raise taxes for more  than a quarter of New Jersey's households. That is 1.2 million families  in the State that I represent.   Across the country, the average tax increase for families under the  Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan is $794 a year, another $794 a year on  families struggling now to make ends meet. In New Jersey, that is money  a family could use to pay for a month of childcare or 7 months of an  electric bill.   The President spends a lot of time golfing at his resort in  Bedminster, New Jersey. He knows many working class people in New  Jersey. He employs some of them. His proposal to eliminate the Federal  deduction for State and local taxes will hurt them dramatically.   Eliminating the Federal deduction for State and local taxes will take  money out of people's pockets and out of New Jersey to fund tax cuts  for the wealthy. That is just not going to work for the American  people. Eliminating the Federal deduction for State and local taxes  doesn't work for New Jersey, and it doesn't work for the American  people.   Nearly 2 million people in New Jersey take the deduction. That is  more than a third of the State's taxpayers. Most of them are from New  Jersey's lower and middle-income families. Getting rid of that  deduction means higher taxes for regular people.   So let's be clear. The Republican tax plan claims to be cutting  taxes, but in reality, it raises taxes on millions of New Jersey's  families and millions of other families nationwide.   The Federal deduction for State and local taxes is good for families.  It keeps them from paying twice on the same income. If you pay State  and local taxes on your hard-earned money, the Federal Government  should respect that. After all, State and local taxes pay for our  roads, our schools, our police, and all essential services we rely on  each and every day.    New Jersey already pays more to the Federal Government in taxes than  it receives in return. In fact, according to the Tax Policy Center, for  every dollar New Jersey pays to the Federal Government in taxes, we get  back only 77 cents. That is 77 cents on every dollar. The Trump-Ryan- McConnell tax plan is asking people from my State to send more to  Washington so the wealthiest 1 percent can get a tax cut. That is just  wrong.   When he unveiled his tax plan, President Trump claimed taxes are  something he is very good at. Yeah, protecting billionaires is all this  tax plan is good at.   Elected officials from both parties must continue to stand against  the Trump-Ryan-McConnell proposal and prevent billionaires' first tax  overhaul from crushing hardworking families.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    Absolutely. Absolutely.    And to your point, I appreciate you bringing this map out  to show these States that are subsidizing, and you are being very  generous in that statement, other States.   To have Members, over the past several weeks, come to the floor and  admonish New Jersey and say that we really don't need the deduction,  when--if I can tell, North Carolina is one of those States being  subsidized. It is disingenuous to come to the floor and critique this  plan when it is one of the only ways that people, citizens from New  Jersey have as a way to balance things out to some degree.   We all have to pay our fair share, but at some point in time New  Jerseyans would like to see a return on their investment as well.
