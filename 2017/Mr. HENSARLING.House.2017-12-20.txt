 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 657, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4015) to improve the quality of proxy advisory firms  for the protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the public  interest, by fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness,  and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4015, the Corporate  Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I thank the sponsor  of this legislation, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the  chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of our committee,  for offering this bill.   Each year, Mr. Speaker, public companies hold shareholder meetings  wherein shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other  significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval.   Mr. Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that,  before these annual shareholder meetings take place, public companies  must provide shareholders with proxy statements that include all  important facts about matters to be voted on at a shareholder meeting.  Many shareholders and investment advisers rely on information provided  by proxy advisory firms to guide their votes on these matters.   H.R. 4015 would enhance transparency in the shareholder proxy system  by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC, disclose  potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make their  methodologies public.   Mr. Speaker, this is a pure disclosure bill, nothing more, nothing  less. Proxy firms play an outsized role in the U.S. economy in shaping  corporate governance. They counsel pension plans, mutual funds, and  other institutional investors about how to vote the shares of  corporations that they own.   With respect to institutional investors, Mr. Speaker, the share of  institutional investor ownership was roughly 46 percent as recently as  1987, but today, that figure is more than 75 percent; in other words,  the volume of proxy votes for which investors are responsible has grown  into the billions.   In 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act  that requires an investment adviser to vote in  [[Page H10316]]  the best interest of their clients' own proxies. A series of SEC no- action letters give the investment adviser a fundamental safe harbor  from liability if they use a proxy adviser.   As a result, institutional investors have increasingly relied on  proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares.  However, regulators, market participants, and academic observers have  highlighted potential conflicts of interest that are inherent in the  business models and activities of proxy advisory firms.   The committee, for example, is aware of numerous instances whereby  the two largest proxy advisory firms have issued vote recommendations  to shareholders that include errors, misstatements of facts, and  incomplete analysis.   For example, in one instance, a company reported that, even though  the total shareholder return the company actually had generated for its  shareholders was 64 percent, a proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis,  erroneously reported this calculation to be 26 percent.   Another company reported that ISS erroneously reported that the  company's long-term cash awards will vest and pay out their maximum  opportunity in the event of a change in control. Well, this was  reported even though the company's plan had been amended and approved  by the shareholders years earlier in a manner that would pay out at  target upon change in control, and there are many other examples.   Some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been made without any  contact to the public company at all, and then these same proxy  advisory firms encourage companies to join their service in order to  have the privilege to ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations.  I suspect, for many people, this simply does not pass the smell test.   An industrial company told its shareholders, Mr. Speaker: ``ISS'  negative recommendation was based on flawed analysis of our  compensation programs that did not appropriately take into account the  significant declines in our CEO's pay in 2015 or the performance-based  nature of our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs.''   A pharmaceutical company responded to a proxy advisory firm's  recommendations with this statement: ``For the second year in a row,  Glass Lewis did not include its full pay for performance analysis in  this report. For shareholders who rely only on Glass Lewis materials to  make voting decisions, there is no discussion of the company's  industry-leading performance over this time period.''   Again, Mr. Speaker, there are many, many more examples like these.   So another concern that many people have, Mr. Speaker, is that the  two largest proxy advisory firms collectively--collectively--make up 97  percent of the proxy advisory industry--97 percent. This monopolization  and the lack of transparency regarding proxy advisory firms means that  the writings, analysis, reports, and voting recommendations of these  two firms have a disproportionate effect on fundamental corporate  transactions like mergers or acquisitions, the approval of corporate  directors, and shareholder proposals. In other words, these two firms  have a huge impact on our economy.   The bill of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) helps address  these concerns by setting up a new regulatory regime for proxy advisory  firms that looks out for the interest of investors, shareholders, by  ensuring they receive complete information through the proxy process  and can better vote in a manner consistent with shareholder interest as  opposed to the potential conflicted interest of a proxy firm.   Mr. Duffy's bill also helps ensure that shareholders and their  proxies have access to accurate information regarding companies by  allowing companies to provide input on proxy recommendations. This is  especially important for emerging growth companies that rely heavily on  investors.   A bad proxy recommendation in which emerging growth companies cannot  refute the recommendation can be devastating to those emerging growth  companies and, thus, have a harmful impact on our economy.   In a letter to our committee, the Biotechnology Innovation  Organization wrote: ``Small business innovators operate in a unique  industry that values a strong relationship with investors. Yet they are  often held to standards that are not applicable to their company and  forced to engage in proxy fights over issues that do not add value to  shareholders.''   H.R. 4015 would provide for SEC oversight of proxy advisory firms,  ensuring that they operate within appropriate boundaries and can be  held accountable to regulators and the public.   To be clear, Mr. Speaker, nothing in this bill permits companies to  rewrite a proxy firm's report or forces a proxy firm to change its  recommendation based on feedback received from the company.   In summary, H.R. 4015 will improve transparency in the proxy system  and enhance shareholder access to information by ensuring that proxy  advisory firms are registered with the SEC, disclose potential  conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make publicly available  their methodologies for forming proxy recommendations and analysis. For  every Member who believes in investor protection and supports a  healthier economy, they should support H.R. 4015.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, it is a historic day in America. Republicans deliver  historic tax relief for working Americans and small businesses.   The ranking member has articulated concern over burdensome  requirements. I look forward to working with her now on reducing the  burdensome requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services'  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), our Republican Conference whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.  [[Page H10321]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that, if the gentleman is so busy he can't read a 100-page proxy  statement, perhaps he could read a 20-page bill and he would realize  that his comments have almost absolutely nothing to do with the bill  whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Duffy), the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the  Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, while I was fascinated to hear so many of my friends on  the other side of the aisle exclaim how much they care about working  Americans, it just makes we wonder why now twice--twice--in the last 24  hours they have voted against giving the average working American a  $2,059 tax cut. Twice now they have voted to deny working Americans tax  relief in order to bolster their paychecks. I wonder about that.   I also wonder, as I listened to this litany of groups whose letters  were entered into the Record, how often I heard labor union; government  pension; Washington, D.C.; and special interest group.   What I didn't hear about is average working Americans who have their  investment in trying to save to buy a home, trying to perhaps fund a  small business, or send a kid to college. It is their interest that we  are trying to stand up for.   So what we know is that the SEC--the Securities and Exchange  Commission--have, for all intents and purposes, required investment  advisers to use one of two proxy advisory firms, one of which, as my  colleague, the author of the bill pointed out, is owned by a foreign  labor union. Yet the SEC requires us to use them.   So here is the radical nature of the bill: the bill, H.R. 4015,  simply says that we ought to have transparency--something apparently my  friends across the other side of the aisle are against.   We say they have to register with the SEC--something my friends on  the other side of the aisle are against.   They have to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Apparently my  friends on the other side are against that.   They have to disclose codes of ethics. Apparently my friends on the  other side of the aisle are against that, as well as making their  methodologies public.   This is a disclosure bill to help investors, pure and simple. We  ought to vote in favor of H.R. 4015.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully. I didn't hear  anything about labor union political campaign contributions, known  political allies of the Democratic Party.   This is yet one more assault on the First Amendment's freedom of  speech by my friends on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, it  ought to be rejected, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
