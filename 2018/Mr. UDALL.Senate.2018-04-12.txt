 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk a little  bit about Scott Pruitt and his administration over at the EPA as well  as the current pending nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be the  Environmental Protection Agency's Deputy Administrator.   The Environmental Protection Agency is in crisis. Scott Pruitt has  thrown the Agency into turmoil by gutting its mission to protect public  health and the environment and by violating ethics and the taxpayers'  trust. I believe Scott Pruitt must resign. Many of our colleagues have  said the same. Even the President is questioning whether Mr. Pruitt  should stay, and that is exactly why I am concerned that the Senate is  not giving the Deputy Administrator nominee the scrutiny he should  have. Andrew Wheeler could become the EPA Administrator if Scott Pruitt  is forced out or resigns. He should be vetted as if he were the  nominee--and there are many reasons to question whether he belongs at  the EPA at all.   Just like Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Wheeler has spent his entire political  career fighting EPA regulations that protect the environment and  protect public health. He has lobbied for many years on behalf of  polluters that the EPA regulates. The American people support clean air  and clean water. Mr. Wheeler is out of step with the values and  principles of the American taxpayers.   I know many Republicans who support environmental protection. We have  had many decades of bipartisan support for public health, environmental  protection, clean air, and clean water. Folks don't want their kids to  have toxic chemicals in their blood or in their bodies. So there is a  lot of support by Republicans in this area, and it has been a  bipartisan issue.   I call on my Republican friends to press the pause button on Andrew  Wheeler's nomination to be Deputy Administrator of the EPA. Let us join  together and demand that the President withdraw this nomination and  nominate someone who supports the basic mission of the EPA.   It is absolutely clear that Administrator Pruitt does not support the  mission of the EPA. In fact, as State Attorney General, he prided  himself in fighting everything EPA was doing and filing a number of  lawsuits against the EPA.   We need a person at EPA who respects science and understands that  climate change is here and now and must be addressed for the sake of  our children and grandchildren, a person who is not hostile to  environmental regulation in all forms, and a person who is not beholden  to special interests. We are supposed to act as a check on the  executive, so let's do our job.   When I mention climate change, one of the very first things that  Administrator Pruitt did when he got in was sabotage a climate change  website. That website had been in place for 10 years. It had been  bipartisan through several administrations. They were accumulating the  best knowledge from scientists in this country and the best knowledge  from scientists around the world to make it available to the public and  to make it available to scientists and their researchers.   When I asked Administrator Pruitt in front of the Appropriations  subcommittee, ``Now, you have taken this website down. When are you  going to put it back up,'' he said: ``Oh, we are just updating it. We  are just updating it,'' and we continue to ask the EPA.   Now, we are almost a year later--1 year later--and Scott Pruitt still  refuses to put the website back up. So we really know where he is  coming from on that issue.   When Scott Pruitt came before the Senate for confirmation, I voted  against him because I expected he would work to undermine environmental  health and protections. Mr. Pruitt has met and far exceeded my worst  expectations. He lobbied the President to leave the Paris Agreement.  The United States is now the only country in the world that is not a  signatory to the Paris Agreement.   Mr. Pruitt proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan, our Nation's best  effort to attack climate change. It is an important public health  measure too. The EPA estimated that the Clean Power Plan could prevent  2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks  in children.   Mr. Pruitt stopped a ban on chlorpyrifos, a dangerous neurotoxic  pesticide that EPA's own scientists say should be off the market  because it is linked to brain damage in young children. Chlorpyrifos is  an example where scientists--and this is what the EPA does--consult  with scientists outside the Agency, study within the Agency, and try to  come to conclusions with regard to public health. In the case of  chlorpyrifos, scientists were increasingly questioning whether it  should be out there as a pesticide, so they were restricting its use in  homes, they were restricting its use near schools, and finally they  decided this is such a dangerous neurotoxin and we should ban it  outright. So all the work had been done over 30 years.   Then, here it is, presented to the incoming Administrator--I would  bet any other Administrator in the history of our country would have  looked at the information, would have looked at what the science said,  and they would have banned the chemical. What has Scott Pruitt done?  Well, what he has done is, he has said we are going to take a look at  it for another 5 years. That is what he posted on his website. There is  no evidence that they are doing any review or anything. There is no  evidence that chlorpyrifos isn't dangerous and should be banned, but  that is the record he has at the Environmental Protection Agency.   He has also tried to suspend methane and smog regulations on oil and  gas wells. He tried to roll back mercury  [[Page S2099]]  pollution rules for powerplants, and he wants to delay rules to protect  against pesticide exposure and formaldehyde emissions. It is absolutely  clear, Mr. Pruitt's actions have not respected the rule of law and,  fortunately, they have been blocked by the courts.   Now, Mr. Wheeler's environmental record is not much better. It gives  no confidence that he will put health and safety first.   Mr. Wheeler has called the Paris climate agreement a ``sweetheart  deal'' for China.   He has fought limits on greenhouse gas emissions.   He is a longtime lobbyist for Murray Energy Corporation--one of the  dirtiest coal companies in the country--which also has a terrible  safety record. Murray Energy is the largest privately held coal company  in the Nation. That raises big questions about conflicts of interest.  The EPA is now moving to repeal the Clean Power Plan. It would be a big  win for Big Coal at the expense of the American people.   Mr. Wheeler opposed reducing poisonous mercury emissions from  powerplants--regulations Scott Pruitt wants to gut. In fact, I don't  see anything in Mr. Wheeler's background that indicates he will act as  our Nation's top environmental protector.   When Mr. Pruitt was confirmed, we knew he had no problem bending  ethics rules. His claim to fame in Oklahoma was currying favor with  moneyed interests and doing their bidding, but the number and extent of  Mr. Pruitt's ethical lapses might surprise even the most cynical.   The list of abuses grows daily: lavish first-class flights around the  world; swanky hotel stays; billing the taxpayers for his personal trips  home to Oklahoma; a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office;  taking 30 EPA enforcement officers away from investigating polluters to  serve as his round-the-clock personal security detail--something no  other EPA Administrator has done; speeding down the streets of  Washington with sirens and lights blaring to get to fancy restaurants;  huge, unauthorized salary increases for his friends; and he even  allowed a close aide to just not come to work for 3 months while still  getting paid by the taxpayers; detailing EPA staff to find him a place  to live. While he siphons hundreds of thousands of dollars off the  taxpayers for special perks for himself, he tries to slash millions of  dollars for health and safety programs for the American people.   Even his own staff has balked at his extravagances, and the  Administrator has met their resistance by retaliating against them,  changing their duties, sidelining them. Mr. Pruitt has treated the EPA  like his own little personal fiefdom, and EPA employees are like serfs  who cater to his whims.   Former EPA Administrator under President George W. Bush, Christine  Todd Whitman, recently called his spending ``absolutely ridiculous.''  That is what Christine Todd Whitman said, ``absolutely ridiculous.''  She charged that his conduct is part of ``an extraordinarily ethically  tone deaf administration.''   It is time for Scott Pruitt's imperial tenure to end. It is time for  him to resign and high time for the President to stop defending him and  to demand his resignation. But Mr. Pruitt should not be replaced by  someone who does not support the basic mission of the Agency--to  protect the environment and public health. That is what the EPA  Administrator should be focused on; it is absolutely clear.    The EPA's first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, a Nixon  appointee, has sounded warnings about what is going on at the EPA. He  said: ``My principal concern is that Pruitt and the people he's hired  to work with him don't fundamentally agree with the mission of the  agency.''   The American people value that mission. They want clean air and clean  water. They want the health of their children and our seniors  protected. It is our responsibility to make sure the EPA protects the  American people.   I urge my friends and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  do our job--to put the nomination of Andrew Wheeler on hold and to work  together to demand that the President nominate a Deputy Administrator  who will have the trust and confidence of the American people and to  work to keep their air and water clean and their families safe and  healthy.   There are a couple of articles that I think show what has been  happening over at the EPA.   This article says that ``nearly a year into the Trump administration,  mentions of climate change have been systemically removed, altered or  played down on websites across the federal government.'' As I said  earlier, they have taken down this huge, bipartisan project that was in  place for 10 years, gotten rid of it and claim they are updating it,  but they haven't done anything after a year.   The article goes on to quote a report by Environmental Data &  Governance Initiative: ``Removing information regarding climate from  federal websites does not affect the reality of climate change, but may  serve to obfuscate the subject and inject doubt regarding the  scientific consensus that climate change is happening and that it is  caused by human activity.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the January 10, 2018,  article by the New York Times be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 10, 2018]   How Much Has `Climate Change' Been Scrubbed From Federal Websites? A                                    Lot.                            (By Coral Davenport)         Washington.--Nearly a year into the Trump administration,       mentions of climate change have been systematically removed,       altered or played down on websites across the federal       government, according to a report made public Wednesday.        The findings of the report, by the Environmental Data and       Governance Initiative, an international coalition of       researchers and activist groups, are in keeping with the       policies of a president who has proudly pursued an agenda of       repealing environmental regulations, opening protected lands       and waters to oil and gas drilling, withdrawing the United       States from the Paris climate accord, shrinking the       boundaries of federal monuments, and appointing top officials       who have questioned or denied the established science of       human-caused climate change.        The authors of the study said that the removal of the words       ``climate change'' from government websites, and a widespread       effort to delete or bury information on climate change       programs, would quite likely have a detrimental impact.        ``We have found significant loss of public access to       information about climate change,'' the authors wrote.        ``Why are these federal agencies putting so much effort       into `science cleansing' instead of using time and resources       to fulfill agency responsibilities, such as protecting the       environment and advancing energy security?'' they wrote.       ``Removing information regarding climate change from federal       websites does not affect the reality of climate change, but       may serve to obfuscate the subject and inject doubt regarding       the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and       that it is caused by human activity.''        The report tracks the Environmental Protection Agency's       removal of hundreds of websites connected to state and local       climate change programs; the removal of information about       international climate change programs from the State       Department, Energy Department and E.P.A. websites; and the       deletion of the words ``climate change'' from websites       throughout the federal government.        In many cases, the report found, ``climate change'' was       replaced by vaguer terms such as ``sustainability.''        In a separate report, also made public Wednesday, the group       found that the Bureau of Land Management had deleted its       climate change website and removed text about the importance       of climate change mitigation from its main site.        The researchers took care to note that raw government data       on climate change, such as historical records of temperatures       and emissions levels, had not been deleted. However, Toly       Rinberg, a co-author of the report, said: ``The data is       certainly less accessible. Links to websites that host the       data have been removed. That data is still available online       but it's been made harder to find on the agency's websites.''        Trump administration officials have noted that it is the       administration's prerogative to highlight its agenda--      repealing climate change policies and promoting the       exploration of oil, gas and coal--on its websites. The Obama       administration sought to promote climate change policies and       elevate the issue in the public eye, but the Trump       administration is under no obligation to continue that       effort.        And some information about government programs related to       climate change, while no longer easily found on the main       federal agencies' websites, was still accessible. Liz Bowman,       a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in an email that pages       were ``archived and available'' on the agency's website.        But the report concluded that of all federal agencies, the       E.P.A.--the agency charged with protecting the nation's       environment and public health--had removed the most       information about climate change. An E.P.A.  [[Page S2100]]       website once titled ``Climate and Energy Resources for State,       Local and Tribal Governments,'' which included prominent       links to programs like ``Climate Showcase Communities,'' now       contains no mention of the term ``climate change'' and no       prominent links to state and local climate information.        The E.P.A. has also removed a website on the Clean Power       Plan, the Obama administration's signature climate change       regulation, which was designed to reduce planet-warming       pollution from power plants. The Trump administration has put       forth a legal plan to repeal that regulation, and part of       that process includes a public comment period. The new report       suggests that when people cannot easily find the original       rule on the E.P.A.'s website, they may be less likely to       submit comments against repealing it.        ``Beyond reducing access to actionable information,       removing public web resources can undermine democratic       institutions such as notice-and-comment rulemaking,'' the       report's authors wrote.     A September 27, 2017, article by Reuters with regard to  EPA workforce reductions describes EPA's workforce declining to levels  not seen in decades. The article says:         In June, the EPA unveiled a buyout program that would       contribute to the biggest cuts of any federal agency in       President Donald Trump's 2018 proposal. The EPA employs about       15,000 people.        After buyouts and retirements, that number could drop to       14,428 by October, the official, who spoke on condition of       anonymity, said in an email.        That would be below the fiscal 1988 level, when EPA       staffing was 14,440, the official noted.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 27, 2017,  article by Reuters with regard to EPA workforce reductions be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From Reuters, Sept. 27, 2017]                              (By Eric Walsh)       EPA Workforce Shrinking to Reagan-Era Levels--Agency Official         Washington.--The workforce at the U.S. Environmental       Protection Agency is on course to fall to its lowest level       since Ronald Reagan was president, an agency official said on       Tuesday.        In June, the EPA unveiled a buyout program that would       contribute to the biggest cuts of any federal agency in       President Donald Trump's 2018 budget proposal. The EPA       employs about 15,000 people.        After buyouts and retirements, that number could drop to       14,428 by October, the official, who spoke on condition of       anonymity, said in an email.        That would be below the fiscal 1988 level, when EPA       staffing was 14,440, the official noted. A further 2,998       employees, or just over 20 percent of the total, are eligible       to retire now, the official said.        In an April spending bill, the Republican-controlled       Congress set a cap for EPA staffing at 15,000 employees for       fiscal year 2017, rejecting proposed increases by the       previous administration of Democratic President Barack Obama.        EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the reductions were       ``giving long-serving, hard-working employees the opportunity       to retire early.        ``We're proud to report that we're reducing the size of       government, protecting taxpayer dollars and staying true to       our core mission of protecting the environment and American       jobs,'' he said in a separate statement.        Pruitt has rolled back a slew of Obama-era regulations       limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.        He was also instrumental in convincing Trump to withdraw       the United States from the Paris climate accord--a global       pact to stem planetary warming through emissions cuts.        While acknowledging the planet is warming, Pruitt has       questioned the gravity of the problem and the need for       regulations that require companies to take costly measures to       reduce their carbon footprint.        Before becoming head of the EPA, he was Oklahoma's attorney       general and repeatedly sued the agency he now runs to block       federal environmental rules.     So here we have an attempt by Administrator Pruitt to  emasculate the Agency by chasing off some of the best and brightest  scientists, buying out people, doing everything he can to intimidate  people to leave the Agency, and we are at a point in time where we have  a staffing level equivalent to 1988. This is the Agency that protects  our water and our air, makes sure the water and air are clean, and  protects our children from toxic chemicals. This is a pretty remarkable  record.   I ask my Republican colleagues to reconsider the Wheeler nomination,  to put a hold on it, to have the proper vetting, and let's find the  kind of individual who is going to respect the mission of the Agency  and move us forward in the direction of public health, protecting the  environment and our air and water.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
