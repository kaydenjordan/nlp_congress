 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Arol  Augsburger who will be retiring from his position as the president of  the Illinois College of Optometry, ICO, on June 30, 2018. During his  16-year tenure at the ICO, which is located on the near southside of  Chicago, the performance of the student body exceeded national  averages. This achievement showcases Dr. Augsburger's positive impact  on the college. In addition, ICO doubled its investable assets, and its  on-campus clinic was able to grow to accommodate over 110,000 visits  annually. This on-campus clinic, the Illinois Eye Institute, is the  largest safety net provider of eye and vision care in Illinois, and it  offers ICO students a unique opportunity for robust clinical training-- something that is not available at other institutions.   Prior to Dr. Augsburger's appointment at ICO in 2002, he served for  30 years in a variety of leadership positions in higher education. He  served as the interim provost of the University of Alabama at  Birmingham, UAB, dean and professor of the UAB School of Optometry, and  professor of clinical optometry at the Ohio State University College of  Optometry. Dr. Augsburger has also served as president of Association  of Schools and Colleges of Optometry, the National Board of Examiners  in Optometry and the Rotary Club of Chicago, Rotary 1, the world's  first Rotary Club and as the immediate-past chairman of the ROTARY/One  Foundation. Additionally, Dr. Augsburger served as the 2014-2015  chairman of the board of the Federation of Independent Illinois  Colleges and Universities, on the Near South Planning Board of Chicago,  and the Jackson Park Hospital Foundation Board. He was also on the  Special Medical Advisory Group of the U.S. Department of Veterans  Affairs.   In addition to being named Optometrist of the Year in three States,  Dr. Augsburger was named National Doctor of Optometry of the Year and a  Distinguished Service Award recipient by the American Optometric  Association. In June of 2014, he was inducted into the National  Optometry Hall of Fame.   I applaud Dr. Augsburger's commendable work as the president of ICO  and in the field of optometry. Students, patients, and Illinois  constituents have greatly benefited from his lifetime of commitment to  education and optometry.                            ____________________
