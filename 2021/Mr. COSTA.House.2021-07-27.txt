 Mr. Speaker, the time is now to make bolder investments in  our families, workers, and communities across the country.   For years, I have said that America is living off the investments our  parents and grandparents made a generation or two ago.   Bringing Federal dollars back to my home in California's San Joaquin  Valley is one of my highest priorities, as is the need to invest  throughout the country, throughout our Nation, for our future  infrastructure needs.   During this week, we will vote on new investments that will make a  difference in our communities and the residents who live there. From  water projects to funding jobs, healthcare and education programs, our  votes this week are to improve people's lives. Thus, in this budget  appropriations that we will be dealing with, these bills are critical  to pass and send to the Senate.   But our work doesn't end there. We must also pass transformative  infrastructure to build our roads, bridges, and transit systems and  modernize our schools and hospitals.    Rural and underserved communities in our country, many that I  represent, should never be left behind.   We also must expand and prioritize broadband access to these areas.  This pandemic has taught us a lot of things, like telemedicine and  tele-learning is difficult enough, but if you don't have access to  broadband, good luck.   Repairing our aging water infrastructure to ensure reliable access to  clean drinking water is critical for the richest Nation in the world.  We are suffering from extreme droughts in California. We need to make  these investments.  [[Page H3917]]    Also, access to quality healthcare is critically important. I have  introduced legislation to bring more doctors to underserved areas  around the country, like the San Joaquin Valley, by creating new  medical schools. Everyone, no matter who they are or where they live,  deserves access to quality healthcare.   These investments will make life better for Americans and will help  spur economic growth by creating millions of good-paying jobs. Guess  what? We need them.   The health and development of our communities and the economy depend  on infrastructure, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in building  back America's future better.   It is essential that, in the next few months, we pass the bipartisan  infrastructure package, the infrastructure bill and reconciliation  package, to bring this country together and to invest in the future.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated  public servant and a strong, strong advocate for students in my home of  Fresno, California, Carol Mills.   Carol Mills was passionate about everything she ever did. She was a  17-year trustee for the Fresno Unified School District, the third  largest school district in California, and spent every moment of that  time fighting for more and better opportunities for kids.   Early this year, Carol Mills was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.  We all know it is a terrible disease, yet she continued to work  throughout that courageous battle with Lou Gehrig's disease and served  on the Fresno Unified School Board. Why? Because that was Carol.   During my time in Congress, I got to know and see firsthand her  passion for helping students. Two months ago, I visited Carol at her  home. We recounted efforts in the past. We laughed. We shared the  challenges of the future because, over the years, she never lost sight  that our country's future comes first when we prioritize the education,  the quality education, of America's next generation. That is why Carol  made a difference in everything she ever did.   Our community and the students of Fresno Unified School District were  made better because of Carol Mills' passion and dedication to not only  her service but to the quality of their education and the future of  America.   She will be missed dearly by everyone who knew and loved her. My  thoughts and prayers go to the family during this very, very difficult  time.   Carol, we loved you. God bless.                            ____________________
