 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on Meeks amendment No. 30.   The facts are plain. Saudi Arabia and its partners have perpetuated a  catastrophic and devastating military campaign in Yemen since 2015,  with no end in sight and without regard to civilian casualties.   Saudi Arabia's brutal Yemen war has resulted in the world's largest  humanitarian crisis, pushed millions of Yemenis to starvation, and  decimated Yemen's civilian infrastructure.   Although the frequency and the intensity of the Saudi military's  bombing campaign has decreased as it has engaged in efforts to end the  war through international negotiations, unfortunately strikes resulting  in civilian casualties have continued.   Between January and March 2021, airstrike incidents causing civilian  casualties in Yemen actually increased as compared to the previous 3- month period at the end of 2020.   On one such strike on March 7, 2021, Saudi aircraft bombed the  residential areas in Sanaa for the first time in months, leaving four  civilians injured.   Later in March and into April, further strikes continued, striking  transportation infrastructure, residential areas, and a marketplace,  leaving dozens of civilians injured, including two children.   The Biden administration took the important step earlier this year of  suspending the deliveries of certain weapons to the Saudi military in  response to this pattern of actions, as well as appointing veteran  diplomat Tim Lenderking as Special Envoy to Yemen.   However, despite these actions and repeated congressional statements  and efforts, the Saudi air force has continued conducting strikes in  Yemen that have resulted in civilian casualties using U.S. support.   That is why I am introducing this amendment, with the support of  Representatives Deutch and Lieu and Chairmen Smith and Schiff, to  suspend U.S. sustainment and maintenance to Saudi air units conducting  strikes that result in Yemeni civilian casualties.   My amendment also requires a thorough set of reporting requirements  to Congress on the extent and details of Saudi offensive air operations  and civilian casualties.   It also includes exceptions for necessary counterterrorism operations  against al-Qaida and its affiliates, territorial air defense, and  defense of U.S. personnel and facilities.   Houthi militants and the Iranian military continue to launch  explosive-laden drones and ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia at  civilian areas and infrastructure, including many areas  [[Page H4941]]  where American civilians live and work.   While we seek to urgently address the tragic toll of civilian  casualties borne by Yemeni civilians as a result of the Saudi  military's expansive air campaign, we recognize that Saudi Arabia does  have a right and a need to defend itself, which this amendment provides  for.   In short, by suspending ongoing sustainment and maintenance of Saudi  aircraft shown to have conducted airstrikes resulting in civilian  casualties, we take a critical and necessary step to ensuring the  United States is not complicit in or supportive of this destructive,  tragic war.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle East,  North Africa and Global Counterterrorism of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.     I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600
