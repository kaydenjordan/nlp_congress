 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  birthday of Ms. Jackie Rowe-Adams and her inspirational life and  remarkable accomplishments.   Jackie suffered the devastating loss of not one but two sons to gun  violence in her Harlem neighborhood. Rather than succumb to her sorrow,  she turned her heartbreaking pain into a powerful purpose by founding  Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E., an organization dedicated to ending the  traumatic scourge of gun violence in this country.   Always dressed in brightly colored matching outfits, Jackie is a  fixture in her community, having served on multiple community boards,  as president of her school board, and on a number of other boards and  commissions. However, it is her dedication to her neighborhood's youth  and her activism in ending gun violence that has drawn the admiration  and respect of everyone in New York City.   It is an honor to know Jackie and a privilege to consider her a  friend, and it is an even greater honor to be able to share her  inspiring story here on the House floor. I wish her the happiest of  birthdays.                            ____________________
