 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the history and  the legacy of the Oberlin Village community.   Founded in 1866, Oberlin Village is one of the last surviving  antebellum settlements founded by free Black people in North Carolina.   After Reconstruction, the community became a welcoming refuge for  newly freed former slaves from the nearby Cameron plantation.   It became much more than a town. The thriving municipality was home  to rows of single-family houses, two churches, and a public school. It  became a symbol of land ownership for freedmen.   The local post office, now located in a building owned by the Oberlin  Baptist Church, is still named after the plantation rather than this  historic community. I urge the Postal Service to change the name to  reflect the post office's new location and to commemorate the Oberlin  Village community and its legacy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my amendment. My  amendment to the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act would help ensure women  have sufficient notice of the new protections afforded to them in this  bill.   By ensuring that eligible people are provided with sufficient  informational resources, more women will be able to exercise their  rights and the likelihood of employer defection will be reduced.   In many places in this country, including my home State of North  Carolina, it is easier to take a smoke break than for a mother to take  a pump break. This is simply unacceptable.   By passing the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, we can end this  discrimination against breastfeeding workers and guarantee that no  mother will have to choose between earning a living and feeding her  child.   But a law is only as effective as its enforcement, and we have  unfortunately witnessed countless occasions where businesses have  failed to inform workers of their rights. Just in this last year, the  Department of Labor investigated six businesses in North Carolina for  violations of breastfeeding rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.   My amendment would provide the necessary information to ensure these  workplace violations do not continue. We owe it to our nursing mothers,  their families, and our local communities to be vigilant about  overseeing the implementation of this law.   This is a gender equality issue, a labor rights issue, and an  economic justice issue that demands our attention.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the director of  La Leche and the National WIC Association.     Written Statement of Diane Thompson, Director of La Leche League  Alliance for Breastfeeding Education Before the United States House of                    Representatives--September 24, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Members of       the U.S. House of Representatives: La Leche League Alliance       for Breastfeeding Education submits this letter to the U.S.       House of Representatives in full support of the Providing       Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act       (H.R. 3110).        La Leche League Alliance for Breastfeeding Education (LLL       Alliance) is a division of La Leche League International in       the United States. While we receive our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt       status as a charitable organization through our association       with LLLI, we are a separately incorporated entity.        Representing over 1000 Leaders spread across 43 states, LLL       Alliance provides resources and support for La Leche League       Leaders and Area Administrators, as well as information and       support for parents.        La Leche League believes that breastfeeding, with its many       important physical and psychological advantages, is best for       baby and mother and is the ideal way to initiate good parent-      child relationships.        Breastfeeding is crucial to the health of both mothers and       babies. It provides protections and health benefits for far       longer than the duration of the breastfeeding relationship.       Why would the USA not want to encourage and support the       feeding of human milk? Some of the advantages include for       mothers: lower risk of breast cancer, lower risk of ovarian       cancer, lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and       less endometriosis. For children: fewer instances of       allergies, eczema, and asthma, fewer childhood cancers,       including leukemia and lymphomas, lower risk of type I and II       diabetes, fewer instances of Crohn's disease and colitis. See       the CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health       Organization.        We have Leaders and parents that are supported who are       denied the opportunity to pump at work because of the types       of jobs they have. Especially affected are teachers in the K-      12 system and nurses who are not currently covered. This can       have several effects. Mastitis caused by not pumping--these       leads to lost days at work and possibly the cessation of       breastfeeding. It is disappointing that those individuals who       do so much caretaking can be deprived of caretaking for their       own children.        Why would the PUMP act be helpful? Among other reasons it       would close the coverage gap. The bill would protect nearly 9       million employees excluded from the 2010 Break Time law by       extending the law's protections to cover salaried employees       as well as other categories of employees currently exempted       from protections.        It would provide employers clarity on when pumping time       must be paid and when it may be unpaid. The bill leaves in       place existing law protecting many salaried workers from       having their pay docked and clarifies that any time spent       pumping while the employee is also working, a common       occurrence for many employees, must be counted as hours       worked.        This is not a partisan issue--parents of any party benefit.        La Leche League Alliance for Breastfeeding Education urges       all members of Congress to vote in support because as stated       above it closes gaps in the current law. Individuals should       not have to choose between going to the bathroom or pumping.        Thank you for your consideration.      Diane Thompson,        Director, La Leche League Alliance for Breastfeeding       Education.                                   ____                                                 September 27, 2021.      Re National WIC Association Support for the Providing Urgent           Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R.           3110).         On behalf of the National WIC Association (NWA), the 12,000       service provider agencies we represent, and the approximately       6.3 million women, infants, and young children our members       serve, we write to express our strong support for the       Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing       Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). This legislation is a critical step       towards ensuring healthy child development and postpartum       health outcomes for working mothers served by WIC.        Because millions of nursing moms are in the workforce and       need protections to pump breastmilk, the PUMP for Nursing       Mothers Act is imperative for protecting the nation's       breastfeeding women, including WIC participants. The Dietary       Guidelines for Americans, based on longstanding       recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics,       promotes exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and       encourages ongoing breastfeeding as complementary foods are       introduced. More than half of mothers return to the paid       labor force before their children are three months old, with       as many as one in four returning within just two weeks of       giving birth. Many of these mothers choose to continue       breastfeeding well after their return to work to meet the       standards reiterated in the Dietary Guidelines--and those       employees need to express (or pump) breast milk on a regular       schedule.        The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,       Infants, and Children (WIC) is the nation's leading       breastfeeding promotion program, serving about 500,000       breastfeeding women with a combination of professional and       peer support. Over the last  [[Page H5811]]       two decades, WIC providers have worked to increase the rates       of breastfeeding initiation amongst women participating in       the program by 30%. As WIC works to address societal,       intergenerational, and historic barriers to breastfeeding,       employment protections are vital for the 15.2 million women       who live in households that earn less than 185% of the       federal poverty line.        According to the Surgeon General, breastfeeding protects       babies from illnesses like ear, skin, and respiratory       infections, diarrhea, and vomiting, as well as longer-term       conditions such as obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and       asthma. Mothers who breastfeed for the recommended duration       benefit, from lower risks of breast cancer, heart disease,       and other ailments. Higher breastfeeding rates in the United       States are associated with lower healthcare costs, with the       American Academy of Pediatrics projecting $13 billion in       health care savings if 90% of families in the United States       exclusively breastfed for six months.        Research indicates that significant breastfeeding       disparities are sustained by both income and race/ethnicity.       Lower-income women experience lower breastfeeding rates than       middle-higher income women. Furthermore, Black women       experience significantly lower breastfeeding rates than White       women and Latinas. Barriers to breastfeeding for these       vulnerable groups include family and social pressures, a       rapid return to work after delivery, lack of facilities to       breastfeed or pump in the workplace and in public, and       targeted marketing by the infant formula industry. In order       to further improve these rates, specifically amongst low-      income women and women of color, workplace barriers to       breastfeeding must be addressed.        Passed in 2010, the Break Time for Nursing Mothers       provision included in the Patient Protection and Affordable       Care Act, provided critical protections to ensure that       employees would have reasonable break time and a private       place to pump. Since the law was tied to language in the Fair       Labor Standards Act (FLSA), millions of nursing mothers were       left without an express statutory right to pump at work.       Without these protections, nursing mothers face serious       health consequences, including risk of painful illness and       infection, diminished milk supply, or inability to continue       breastfeeding. Employment is compatible with breastfeeding,       and solutions to support nursing mothers exist in all       industries. In fact, studies show that supporting nursing       mothers leads to lower employer health care costs,       absenteeism, and turnover, as well as improved morale, job       satisfaction, and productivity. Without protection, nursing       employees are likelier to face harassment, reduced wages, and       job loss.        The fact remains that nursing mothers are suffering       negative health consequences and being forced to choose       between breastfeeding and earning a paycheck. The PUMP for       Nursing Mothers Act would strengthen the 2010 Break Time law       by:                           Closing the coverage gap         The bill would protect nearly 9 million employees excluded       from the 2010 Break Time law by extending the law's       protections to cover salaried employees as well as other       categories of employees currently exempted from protections.       Unfortunately, the 2010 Break Time law's placement within the       part of FLSA that sets overtime meant that nearly 9 million       women--nearly one in four women of childbearing age--were       excluded from coverage and have no clear right to break time       and space to pump breast milk under federal law. Those left       unprotected include teachers, software engineers, and many       types of nurses, among numerous others. The categories of       employees excluded under FLSA predate the 2010 Break Time       law, and were created specifically with overtime exemptions       in mind. There is no principled reason why these working       mothers should be ineligible to receive break time and space       to pump breast milk under federal law. The PUMP for Nursing       Mothers Act fixes this harmful error.   Providing employers clarity on when pumping time must be paid and when                              it may be unpaid         The bill leaves in place existing law protecting many       salaried workers from having their pay docked, and clarifies       that any time spent pumping while the employee is also       working, a common occurrence for many employees, must be       counted as hours worked. Under the existing Break Time law,       breaks do not need to be paid unless they are concurrent with       paid breaks. The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act clarifies that       although the breaks taken under the law are typically unpaid,       if hourly workers are not actually relieved from duty while       pumping, then that time should be counted as hours worked.       The bill also specifies that it does not change existing       protections preventing employers from deducting compensation       from the salaries of employees who are exempt from receiving       overtime.                    Providing remedies for nursing mothers         The bill would ensure that nursing mothers have access to       remedies that are available for other violations of the FLSA,       bringing this law into alignment with other requirements that       are familiar to employers. Another unintended consequence of       the 2010 Break Time law's placement in the FLSA is that an       employee who is denied break time and space has no effective       remedy for the violation. An employer that violates the 2010       Break Time law can be ordered to pay the employee ``the       amount of their unpaid minimum wages,'' but violations of the       Break Time law typically do not involve unpaid wages. This       leaves those who are denied the ability to pump without any       meaningful way to enforce their rights, or to address the       negative health consequences (such as physical or emotional       suffering from infections or early termination of       breastfeeding) or financial harms (like unpaid leave or job       loss) that they may suffer. In light of the many exemptions       and the absence of an effective way to enforce the law's       requirements, it is no surprise that sixty percent of       breastfeeding employees still did not have access to break       time and space after the 2010 Break Time law was in effect.       The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act fills the gaps in the 2010       Break Time law so all breastfeeding employees receive the       full protections of the law.        The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act represents the next       critical step toward bringing federal legislation into       alignment with the nutrition and practical needs of our       nation's families and their employers. On behalf of WIC's       national network of lactation support professionals and the       mothers that we serve, we urge your support for this vital       legislation.            Sincerely,                                      The National WIC Association.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  my amendment and the bill. Both are essential for our working mothers,  for  [[Page H5812]]  our families, and for the health of the next generation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1015
