 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of Elaine Duke's  nomination to be the seventh Deputy Secretary for the Department of  Homeland Security.   The Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary serves as the  chief operating officer of the Federal Government's third largest  agency. The Deputy Secretary manages 240,000 men and women responsible  for securing our borders and aviation system, enforcing immigration  laws, defending cyberspace, preparing for disasters, assisting in  counterterrorism efforts, and preventing terrorist attacks. In short,  the Deputy Secretary is critically important to our homeland security.   On March 15, Ms. Duke was approved by the Senate Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs by a voice vote. She has  overwhelming bipartisan support.   I want to remind everyone of Ms. Duke's qualifications and,  particularly, of her dedication to public service through both  Republican and Democratic administrations. Ms. Duke is no stranger to  this body. In 2008, she was confirmed by a voice vote to be the  Department's Under Secretary for Management. As a testament to her  character and dedication, she was asked by President Obama to stay on  when he came into office. She served in the Obama administration for a  year and a half before retiring from Federal service. In total, Ms.  Duke has been a public servant for 28 years.   It is also noteworthy that Ms. Duke has been endorsed by at least the  last five Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretaries, from both  Democratic and Republican administrations. This is what they had to say  about her:         For this job, the Nation needs someone with impeccable       integrity, strong management and leadership skills and       experience in protecting the safety, security, and resilience       of our Nation. This person must be able to collaborate       routinely . . . and ensure that every Congressionally-      appropriated dollar is well and wisely spent.        Together, we respectfully attest that Elaine is       extraordinarily well qualified to serve in the position for       which she has now been nominated. Elaine knows DHS. She has       been a senior leader at DHS under two presidents. She sets an       unwavering standard of excellence for all who consider       themselves committed to public service.    As chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, I worked hard to move 30 of President Obama's nominees  through the committee on a bipartisan basis. I am pleased that we will  be sending to DHS a career public servant whose experience and  management skills will immediately assist Secretary Kelly and the  mission of the Department to defend our homeland.   For the sake of our national and homeland security, I encourage my  colleagues to support Ms. Duke's nomination to be the next Deputy  Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to use my remaining time to  voice my strong support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  Court. Let me stress that Judge Gorsuch won my vote when I first heard  his definition of the role of a judge. Let me quote:         It is the role of a judge to apply, not alter, the work of       the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome       he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results       he prefers rather than those the law demands.    That is the quintessential definition of the role of a judge. I met  with Judge Gorsuch last Tuesday morning, and in that meeting he further  reinforced my support. I asked Judge Gorsuch and voiced my concern that  far too often we have seen judges evolve into superlegislators-- judicial activists on the court. I asked the judge: How can I be  assured that won't happen with you? To paraphrase his response to me,  he said: Senator, I am going to follow the law; you will not like some  of my decisions.   That was music to my ears. I realize there is a lot of bad law, and  we have a judge who follows the law and applies it. Sometimes I am not  going to like those decisions, but that is OK. That is the role of a  judge.   He went on to say: I am not itching to be anything other than a good  judge. He further said that legislative power cannot be delegated.  Judge Gorsuch gave me a great deal of confidence that he is well  qualified and that he deserves to fill some pretty big shoes--Justice  Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court.   It is not just I who considers Judge Gorsuch well qualified. The ABA  has given Judge Gorsuch their ``well qualified'' rating, which is the  highest possible rating. Of course, Democratic Leader Schumer, in a  Washington Post article from March 18, 2001, said: ``The ABA'S  evaluation is the gold standard by which judicial candidates are  judged.''   Vice President Biden, back in 1994, talking about the ABA rating  system said:         I look at no other recommendation more closely. I value no       recommendation more highly.    So the ABA says Judge Gorsuch is highly qualified, and I agree. Judge  Gorsuch also has bipartisan support. I am heartened by the fact that  three of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have already voiced  their support for Judge Gorsuch. Of course, President Obama's Solicitor  General, Neal Katyal, also said:         Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant       judges to have served our Nation over the last century. As a       judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve       the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with       him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.       I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court.    Again, that is a quote from President Obama's Solicitor General. My  final comment has to do with the fact that this is the will of the  American people. In my lifetime, I really cannot remember when a  Presidential election elevated the issue of Supreme Court nominations  to as high a level as it was elevated in this election. As a matter of  fact, this election, point blank, elevated this particular vacancy.   So many of my Republican colleagues said exactly what I said: It is  so close to the election; so why don't we let the American people  decide not only the direction of this country but the composition of  the Supreme Court. The American people spoke. The voters in my State of  Wisconsin spoke. They voted for the 10 electoral votes in support of  President Trump, and they voted to elect me to confirm President  Trump's nominee to this Supreme Court vacancy.   I believe it is our duty to listen to the voices of the voters, the  American people, the voters of Wisconsin. I am hoping that my junior  Senator colleague from Wisconsin will listen to the voices of Wisconsin  voters and vote at least for cloture. Maybe you don't have to vote for  confirmation, but let's vote for cloture so this good, fine, decent,  humane, high-integrity, well-qualified judge--Judge Neil Gorsuch--will  be the next Supreme Court Justice of the United States.   I yield the floor.
