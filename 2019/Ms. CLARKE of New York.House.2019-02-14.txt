 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Black  History Month to honor a man who represents Brooklyn, New York, to the  fullest, a trailblazer, an innovator, and a cinematic genius:  Brooklyn's own Spike Lee.   On behalf of the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New  York, I would like to congratulate Spike Lee, a son of Brooklyn, on  receiving the first-ever best director Oscar nomination despite a more  than 30-year career in film.   He joins the ranks of only six other African Americans to ever be  nominated for the category.   Mr. Lee was raised in Brooklyn and attended Morehouse College, where  he received a bachelor of arts in mass communications. He received a  fine arts degree from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.   Many of Mr. Lee's films have examined race relations, colorism in the  Black community, and the role of the media in contemporary life and  political issues.   Spike has never ceased to speak out against injustice in the Black  community.   He has been outspoken on police brutality, environmental injustice,  and other issues that affect communities in Brooklyn and beyond.   His love of Brooklyn is reflected in his activism and his work.   Forty Acres and a Mule, Spike's production company, is based in  Brooklyn, contributing in part to the economy that keeps our city  running.   He shot films like ``Do the Right Thing'' and ``Crooklyn'' in  Brooklyn, allowing viewers to experience all that we know and love  about Brooklyn.   Spike Lee continues to produce work that pushes the envelope on  topics that need to be discussed. ``BlacKkKlansman,'' for which he is  being nominated, has received praise and adoration for its topics  around combating racism.                            ____________________
