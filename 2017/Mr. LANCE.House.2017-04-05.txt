 Mr. Speaker, I certainly commend the chairman of the  committee, Dr. Roe, for his leadership on this issue, as well as the  ranking member for his leadership.   I rise in strong support of S. 544, which will extend the Veterans  Access, Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act. This is an  important bill. I have heard from constituents in the congressional  district I serve that the Choice Program is working and Congress should  extend its authorization and its funding.   The Choice Program was the first step in a long road to true  transformation of the Veterans Administration. Veterans should get to  choose the care and the facility serving them best. No veteran should  ever been forced into waiting lines and other limitations.   Many Veterans Administration healthcare facilities do tremendous  work, like the Lyons VA Hospital in Bernards Township, Somerset County,  New Jersey, in the district I serve. But care through the VA should not  be limited to VA facilities.   The extension of the Choice Program should be a down payment on other  reforms. We should be expanding choice and eliminating geographic  limitations, and I hope to work with Chairman Roe and his committee to  do so.   Too many of our Nation's heroes have lost confidence in a desperately  broken bureaucracy, and we have begun to reform that in 2014, and we  continue today. Legislation like this bill is another step in restoring  that trust and faith.   The brave men and women who have stepped forward to serve our Nation  deserve our continued dedication to fixing the VA and ensuring they  receive the services they have earned in our defense.                                time  1430
