 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American  Rescue Plan, a bill that will deliver crucial relief to millions of  Americans who have been struggling for far too long.   The pandemic has caused economic uncertainty, hardship, and turmoil.  An estimated 8 million people have fallen into poverty during this  crisis making the need for relief even greater.   This bill includes an antipoverty measure I have fought for: An  expansion of the child tax credit. The expansion will provide increased  payments to help families pay bills and buy essentials. The expansions  in this bill are estimated to cut child poverty in half. This will  transform the lives of many families and children.   As chair of the New Democrat Coalition, I am working to make the  child tax credit permanent with Representatives DeLauro and Torres.  Democrats are united around our shared goal to rebuild the middle class  and make some of the biggest antipoverty reforms in a generation.   I welcome my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us.  Lifting children out of poverty should not be partisan.   The American Rescue Plan will get our economy back on track and crush  the virus. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this critical  legislation.
