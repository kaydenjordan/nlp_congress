 Mr. Speaker, I have grave concerns about the current  composition of the Intelligence Committee. The Intel Committee handles  our Nation's highest secrets. It has access to information that most  Members do not see. And unlike standing committees, Members of the  majority are appointed by the Speaker only.   That is why Members who are appointed to this important committee  must possess the highest level of credibility and character, and it is  why no Member should be compromised in any way.   Unfortunately, information that I have seen and that others have seen  suggests that not all Members meet this high standard. So earlier this  week, I introduced a resolution to restore confidence in the Intel  Committee's ability to safeguard our Nation's secrets.   Now, I do not take this action lightly or for political reasons.  Frankly, I am surprised that it had to come to this. The Speaker and I  received the same classified briefing from the FBI. The details  were deeply disturbing. Yet, so far, the allegations, which have not  been denied, have gone unaddressed.    As the House considers this question, I hope all Members will reflect  on the purpose and responsibilities of the select panel. I want all  Members to ask this one question:   Should a Member who can't get a security clearance in the private  sector sit on the House Intelligence Committee?   Think about that for one moment.   Should a Member who cannot get a security clearance in the private  sector sit on the House Intelligence Committee?   The American people deserve to know that their government is not  vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, by adopting my resolution, we will show that we have our  priorities straight. I urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican leader of the  Judiciary for yielding. He is correct that when the Republicans were in  the majority, they brought two bills to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the gentleman and others, and  even the majority leader, that not one Democrat voted for either of  those bills. Not one Democrat voted for a bill to move to the Senate.  They actually denied the bill from going to the Senate, even if you  wanted to change it to become law. That is just a little truth in  history.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to say something that President Biden refuses  to say. There is a crisis on our southern border. It is a humanitarian  crisis. It is a public health crisis, a national security crisis. It is  a Biden border crisis, and it is spiraling out of control with no signs  of ending.   When candidate Biden told migrants in June to immediately surge to  the border, I knew his immigration policies would be bad. But I did not  think it would be this bad. I did not think that would mean 13,000  unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody.   I did not think it would mean moving them from border facilities  across the country: 1,000 of them went to Midland Texas; 3,000 to  Dallas; and, likely, to more cities tomorrow.   I did not think the Biden administration would require COVID tests  for American citizens entering the country, but not for illegal  immigrants.   I did not think Biden's own DHS Secretary would have to admit that we  are ``on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border  than we have in the last 20 years,'' Mr. Speaker.   I did not think I would hear the President of Mexico refer to our  President Joe Biden as the ``migrant President.''   And I did not think it would only take 2 months to create the worst  border crisis in the history of America.   But, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what happened. When  I visited the border on Monday, one thing was abundantly clear: This  crisis started at midnight on January 20.   Mr. Speaker, it started when President Biden stopped building the  wall, even though there are only a few miles left to complete. When he  made that decision, he had to pay more money to the contractors to  break the contract. It started when he promised to make all 11 million  illegal immigrants citizens.   Now, my colleague from Florida (Mr. Gimenez) spoke with a family from  Honduras about their journey to the border. He asked them how long the  trek was. They said it was 22 days. The story of this family is a story  we have heard from many and it is not unique.   You see, thousands decided to cross the border now because of  President Biden's promises and policies. They listened to him in June  when he said: You need to surge the border.   As one migrant family recently told FOX News: Yes, I listened to the  news that they were letting people in.   When I was there Monday, I was speaking to the border agents, the  American citizens, and the migrants. The number one thing was clear:  the crisis at the border is the worst they have ever seen.   When we went to El Paso, we toured the new processing facility. We  built it under the last administration. It is huge, 98,000 square feet.  And when I asked the chief patrol agent, Chief Chavez said: We built it  so large with capacity, we didn't believe it could ever meet capacity.   But that day we marked history. That day they hit capacity: 1,040  people, mostly children unaccompanied.   You know what it meant when you hit capacity?   That meant 120 border agents got pulled off the border to protect us  to go into the center. That is what a crisis looks like, even if the  administration won't say it.   We also saw overworked Border Patrol agents in the El Paso facility.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank them. What they are being asked to do is  extraordinary: the pressure on them, the pressure from the  administration not to allow press to see what is happening; the  pressure of being over capacity with the number of people there; the  pressure to do it under a pandemic. That is what a crisis looks like.   When we sat and talked to the doctor from the medical unit, he told  us that approximately 10 percent of every immigrant has COVID, but they  are not tested. You see, that is only for American citizens when they  reenter. But they are not tested and they are sent to other cities.   And, as many of you know here, you could be tested and you are  positive, but the person you have been standing around, put into one  unit for a number of days, sleeping very close next to, after you have  interacted the entire time in one unit, a closed unit, that you will  become positive in the next 5 days. But that is okay because you will  be shipped to another city. But that city has been trying to combat  this pandemic. Who knows what happens next.   And the most alarming, Mr. Speaker, was when we were briefed in  Monument Three in El Paso. They told us that they caught people on the  terrorist watch list. I know that the Speaker would be concerned about  that. I was alarmed. I questioned further. It is not just people on the  terrorist watch list. We found people from other nations, from Iran,  from Turkey.   Mr. Speaker, when I went to the press conference right after that, I  mentioned that because I think every American--one terrorist is too  much in this Nation that could get through. I believe, Mr. Speaker,  that you believe that, too.   But Congressman Gallego, the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Intelligence and Special Operations--and  [[Page H1517]]  he also represents a border State--I thought he would tweet arm-in-arm  to stop this.   But you know what the gentleman said, Mr. Speaker?   He tweeted on Monday that I was ``either lying or I was wrong''  because he hadn't heard anything about it. I believe he even challenged  me because he had such high clearance because he is on Intel.   And Congresswoman Escobar, who represents part of El Paso, I thought  the gentlewoman would be very concerned, too, because this is where  they are entering, where they caught these people on a terrorist watch  list. Not everybody gets put on one. Mr. Speaker, what she said was  that I was trying to ``fuel the division'' because I just said that a  terrorist was caught coming through.   But, on Tuesday, Axios confirmed that four people matching terrorist  watch lists were arrested at the border, three from Yemen and one from  Serbia.    Biden's DHS Secretary also confirmed that this indeed happened. I am  not sure if their Twitter account is down or if they have been blocked,  but I have not heard an apology or a correction. I know Twitter does  that to Members of Congress, but I hope they are back on and I will  soon get the apology or the acknowledgment of a correction and the  respect.   If Members with security clearance haven't heard about the terrorist  threats on the border, I suggest they pay closer attention to the  classified briefings.   Mr. Speaker, the responsibility for this crisis rests squarely on the  shoulders of President Biden. After weeks of claiming they could handle  it, his administration is now attempting to blame the growing crisis on  the previous President. But nothing could be further from the truth.  Words and actions have meanings, and Biden has sent the message that  our border is open.   So there is no question that President Biden provoked the problem.  The question is: How can we stop it?   Mr. Speaker, when I was there in El Paso, 150 miles of the wall was  supposed to be built. But at midnight on January 20, 133 miles had been  finished. Instead of finishing the project, they stopped. You could go  to the ranch where they took down the old barrier because they were  going to put up the new wall, and there is nothing there. It is not  just people coming across illegally, but animals move back and forth.   So far, the Biden administration congressional Democrats aren't  providing any solutions. Mr. Speaker, we want to solve this problem.  That is why I sent a letter to the President 2 weeks ago to sit down.  When the President said immigrants should surge to the border, we  understood what he meant. So all those who were seeking asylum  automatically got in, COVID or not, no tests required.                                time  1315    We saw that the Biden administration told migrants: We aren't saying  don't come; just don't come now. You see, that was from the Secretary.  Those are really strong words.   But, Mr. Speaker, what moved me the most was speaking to border  agents, one who was a father, and one that was a mother, talking about  the unaccompanied children. He told me a story of coming upon children,  a one-year-old, a three-year-old, and a five-year-old all holding  hands. No one in sight for miles away. It is remarkable that they got  there.   But the question is: How many didn't make it? How many lives have  been lost or abused, simply because they heard a message, or you  stopped the PACR program, or you changed from ``remain in Mexico,'' or  you stopped finishing the wall that was almost complete?   Mr. Speaker, those who defend the border told me that they have never  seen so much fentanyl as they have in the last month. They have never  seen the tactics that were used of storming the wall all at once. Just  in this one small section, if you looked--it would just go a number of  blocks--100 to 200 people a night are apprehended.   We saw last week, with the Democrat's so-called COVID relief bill,  $22 billion in healthcare subsidies that illegal immigrants are  eligible for, another clear message. But zero dollars are dedicated to  helping the men and women patrolling the border.   Mr. Speaker, they need the help. They are stretched so thin. They are  stretched so thin, in the middle of COVID, where they are dealing with  something where they are not even testing for COVID but they have to  interact.   This new facility, 98,000 square feet, is a beautiful facility. It  has already met capacity for the first time in history with the new  administration. But if you look across into the parking lot, the dirt  parking lot, where the border agents have to park, they were moving  their cars. They had to put up tents, because the surge is so great.  You see, they listened to the words of candidate Biden and they watched  the actions of President Biden.   But there is no new money. I know that COVID bill was the--well, we  shouldn't call it COVID. It is less than 9 percent for COVID. But, Mr.  Speaker, do you realize in that bill, prisoners will get more money  than the Border Patrol? Do you realize that they are going to have to  use their own operation money that is stretched so thin? So not only  can the Border Patrol not be on the border, now they are taking any  money for the future to deal with the surge today.   The American people deserve leaders who will work with the  seriousness of purpose, what this crisis requires. That is why I wrote  a letter to President Biden 2 weeks ago asking to meet about the  crisis. Since then, the crisis has only gotten worse, but,  unfortunately, the President still hasn't responded. Today, I sent  President Biden a second letter offering to relay what we learned at  the border, since he refuses to go there. But I believe he would  benefit from a hearing of what we saw and heard.   Mr. Speaker, if the President won't go there and the President puts  orders to deny the press from learning so the American people can't  know, I think it would behoove him to hear from the people who are  there.   I also introduced five solutions based on the information from our  trip. All of them are rooted in the basic idea that we are both a  Nation of immigrants and a Nation of laws.   Mr. Speaker, I know you are proud of your heritage, and I am proud of  mine, like every single American. I know how many of us come from  immigrant families. I know when you walk into my office, where you have  been, Mr. Speaker, you look on my wall and you will see the documents  from Ellis Island. April 23 of this year will mark the 100th  anniversary of my grandfather, Guido Palladino, coming from Italy as a  young child, boarding a ship to come here for a better life.   You see, America believes in immigration, but there is no time to  break the law and come illegally. There is a process to come here.   If we implement now these commonsense solutions, it will help to stop  the border crisis.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the Biden border crisis is a  humanitarian, health, and national security crisis, and it is  deteriorating quickly.   To protect our citizens from further harm, our Government must send a  clear and united message to the citizens of Mexico and Central America.  That message is simple: There is never a right time to break the law  and enter the United States illegally.   The time for delay, denial, and distraction is over.   Mr. Speaker, I know you care about this issue. I know you care about  what is happening at the border. Mr. Speaker, I ask you, convey that to  the President. If he cares as much as you, he will travel there. I know  it is tough to travel, but when you have Air Force One--and I know he  has got a schedule--it is not far to fly to the border. His own  Secretary has said this is the worst it has been in 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, there is not one law that has passed here that created  that crisis.   Mr. Speaker, to all your constituents and all of those in America,  there are terrorists who have been caught; there are children walking  in the desert by themselves; there are cartels making a fortune off the  parts and disadvantaging of America.   We are in the middle of a pandemic where people are not being tested  but shipped to other cities. This isn't political, Mr. Speaker. This is  about this Nation. Join with us on our letter. Let's solve this problem  together.  [[Page H1518]]         Madam Speaker, I rise to raise a question of the  privileges of the House, and I offer a resolution (H. Res. 243)  removing a certain Member from a certain committee of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
