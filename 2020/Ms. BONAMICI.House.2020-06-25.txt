 Mr. Speaker, Black lives matter. I rise in strong  support of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Black people in this country have been fighting for centuries for  freedom, equality, and justice under the law. The senseless death of  George Floyd is the latest tragic example of how, too often, the Black  community is targeted rather than supported by law enforcement.   In Oregon and around the country, people from all backgrounds are  demanding change, and the bill before us today answers their call. It  bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants, overturns the existing qualified  immunity doctrine, creates a public national police misconduct  registry, and increases accountability and oversight of Federal, State,  and local law enforcement.   The bill cannot bring back George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or the  countless others who have been killed or mistreated by the very  individuals who swore an oath to protect them, but we can honor their  memory today by passing this legislation to prevent these abuses going  forward.   I thank Chairwoman Bass for her leadership.
