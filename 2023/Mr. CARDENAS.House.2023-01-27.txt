 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn Azerbaijan's  ongoing blockade of the Lachin Corridor.   For more than 6 weeks, under the guise of an environmental protest,  Azerbaijan has conducted a blockade of the Lachin Corridor, the only  road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.   The blockade has left thousands of people without access to critical  medical supplies, food, and essential goods.   This is needless and malicious and is part of a larger pattern of  violence by the Azerbaijani regime against the people of Armenia and  Nagorno-Karabakh.   I urge the administration to use every tool at its disposal to ensure  the safety of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh and put an end to this  needless and violent blockade.   We must provide direct humanitarian assistance through this  administration and every Member of Congress so that we can help the  people who are suffering through this atrocity.                            ____________________
