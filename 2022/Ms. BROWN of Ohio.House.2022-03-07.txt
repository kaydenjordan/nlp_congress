 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Candice  Eberhardt, who recently made history by becoming the first Black woman  to lead the Akron-Cleveland Association of Realtors, also known as  ACAR, across its 100-year existence.   Throughout her 20 years in realty, Ms. Eberhardt has held many  titles: youngest minority real estate broker in Akron, emerging leader,  and entrepreneur. Now, she adds one more: glass ceiling breaker.   I am most grateful for the ways Ms. Eberhardt gives back to our  community. She helps to develop young agents. She speaks to community  groups about homeownership. She has held key roles in local government.  She serves as the Akron NAACP housing chair, and she mentors high  school students.   Through her impressive career and considerable contributions, Ms.  Eberhardt has paved a path that more Black women in northeast Ohio will  follow. I would like to congratulate Ms. Eberhardt on her new role and  thank her for serving as a trailblazer, a change-maker, and a role  model in northeast Ohio.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and also the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres) for hosting this Special Order hour. I would like to thank my  sister Chair Beatty and all my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues  for their continued work to shine a spotlight on racial health  disparities.   Dr. Martin Luther King once said, ``Of all the forms of inequality,  injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.'' Madam  Speaker, what was true in Dr. King's time continues to be true in our  own. Communities of color have long experienced inadequate access to  healthcare, housing, healthy food, and economic opportunity.   These inequalities independently, and working together, increase the  prevalence of a host of dangerous health conditions, including  diabetes, asthma, obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure.   One of the most shocking examples of health inequity is our Nation's  maternal and infant mortality crisis. Infants born to Black mothers are  nearly twice as likely to die compared to those born to White mothers.  Continuing after birth, minority Americans face far higher rates of  illness and death from an array of conditions.   And what does this lead to, you might ask? Well, I am glad you did.  Black Americans have a life expectancy that is 4 years--I repeat, 4  years--shorter than White Americans.   The COVID pandemic's disproportionate impact on minority Americans  exacerbated and exposed these disparities and the underlying  inequalities driving them. Black and Brown Americans have faced far  higher rates of hospitalization and death during the pandemic, and a  growing body of research confirms what we have suspected--no, what we  have known, what we have known for years--and that is there is an  undeniable link between historical racism and the present-day medical  health problems Black Americans face.   Health disparities that disproportionately impact Black Americans,  from heart disease to maternal and infant mortality, are not merely an  aberration. No, they are a direct result of structural, systemic, and  institutional racism that has been passed down from generation to  generation.   To build a healthier America for all, we must address the  generational injustices that drive the racial inequities we continue to  see today. That is why I was proud to declare racism as a public health  crisis as a county council member, and that is why I am proud to work  today with my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues to improve health  outcomes for minority Americans and to address injustice in healthcare  and throughout our society.   As Dr. King said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere. That is our power and our message.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  my friend.                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Payne for those  remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
