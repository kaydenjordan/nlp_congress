 Mr. Speaker, last night President Biden tried to paint his  administration in a positive light during the State of the Union  address, but the American people know better.   We are facing an unprecedented number of crises: an economic crisis,  a border crisis, a crime crisis, an energy crisis, and an unprecedented  national security crisis. Every one of these crises have been either  created or made worse by President Biden and congressional Democrats.   Simply put, Democrats own these crises, but I am sure--and we did  see--an attempt by President Biden to dress up these disasters and  highlight victories that simply don't exist.   While President Biden tries to take credit for accomplishments he had  no responsibility in delivering, House Republicans remain committed to  showcasing to the American people what we stand for: unleashing  American energy independence, peace through strength, respecting the  Constitution, putting power back in the hands of parents, lowering  taxes, balancing budgets, and securing our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, if given the opportunity, Republicans will lead on these  issues, and I look forward to delivering on the day that that happens.                             Support for Ukraine     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to the  people of Ukraine. All Americans stand in solidarity against Russian  aggression, and we pray for peace.   However, as the conflict escalates and we call for not one more drop  of Russian oil to be imported into this Nation, the United States must  make energy independence a priority.   Prior to the invasion, gas here at home was already 40 percent higher  than it was 12 months ago, marking an 8-year high. Now, as the world  sanctions Russia, prices are climbing yet again, and experts predict  Americans could soon be paying more than $5 for a gallon of gas.   In response, the President announced that he is releasing 30 million  barrels from the U.S. strategic oil reserves. It sounds great, but  considering the United States uses more than 20 million barrels a day,  this is nothing more than a gimmick. A day-and-a-half worth of oil is  not going to reduce costs for American businesses, workers, and  families in my district.   There must be a comprehensive plan that leads us back to the energy  independence we enjoyed during the Trump administration, and it starts  with lifting the President's moratorium on new oil and gas drilling on  public lands, exploring in ANWR and off our coasts, and finishing the  Keystone XL pipeline.                                time  1030                Recognizing the Cave Spring Cheerleading Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the student  athletes on the Cave Spring High School cheerleading team in Roanoke,  Virginia, for winning its division's State championship toward the end  of last year. The Knights cheerleading squad is often referred to as a  dynasty, and this victory marks the team's fourth State title in 9  years--and in those other 5 years they placed second each time.   The team had to overcome several obstacles this season, but through  it all they persevered. Cave Spring senior cheerleader, Abby Holbrook,  said it best when she said: ``We work so hard during the season, and it  feels like all the hard work is paying off.''   Yes, Abby's hard work certainly did pay off. With the graduating  class of 2022 having won the title their freshman and senior years,  they are proud of the legacy they leave behind, and rightly so.   Congratulations to Cave Spring on this accomplishment, and I wish  them the best of luck again next season.                            ____________________
