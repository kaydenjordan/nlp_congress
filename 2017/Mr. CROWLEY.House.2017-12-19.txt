 Mr. Speaker, the Republican bill is unaffordable, with a  $2.3 trillion price tag.   It is inequitable, costing working families more, while cutting taxes  by $200,000 for the top 0.1 percent.   It is a scam, and the American people know it.   Is this bill about helping people who are living paycheck to  paycheck?   Hell no.   Is this bill going to bring back jobs and lift up the middle class?   Hell no.   Is this bill going to make life better for cops, firefighters,  nurses, truck drivers, students, veterans, teachers, and shift workers?   Hell no.   Do you know who this bill is going to help?   Corporate special interests, the wealthiest Americans, and, yes, the  Trump family.   My colleagues, if it looks like a scam, quacks like a scam, it is a  scam.   Can you vote for this bill with a clear conscience?   Hell no, you can't.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to observe proper  decorum in debate.
