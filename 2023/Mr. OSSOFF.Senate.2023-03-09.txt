 Madam President, I rise to honor a titan in  Atlanta's media industry, someone whose name--and voice--are a staple  of everyone's morning routine.   Scott Slade began his storied career at WSB Radio in 1984 on an  overnight music show. In 1991, he took over as host of ``Atlanta's  Morning News,'' becoming the longest running host in the Atlanta  market. Last month, Slade announced he would step aside from daily  hosting duties of ``Atlanta Morning News.''   Slade's service to the community extends beyond his duties on air as  a trusted voice for news. In 2000, Slade started the WSB Radio ``Care- a-Thon'' for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's Cancer Center, helping  raise millions of dollars to fight childhood cancer and blood  disorders. Slade's voice and journalism has informed Georgians for  decades, and we are all grateful to him.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Scott Slade on his  historic career and on his induction into the Georgia Association of  Broadcasters Hall of Fame on March 15, 2023.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to commend and recognize  Tina Tyus-Shaw on her induction into the Georgia Association of  Broadcasters Hall of Fame.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S740, March 9, 2023, the following appears: I rise to  commend and recognize Tina Titus-Shaw on her introduction into the  Georgia Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame      The online Record has been corrected to read: I rise to commend  and recognize Tina Tyus-Shaw on her induction into the Georgia  Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Born in Griffin, GA, Tyus-Shaw knew she wanted to be a journalist  from an early age.
