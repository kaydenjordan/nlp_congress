 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for yielding.   Today I affirm that pro-life is also pro-science. Advances in  science, especially ultrasound technology in medicine, make this clear,  not just to parents, but to anyone who will see the live baby human  growing inside a mother's womb; that we are talking not about a clump  of cells as some like to refer to them, but indeed a baby human. As a  result, the country is becoming increasingly pro-life.   Every single life has purpose and dignity. As Pope John Paul, II,  stated:         Human life has dignity not because of the work people do,       but because it is imprinted with God's image.                                time  1445    This week, I am proud to welcome pro-life leaders and friends from  Ohio's Eighth District traveling to Washington, D.C., for the March for  Life.   Today, we look forward to the day when Americans will contritely turn  away from abortion, perhaps as vigorously as they have rejected the  abhorrent etiology that led to the three-fifth compromise.   Knowing women who have experienced abortion, I also hope that  everyone will show kindness and mercy to those who wrestle with the  enduring trauma with repentance. May God have mercy on them and on all  of us.
