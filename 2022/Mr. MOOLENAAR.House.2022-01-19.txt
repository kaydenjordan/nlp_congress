 Madam Speaker, over this past weekend, the Democratic  Party in my home State published a graphic saying public schools do not  exist to serve the parents of those students and, rightfully, there was  an outcry before they took it down and disavowed what they posted.   Parents absolutely have the right to know what their kids are  learning, and over the past year and a half they have been fighting  back against administrators and unions who have kept students out of  the classroom.   When public school teachers in Chicago went on strike earlier this  month, the phones rang off the hook at the city's private schools as  parents finally had enough and searched for classroom opportunities for  their kids.   Support for parental involvement in education and for school choice  has risen over the past year, and my colleagues and I will soon be  introducing a resolution to honor National School Choice Week that will  be next week, from January 23 through January 29.   Parents and students should be given every opportunity to find a  classroom where the kids can attend in person, see their friends, and  learn directly from a teacher.
