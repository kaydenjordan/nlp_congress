 Mr. Speaker, for months I had calls coming into my office  about delays in the U.S. mail. Some of these delays had to do with cold  weather, some are because of COVID, but most are the direct result  [[Page H703]]  of the failures and slowdowns deliberately imposed by Postmaster DeJoy.  His efforts to eliminate overtime, close mail processing facilities,  and remove mail sorting machines have taken all of the cushion out of  the system.   Our postal workers are demoralized, they are seeing mail pile up as  they are blamed for the delays. Seniors have gone for days waiting for  medications. Constituents and local mayors are sounding the alarm.   The truth is that our Postal Service has survived this assault from  its own leadership, only because those letter carriers and mail  handlers have doubled down in spite of the challenges through rain,  through sleet, and snow. And, yet, DeJoy has failed them. He has failed  the American people.   He has not failed by accident. He has a mission to weaken and  ultimately privatize the post office to make people who depend on the  Postal Service angry enough to finish the destruction that he has  started. He hasn't succeeded yet. But every day he stays in office is  another day closer to him realizing that goal. The Postal Service needs  a leader who is committed to public service. DeJoy must go.                            ____________________
