 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Lucy Greene, who was awarded the W. Parker Greene Legacy Award on  September 16, 2019.   Dr. Greene, along with her late husband, Parker Greene, were staunch  advocates for Moody Air Force Base for the last 40 years. During this  time, the pair and their advocacy could not have been more important to  the First Congressional District of Georgia.   They have been referred to as our region's civilian secret weapons in  keeping Moody Air Force Base open and viable. Making relationships with  generals at the Department of Defense, they kept Moody Air Force Base  off the list for base closures. In turn, they kept the Valdosta  community churning.   But on her own, Dr. Lucy Greene was critical in supporting the airmen  at the base. She taught courses for airmen who had children with  developmental disorders. She even handed out fabric softener sheets so  the airmen could keep the sand gnats away.   Congratulations on your award, Dr. Greene. You deserve it.                            ____________________
