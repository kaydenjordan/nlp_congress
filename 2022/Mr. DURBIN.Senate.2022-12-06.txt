 I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Georgia  (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), the Senator from  Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Frances Kay Behm to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern  District of Michigan. She is a highly experienced jurist who will serve  with distinction on the Federal bench. Judge Behm graduated summa cum  laude from Albion College and earned her J.D. from the University of  Michigan Law School. After law school, she spent more than a decade in  private practice, representing a broad range of clients in business  litigation, transactional matters, and probate proceedings, as well as  preparing estate planning documents.   In 2009, then-Governor Jennifer Granholm appointed Judge Behm to  serve as a judge for the Genesee County, MI, circuit and probate  courts. On the bench, she has presided over a wide range of cases-- including criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate matters. As a family  court judge, Judge Behm has presided over approximately 1,600 bench  trials and three jury trials. Since 2019, she has presided over 16  bench trials and 18 jury trials on the general/civil/criminal division/ business court.   Judge Behm has the strong support of her home State Senators, Ms.  Stabenow and Mr. Peters. In addition, she received a unanimous rating  of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association. I am proud to  support Judge Behm's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do so as  well.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), the Senator from  Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 376 Ex.]                                  YEAS--49       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--4       Hickenlooper      Kelly      Murphy      Warnock   The nomination was confirmed.

Madam President, I know that Senator Roy Blunt has  already delivered his farewell remarks a short time ago. Regrettably, I  was tied up in a longstanding appointment and couldn't be on the floor  to hear them, but I want to say a few words about my friend from  Missouri and thank him for his service to the Senate and to our Nation.   I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, just across the Mississippi River  from St. Louis, MO. My hometown now is Springfield, IL, and Roy Blunt's  hometown is Springfield, MO. We often joke about catching the wrong  plane to St. Louis and ending up in one another's homes.   Senator Blunt and I came from different parties, obviously. We have  different ideas about a lot of things. But over the 12 years he served  his State of Missouri in the Senate, he has become a friend and ally.   Managing the Mississippi River is an issue that we share. Many of the  locks and dams that keep the river navigable are nearly 100 years old.  For many years now, Senator Blunt has worked with me and with the Army  Corps of Engineers to come up with a plan that we call the Navigation  Ecosystem Sustainability Program--shorthand, NESP. It will expand and  modernize seven locks at the most congested locations on the upper  Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to make sure the waterways can continue  to serve as major navigation channels moving crops and other goods.   I am really grateful to Roy Blunt for his leadership supporting  biomedical research. There is a good story here. My partnership with  Senator Blunt started almost 10 years ago. I went up to the National  Institutes of Health for a tour and sat down with legendary Dr. Francis  Collins, who headed up the Institutes of Health. For years, NIH had  limped along with flat funding and sequestration budget cuts.  Inadequate funding had really hurt research at NIH. It discouraged a  lot of young scientists who just couldn't count on regular funding from  Congress, or they chose to maybe move back to other nations where they  were born and the research funding was more predictable.   I asked Dr. Collins: What does NIH need?   He said: Just give me 5 percent real growth in our budget every year,  consistently, and we will light up the scoreboard with our discoveries  and cures.   So I came back and looked for Roy Blunt. He was the leading  Republican on the Appropriations Committee for the National Institutes  of Health. He chaired the Labor and HHS Appropriations Subcommittee. We  decided to put  [[Page S6989]]  together a team. The natural ally on that team was Senator Patty  Murray, a Democrat for the State of Washington and the lead Democrat on  the HELP Committee and on the Appropriations Committee. We rounded out  with two Democrats and two Republicans, the now-retired Senator Lamar  Alexander who led the HELP Committee when Patty Murray was ranking  member, and vice versa.   We agreed on a common goal, the four of us: 5 percent real growth  every year in the National Institutes of Health. In the first year  working together, Senator Blunt overdid it. He helped steer $2 billion,  or 7 percent, to the NIH.   I remember getting a phone call from Roy. It was a few weeks before  Christmas. We were on break with our families, and it is uncommon for  Senators to call one another under those circumstances. But he called  me, and he said he had just spoken with the leaders from Barnes-Jewish  Hospital, which is a major health and research institution in St.  Louis. They were ecstatic about the care they were able to give their  patients and research they were going to undertake because of this new  level of funding.   Senator Blunt said it was unlike any call he had ever received in his  congressional career.   Then he said to me, ``Durbin, we can't be one-hit wonders.'' And from  there, we were off.   Since 2015, with the help of Senator Murray and others, through  changes in the Presidency and through pretty divisive times, we  succeeded on a bipartisan basis to keep steady, predictable funding for  the National Institutes of Health as a bipartisan priority.   Over 7 years, we saw NIH funding increase by more than $14 billion, a  nearly 50-percent increase from where we started. These new investments  are supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide in research  institutions large and small. They are saving lives, and they will  continue to do so for decades to come.   So I want to personally thank Roy Blunt, the Senator from Missouri,  for his leadership in funding this breakthrough medical research.   I also want to thank his staff for their wisdom and professionalism  and calm demeanor. They consistently look for ways to work together for  the common good.   Senator Blunt honored his commitment to medical research and made a  difference in America.   I said to him today as we were gathering for a tribute to the Capitol  Police for defending us on January 6, I said, ``Roy, the reason we all  come here is to make a difference in this great nation that we live in.  You have made that difference in medical research, and you will be  remembered for it.''   He has pursued our shared goal with decency, genuine curiosity, and a  vision for the promise of medical discovery. There are people here in  America today and around the world who are going to have better lives  because of Roy Blunt's commitment. That is a legacy which he can  certainly be proud of.   Loretta and I wish him, his wife Abby, and his family all the best as  they start this new chapter in life. I am sorry to see him go. I am  losing a great friend and a great Senator.   I yield the floor.
