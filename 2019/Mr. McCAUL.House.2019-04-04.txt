 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me first say, at the outset, that the chairman and  I work very closely together. There is a recent article that said that  Chairman Eliot Engel and Ranking Member McCaul forge a rare bipartisan  bond, and I think that is the way we like to conduct this committee. It  is a national security committee, and it needs to be bipartisan.  However, as the chairman mentioned, there are times when we do have  policy differences, but we do have respect in those differences.    We did take this up on the floor several weeks ago. I did oppose it  then, and I oppose it for the same reasons today, most importantly,  because the resolution uses the war powers mechanisms to direct the  removal of U.S. troops from hostilities.   The problem is there are no U.S. Forces to remove, and the basic  premise of this resolution is that somehow we have forces in Yemen that  need to be removed that are engaged in hostilities. As the Department  of Defense  [[Page H3077]]  has repeatedly confirmed, no United States Forces are conducting  hostilities against the Houthis in Yemen.   This resolution abuses a war powers tool to get at a completely  different security assistance issue which Congress already has clear  tools to address. If Members want to condition or cut off U.S. security  assistance to Saudi Arabia, then bring forward a bill to do just that.   But this resolution does nothing to address the humanitarian crisis  in Yemen. It does nothing to secure justice for the heinous murder of  Jamal Khashoggi. It does not even make real decisions on U.S. security  assistance to Saudi Arabia. The only thing it addresses clearly is the  midair refueling of coalition aircraft, ended in November of 2018,  which is not in danger of restarting.   Meanwhile, this resolution stretches the definition of war powers  hostilities to cover non-U.S. military operations by other countries.  Specifically, it reinterprets U.S. support to these countries as  ``engagement in hostilities.''   This radical reinterpretation has implications far beyond Saudi  Arabia. This precedent will empower any single Member to use privileged  war powers procedures to force congressional referendums that could  disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100  countries around the world.   Just days after Israel was forced to respond to rocket attacks from  Gaza, I believe this would be a dangerous precedent to legitimize this  abuse of process.   It could also be used to call into question our commitments to NATO  members. Let me remind my colleagues that we are celebrating NATO's  70th anniversary this week, as we saw the Secretary of NATO address a  joint session of Congress.   Finally, this one-sided resolution completely ignores the destructive  role of the Houthis and their backers in Tehran. The Houthis violently  overthrew the Government of Yemen. They are attacking Saudi Arabia with  weapons they got from Iran in violation of the U.N. Security Council  resolutions. They have killed Saudi civilians and endangered many  Americans living there.   Human Rights Watch accused the Houthis of taking hostages and  torturing detainees. The United Nations says the Houthis use civilian  human shields. The World Food Program has criticized them for illegally  stealing urgently needed food aid. The Houthis have targeted ships in  the Red Sea.   These realities are ignored in the text of this resolution. The only  impact this resolution will have on the Houthis will be to encourage  them.   In addition, Madam Speaker, this is very important because, since the  last time we debated this on the floor, the Houthis engaged in a  propaganda outlet, supported by Hezbollah, actively touting this very  resolution online. They used our debate on the floor of the Congress to  advance their propaganda, a proxy of Iran and Yemen.   This is what we are doing here today. I would submit, Madam Speaker,  that is very dangerous. It is dangerous, and I believe it is reckless.   This will weaken the hand of the U.N. Special Envoy, as well, to  Yemen, whose efforts currently represent the best hope we have of  bringing a negotiated end to this conflict and ending the suffering of  the people of Yemen.   So, for these reasons, I continue to oppose this pro-Iran, pro-Houthi  resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting against  it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I close, I include in the Record a statement of administration  policy issued on Monday.                     Statement of Administration Policy     S.J. Res. 7--Directing the President to Remove United States Armed    Forces from Hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that Have Not Been        Authorized by Congress--Sen. Sanders, I-VT and 19 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 7,       a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to       remove United States forces from hostilities in or affecting       the Republic of Yemen, with certain exceptions.        The premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015,       the United States has provided limited support to member       countries of the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence       sharing, logistics support, and, until recently, aerial       refueling, to assist in the defense of United States allies       and partners. The provision of this support has not caused       United States forces to be introduced into hostilities. Such       support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under       the Arms Export Control Act, statutory authorities for       Department of Defense to provide logistics support to foreign       countries, and the President's constitutional powers. Because       the President has directed United States forces to support       the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers, the       joint resolution would raise serious constitutional concerns       to the extent it seeks to override the President's       determination as Commander in Chief.        In addition to its erroneous premise, the joint resolution       would harm bilateral relationships in the region, negatively       affect our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist       organizations--such as al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and       ISIS in Yemen--and establish bad precedent for future       legislation by defining ``hostilities'' to include defense       cooperation such as aerial refueling for purposes of this       legislation. While we appreciate that sections 5 and 6 of the       resolution acknowledge these serious consequences to some       extent, after-the-fact reporting is not an effective means to       mitigate them. Our continued cooperation with regional       partner nations allows the United States to support       diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict, promote       humanitarian access, mitigate civilian casualties, enhance       efforts to recover United States hostages in Yemen, and       defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States.  [[Page H3079]]         If S.J. Res. 7 were presented to the President, his senior       advisors would recommend he veto the joint resolution.     Madam Speaker, it really, basically, states yet again  that the fundamental premise of this resolution is flawed, because U.S.  forces are not engaged in hostilities against the Houthis in Yemen,  which is what the War Powers Act requires.   If we want to cut off economic assistance or logistic assistance,  security assistance to Saudi, there is a way to do that, but it is not  through the War Powers Act.   I think it is unfortunate that we couldn't work that out, but I think  we are using the wrong vehicle here. I think this confrontation abuses  the War Powers process, and we need to protect the integrity of the War  Powers Act that Congress, in its wisdom, passed.   Also, what worries me is the resolution stays silent on the role of  Iran. It does not condemn the Houthis, who are responsible for the  killings. It tells them both to press on. It also undermines the peace  negotiations going on, as I speak. The U.S. envoy is working with the  full support of the United States to negotiate a political end to this  conflict.   Getting all parties to the table has taken substantial pressure,  which I believe this resolution would relieve.   Again, I think the fact that the Houthis are using this resolution as  propaganda to advance their cause is concerning and disturbing.   The other side cannot tell us specifically what assistance this  resolution would cut off. What I can say for sure is that this  resolution says to the Houthis and to Iran to keep going, because you  can gain more ground.   It only emboldens the rebels who violently overthrew Yemen's  government and the radical regime that backs them. That would be Iran.   So I think this resolution would set a dangerous precedent with  respect to the War Powers Act, a dangerous, damaging policy. Once  again, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, let me first say that the Yemen resolution  before us here today is pro-Iran and anti-Israel.   I rise today to offer a motion stating that it is in the national  security interest of the United States to oppose the global movement to  boycott the State of Israel. This motion will not kill the joint  resolution or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the resolution  will immediately proceed to final passage.   As we heard from the powerful speech of the Secretary of NATO  yesterday, it is in our national interest to work with our allies to  counter our shared threats and promote our shared values.   Since its founding in 1948, the United States has stood shoulder to  shoulder with Israel against enemies that want to destroy it.   Let's be clear about the BDS movement: It is yet another enemy of  Israel. It wants to exclude, isolate, and, ultimately, destroy Israel.   The founder of the BDS movement has stated: ``We oppose a Jewish  state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian . . . will ever accept a  Jewish state in Palestine.''   The BDS movement is not about equality. It is not about peace. It is  about undermining negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians, and  it is about placing all of the blame on one party, and that is Israel.   We do not support a movement that demands concessions from one party  alone. We do not stand with a movement that seeks to isolate and shame  our strongest ally in the Middle East.   By weakening Israel, the global BDS movement endangers American  security. When foreign entities like the U.N. foster boycotts against  Israel, they are interfering with the United States' foreign policy.   The Senate passed a bill, S. 1, in its wisdom, 2 months ago with  overwhelming bipartisan support to tackle BDS, better support Israel  and Jordan, and sanction Assad's brutal regime. Sadly, the House  Democratic leadership won't let that bill or a House version of that  bill to this floor for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close with this: As the son of a World War II  veteran, a B-17 bombardier who bombed the Nazis and was part of the D- day air campaign, it saddens me that we are still struggling here today  with the same issues that the Greatest Generation defeated.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
