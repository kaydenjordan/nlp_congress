 Madam Speaker, over the weekend of July 4, sweet,  precious, 2-year-old angel, Wynter Cole Smith of Lansing was kidnapped  and killed by a truly evil person. Two years old, murdered with an  iPhone charging cable. Everyone in Michigan is horrified by this  heinous and despicable crime; a bright light snuffed out way too early.   Madam Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with Wynter's family, and  I ask that all Members in the Chamber and those in the gallery please  rise for a moment of silence to honor and remember this beautiful,  beautiful soul.   We love Wynter Cole Smith, and she will always be in our hearts.                            ____________________
