 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her extraordinary leadership.   Madam Speaker, injustice need not be forever. By affirming the  Mississippi pro-life law, the Supreme Court can take a powerful step  toward inclusion, justice, and respect for the weakest and most  vulnerable.   Shockingly, since the infamous 1973 abortion decisions, more than  62.5 million unborn children have been killed--a staggering loss of  children's lives that equates with the entire population of Italy.   Abrogating both duty and due diligence, the 1973 Court wrote: ``We  need not resolve the difficult question of when human life begins.''   Sidestepping that threshold and giving no benefit of the doubt to the  child, they went on to legalize abortion on demand as if the baby were  a tumor to be excised or a disease to be vanquished.   For decades, right up to this very moment, abortion advocates have  gone to extraordinary lengths to ignore, trivialize, and cover up the  battered baby victim. But today, thanks to ultrasound, unborn babies  are more visible than ever before.   This begs the question: Why does dismembering a child with sharp  knives, pulverizing a child with powerful suction devices, or  chemically poisoning a baby with any number of toxic chemicals fail to  elicit so much as a scintilla of empathy, mercy, or compassion?   Madam Speaker, someday future generations of Americans will look back  on us and wonder how and why such a rich and seemingly enlightened  society, professing to be devoted to human rights and so blessed and  endowed with the capacity to protect the vulnerable, could have instead  so aggressively promoted death to children and the exploitation of  women by abortion.   Injustice, Madam Speaker, need not be forever.
