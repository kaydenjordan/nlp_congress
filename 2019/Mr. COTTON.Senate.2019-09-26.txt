 Mr. President, earlier today, this body confirmed Gen.  John Hyten as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote was  75 to 22. It should have been 100 to 0.   General Hyten has weathered a storm of malicious attacks on his  character--attacks that have been elevated by credulous pundits and  politicians, even as they have been debunked again and again by  independent investigations.   Today, General Hyten got his due, and Joint Chiefs gained a great  leader--all because he refused to back down and because a majority of  this body was willing to follow the facts where they lead.   General Hyten has devoted his life to public service. He attended  Harvard University on an ROTC scholarship and spent the next three  decades mastering warfare in a new domain: space. Today, he is an  undisputed expert in space technology and operations, having served in  senior positions at Strategic Command, Central Command, Air Force Space  Command, and the 50th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base.   Gen. Hyten's expertise and leadership will only grow more valuable in  the  [[Page S5741]]  years ahead, as the United States competes with China for dominance in  space and cyberspace.   Unfortunately, we haven't spent the past few months discussing  General Hyten's qualifications for the job or the strategic challenges  we face as a nation. Instead, Gen. Hyten's nomination was marred by  false accusations of misconduct by a subordinate. This accuser has a  long and disturbing history of responding to professional setbacks with  serious accusations against her superiors. These accusations--all of  them, against General Hyten and others in her chain of command--have  been dismissed by competent, independent military investigations.  Multiple inspectors general have now looked into these claims.  Countless manhours have been devoted to uncovering the truth. And the  truth is that General Hyten is innocent.   Today the Senate said ``enough'' to the malicious claims against him.   Ensuring justice for General Hyten meant nothing more and nothing  less than following the facts where they lead. When we follow the  facts, it sends a clear message to our men and women in uniform that  they will be treated fairly by the armed service, not railroaded by a  media mob or hung out to dry by their chain of command.   For victims of sexual assault and harassment, following the facts  will ensure that justice is done. It will mean the same for victims of  false claims like General Hyten.   I know of few leaders who take sexual misconduct more seriously than  my colleague, Senator Martha McSally--herself a victim of sexual  assault. It speaks volumes about this case, as well as her own courage,  that Senator McSally has stood up for a good man in the face of truly  reprehensible attacks. I will close with her words. ``[T]he full truth  was revealed in this process,'' she said. ``The truth is that General  Hyten is innocent of these charges.'' Indeed he is. So today he has  been confirmed as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, with our full  confidence that he will continue to serve with the courage and  brilliance that have so far distinguished his career.                            ____________________
