 Mr. Speaker, in the coming days and weeks, the  Democratic Caucus will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make  transformative change for our children. But if you turn on the news,  you will see, instead, a narrative about winners and losers within our  party.   This is not about winners or losers in the Democratic Party. It is  about delivering together on our bold vision. Our constituents are  going to remember the results, not the process.   That is why we have to come together to make good on our commitment  to address the climate crisis, to invest in infrastructure and create  jobs, and to lower costs for working families through tax cuts, support  for early education, and healthcare.   We have an obligation to pass both the Build Back Better Act and the  bipartisan infrastructure framework, and we are going to get both done,  strengthening our country and creating a better future for our  children.                            ____________________
