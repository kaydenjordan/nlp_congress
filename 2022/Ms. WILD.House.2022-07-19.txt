 Mr. Speaker, our Nation can be characterized by many great  traits, hard work, discipline, grit, dedication, determination,  selflessness, bravery, courage, strength, and a quest for success.   We have a rugged streak of individualism, a desire to get things done  by any means necessary, even if it means going it alone. These are  admirable American traits and have made us who we are. But they are  also why we are where we are on mental health.   We Americans find it so difficult to ask for help; to show people we  need support; to recognize that maybe we should not always go it alone.   Our Nation is facing a mental health crisis, one which the  unprecedented stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has forced into  plain view, demanding to be addressed, to be seen, to be helped. And  that, perhaps, may be the silver lining of the pandemic; that we have  finally woken up and taken notice of this epidemic in our country.   Just think about it: Healthcare providers were on the front lines of  treating COVID-19 through waves and waves of patients, selflessly  putting the needs of everyone else before themselves. In the early  waves, when COVID-19 was still new, they were the only ones present to  hold the hands of countless people as they passed from this world.   Teachers, historically underpaid and overworked, putting together  lesson plans to keep our children learning, while under the pressure  of, what if my school is next? How will I protect my kids? As they see  that yet another school is the recipient of thoughts and prayers.   No occupation is spared. Law enforcement, firefighters, dentists,  veterinarians, farmers.   Young people just beginning their lives thrown for a loop by the  pandemic--milestones they and their families had looked forward to,  delayed or canceled, not being able to see friends and family members  in person, the anxiety of entering a world changed almost overnight,  trying to find a new normal.   Parents, who served triple duty, caretaker, teacher, breadwinner, all  while trying to keep their families safe and healthy.   We have all experienced grief and loss in one way or another over the  last 3 years. Some of us lost family and friends; some lost businesses  or their health, and some of us experienced extreme isolation, anxiety,  and stress. But we all experienced something.   Our strength as Americans isn't just rooted in our individual  discipline, selflessness, bravery, or courage, but in our collective  ability to take care of one another.                                time  2000    That is why I am so passionate about mental healthcare, making it  more accessible, affordable, and available.   During last year's appropriations bill, I successfully fought for an  increase of $530 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration, our most important Federal agency for  supporting mental health and combating the addiction crisis.   For our healthcare providers who have for so long taken care of us  with so little support for their own care, I introduced the Dr. Lorna  Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, a bill that provides funding  to reduce and prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral  health conditions among healthcare professionals. I am very proud to  say that it passed through the Senate and has been signed into law by  President Biden.   The bill is named for Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency room doctor, who  worked on the front lines of the pandemic and died by suicide in the  spring of 2020. I am so proud to say that this bill was signed by  President Biden this past spring.   For students on college campuses, I have introduced and passed  through the House the Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention  Through Campus Planning Act, focusing on promoting positive mental  health among college students, and encouraging college leaders to  engage in comprehensive planning efforts to prevent suicide on college  campuses. I am now focused on getting that through the Senate and  signed into law.   During this time of extreme stress for our young people, our colleges  and universities need resources to reach out to students and to better  support their mental health.   Our young children have, unfortunately, not been spared from the  mental health crisis. Suicide rates in young  [[Page H6877]]  children have been climbing, and the leading method has become by  hanging, with information found online.   There is no reason for young children to be able to find directions  on how to tie a noose on YouTube. I have been working to hold YouTube  accountable and to bring down those videos.   Our children deserve to grow up in a world that encourages them to be  both strong and determined and able to ask for help and lean on their  support systems. We all deserve that.   Finally, we must make sure that our mental health professionals are  respected, that people are encouraged to go into that profession, and  that that profession is fairly compensated.   We have a shortage of mental health professionals that is hurting our  country, hurting our communities. We, as individuals, and together as  communities, are so much stronger when we have support systems in place  to reinforce our strength, to help us bounce back, and to be resilient.   We can do this, but we have to work together. We have to admit our  vulnerabilities, and we have to put all politics aside as we work on  this critical issue.
