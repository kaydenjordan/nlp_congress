 Madam Chair, I rise today to support my colleague, Bill  Johnson's legislation, H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG  Certainty and Access Act. With its passage, there will no longer be  unnecessary restrictions placed on small-scale liquefied natural gas  exports, creating more open, transparent, and competitive markets for  our natural gas industry.   H.R. 4606 includes a rule finalized by the Department of Energy that  expedites approval for small-scale gas exports, ending the several- months wait in the review process.   These simple fixes are so commonsense that the bill itself is  significantly bipartisan which, as you know, is a rarity here in  Washington. But I am pleased to see that when the good clearly  outweighs the bad, both sides really can come together, and that is  what we see here today.   This legislation would also place small-scale exports on a level  playing field with Canada and Mexico, and open new markets in the  Caribbean, Central America, and South America. As a result, this bill  would create new jobs in the United States, boosting our local  economies.    I spent most of the day yesterday with the Farm Bill Conference  Committee, where the biggest theme we heard was the need to have  certainty. That desire for policy certainty is something that  transcends parties and, in this case, committees. This legislation  would provide that assurance to our energy folks and protect jobs and  investments in the United States.
