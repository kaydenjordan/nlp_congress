 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   President Trump's actions--encouraging, inciting a mob that stormed  the United States Capitol for the sole purpose of stopping the  constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes--cannot go  unanswered by this body. He must be impeached.   If Congress does not act, if we shrink from our constitutional  responsibilities to defend our Republic, it will undoubtedly undermine  the vision of America as ``the last best hope of earth,'' as Abraham  Lincoln so eloquently said so many years ago.   To the millions of Americans watching today: I hope that you  understand that we are proceeding on this path out of love for our  country.   I will honor my oath today. I will vote for impeachment, and I pray  that my colleagues will muster the courage to do the same.
