 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning Donald Trump tweeted that  ``Democrats are holding our military hostage'' in this shutdown--just  the latest in a string of recent comments wherein he accuses Democrats  like me of not caring about our military, and it is the latest example  of his failing to show leadership, to take responsibility for leading  this Nation.   Does he even know that there are servicemembers who are in harm's way  right now watching him, looking for the Commander in Chief to show  leadership rather than to try to deflect blame, or that his own  Pentagon says that the short-term funding plans he seems intent on  pushing are actually harmful to not just the military but to our  national security?   I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the  training, and the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible-- sadly, this is something the current occupant of the Oval Office does  not seem to care to do--and I will not be lectured about what our  military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger.   I have a message for Cadet Bones Spurs: If you cared about our  military, you would stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put  85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger.   Last night, after the lights had been turned out in the White House  and the President had gone to his private quarters, I voted to better  train and equip our troops, to stop wasting taxpayers' dollars with yet  another CR. I voted to make sure that our military men and women--who  are standing on the line in the DMZ, who are in Iraq and Afghanistan,  across Africa, in Asia--get the help, the support, and the equipment  they need.   If the President truly cared about them, then he would stop hiding  behind his Twitter account and stop blaming everyone else. And he can  tell his party--a party that controls the House, the White House, and  the Senate--to do their job, to govern, to stop allowing the most  extreme wing of your party to prevent us from passing a long-term  funding solution that the military itself--your own leaders whom you  nominated and appointed--is asking for.   At the very least, you could ask your party to guarantee military pay  and death benefits for our servicemembers and their families so that  the troops downrange aren't putting their lives at risk overseas while  also worrying about whether they are going to be able to feed their  families or if our government will take care of those families if, God  forbid, they must make that last full measure of devotion for our  Nation.   I am so disappointed that my Republican colleagues refused to allow  us a vote for our troops last night, and I encourage them to please  reconsider that vote. Let's get to a full budget. Let's move on. We can  compromise. We can do this together. So many of the options on the  table are bipartisan. In fact, a majority of them are Republican- authored. Our troops know how to work together. They stand shoulder-to- shoulder when they protect and defend this country. We surely in these  Chambers can do the same. So let's stop blaming each other, and let's  get to work.   I will be here, as I was today, tomorrow and the day after until we  get this done. Our men and women in uniform deserve nothing less.    Thank you.
