 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the heaviest of  hearts to offer my sympathy and recognition to my fellow Texans and  fellow Americans.  [[Page H2561]]    On this day, the unspeakable happened in Uvalde, Texas. It happened  on the 24th. That weekend, I immediately went to Uvalde, simply wanting  to embrace and to be able to understand what the parents could not  speak.   We worshipped in a church. We walked amongst the flowers. We hugged  children. We saw 9-year-olds crying in utter pain because they lost  their playmates.   I remember the viciousness of the scene. The loved ones of these  children and teachers have never gotten justice. There have been no  answers. They have gone day after day asking what happened.   They watched as children scrambled out of windows, looking to see if  their child would come. No one helped in the midst of that crisis.   I want us to look at those faces today. Let us mourn and seek justice  for these families. I mourn them. I will take my moment of silence in  honor of these beautiful children and teachers who died viciously on  May 24.                            ____________________
