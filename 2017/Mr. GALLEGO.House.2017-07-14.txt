 Mr. Speaker, on July 11, Donald Trump, Jr., released a  series of emails regarding his meeting with a Russian Government lawyer  and an individual associated with Russian intelligence.   Don Trump, Jr.'s, emails are a smoking gun. They prove that the Trump  campaign was not only aware of the Russian Government's efforts to  meddle in our elections, they were enthusiastic about accepting  Russia's support.   What follows are the contents of those emails. They painted a  disturbing picture of a campaign, and now an administration willing to  break the law and sell out to an adversary of the United States in  order to advance their own petty interests.   Our hope is that the American people will carefully consider the  content of these messages and what they say about the fitness of Donald  Trump and his senior advisers to hold high office.   We will begin. There was a comment posted by Donald Trump, Jr., on  Twitter on July 11, 2017. ``To everyone, in order to be totally  transparent''--which we now know he wasn't even in this email--``I am  releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about  the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from  Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the  2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very  highly respected company in Moscow. The information they suggested they  had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research.  I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn't work out,  they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I  decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was  not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information  to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky  Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian  fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the  entire meeting was `the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was  actually agitated by it.' ''   End of email.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    On June 3, 2016, at 10:53 a.m., less than 20 minutes  after that email, Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back:   ``Thanks, Rob, I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but  perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time, and if  it's what you say, I love it especially later in the summer. Could we  do a call first thing next week when I am back?   ``Best, Don.''   Mr. Speaker, ``I love it.'' His response was: ``I love it.'' I worked  in politics for a long time. I have never been approached with  information from a foreign government. But if I were, my response would  not be: ``I love it.''   My response would be: ``This is completely inappropriate.'' My  response would be: ``Don't ever contact me again.'' My response would  be: ``I am calling the FBI.''   In this email, Donald Trump, Jr., showed his true colors. This email  proves that he lacks basic integrity. The willingness of Jared Kushner  to attend that meeting proves that he, too, is no patriot.    On June 6, 2016, at 3:38 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., wrote  back:   ``My cell''--we have omitted that cell number. Unlike Donald Trump,  we do not give out individual cell numbers.   ``Thanks.   ``D.''    On June 6, 2016, just a few minutes after receiving this  email, Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back:   ``Rob, thanks for the help.''   From Moscow thanks for the help, he should have said.    On June 7, 2016, at 5:16 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr.,  writes:   ``How about 3 at our offices? Thanks, Rob, appreciate you helping set  it up?''    On June 7, 2016, at 6:14 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr.,  writes:   ``Great. It will likely be Paul Manafort, campaign boss, my brother- in-law''--Jared Kushner--``and me, 725 Fifth Avenue, 25th floor'' which  is Trump Tower?    On June 8, 2016, at 11:15, Donald Trump, Jr., writes:   ``Yes, Rob, I could do that unless they wanted to do 3 today instead.  Just let me know and I will lock it in either way.''   That is some eagerness that this man has for this information.    This email is from Donald Trump, Jr., sent Wednesday,  June 8, 2016, at 12:03 p.m., to Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort.  Subject, forward, Russia--Clinton--private and confidential.   ``Meeting got moved to 4 tomorrow at my offices.   ``Best.   ``Don.''    The other thing that we have to consider is this: right  now, there is a person who is in the White House who has lied on their  security clearance--a security clearance that we use to determine  whether we shall trust somebody with this top secret information for  this country.    Jared Kushner was in a meeting with a foreign agent. Now we know that  he was in a meeting not just with a foreign agent but a former-- ``former'' Soviet counterintelligence officer. Let me tell you  something. There is no such thing as former counterintelligence  officers if you ever work with the Soviets. Once you are in the KGB,  you are always in the KGB.   Why was that person in that room? It was not to talk about adoption.  He certainly wasn't there to talk about anything else. But, if  anything, he was there to pass information. The fact that Jared Kushner  lied in his clearance, lied and omitted it until finally revealed  today, really calls into question whether that man should be in the  White House right now and trusted with this type of sensitive  information.   Ted, you and I were in the military. We both had security clearances.  If we had this type of omission in our security clearance, what would  have been our punishments?    What is the motivation for omitting this meeting? There  are clearly emails, there are clearly pointed emails, saying: Why are  you going to be attending this meeting?   There is a subject line that says, Clinton emails. There is a subject  line that has to do with a Russian agent, a crown prosecutor. Now we  know there is a former Soviet counterintelligence agent who just  happens to be there, and Jared Kushner omits it from his security  clearance. That is not an accident. That is a criminal act, a criminal  act that any other citizen in this country, any other soldier, sailor,  marine, airman, if we ever did that, we would be quickly prosecuted  under the UCMJ.    No.    I am controlling time.  [[Page H5878]]         If you start seeing and putting it all together, we now  know that there is a clear narrative of Jared Kushner's involvements  with the Russians.   First, he tries to set up a back channel. Then he omits his  conversations and meetings in a security clearance. He continues to lie  even though he is continuously brought forth as being untruthful. Now  we find ourselves in the situation where there is basically zero trust  that this man in the White House with top secret clearance is not  compromised.   In conclusion, let me close with this. You just heard emails after  emails. Imagine this conversation happening the opposite way. Imagine a  conversation happening with a Democrat or the Clintons saying, I have  information, and the word Moscow is said probably four or five times  altogether.   Imagine the idea that you are meeting in private, and then imagine  all the follow-up lies that happened.   What would be occurring right now? What would be occurring is what we  saw last year: consistent oversight. But there is none. There is no  oversight right now. Paul Ryan has not taken the helm and has not done  any type of oversight. The House Republicans have abdicated their  responsibility and have allowed Donald Trump and all those other  members of his family and the administration who have been compromised  to continue being a threat to our national security in the White House.   This should not be the way. Partisanship should never be above  patriotism. But what we are seeing right now is naked partisanship  being exposed and pushed as far as possible in the hopes of protecting  a faulty President, his administration, and his family.    That is not American. That is not what any of us ever signed up for.  We swore--whether it was in the Armed Services Committee, whether it  was when we were in the armed services, or whether it is when we came  here to Congress--to uphold the Constitution of the United States and  protect it.   Right now we can honestly say that that is not occurring. There is an  absolute abdication happening right now of leadership from House  Republicans.   Ted, please close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
