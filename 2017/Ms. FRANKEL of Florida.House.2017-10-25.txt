 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the  bipartisan leadership of this committee.   Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 34th anniversary of the devastating  Marine Corps barracks bombing in Lebanon. As the very proud mother of a  U.S. marine, this is deeply personal to me. My son returned safely from  his tours of service. Not so blessed were the families of 220 marines  and 21 other service personnel who were murdered when Hezbollah struck  with truck bombs at a Marine Corps compound in Beirut, Lebanon, on  October 23, 1983.   The marines we lost that day were someone's husband, father, brother,  or son. Except for al-Qaida, Hezbollah has killed more Americans than  any other terrorist group in the world, and it continues to be a  menacing threat to all humanity.   Just look at Syria, the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time:  hundreds of thousands of civilians murdered; 5 million have fled as  refugees; Hezbollah, a tool of Iran, propping up Assad and fueling the  violence.    Their actions don't stop there. Israelis live under the constant  shadow of Hezbollah's missile arsenal that is pointed directly at them.  In just a decade, they have increased their rocket count from 15,000 to  150,000. They hold the Lebanese people hostage by embedding weapons in  their mosques, their hospitals, and their schools.   These bipartisan bills before us that I wholeheartedly support will  help America go after the full range of Hezbollah's activities,  sanctioning them for utilizing civilians as human shields, targeting  Iran's financial support to Hezbollah, and urging the European Union to  designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of these bills.
