 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Easton/ Newnam Field Airport on its 75th anniversary. Easton Airport on  Maryland's Eastern Shore is a fixture in the Talbot County community  and celebrates a rich and patriotic history.   Originally constructed by the military during World War II, the  Easton Airport was used as one of the hundreds of bases for military  planes patrolling the East Coast for Nazi submarines. After the war,  the Federal Government sold the Easton Airport, and others like it, to  the local jurisdictions in which they were located for just $1.   Since the end of World War II, the Easton Airport has grown to be one  of the busiest general aviation facilities in Maryland, serving local  businesses, the military, corporate pilots, and aviation enthusiasts.   Congratulations to the Easton Airport on this tremendous anniversary,  and cheers to another 75 years of serving Talbot County, the State of  Maryland, and the United States of America.                            ____________________
