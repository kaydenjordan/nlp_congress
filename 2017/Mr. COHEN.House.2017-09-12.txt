 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in support of our  bipartisan amendment, which would increase Legal Services funding by  $10 million. I am willing to withdraw this amendment after my  colleagues and I take a brief moment to speak about Legal Services. I  know that the chair and the ranking member support Legal Services and  may be able to help, but at some time in the future.   Our justice system is the envy of the world. Whenever we travel,  people say what they really respect about America is the rule of law  and our justice system, but it takes professional help by an attorney  to navigate it. When they are poor--which most people don't have legal  training--they are not going to be able to successfully compete against  a private attorney on the other side. They need help. If they don't  have that help, the justice system is not fair.   Legal Services helps ensure equal justice under the law. It helps all  kind of folks: military families, homeowners and renters, families with  children, the disabled, and the elderly.   It is vital all over the country, but in places like Houston,  residents struggle from Hurricane Harvey. Lone Star Legal Aid, which is  partially funded by Legal Services, is helping people navigate the  legal hurdles when people need them most so that they can get their  lives back.   Mr. Kennedy has been a strong supporter of this. He was supposed to  be here today, but I think he has been detained.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Fitzpatrick).  [[Page H7259]]         Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  his help.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Serrano), the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr.  Serrano has helped me on other amendments as well as this one.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Culberson for his help, and Mrs.  Brooks for her leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would reprogram $10 million from  the prison account and put it in the juvenile justice programs designed  to reduce recidivism, gang violence, and gun crimes.   Ms. Jackson Lee, a fellow member on the Judiciary Committee, has been  a leader on this issue, and she is right in her approach, understanding  that working with juveniles early will save money in the long run and  see that they don't get into the prison pipeline that so often takes  young people and ruins their lives and costs our communities and our  taxpayers a great deal of money.   Our Federal prisons are presently funded $7 billion for  administration, operation, and maintenance. Twenty million dollars of  that is made up for contract confinement.   This amendment would reduce the account by $10 million and put it  into juvenile justice programs that would reduce recidivism, gang  violence, and gun crime.   These juvenile justice programs that would get the benefit of this  money would protect our most vulnerable children through treatment and  mentoring programs. According to the Justice Policy Institute, locking  up juveniles costs an average of $407 a day and $148,000 per person per  year.   There are a lot of conservative coalitions, like FreedomWorks,  American Conservative Union Foundation, and Taxpayers Protection  Alliance that agree that mass incarceration is extremely costly to  taxpayers.   This amendment invests in our youth population at the front end with  rewards on the back end, as these folks don't end up in the prison  system; supports programs that have shown consistent success in  curtailing gang violence and gun crimes.   Violence among our youth is a health epidemic that must be addressed;  therefore, we must support professionals that possess practical  experience in epidemic control for violence prevention, and that show  success working with the most vulnerable and at-risk youth population  when addressing this health epidemic.   Within the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the  following programs focus on violence prevention: Forum, Community Based  Violence Prevention, and Defending Childhood. The CBVP explicitly calls  for and supports the health approach; hence, this amendment provides  funding for organizations such as community-based violence prevention  programs that have shown great success.   Cure Violence, a health-based organization operating in several  cities and States, including Chicago and New York and Philadelphia and  others, has shown great success and also shown success in Puerto Rico.  They have had 100 percent reduction in homicide retaliation in Chicago,  a 41 to 73 percent drop in shootings in five of eight communities in  Baltimore; they have had a 56 percent drop in killings, and 44 percent  other places.   In essence, this is putting money in a place where we can save money,  save youths, save lives.   Mr. Chair, I ask that we support this amendment that Ms. Jackson Lee  has brought forth. It makes a lot of common sense.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I understand Mr. Culberson's position and look  forward to his help with legal services that will help juveniles, too.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  withdraw the amendment.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 12, 2017, on page H7262, the following appeared: Mr.  Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw the  amendment.      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw the  amendment.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Walberg for bringing this  amendment and for the bills he has proposed; and I thank Senator Paul  as well.   I think criminal asset forfeiture is one of the worst, most heinous,  most despicable, and most vile laws that we have ever put on the books.  It is an assault on human beings and State governments on State  sovereignty and on individuals having a right to their property and  having a right to a hearing and being found guilty of something before  their property is taken.   The way it is today, the government can come in, and they don't even  have to charge you with a crime, and they can take your car or your  money or whatever else they find. It is an un-American a thing as has  ever existed.   Mr. Walberg laid out some of the supporters: the ACLU, NAACP, and  then it goes around to some conservative worlds. There are many times I  have found that you get 360 degrees where the liberals and the  conservatives come together and agree on libertarian principles that  something needs to happen.                                time  1645    When you have got Rand Paul, Keith Ellison, Mr. Walberg, and myself  all on the same thing, this needs to happen. So we need to pass it now.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
