 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for having and hosting  this time.   During biblical times, we read about sacrifices of babies to Moloch  and to Baal.   How could that happen? How could you allow a child--a tiny baby--to  suffer like that? It goes on.   I know there is so much said, but let's simplify it. If you think  that it is not a child, see a preemie. It doesn't have to be your own  premature child like ours was. Let that little child grab your finger  and hold on for dear life. Understand what we have heard about here-- what a late-term abortion is that so many in this body embrace.                                time  1945    That little hand is attached to an arm that is attached to a body,  and it is a beautiful child. The late-term abortionist, as he has  explained, will rip off--he reaches in with a clamp, clamps on to the  arm, linear things, and rips off four linear things from the body and  then reaches in and crushes the skull and rips the skull off of the  child.   That is not progress for civilization. That is horrendous.   Let a premature child hold your finger, Mr. Speaker, and see what the  monitors do--as I have--and you will never ever want to know of a child  like that being broken, pulled, and torn apart. Let's progress beyond  the brutality.
