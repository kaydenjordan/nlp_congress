 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for the opportunity. We  certainly appreciate the esteemed institution that is West Point. May I  also say that the United States Marines are also a great institution,  and I want to thank the Speaker for his service in Afghanistan and in  Iraq as well.                      Recognizing Melinda Jones Williams     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Melinda Jones Williams.   Melinda Jones Williams, a civil rights activist, was born March 14,  1950, in Americus, Georgia. She is currently a resident of Haines City,  Florida, with one child, Jeffrey Jones.   In July, 1963, Melinda Jones Williams was one of 15 young Black girls  with a passion to change the bigotry and divisiveness in Americus,  Georgia, by protesting a strong force of generational racism. During a  peaceful protest, she was arrested along with 14 other young girls.  These girls were all stolen, hidden from their parents, and locked in  an abandoned building for over a month. There were no windows, toilets,  and no source of water.    This was their punishment for protesting a segregated movie theater.  Melinda Jones Williams is one of the few remaining survivors of the  Stolen Girls of Americus, Georgia.   For that and her heroism in the civil rights movement, we thank you,  Ms. Jones Williams.                           Recognizing Charlie Reed     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Charlie Reed.   She was born and raised in Kissimmee, Florida, my hometown. She was  the first in her family to graduate from college with a degree in  journalism from the University of Florida in 1997. She has worked at  the Orlando Sentinel, Osceola News-Gazette, and Treasure Coast  Newspapers. While working for the Stars and Stripes newspaper, she has  covered international defense, geopolitics, and the U.S. military  community.   After a reporting trip to Vietnam, Charlie moved there to do  volunteer work and write about Vietnam veterans living in the place  where they fought a war so many years before. While living in Vietnam,  she was named editor for an English-language Vietnamese magazine and  worked closely with several NGOs helping Agent Orange victims and  impoverished children.   Charlie came back to Kissimmee in 2014 to reconnect with her Florida  roots. It was a homecoming that led her back to the staff at the  Osceola News-Gazette. As a seasoned journalist who has lived around the  world, Charlie knows no stranger. Her ability to connect with people  and understand their problems is perhaps her greatest strength.  Charlie's life work is about more than chasing a story. It is about  serving the community, being an advocate for the public, a voice for  the voiceless and shining light on corruption. The pleasure she  experiences while helping others is truly all hers.   For that, Charlie Reed, we recognize you.                         Recognizing Juanita Geathers     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Juanita Geathers.   Juanita Geathers has six children and nine grandchildren with her  husband, Lemuel Geathers, former mayor of Winter Haven. She has spent  34 years as an educator in Polk County schools, retiring as an  assistant principal in 2004. She graduated from Jewett High School as  valedictorian in 1959, went on to receive her bachelor of science  degree from Rollins College and a master's in education from the  University of South Florida.   Juanita served as Secretary for the Florida Democratic Party State  Executive Committee and was the highest ranking African American woman  during her tenure as Secretary. She also served as a Democratic  National Convention delegate from Florida for three conventions.   As an active member of her community, she is a recipient of the  Outstanding Community Service Award. She has served on the Polk  Education Association, Polk County Opportunity Council, Polk County  Voters League, Girls and Boys Club, and Girls, Inc. She is also a  lifetime member of the NAACP and a member of the Hurst Chapel AME  Church.   For that, Ms. Juanita Geathers, we honor you.                          Recognizing Monica Readus     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Monica Readus.   Monica Readus is a wife, mother, business owner, and real estate  professional. She was born in Detroit, Michigan.   After moving to Texas, Monica became aware of a shift in the  political climate. After the 2004 Presidential race, Democrats were  discouraged and Dallas Republicans were running unopposed. It was at  that time that Monica took time away from the company's day-to-day  operations to become a full-time volunteer for the Collin County  Democratic Party office in Plano, Texas.   Since then, Monica has worked with candidates and campaign managers,  coordinated grassroots efforts for local and Federal elections, and  fundraised for candidates and more. In 2011 Monica moved to Florida  where she immediately began coordinating grassroots efforts for  Organizing for America by spearheading daily phone banks. She then  joined the Democratic Women's Club of Florida of West Orange County,  serving as its first president.   She now happily serves as the Democratic Women's Club of Florida  Region 9 chair, serving nearly 600 members and the chair of the Annual  PerSisters Rally in celebration of Democratic Women's Month.   For that, Monica Readus, we honor you.  [[Page H2636]]                            Recognizing Lisa Santoni Cromar     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Lisa Santoni Cromar.   Lisa Santoni Cromar is a legally deaf Puerto Rican woman. She is the  mother to two boys, Nicholas and William, and the wife to Scott Cromar.  She was born in 1962 to Puerto Rican parents, Trina and Jose Santoni.  Her early career was in corporate IT. At age 30, she divorced her first  husband and went to work for the domestic violence agency that helped  her leave. After meeting her husband, Scott, he had a friend running  for Congress, which presented an opportunity to transition to political  consulting and issue advocacy. She has served as voting chair and co- chair, and is now an executive board member of the Women's March of  Florida.   In 2003, the longtime consequences of her Meniere's disease became  unbearable, resulting in severe hearing loss. In 2016, Lisa moved to  Longwood, Florida. Like everyone else in her new community, she was  horrified by the Pulse nightclub shooting. The lack of family support  for some of the victims combined with memories of post-9/11 days,  prompted Lisa to reach out to the affected communities offering a safe  place and a safe space for frightened neighbors as well as visiting  victims' families.   When Hurricanes Irma and Maria worsened Puerto Rico's already  delicate situation, Lisa refocused her advocacy efforts on achieving a  just recovery for her islands. Lisa is currently vice president of  Diaspora en Resistencia, an international coalition of human  rights organizations working for a better future for Puerto Rico. She  also sits on the steering committee for Vamos4PR.    For that, Lisa Santoni Cromar, we honor you.                           Recognizing Karen Green     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Karen Green.   Reverend Dr. Karen R. Green, a proud Jamaican-born Caribbean  American, is a former U.N. Humanitarian Religious Ambassador At Large.  She is a tireless community advocate and social justice crusader  fighting to enhance the rights of women, defend religious freedoms, and  secure the civil liberties of immigrants.   As a resident of Florida for over 20 years, Dr. Green has leveraged  her talents as a respected political strategist, campaign manager, and  expert mediator. She has served as the Democratic Party's former  Caribbean Coalition Director for the State of Florida and its  territories. Her vast political and voter advocacy record includes  service as field officer for President Barack Obama's Presidential  election campaign, Coalition Director for Hillary Clinton's  Presidential primary and general election campaigns, and political  advance to U.S. territories.   Dr. Green has led on issues of universal healthcare, a woman's right  to choose, and immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship under  DAPA and DACA as well. Dr. Green is also noted to have been  instrumental on the front lines of the fight to secure in-state tuition  for undocumented students living in Florida.   Dr. Green currently serves as the CEO of the Liberty and Justice for  All Community Foundation and is the primary partner at Blue Fields  Consultants International.   Passion for service and a strong sense of dedication to critical  social issues is clearly a key motivating force for Dr. Green.   She merits these values to her Christian beliefs and cultural  experiences as a Jamaican-born immigrant.   She quotes Marcus Mosiah Garvey himself, a Jamaican native and noted  civil rights leader, with: ``A people without the knowledge of their  past history, culture, and origin is like a tree without roots.''   And for that, Ms. Karen Green, we honor you.                                time  2030                           Recognizing Kim Porteous     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Kim Porteous.   Kim Porteous is one of many activists ignited by the modern women's  movement at the March on Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2017.   She is a community organizer who is supported by a community of  women. Although she has been involved in advocacy throughout her life,  she knew, as a former survivor of rape, workplace sexual assaults, and  domestic abuse, that she needed to make it her life's work to stand for  women, sexual assault victims, the disabled, the LGBTQ community,  immigrants, Dreamers, against climate change, for religious minorities,  and to promote healthcare.   She is committed to amplifying the voices of marginalized communities  through intersectional feminism and uniting communities regardless of  their privilege.   The 2016 election led Kim to amplify her message of equality beyond  her circle of friends and get out in the community to engage.   She has had the privilege of supporting organizations and community  partners, including the National Organization for Women, Organize  Florida, Planned Parenthood, For Our Future, ADAPT, Rubio Tuesdays,  Hope House, Moms Demand Action, March for Women, and Fight for $15 an  Hour.   Kim is currently the vice president of the Greater Orlando chapter of  the National Organization for Women and is focused on sustained action  to achieve the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.   And for that, Ms. Kim Porteous, we honor you.                          Recognizing Rasha Mubarak     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Rasha Mubarak.

Rasha leads educational panel discussions dispelling stereotypes  about Muslim women.   In 2015, she cofounded Floridians Responding to Refugees,  spearheading efforts to welcome and transition refugees.   She was previously a mental health counseling volunteer with the  Palestine Medical Relief Society in Ramallah, aiding women and children  suffering from PTSD.   And for that, Ms. Rasha Mubarak, we honor you.                   Recognizing Nicolette Fariello Springer     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Nicolette Fariello Springer.   Nicolette is the sort of woman who does not fit conveniently into a  mold. She is a criminologist, college educator, and a doting mother to  her two daughters, Emmerson and Avery.   With a master's degree in criminal justice from the University of  Central Florida, Nicolette specializes in mental health and substance  abuse. She was the assistant director of the Criminal Justice Mental  Health Substance Abuse Technical Assistance Center, where she focused  on program evaluation and policy analysis across the State of Florida.   Nicolette's research areas include mental health court, drug court,  and corrections. It is her work in criminal justice that informs her  work as a community activist, championing issues around adverse  childhood experiences, social justice, and access to education and  healthcare.   Nicolette serves as the champion leader for central and north Florida  for  [[Page H2637]]  the United Nations Foundation Shot@Life Campaign, which focuses on  advocating for access to vaccines in the developing world.   On the local front, she co-leads a Girl Scout troop of 27 girls and  gives them the opportunity to see the best in themselves.   Nicolette's activism led her to run for office during the historic  Pink Wave of 2018. She parlayed her own campaign experience into a  full-time position on a Democratic gubernatorial campaign and continues  to advocate for progressive values.   She is currently one of the co-chairs of the Juvenile Justice  Committee for the Central Florida League of Women Voters and serves on  the Victory Council for Ruth's List Florida. She is the legislative  analyst for the League of Women Voters of Florida, empowering voters  and helping improve the lives of all Floridians.   For that, Nicolette Fariello Springer, we honor you.                           Recognizing Iza Montalvo     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Iza Montalvo.   Iza Montalvo lives in Orlando with her husband and two sons. She is  an award-winning journalist, former news executive, radio anchor,  television producer, and congressional staffer recognized by the United  States Congress for her contributions to the Hispanic community. In  2015, Vision magazine named her as one of central Florida's most  influential Hispanics.    Under her leadership as the former editor-in-chief of La Prensa, the  oldest running publication in central Florida and also founded by a  relative of mine, readership almost doubled in 1 year alone.   As a reporter for the largest Spanish-language media outlet in the  country, some of her stories gained national attention during her  almost 20-year journalism career.   While working as a reporter, she covered news events like the  protests at the United Nations against the U.S. Navy military practices  in the island of Vieques, protests in Times Square against the war in  Iraq, the aftermath of 9/11, the World Economic Forum, and the New York  blackout.   She has had the opportunity to interview high-profile politicians and  celebrities of worldwide recognition as well as holding an exclusive  interview with the Federal agent who stopped the 20th hijacker from  catching a flight during the terrorist attacks on 9/11.   Her reporting with the Puerto Rican diaspora, neglected communities  of color, Latinx and migrant communities earned her recognitions and  awards from the prestigious National Association of Hispanic  Publications.   She served as the press secretary of two U.S. Representatives before  taking her vast experience into a new business venture. She currently  is the founder and president of the Olan Group, a purpose-led  communications, research, and consultancy firm in Orlando.   As an independent journalist and media strategist, she is focused on  raising awareness about underreported issues affecting the world, like  environmental justice and women's rights, in Spanish language and media  outlets covering the Latinx experience in the U.S.   She also served as our press secretary from 2017 to 2018 and did an  absolutely fantastic job.   And for that, Ms. Iza Montalvo, we honor you.               Recognizing Dr. Catherine ``Elizabeth'' McCarthy     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Dr. Catherine ``Elizabeth'' McCarthy.   Dr. Elizabeth McCarthy currently serves as the legislative director  for the Florida LGBT Democratic Caucus and as federal chair of the  Democratic Women's Club of Florida.   Born in Richmond, Virginia, she moved to Florida in 1981. After  attending high school in Pasco County, she attended the University of  Florida and Florida State University on basketball scholarships and  graduated from Florida State in 1992 with a degree in criminology.   She then went back to school to become a nurse. After spending 25  years working as a cardio operating room registered nurse for the  Florida Heart Group, she decided to attend medical school at the  University of Central Florida and soon became a cardiologist.   Elizabeth was working at Orlando Regional Medical Center the night of  the horrific Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. As a doctor,  her work was vital in saving the lives of many victims and members of  our community. She was able to remove 77 bullets out of 32 victims.   As a member of the LGBT community and an LGBT activist, she now  serves on the One Pulse Foundation Memorial Task Force, established to  create a sanctuary of hope and to grant care for the families of  victims and survivors.   And for that, Dr. Elizabeth McCarthy, we honor you.                        Recognizing Ann Marie Siefker     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Ann Marie Siefker.   Ann Marie Siefker was born on May 8, 1957. She attended Cardinal  Gibbons High School and graduated from Florida Atlantic University with  a degree in education.

Ms. Ann Marie Siefker, for that, we honor you.                   Recognizing Christina Whitfield Atkinson     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Christina Whitfield Atkinson.   Christina Whitfield Atkinson resides with her husband, Jeffrey; their  four dogs; and is supported by her son, Thomas; two stepdaughters,  Mariah and Amber; and her four grandchildren.   She has long believed women are the backbone to any successful,  prosperous society. She has earned both a bachelor's and master's  degree in business administration and has worked for the past 20 years  in multiple professional capacities, including owning a dental supply  company; working in risk management, internet security, insurance  claims, as an adjunct university professor; and has dedicated hundreds  of hours to various charities.   She believes in promoting a philosophy of integrity and honor through  giving back to those who have given her so much. She believes there is  no greater honor than participating in and promoting philanthropic  activities.   In January 2018, after leaving her role in corporate America, she was  appointed as the VA representative for Soldiers' Angels. As the wife of  an Air Force veteran, sister to a Navy veteran, and mother-in-law to an  Active-Duty Army soldier, Christina was thrilled to volunteer for one  of the highest ranked 501(c)3 organizations, which is dedicated to  supporting our military veterans.   Christina oversees a diverse group of volunteers in the Orlando area  who visit veterans who are patients at the VA Hospital at Lake Nona;  help with veteran support events, including distributing gifts and  blankets from the community; and oversee the monthly mobile food  distribution, which provides 200 low-income veterans 50 pounds of food  each month.    If she is not at the VA supporting our veterans, she is reaching deep  into the community to find other groups and business and community  leaders to help our military veterans.   Her love of the military is her primary focus in all she does and is  permanently ingrained in her.   And for that, Ms. Christina Whitfield Atkinson, we honor you.                         Recognizing Chloe C. Battle     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want to  recognize Chloe C. Battle.   Chloe Battle works in Orlando, Florida, as the executive director for  the local food pantry called Servant's Heart Ministry. The faith-based  organization feeds children, seniors, and other vulnerable individuals  through community partnerships by providing basic needs, empowering  people to grow and thrive in their own neighborhoods, and offering  opportunities for people to serve.   Ms. Battle's mission is to feed the hungry, and she also advocates  for building relationships, which she says is the most important part  of serving and is the cornerstone for community  [[Page H2638]]  health. When you get to know a family at the interpersonal level, their  needs become more apparent and easier to address, and resources  provided become more meaningful to them.   Before entering the nonprofit sector, Ms. Battle acquired her  bachelor of science in psychology from Indiana University, working out  of a prestigious child development lab. She developed a keen interest  in health psychology and social work and, from there, maintained a  personal commitment to caregiving, family, advocacy, and community  casework.   Ms. Battle cites that her strength comes from God and personal  experience, and her growth as a leader and community partner drives her  forward to show others how everyone can do something and that education  and nurturing is the key to the success of all families.   And for that, Ms. Chloe C. Battle, we honor you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
