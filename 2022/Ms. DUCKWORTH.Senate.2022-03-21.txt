 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Nani  A. Coloretti, of California, to be Deputy Director of the Office of  Management and Budget; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, it makes no sense to say that we are  not getting answers so we are not going to confirm anybody to this  position of Deputy Director of OMB. We only just confirmed the Director  last week.   It is like saying: I am going to the emergency room because I have an  emergency, and there are no doctors working there to solve my problem  so we are not going to let any more doctors in to work there. It makes  no sense.   I am deeply disappointed the Republicans are objecting to the swift  confirmation of the Honorable Nani Coloretti to be Deputy Director of  the Office of Management and Budget.   She came through committee; she was reported out of committee; and if  there were any questions of her, they should have been asked in  committee.   But, again, we are holding up the nomination of someone to lead an  Agency that you are complaining isn't answering your questions. Well,  there is no leadership there to make sure that those questions get  answered. So this is a circular logic that does not make any sense.    In fact, Ms. Coloretti is eminently qualified to hold this position  of Deputy Director of OMB. Like many members of our Nation's diverse  Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community, Ms.  Coloretti and her family lived the American dream of countless  immigrants who came to the Nation in search of a better life. Her late  parents instilled in her the value of education and hard work and,  perhaps more importantly, fostered a sense of empathy and curiosity  that helped lead Ms. Coloretti to choose a life of public service. And  make no mistake, she is a true public servant who is devoted to serving  her country.   Her nomination should not be controversial. After all, a bipartisan  supermajority coalition of Senators already confirmed her to serve as  Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Of course, this  overwhelming support was not surprising, given Ms. Coloretti's  impressive experience in the public and private sectors, including  serving as a program examiner at OMB.   During her time in public service, Ms. Coloretti dedicated herself to  making government work better for the people it serves. At the U.S.  Department of Treasury, she pushed to enhance decision-making processes  through better use of data and evidence.   At the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, where she  served as a Chief Operating Officer of a Department with a $45 billion  budget and approximately 8,000 employees, Ms.  [[Page S1266]]  Coloretti focused on strengthening management practices to improve  program delivery and ultimately achieve better results.   Look, there is no question that Nani Coloretti is eminently qualified  to be Deputy Director of the OMB, nor is there any question that the  President deserves to have his full leadership slate in place to  formulate and finalize his fiscal year 2023 budget proposal.   As the President often notes, a budget truly reveals what one values,  and that is why it was so important that the Senate confirmed the  Honorable Shalanda Young to be OMB Director last week.   Now, my question is, If you want to fix the problem and get answers,  let's get somebody like Nani Coloretti in there who has got a  background and a track record of getting Departments and Agencies  working correctly, working again efficiently for the American people.  That is why it is critical that we move swiftly to confirm Nani  Coloretti now.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have one request for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 21, 2022, at 11 a.m., to conduct  a hearing.
