 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dan  Glessing, the newest president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation.  Dan has served as vice president and as a member of the Minnesota Farm  Bureau board for more than 8 years. He recently was elected to serve as  the 14th president of the bureau on November 19 following the  announcement of Kevin Paap's retirement in March after serving 16 years  in his position as president.   Our office and I personally have been fortunate to know and work with  Dan for many years already. Dan and his family are the definition of  the great American farming tradition. He has always been a steadfast  advocate for our State's farmers and producers. I am proud that Dan,  his wife, Seena, and the entire Glessing family call Minnesota's Sixth  District home.   There are many challenges ahead for Dan, but I know he will continue  to be a leader for all of Minnesota's farmers, ranchers, producers, and  agribusinesses. I congratulate Dan on his new leadership role, and I  look forward to working with him and everyone at the Minnesota Farm  Bureau on behalf of Minnesota's agriculture community.                            ____________________
