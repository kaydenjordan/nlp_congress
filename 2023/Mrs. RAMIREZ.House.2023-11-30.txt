 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of my friend and constituent, Oscar Ortiz, a devoted champion for  educational equity.   Oscar was a visionary. He believed that education was a powerful tool  to realize our collective potential and dreams. As a teacher, ``el  maestro,'' ``teacher,'' Ortiz helped the students find their power and  joy in learning. As an organizer with the Chicago Teachers Union, he  energized our community to advance social justice and equity through  education.   Oscar committed his time on Earth to building a future for everyone.  His passion and optimism were infectious. I am going to miss him  dearly, and I know countless others will, too.   To his family and loved ones, know you are in my heart and prayers.  Together, let's celebrate the blessing he was in our lives and the mark  he has left in our city of Chicago. A bullhorn will never be the same  after Oscar Ortiz. May his passion for change and love of community  always guide us.   Rest in power, Oscar Ortiz. We love you.                            ____________________
