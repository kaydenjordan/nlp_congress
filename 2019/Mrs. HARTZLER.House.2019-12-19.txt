 Madam Speaker, this week represented the best of times  and the worst of times.   Yesterday displayed the worst of times by impeaching the President  for political reasons and reversing the will of 63 million Americans.   Today, however, represents the best of times by finally voting to  approve the USMCA.   This historic agreement, which has been held up by Speaker Pelosi for  over a year, will bring 176,000 new jobs and spur $68 billion in new  economic activity. It removes trade barriers for our ag products,  creating new markets for our farmers and helping rural America as a  result.   Encouragingly, the auto industry will benefit as well. Just last  week, General Motors announced that it would be investing over $1  billion in a truck plant in my home State of Missouri due to the USMCA.   This agreement moves our relationship with Mexico and Canada into the  21st century, and will benefit the American farmer, the American  worker, and the American consumer.   I applaud President Trump for delivering on this historic trade  agreement.   I look forward to voting ``yes'' on the USMCA and bringing more jobs  to our great country.
