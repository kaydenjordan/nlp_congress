 Mr. President, as a fellow member of the Judiciary  Committee, along with my colleague from Texas who just spoke, it is not  our job as members of this committee to cast aspersions on the motives  of those of us who ask probing questions of judicial nominees for  lifetime positions. Many of these nominees have very strongly held and  long-held views on a number of issues that may come before them as  judges, and the probing questions we ask go to whether they can  separate their ideological and personal views when they are confronted  with issues they have taken public positions on and whether they can be  fair and objective and follow the rule of law. Those are the kinds of  probing questions we ask.   I hope that when my friend from Texas mentioned that some of us seem  to--that many of us on this side of the aisle will not vote for any  nominee from this President, I certainly hope he wasn't referring to me  because I have, in fact, voted for a number of those nominees.                                    S. 47    Mr. President, having clarified that, I want to talk about the  Natural Resources Management Act that is coming before us. This is a  great example of what the Senate can accomplish when we come together  on a bipartisan basis to get things done.   Although we certainly have disagreements on energy and climate  policy, a broad bipartisan consensus supports strengthening and  expanding conservation programs like the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--better known as LWCF--a program whose transformative impact is  felt in every State in the country.   Over the past 50 years, the LWCF has provided nearly $250 million in  funding for Hawaii to protect some of its most cherished public spaces,  including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hanalei National Wildlife  Refuge, and the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail. LWCF funding has  also gone toward protecting State and private forests, as well as  efforts to protect our native species and watersheds.   I saw the benefits firsthand last April when I joined Keith Unger and  his family for a blessing ceremony to mark the sale of the McCandless  Ranch to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Financed through the LWCF,  the $22 million purchase significantly expanded the Hakalau Forest  National Wildlife Refuge on Hawaii island.   After a slow, 45-minute ascent up the slopes of Mauna Loa, I saw a  beautiful property that the McCandless family had faithfully stewarded  over six generations and 100 years. According to Keith, the property's  forests ``represent some of the most intact and pristine native forests  in the state and provide habitat to many of Hawaii's unique flora and  fauna.''   During the time I spent with Keith and his family, their passion for  the land and the plant and animal species that call it home was quite  evident. Keith shared his family's efforts to conserve and rehabilitate  the alala--the critically endangered Hawaiian crow. The McCandless  Ranch was the last place the alala was seen in the wild.   In the late 1990s, the McCandless Ranch entered into a conservation  partnership with the Fish & Wildlife Service to protect the alala. When  Keith decided to sell a portion of his land years ago, he wanted to  find what he called a ``like minded buyer, someone who would continue  our legacy of  [[Page S886]]  conservation and well managed forests. This was easier said than done.  The majority of our buyer prospects were loggers or developers.'' Keith  and McCandless Ranch began talking with the Fish & Wildlife Service  about selling a portion of their property to add to the national  wildlife refuge. Through his past experience working with the Agency,  he ``knew that their conservation philosophy aligned with ours.''   The Fish & Wildlife Service began seeking money to acquire the  property in 2011 and made it their top priority for acquisition in the  Pacific region for fiscal years 2013 through 2015. Funding to acquire  the McCandless Ranch became possible because of the collaborative work  to develop the State of Hawaii's ``Island Forests at Risk'' proposal.  Developed through engagement with a wide range of stakeholders,  ``Island Forests at Risk'' was a comprehensive proposal to protect  endangered or threatened species, safeguard water resources, improve  ecosystems, and preserve Native Hawaiian cultural resources. This  proposal included a number of land acquisitions to add to existing  national parks and wildlife refuges in Hawaii, including the McCandless  Ranch addition to Hakalau.   In addition to Federal land management agencies such as the National  Park Service, the Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service,  ``Island Forests at Risk'' incorporated input and perspectives from  Hawaii's State agencies, such as the Department of Land and Natural  Resources, local organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy Hawaii  and The Trust for Public Land, and local landowners, such as Keith  Unger with the McCandless Ranch.   Beginning in fiscal year 2016, after many meetings between myself and  the principals overseeing the LWCF proposals, Hawaii's land acquisition  within ``Island Forests at Risk'' began to receive Federal funding.  Between fiscal years 2016 and 2018, nearly $40 million was awarded to  acquire land to add to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Haleakala  National Park, and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge.   In addition to facilitating the purchase of land such as the  McCandless Ranch, the LWCF also funds the Fish & Wildlife Service's  Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. In Hawaii, we have  over 500 threatened and endangered species--more than any other State.  One-third of all endangered birds in the United States are found in  Hawaii. LWCF funds are essential for protecting and reintroducing these  species, including the alala.   The LWCF also funds the Forest Legacy Program, which helps States and  private owners protect and enhance forest habitats. The program has  leveraged over $22 million of Federal funding for Hawaii's forests over  the past 50 years.   Most recently, the Forest Legacy Program helped facilitate the  acquisition of the Helemano Wilderness Area on Oahu. This land includes  high-quality native forests that are home to the endangered Hawaiian  hoary bat and a watershed that is a primary source of drinking water  for one-third of the people on Oahu.   Program funding will facilitate invasive species' removal and  reforestation. It will also provide public access to hunting and  camping areas, which are limited on Oahu. Oahu is the island on which  the majority of the people of Hawaii live. Eighty percent of the people  live on Oahu.   Forest protection and conservation are particularly important as we  face the threat of catastrophic climate change. Protecting these lands  and forests can help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon  dioxide, cooling the Earth, and regenerating our watersheds.   Aside from helping mitigate climate change, the LWCF provides  numerous downstream benefits to local economies. In 2003, for example,  the LWCF funded the $22 million addition of Kahuku Ranch to Hawaii  Volcanoes National Park--almost doubling the park's size.   Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a pillar of our tourism economy in  Hawaii. It contributes nearly half a million dollars every day--or $166  million annually--to the economy and attracts approximately 2 million  visitors per year. That is just one park--Hawaii Volcanoes National  Park.   Aside from the LWCF, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has also  benefited from programs and organizations like KUPU that educate and  inspire youth to become stewards of our natural resources. KUPU  provides hands-on training for youth in the areas of conservation,  sustainability, and environmental education. It has also placed youth  workers within various units of the National Park System in Hawaii to  conduct trail repair, vegetation management, interpretation, et cetera.   The 21st Century Conservation Service Corps bill included in the  Natural Resources Management Act that will come before us supports  programs like KUPU that seek to nurture the next generation of  environmental stewards.   In testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last  Congress, KUPU CEO John Leong spoke to the transformative impact of  participating in a conservation program. He cited two inspiring  examples of Corps members who have gone on to do meaningful work in the  environmental and conservation space. He shared the story of John Brito  from Molokai, who was awarded the White House Champion of Change Award  in the years following his participation in KUPU programming and who  has since chosen a career in conservation. Another KUPU Corps  participant, Justine Espiritu, recently helped to launch Honolulu's  popular and revolutionary Biki bike share.   More adults in Hawaii and across the country will have their own  transformative experiences if we pass this legislation.   The Natural Resources Management Act also includes legislation  Senators Murkowski, Cantwell, and I passed last Congress to improve our  country's capacity to monitor and respond to volcanic activity across  the country.   Last year, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, HVO, was instrumental in  studying and responding to the 3-month-long eruption of Kilaeua on the  Big Island. The eruption devastated a number of communities, destroying  more than 700 homes and displacing thousands of people, including  United States Geological Survey staff and scientists who operated out  of the HVO facility in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.   Over the coming months and years, impacted homes, farms, and even the  observatory will need to be rebuilt.   At the same time, it will be critically important to have the most  updated monitoring and communications technology to alert and protect  impacted communities from future events.   Our legislation will unify and connect the Hawaiian Volcano  Observatory with the other four observatories across the country into  one national volcano early warning system.   It will also create a volcano watch office that will operate 24 hours  a day, 7 days a week, to provide continuous situational awareness of  all active volcanos in the United States and its territories, including  Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes on Hawaii island.   Our legislation will also create a grant program for the research and  development of emerging technologies for our volcano monitoring.   During yesterday's cloture vote, the Natural Resources Management Act  earned the support of 99 out of 100 Senators. I don't know what  happened to that lone Senator, but we need to bring that person in. I  am eager to vote on its final passage as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.
