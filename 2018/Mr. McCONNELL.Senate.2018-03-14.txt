 Mr. President, hearts are heavy in Pikeville, KY, this  morning. Last night, Officer Scotty Hamilton, a 12-year veteran of the  Pikeville Police Department, was shot and killed in the line of duty.   The investigation is ongoing. My Kentucky staff and I are monitoring  the situation closely.   For now, our sincere condolences go out to his family, friends, and  colleagues at the Pikeville Police Department.   Officer Hamilton leaves behind a wife, a young daughter, and a  community that is safer for his service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter,  this will be a busy day for the Senate. Today, Senator Thune and our  colleagues on the Commerce Committee will continue their hearings on  rebuilding America's infrastructure.   Notably, five Cabinet Secretaries will testify: Secretaries of Labor,  Commerce, Energy, Agriculture, and Transportation will all share the  administration's ideas for cutting redtape, streamlining permitting,  and aligning Federal resources with local needs.   I am grateful for the Trump administration's commitment to this  issue, and I hope this week's hearings, along with the ongoing work of  our colleagues on Environment and Public Works, Appropriations, and  other committees, will keep building momentum.   Bipartisan results are achievable this year, starting with billions  of added funding for infrastructure improvements in the budget  agreement, and extending to the work of many committees in the months  ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today we will also finish considering  the bipartisan banking reform bill championed by Senator Crapo. The  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is  cosponsored by a quarter of the Senate--split down the middle between  Republicans and Democrats--and was advanced earlier this week by two- thirds of our colleagues. That is because this modest but essential  bill tackles a problem that hurts communities in red States and in blue  States. It hurts rural areas, farm towns, suburbs, and urban  neighborhoods.   The problem is this. The Dodd-Frank Act has proven to be far too  blunt of an instrument for regulating our financial system. Regulations  meant for Wall Street are crushing Main Street.   Community banks and credit unions play a vital role in our economy.  Smaller lenders provide more than 50 percent of small business loans  and nearly 80 percent of agricultural loans, but they are struggling to  keep their heads above the tide of complicated regulations and  compliance costs. Many are going under, and when they do, research  shows that access to capital shrinks for small businesses, farmers,  ranchers, and low-income Americans.   Senator Crapo's legislation helps to fix this. It streamlines  regulations and  [[Page S1696]]  tailors the rules so smaller lenders aren't caught up in the web of  regulations aimed at the biggest banks.   Senators had and still have a wide diversity of views on Dodd-Frank,  but all of us should at least agree that Wall Street and Main Street  are very different, and that one-size-fits-all is a poor way to address  this issue.   I look forward to voting to pass this bill later on today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, this afternoon  President Trump will visit a Boeing production facility in St. Louis.  He will hear from local business leaders about how tax reform is giving  them room to invest more and hire more.   Missouri's senior Senator tried to block tax reform on a party-line  vote. Fortunately, their Republican Senator voted to let them realize  this prosperity.   For months now, the headlines have been filled with businesses large  and small using tax reform to give workers bonuses, pay raises, and new  benefits. But raises and bonuses aren't the only ways that tax reform  will help hardworking families.   Thanks to the efforts of Senator Heller and others in the committee,  tax reform doubled the child tax credit and extended it to more middle- class families. When they file their taxes next year, families will be  able to take $2,000 off of their tax bill for every qualifying child.   My friend the Democratic leader said repeatedly that tax reform would  do nothing to help American workers. The Democratic leader in the House  said the law would bring about ``Armageddon.'' I am not sure where they  get their predictions, but I don't think they will carry much water  with middle-class families in Missouri or Indiana or West Virginia or  certainly in Kentucky.   For brand-new parents facing one expense after another, the $2,000  credit will more than cover the cost of a brand-new washer and dryer  set or a new refrigerator. For a middle-class family of four, the  credit is $4,000. That more than covers the standard down payment on a  used car, priced at the national average, or it could kick off a  college savings fund.   Just ``crumbs''--really? Maybe adding thousands of dollars to family  budgets looks like crumbs in New York or San Francisco, but to most  Americans around most kitchen tables, that is real money, and so is the  adoption tax credit, which keeps the IRS's hands off more of the hard- earned money that adoptive families need to cover expenses.   Last autumn, I met a wonderful family from Franklin, KY, who adopted  their son from Ethiopia in the face of many hurdles and difficulties.  His mother wrote my office. She told me:         Our sweet boy is worth every dime and tear.    They were counting on that tax credit, as were many other families.  Republicans made sure this credit was preserved.   Here is how that Kentucky mother described the impact. She said:         The tax credit we will receive . . . has allowed us to pay       off the last remaining debt we owed. Such a weight lifted off       our shoulders.    New pro-family tax cuts and new pro-family tax credits, all while  protecting existing pro-family provisions that Americans rely on--that  is what every Democrat voted against, but fortunately, it is what every  Senate Republican voted for. So the American people won in the end.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
