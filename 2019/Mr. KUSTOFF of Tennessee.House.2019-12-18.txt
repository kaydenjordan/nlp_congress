 Madam Speaker, going back almost 3 years to  when the President was sworn into office, we have seen some Members on  the other side of the aisle pledging and promising to impeach President  Trump. Prior to the start of this inquiry, Speaker Pelosi claimed that  the impeachment must be compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan. The  impeachment inquiry was announced less than 3 months ago, and what we  know is that the process has been fast, faulty, and flawed.   What we have witnessed since September 24, when the inquiry was  announced, is that the evidence we have seen is not compelling, it is  not overwhelming, and the process is undoubtedly and unquestionably not  bipartisan.   I am viewing this through the lens of a former United States  Attorney, and as we take this vote, here is the bottom line for the  American people: there was no bribery, there was no extortion, there  was no quid pro quo, and there were no high crimes and misdemeanors  committed by the President.
