 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 250th  anniversary of Botetourt County, Virginia. When initially founded,  Botetourt County extended far and wide, all the way to the banks of the  Mississippi River, and encompassed portions of seven present-day  States.   Named for Royal Governor Norborne Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, this  scenic county serves as a gateway from the Shenandoah Valley into  southwest Virginia.   As you walk through the quaint towns within the county's borders, you  are filled with a sense of awe, not only because of its beauty, but  because of the history that surrounds you.   Thomas Jefferson famously designed an earlier version of the county  courthouse in the town of Fincastle, and Lewis and Clark departed on  their great expedition westward from within Botetourt County.   Even after exploring the vast western expanse of America, William  Clark returned to marry county resident, Judith Hancock, following his  journey.   Just as the James River flows through Botetourt County, our citizens  will continue to carve out their path toward prosperity with excitement  and hope in the centuries to come.   Madam Speaker, may God continue to bless Botetourt County.                            ____________________
