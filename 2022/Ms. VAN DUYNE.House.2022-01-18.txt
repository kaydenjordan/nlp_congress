 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor America's heroes  as they protected the faithful members of Texas-24 in their place of  worship over the weekend. We witnessed a terrorist threat in our  community, as he held four worshippers hostage in the Congregation Beth  Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas.   The brave men and women of our community selflessly rose to show our  neighbors and our country that we will always stand together in unity  to support each other. We proved this as the Colleyville Police  Department responded immediately to the threat. Local churches showed  their support as Good Shepherd Catholic Community Church opened its  doors to take in the evacuees and families of hostages until the  situation was resolved. Pleasant Run Baptist Church also opened its  doors for others and displayed prayer signs for their ``brothers and  sisters at Beth Israel.''   We are grateful for everyone who stepped up to serve their neighbors,  and commend the resilience of the four who were held hostage against  their will, including Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, whose courageous  actions led to the safe escape of his fellow hostages.   As we await further details, we ask for your continued support and  prayers for the Colleyville community and the Congregation Beth Israel  synagogue.                            ____________________
