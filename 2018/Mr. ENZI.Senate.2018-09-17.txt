 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider the conference report to H.R. 6157, a  spending measure covering programs within the jurisdiction of the  Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense and Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, Labor-HHSE. The  Defense portion of this legislation includes funding designated as  overseas contingency operations funding pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. The Labor-HHSE portion includes spending  designated for various program integrity efforts pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section 251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA.  The inclusion of these designations with these provisions makes this  spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act.   On August 16, 2018, I filed an adjustment relating to S. Amdt. 3695  to H.R. 6157, which contained appropriations for the same two  appropriations subcommittees. The Defense portion of the amendment  contained $67,914 million in revised security budget authority  designated as overseas contingency operations and $37,285 million in  outlays, and the Labor-HHSE portion contained $1,897 million in revised  nonsecurity budget authority for program integrity initiatives with  $1,573 million in outlays. The budgetary adjustment was made to  accommodate this spending.   Since the levels of budget authority for overseas contingency  operations and budget authority and outlays for program integrity  spending in the conference report are consistent with the previously  filed levels and appropriately designated, those funds are now  available for use in this conference report. However, the amount of  outlays flowing from the overseas contingency operations funding in the  conference report is estimated to be $214 million less than my earlier  adjustment. Therefore, I am reducing the general purpose outlay  allocation to the Appropriations Committee and budgetary aggregates to  reflect this new estimate at this time.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.................................          3,617,479     Outlays..........................................          3,546,608 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.................................                  0     Outlays..........................................               -214 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.................................          3,617,479     Outlays..........................................          3,546,394 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget Authority..            715,835     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget            598,897      Authority.......................................
