 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor those who have made  the ultimate sacrifice for the protection of freedom.   While the circumstances that brought our heroes to combat vary, their  sacrifice is the same. They died protecting their fellow soldiers in  the foxhole, the skies, and the seas. We can never fully grasp the  unique story of each of our fallen, but let us never forget the  patriotic lesson that our Nation's bravest remind us.   Among them, we do not pursue freedom in support of the United States,  we pursue the United States in support of freedom.   On this Memorial Day as the Nation collectively pauses to remember  those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, let us also contemplate  what their sacrifice teaches us. The United States and its Constitution  are more than a mutually beneficial agreement between the States. The  final cause of our union is the universal principle of freedom.   Many of our heroes lost their lives protecting the freedom of their  friends, family, and neighbors. Others died in defense of freedom  belonging to those they had never met. The sacrifice of our fallen  servicemen and -women, including thousands from the Third District of  New York, reminds us of this.    Today and every day, Mr. Speaker, let us honor the lives of our  fallen military personnel and let their lessons guide our every  decision as we move toward a free world. Let that be what we talk about  on this Memorial Day.                            ____________________
