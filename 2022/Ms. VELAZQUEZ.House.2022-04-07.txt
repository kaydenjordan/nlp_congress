 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1033, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3807) to amend the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021  to increase appropriations to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3807.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3807, the Relief for  Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 2022.   This bill will provide $42 billion to replenish the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund and allocate $13 billion to launch a new industry- neutral relief program for the small businesses most impacted by the  pandemic.   Last year, Congress created the RRF under the American Rescue Plan to  provide targeted relief to struggling small restaurants. The program  delivered emergency aid to over 100,000 employers in communities across  the country. This grant was a critical lifeline and allowed businesses  to keep their lights on and continue to pay their employees.   Despite the program's success, approximately 177,000 small businesses  are still awaiting relief. While these companies are dispersed  throughout the country, they are united by a common message: Small  firms are still hurting, and they are counting on Congress for more  support.   That is why we must act to replenish the RRF and deliver long-awaited  aid to hundreds of thousands of restaurants across the country.   H.R. 3807 also takes the crucial step of creating a new $13 billion  hard-hit industries award program, which will extend aid to businesses  with the greatest revenue losses that were ineligible or unable to  access relief through other means. Rather than picking winners and  losers, this industry-neutral program makes hard-hit companies the  priority.   These programs are offset by utilizing recovered money from fraud  cases in the pandemic relief programs. Congress will take the money  that was fraudulently obtained and put it in the hands of small  businesses that need it the most.   The SBA OIG, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, and  [[Page H4405]]  the Department of Justice are all working aggressively to investigate  and prosecute instances of fraud and abuse, and this bill provides them  with much-needed support. By allocating $30 million to oversight  funding, today's legislation ensures these offices have the resources  needed to pursue bad actors and reclaim money Congress intended to help  small businesses.   Small employers and entrepreneurs are the backbone of our communities  and economies, and they cannot be ignored. Without today's legislation,  our local communities risk losing these critical job creators. We  simply cannot ignore them in their time of need.   Members on both sides of the aisle have come together numerous times  throughout the pandemic to pass legislation to support small firms.  Today gives us the opportunity to do that once more.   I urge my colleagues to meet this moment and pass this bill so that  these businesses can stop treading water and start looking to the  future.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
