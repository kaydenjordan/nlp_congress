 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the past year and a half,  Washington Democrats have continually found new ways to be wrong about  the U.S. economy. Last springtime, Democrats insisted their plan to  dump $1.9 trillion onto the economy would not cause inflation.   Here was the Democratic leader in March of 2021:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near term, are very real.    And here was President Biden:         The biggest risk is not going too big . . . it's if we go       too small.''    Well, obviously, they were entirely wrong. Their reckless spending  fueled the worst inflation in 40 years. As Ms. Alvarado, a teacher and  mother of three, explained to a reporter--here is what she said:         When I say, ``OK, we cannot buy anything this week or else       we'll go into overdraft,'' [my husband] says, ``No, what are       you talking about? We're both working. That shouldn't       happen.''    Well, it shouldn't have happened, but it is exactly what Democrats'  policies have inflicted on working families in this country.         Every time I fill up our van, I'm flabbergasted--    Ms. Alvarado explains--         I'm always worrying. . . . I can postpone the mortgage by       two weeks, but then it becomes two more weeks, and then all       of a sudden they're calling you.    After Democrats' policies that did cause inflation, they moved on to  their next wrong prediction. President Biden admitted inflation did, in  fact, exist but said it was ``expected to be temporary.'' That one  didn't work out either. That was over a year ago.   Then, 7 months ago, in early December, President Biden promised  inflation had peaked--wrong again. It didn't peak in December. It just  kept getting worse. Inflation set a fresh new 40-year high just last  month.   These same folks are preparing for yet another battle against  reality. In advance of the GDP numbers coming out later this week, the  Biden administration has begun their latest project: a frantic effort  to redefine the word ``recession.'' The White House published a whole  explanation insisting that even if the new data suggested our country  is in recession, we actually won't be.   It is almost beyond satire. The White House isn't focusing their  energies on  [[Page S3621]]  correcting their mistakes and making the economy better for working  families who are hurting. Instead, their priority is telling everybody  things aren't as bad as they look or feel. They want working Americans  like Ms. Alvarado to believe Democrats' spin instead of their own lying  eyes.   I guess the whopping 42 percent of Americans who say they are  struggling to stay where they are financially are supposed to read the  White House press release and cheer up. The same people who said  inflation wouldn't happen and then said it would be transitory and then  said it had peaked last year are now insisting we aren't heading into a  recession. Well, draw your own conclusions.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, on another matter, staring down the barrel of the  economic disaster they have created, Washington Democrats still don't  appear to be pumping the brakes on their reckless agenda. For example,  the same Democrats who spent our country into inflation are now angling  to regulate our medical cures industry into fewer new cures and fewer  lifesaving treatments.   American researchers and manufacturers are the driving force behind  cutting-edge treatments that the entire world relies on. American  innovators are leading the races to cure terminal illnesses like  Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.   The entire world benefits from our genius, but, in particular, the  American people get first and fastest access to the latest new  treatments, cures, and medical marvels. But the Democrats' pursuit of  prescription drug socialism could put all of this at risk.   Arbitrary, top-down, government price controls would dry out the  wells of American innovation to the tune of hundreds of billions of  dollars in lost research and development, and American patients would  feel the pain. The cost of breakthrough cures is measured in dollars,  but the cost of neglecting them would be measured in lost years of  American life.   One academic analysis pegged that true cost at a cumulative 331.5  million years.   Let me say that again: One expert says the negative effects of  Democrats' proposal on medical research would cost a collective total  of 331.5 million cumulative years of life.   In other words, their proposal would eventually destroy as many years  of Americans' lives as there are Americans to live them.   Just 2 years ago, Democrats were lining up with Republicans and the  rest of the country to cheer the American researchers and innovators  who were driving the race for a COVID-19 vaccine--a race they finished  in record time.   The American people know what it looks like when lifesaving advances  happen right here at home. Unfortunately, they may be about to find  what happens when they don't.                                    Burma    Madam President, now, on one final matter, over the weekend, Burma's  long and difficult struggle toward democracy and freedom took another  dark step backward. The brutal military junta controlling Burma  executed--executed--four political prisoners, including the well-known  activist Ko Jimmy and Phyo Zeya Thaw, a former elected official and  protest musician--yet more innocent bloodshed for the crime of  dissenting against the junta's illegitimate rule.   This is yet another atrocity in a long list of horrors committed by  the junta with no legitimacy, no regard for the sanctity of human life,  and no respect for its fellow citizens. It provides even further  evidence that the junta does not fear any consequences for its  actions--not from internal chaos, not from civil war, not from its  neighbors, not from the so-called international community.   The United States has led efforts to support Burma's people and to  impose costs and consequences on the junta. Clearly, it is time for  Burma's neighbors to shoulder a larger burden as well. It is time for  ASEAN states to step up, individually and collectively.   As the junta plunges Burma deeper into chaos and civil war, the  turmoil will affect the entire region. It is Burma's neighbors who have  the most economic influence over the junta, and it is Burma's neighbors  who have the most at stake.   Do they want a failed state wracked by civil war like Syria on their  borders? Do they want a Russian- or Chinese-backed client state in  their midst?   If they will not step up and impose meaningful costs on the junta,  the Biden administration should use authorities already given to it by  Congress to sanction Burma's energy sector, including Myanmar Oil and  Gas Enterprise, notwithstanding the concerns of those neighbors.   The people of Burma are risking their lives and, in some cases,  losing their lives to defend their freedom. The Biden administration  claims to prioritize democracy and human rights in its foreign policy.  Here is an opportunity to demonstrate that it means what it says.   So in sum, it is time for Burma's neighbors to act. If they do not,  the Biden administration should sanction Burma's energy and other major  sources of revenue for the junta.
