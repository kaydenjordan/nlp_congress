 Madam Speaker, I was not present for Roll Call Vote No.  130 on ordering the previous question of H. Res. 252 and Roll Call No.  131 on adoption of the rule, H. Res. 252. Had I been present, I would  have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 130 and No 131.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained due to illness.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 132.
