 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I know  that we have talked a lot about different crises, and we do have a lot  of different crises. We have an economic crisis. We have an inflation  crisis. We have an energy cost crisis. We have a supply chain crisis.  We have an education crisis. We have a crime crisis. We have a COVID  response crisis. We have a healthcare crisis. We have a foreign  relations and security crisis. We have a freedom of speech crisis. We  have a centralized government and infringement on our rights crisis.   There is one crisis that is very disturbing and concerning to me as a  naturalized American who immigrated to this great country. I went to  the border three times, and what I saw was lawlessness; its issue of  national security, its anarchy, and it is a crisis that has posed a  risk to our sovereignty as a nation.   We can see what has happened in the country. Drug cartels are  controlling the border. They control drug trafficking and are making  billions from that. We have the highest deaths from overdoses in our  country that ever existed. Our kids are dying, and they are making a  lot of money. The border is open. No one can control it. It poses risks  to our national security.   I hope for us all as Americans who care about our country, that our  President at least starts dealing with this crisis because it is a  serious issue, and  [[Page H246]]  we cannot disregard national security of the greatest country that ever  existed on Earth and put our people at risk.   It is our responsibility as Representatives for this Republic to  stand up, regardless of party affiliations, and raise the issues, and  we owe a duty to the American people.
