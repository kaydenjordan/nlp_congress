 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor several men and  women for dedicating their lives to the service of this country and to  Iowa.   Recently, three University of Iowa alumni, a staff member and a  graduate student, received the 2021 Hawkeye Distinguished Veterans  Award for their honorable service to this great Nation and their  continued service to the University of Iowa and the Iowa City  community.   The recipients of this prestigious award are Chaplain George M.  Campbell, Jr.; Colonel Kenneth E. Madden; Staff Sergeant Maria  Guadalupe Bruno; General Charles A. Horner; and Staff Sergeant Jake L.  Schillo.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for these wonderful men and women and for  their service to the United States and to Iowa.                            ____________________
