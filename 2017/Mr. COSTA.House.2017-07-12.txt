 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   We, in the San Joaquin Valley, know that where food grows, water  flows. That is not just a saying; that is the truth. It takes water to  grow the food that we rely on to sustain ourselves.   Luckily, this year, we have been blessed with an abundance of rain  and snow on the mountains--a record year. However, it is only because  of the wettest year in California's historical record that the  agricultural heartland of California, a place where half of our  Nation's fruits and vegetables are grown, is, this year, free from  drought.   Only 1 year ago, over 83 percent of California was in a moderate  drought or worse. We know that the next drought is sure to come,  threatening valley families and farm communities. It is either feast or  famine. We measure water on 10-year averages. That is why we need  solutions that solve this long-term challenge.   I commend Congressman Valadao for continuing this effort. As I noted  in a letter I wrote to him in February, though, I have concerns that  this legislation, without some improvements, will fail to be that long- term solution that the valley and our State so desperately needs. This  solution must be, at the end of the day, multifaceted, must not pick  winners and losers, as California water policies in the past have so  frequently done, to the detriment of both the agricultural economy,  which we have felt, and California's ecosystems. Sadly, some of the  provisions within this legislation, in my opinion, I think fail to meet  this test.   Language within titles 1 and 3 would pose threats to the wetlands of  Grasslands Ecological Area, the largest wetlands west of the  Mississippi, a vital component of the Pacific Flyway, in an area that  contributes nearly $73 million a year alone to Merced County, which I  represent.    Section 106 would drastically cut collections to the Central Valley  Project Restoration Fund, which pays for refuge water conveyance--that  is very important--and that would transfer oversight of the fund to  other water users. It would also, I think, supersede State laws in some  areas that, frankly, over the experience I have had, in many years,  will create more problems than it solves.   In addition to these concerns, I know from having worked on water  solutions for over 30 years that both here and in Sacramento, the only  path to legislative success is through bipartisan, bicameral action, as  we experienced in December with the passage of the WIIN Act that, by  the way, authorized four reservoirs that was contained in the WIIN Act  that Senator Feinstein and I and Republicans in the House worked on  together in a very constructive way.   So, as always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both the  House and the Senate on a bipartisan basis to improve this legislation  and get solutions to fix California's broken water system to the  President's desk.   I support moving this legislation forward to the Senate. But let's be  clear, this is a work in progress, and much more work remains for this  legislation, I think, to be successful.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the dean of the Republican  delegation to the House.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   This amendment is about rescheduled water, and this is a technical  term that, for people who aren't familiar with water use in California  and other parts of the country, it allows people with water rights,  whether they be senior or junior water rights, to reserve that water,  in other words, to reschedule it, to hold it off for another time when  it might be more valuable to use. And so this is an important tool.   I agree with Congressman LaMalfa that water users throughout  California should have flexibility to use their water supplies in ways  that are most beneficial to be able to reschedule it.   I do have some concerns that this amendment may have unintended  consequences with other water users downstream should it become law  without changes. Specifically, it is critical that those with more  junior water rights, like some of the areas I represent south of the  California delta, are not negatively impacted when they reschedule  their water from senior water rights holders.   Water is precious. You have water shortages. So if I want to reserve  it for later in the year or for the next water year, that means  rescheduled water. So for these water users, we want to protect that  ability.   Additionally, in the event that a future wet year causes spilling of  rescheduled water, it is critical that the priority of the water  spilling is addressed in a fair and equitable manner.   I would like to work with the gentleman to address these concerns.  And I thank him, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I am very pleased to be able to work with my  colleague, Mr. Costa, to ensure that these concerns are met and  addressed as the bill moves through the Senate.   I believe the ability to reschedule water deliveries for these  periods when they are needed should be offered as widely as possible,  and I appreciate the support in that goal.   Indeed, the opportunity that we can help the Central Valley with  this, I relish that opportunity to do so. More facilities to store more  water is, indeed, very important so we have more flexibility for Mr.  Costa and his neighbors, constituents.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I just want to say that this is a very  good amendment. The committee supports it, and it is essential to  providing the flexibility that is necessary.   I might point out to my colleague from California, when we originally  developed this bill more than 5 years ago, we consulted more than 60  water agencies throughout northern and central California, including  many in Democratic congressional districts. Senior water rights are  essential to northern California. This bill strengthens them, and Mr.  LaMalfa's amendment adds the management flexibility that is long  overdue.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McCLINTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from California.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McCLINTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from California.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   That is correct. I know this was offered 5 years ago. I would like to  point out, though, in the last 5 years of the drought conditions, we  have learned a whole lot more about the flexibility and how you can and  cannot use rescheduled water and, of course, how valuable it is.  [[Page H5526]]    So I respect and thank the gentleman, Congressman LaMalfa, for  working together on this to ensure that we protect all of the water  users in their ability to have flexibility, especially during drought  times.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, indeed, whether it is a drought period where  we have to work even harder to spread that water around or in a year of  abundance like what we had, we have to be wise about storing it where  we can and having the flexibility to put it where we need to and having  additional facilities in the future to store farther into the drought  years that, no doubt, will come. This is what we are looking for in  this legislation and what I am trying to promote for my particular area  in northern California with this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title II, add the following:       SEC. 204. GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY.         The Bureau of Reclamation, in cooperation with the United       States Geological Survey, the State of California, and local       and State water agencies, may conduct detailed geophysical       characterization activities of subsurface aquifer systems and       groundwater vulnerability in California, which has       experienced a critical, multi-year drought that resulted in       severe groundwater overdraft in some areas, followed by less       than optimal recharge from the heavy rainstorms and flooding       during the 2016-2017 winter season. This geophysical survey       should include data pertaining to the following:        (1) Subsurface system framework: occurrence and geometry of       aquifer and non-aquifer zones.        (2) Aquifer storage and transmission characteristics.        (3) Areas of greatest recharge potential.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Costa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to first thank the Rules Committee chairman, and the  ranking member, Ms. Slaughter, for making my amendment in order.   Mr. Chair, groundwater storage is a central element of drought  resilience in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout California.  Recharging our groundwater that has been overdrafted is critical in  terms of our overall strategy to use all the water tools in our water  management toolbox.   California's hydrological cycle is varied, with each year's intense  rainfall and flooding like this year followed by prolonged periods of  droughts like the previous 5 years. As a matter of fact, in California,  it is either feast or famine. We don't have enough or we have too much  water.   This varied hydrological cycle means that regions like the San  Joaquin Valley rely heavily on groundwater to supply regional water  needs during the dry years, and that is how the overdraft takes place.  An attempt to refill that pumped water during wet years comes all too  infrequently.   The recent record drought, coupled with previous droughts and policy  changes that have led to shifting of water supplies from agriculture  water uses to environmental uses over the last 25 years, has literally  resulted in ground sinking beneath the feet of the people of the San  Joaquin Valley.   These depletions led the State of California to pass a law in 2014  that regulates the use of groundwater, with the objective of creating  groundwater balance over time. It is called the Sustainable Groundwater  Management Act, otherwise referred to as SGMA.   Obviously, we ought to make our groundwater sustainable, and there  are a lot of different ways in which we can do so in terms of that  water strategy. This amendment purports to address part of that.   Many groundwater basins have been overdrafted for long periods of  time. Twenty-one of California's 515 groundwater basins now are  considered critically overdrafted. That is a real, real serious crisis.   It is critical that efforts are taken to recharge these groundwater  aquifers so that the water is available during the dry years, which we  know will surely come. This is all about sustainability. We know that  the performance of any projected groundwater recharge and recovery  project is reliant on a thorough understanding of how the surface and  subsurface waters interact with a geographical region.   Without thoroughly developed and field-verified information about the  geophysical characteristics of California's groundwater aquifer systems  and best areas for groundwater recharge projects, compliance with  California's recently enacted Sustainable Groundwater Management Act-- it is simply infeasible for us to expect that we are going to do that  without having all of the information together.   What we are trying to do in this legislation is provide the  opportunity to ensure that we have a reliable water supply so that we  have food security. After all, food security, I believe, is a national  security issue for America. It doesn't get looked at that way, but it  is.   California's Department of Water Resources has identified a number of  gaps in the scientific body of knowledge that need to be filled in  order to effectively recharge groundwater aquifers. Some of these  studies show that simply irrigating lands in the Central Valley with  right soil conditions for groundwater percolation could lead to an  additional 2 million to 6 million acre-feet of groundwater  infiltration. That would double the level of recovery rate in a post- drought winter like 2017.   This amendment would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation, partnered  with scientific agencies, the United States Geological Survey, and the  University of California, to conduct surveys for groundwater aquifers  to identify, one, subsurface aquifer systems framework, including the  geometry of areas where water can move more easily; two, aquifer  storage and transmission characteristics; and three, land areas of  greatest recharge potential.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                                time  1800    Mr. McCLINTOCK. Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H5527]]         I yield to the gentleman from California.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have no objection to this amendment.  I thank the gentleman from Fresno, California, for his constructive  contribution to this process.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman), who is from Marin County.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Costa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title II, add the following:       SEC. 204. HEADWATER-RESTORATION SCOPING STUDY.         The Bureau of Reclamation may partner with academia,       specifically the University of California, and State and       local water agencies, to develop a study to enhance mountain       runoff to Central Valley Project reservoirs from headwater       restoration with the following aims:        (1) Estimate forest biomass density and annual       evapotranspiration (ET) across the Shasta Lake watershed for       the past decade using satellite and other available spatial       data.        (2) Identify areas on public and private land that have       high biomass densities and ET, and assess potential changes       in ET that would ensue from forest restoration.        (3) Assess role of subsurface storage in providing drought       resilience of forests, based on long-term historical       estimates of precipitation, drought severity and stream       discharge.        (4) Assess role of snowpack in annual water balance across       the watersheds.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Costa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to first, again, thank the Rules Committee  chair and Ranking Member Slaughter for making my amendment in order, as  well as acknowledge my colleague from California, Congressman LaMalfa,  for his work on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, a record drought and the most destructive wildfire  seasons on record have brought renewed attention to California's  headwaters. These forests, meadows, and other source waters play a  vital role in California's water supply and management system, and they  are under threat from a host of factors, including wildfires, climate  change impacts, and poor management policies.   More effective forest and headwaters management practices, such as  increased use of forest thinning and watershed restoration, have  demonstrated the potential to provide a measurable increase in water  supply to the Central Valley Project reservoirs that receive runoff  generated by these headwaters in the Sierra Nevadas, the beautiful  mountains that we have in California.   The Sierra Nevada mountain range, many people don't realize,  generates nearly 60 percent of California's developed water supply--60  percent. And that is why the abundance of snow on the mountains during  the wintertime is so critical.   Some estimates indicate that simply by instituting more effective  headwaters management policies, that up to 300,000 acre-feet of  additional water supplies--300,000 acre-feet--could be generated each  year.   Now, that is a significant yield of water when you look at the  overdraft crop problems that we have and some of the other  authorization of surface storage that we have made last year during the  WIIN Act.   As a matter of fact, the Bureau of Reclamation has analyzed that some  of the projects that I support, such as raising Shasta Dam 18 feet,  would generate anywhere from 75 to over 100,000 acre-feet of water  annually. So if we can generate an additional 300,000 acre-feet by  better managing our headwaters, this is almost three times that yield.   Simply managing our forests better could, in many instances,  quadruple our water supply and better produce environmental outcomes  for our forest ecosystems.   To put this in context, this is enough water to irrigate over 100,000  acres, of which we have significant overdraft of land, or provide daily  water for an additional 500,000 homes in California for an entire year.   My amendment would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into  partnerships to determine the amount of water that could be untapped by  doing these kinds of efforts.   Fixing California's broken water system, as I have said repeatedly,  means using all of the water tools in our water management toolbox.  Included in this amendment, we would be having the opportunity to  improve our headwater management in an integrated and multidisciplinary  approach that is responsive to the changing conditions that we face as  we know that will continue to occur.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from northern  California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment that has  bipartisan support. Frankly, I think as we learned so much more about  how the hydrology of California's water systems develop, we need to  take advantage of that knowledge. And this amendment will allow us to  do so in a way that makes this so valuable resource that we sometimes  take for granted--that is our water supply--to allow us to use it in a  way that makes sense and will provide the water needs for all  Californians.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the support of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Denham    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Fixing California's broken water system, as we all know, involves  multiple strategies. Recycled water, on-farm recharge, and other  innovative methods of increasing water supply, we have found, improves  the situation, but there is no silver bullet to solving California's  long-term water challenges.   In the Valley, we understand that, and this is why many communities  moved forward on efforts to diversify their water supplies. For  example, the Del Puerto Water District has partnered in northern Merced  and Stanislaus Counties with the cities of Modesto and Turlock on a  project that uses treated wastewater to irrigate agricultural fields,  creating significant water security for about 30 percent of Del  Puerto's Central Valley water supply that is rarely delivered.   This is cost-effective and costs less than other alternatives. We are  partnering with local water districts in the city of Mendota and the  city of Fresno.   So this is a very valuable source of water, and we ought to encourage  it whenever possible. More efforts like this are necessary.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman).
