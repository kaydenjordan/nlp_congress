 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical Education  Caucus, I rise in strong support of the Strengthening Career and  Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bipartisan bill, Mr.  Speaker, is long overdue. The Carl D. Perkins CTE Act, the primary  Federal investment in CTE, has not been reauthorized in over a decade.   I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking  Member Scott, Representative Thompson, and Representative  Krishnamoorthi for their leadership and collaboration on this important  bill, and a particular thanks to my co-chair of the CTE Caucus, Mr.  Thompson, for his outstanding leadership and partnership on this issue  over the years.   Mr. Speaker, CTE provides students of all ages with the skills they  need to succeed in high-demand, high-paying, high-skilled jobs. At a  time right now when hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, IT,  and other skilled trades remain unfilled, Congress has a responsibility  to empower workers with appropriate education and training. If we fail  to modernize and invest in CTE, we will be unable to build a skilled  workforce, and American businesses will pay the price.   H.R. 2353 aligns CTE programs with industry needs, promotes work- based learning, and supports career counselors.    H.R. 2353 aligns CTE programs with industry needs,  promotes work-based learning, and supports career counselors while  strengthening Federal investment in CTE.   I encourage my colleagues to support students, businesses, and their  local economies by supporting this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  latest plan to gut the Affordable Care Act.   Senate Republicans, as has been reported, just unveiled their draft  of their healthcare bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which was  developed entirely behind closed doors and will be rushed to a vote,  from what I understand, without additional input or public debate.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it, this bill will not provide  Americans access to better care and it will not create more affordable  coverage.   Changes to Medicaid will mean Americans in the expansion population  will eventually lose access to crucial services and supports, and  shrinking the program will force States to cut services to the poor,  the sick, and the elderly.  [[Page H5096]]    Like the House Republican version to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act, the Senate's bill is an attack on the preservation  of essential health benefits, and it will not ensure middle-income  Americans can receive sufficient financial support to obtain coverage.   The Senate Republican Better Care Reconciliation Act does not deviate  from the damage of the core policies found in the Republican House  version of the American Health Care Act, and I just hope my Republican  colleagues have a chance to realize this before they take a vote on a  bill that will only undermine health coverage for the American people.                            ____________________
