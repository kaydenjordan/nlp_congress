 Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able       to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will       probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that       happens.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Following Special Counsel Mueller's testimony,  during which he warned against future interference in our elections,  did the President recognize the threat posed to our democracy and  renounce Russian interference in our democracy? Did he choose to stand  with his own intelligence agencies, both Houses of Congress, and the  special counsel's investigation in affirming that Russia interfered in  our last election?   He did not.   Instead, only one day after Special Counsel Mueller testified before  Congress, empowered in the belief that he had evaded accountability for  making use of foreign support in our last election, President Trump was  on the phone with the President of Ukraine, pressing him to intervene  on President Trump's behalf in the next election.   Let's take a moment to let that sink in.   On July 24, Bob Mueller concludes a lengthy investigation. He comes  before the Congress. He testifies that Russia systemically interfered  in our election to help elect Donald Trump, that the campaign  understood that, and that they willfully made use of that help. On July  24, that is what happens.   On the very next day--the very next day--President Trump is on the  phone with a different foreign power, this time Ukraine, trying to get  Ukraine to interfere in the next election--the next day.   That should tell us something. He did not feel chained by what the  special counsel found. He did not feel deterred by what the special  counsel found. He felt emboldened by escaping accountability, for the  very, very next day, he is on the phone, soliciting foreign  interference again.   Now, that July 25 phone call between President Trump and President  Zelensky was a key part of President Trump's direct and corrupt  solicitation of foreign help in the 2020 election.   The question likely sounded familiar to President Zelensky, who had  been swept into office in a landslide victory on a campaign of rooting  out just the type of corruption he was being asked to undertake on this  call with our President.   Zelensky campaigned as a reformer, as someone outside of politics who  would come up and clean up corruption, who would end the political  prosecutions, end the political investigations. And what is his most  important and powerful patron asking him to do? To do exactly what he  campaigned against. No wonder he resisted this pressure campaign.   Now, President Trump had been provided talking points for discussion  by the National Security Council staff beforehand, including  recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote  anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. So the National Security staff  understood what was in the U.S. national security interests, and that  was rooting out corruption, and they encouraged the President to talk  about it.   But as you see from the record of the call--and I join the President  in saying ``read the call''--that topic was never  [[Page S449]]  addressed. The word ``corruption'' never escapes his lips.   Instead, President Trump openly pressed President Zelensky to pursue  the two investigations that would benefit him personally.   In response to President Zelensky's gratitude for the significant  military support the United States had provided to Ukraine, President  Trump said:         I would like you to do us a favor though because our       country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about       it. I would like you to find out what happened with this       whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike . . . I       guess you have one of your wealthy people . . . The server,       they say Ukraine has it.    That is that crazy conspiracy theory I talked about earlier that  there is this server somewhere in Ukraine that shows that, in fact, it  was Ukraine that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. That is a Russian  propaganda conspiracy theory, and here it is being promulgated by the  President of the United States. And more than promulgated, he is  pressuring an ally to further this Russian propaganda because he was  referring to this extensively discredited conspiracy theory that  Ukraine was the one that really hacked the DNC--the Democratic National  Committee--servers in 2016.   And that reference to CrowdStrike--well, that is an American cyber  security firm. And the theory--this kooky conspiracy theory--is that  CrowdStrike moved the DNC servers to Ukraine to prevent U.S. law  enforcement from getting it.   If Ukraine announced an investigation into this fabrication,  President Trump could remove what he perceived to be a cloud over his  legitimacy--legitimacy of his last election, Russia's assistance with  his campaign--and suggest that it was the Democratic Party that was the  real beneficiary of that.   On the call, President Trump told Zelensky: ``Whatever you can do,  it's very important that you do it if that's possible.''   President Zelensky agreed that he would do the investigation saying:  ``Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just  mentioned earlier.''   President Trump then turned to his second request, asking President  Zelensky to look into the sham allegation into former Vice President  Biden. President Trump said to President Zelensky:         The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,       that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want       to find out about that so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it .       . . It sounds horrible to me.    There is no question what President Trump intended in pressing the  Ukrainian leader to ``look into'' his political rival. Even after the  impeachment inquiry began, he confirmed his desire on the south lawn of  the White House, declaring not only that Ukraine should investigate  Biden but that China should do the same.   Let's see what he said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         NEWS REPORTER. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do       about the Bidens after your phone call? Exactly.        PRESIDENT TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were       honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the       Bidens. It's a very simple answer.        They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a       company that is newly formed--and all these companies, if you       look at--        And, by the way, likewise, China should start an       investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China       is just about as bad as what happened with--with Ukraine.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The day after that July 25 phone call, President  Trump sought confirmation that President Zelensky understood his  request to announce the politically motivated investigations and that  he would follow through.   After meeting with Ukranian officials, including President Zelensky  and his top aide, the President's handpicked Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland, called President Trump from an outdoor  restaurant in Kyiv to report back. This was the second conversation  between the two about Ukraine in as many days.   David Holmes, an American diplomat dining with Sondland, overheard  the call, including the President's voice through the cell phone. I  described part of that call last night.   Holmes testified that President Trump asked Sondland: ``So he's going  to do the investigation?'' Sondland replied that he is going to do it,  adding that President Zelensky will do ``anything you ask him to do.''   After the phone call, Holmes ``took the opportunity to ask Ambassador  Sondland for his candid impression of the President's views on  Ukraine.'' According to Holmes:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
