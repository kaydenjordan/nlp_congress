 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Iraq war  veteran David Bellavia, who is, tomorrow, receiving the Medal of Honor  from President Trump.   On November 10, 2004, while clearing a block of houses in Fallujah,  Iraq, then-Staff Sergeant David Bellavia's platoon came under attack.  David quickly rose to action and charged into a house where his men  were trapped. He provided cover fire, which allowed his men to safely  exit the building.   David then reentered that house, going floor to floor and  neutralizing the threat by individually killing four insurgents and  wounding a fifth in what can only be called an epic battle.   That day, David Bellavia rescued an entire squad and cleared an  insurgent stronghold, protecting his platoon from further threat.   Tomorrow, President Trump will award David the Medal of Honor for his  heroic actions, becoming the first living Iraq war veteran to be so  honored.   Congratulations to my constituent and my friend. Most importantly, we  thank David for his heroic actions and his service to our country.                            ____________________
