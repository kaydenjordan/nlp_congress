 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of Judge  Neil M. Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Confirmation of anyone appointed to the Federal judiciary is a big  deal. Confirmation of someone appointed to serve on the Supreme Court  of the United States is an exceptionally weighty matter. I therefore  approach this with the seriousness it deserves. I approach this as one  who has argued in front of Judge Gorsuch. I found as a lawyer that he  is an exceptional judge, an unusual judge--a judge who comes to  argument with an unusual degree of preparation, having read all the  briefs and apparently all of the cases and all of the statutes cited in  the briefs.   There are some judges who at oral argument are constantly asking  questions, but they are not necessarily questions that need to be  asked. Perhaps some judges want to hear the sound of their own voices.  That is, of course, something that would never happen here, in the U.S.  Senate, but it happens sometimes with other people. There are other  judges who might be quiet throughout an argument. Then there is a  unique category of judge, a judge who doesn't necessarily speak  constantly but a judge who listens attentively and then pounces at the  moment when he or she sees the pivotal moment in the case arising.   The late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., used to say there was a  point of contact in every case. When asked, he pointed out that the  point of contact in any case is the place where the boy got his finger  caught in the machinery. I learned that quote when I was in law school.  I have never entirely understood what it means, but it reminds me of  the fact that in every case, there is a pivotal fact and a pivotal  aspect of the law which, when properly understood, can help lead the  court to a proper disposition of the legal question at hand.   Judge Gorsuch is one of those rare judges who is able to seize upon  the point of contact in any case. He does so with seeming  effortlessness. Yet I know he does it in a way that requires a lot of  effort because these things don't just come naturally. They come only  as a result of faithful study of the law, of faithful attention to  detail in every case, reading every brief in every case.   Judge Gorsuch does this in part because he was well trained. When we  look at his background, we can see that excellence has always been  something we have been able to see from him. He graduated with honors  from Harvard Law School and received a doctorate in jurisprudence from  Oxford. He clerked for three brilliant and very well-respected jurists:  Judge David Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit  and Justice Byron White, as well as Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S.  Supreme Court. We could not ask for a better legal education or a  stronger record of accomplishment from a young lawyer.   After his clerkship, Judge Gorsuch entered into private practice,  where he was a trial attorney for 10 years. In 2005, he joined the U.S.  Department of Justice as Principal Deputy Attorney General, and he  became a judge on the Tenth Circuit in 2006, where he has served for  the last decade.   Judge Gorsuch has what I would consider--and I think what most would  acknowledge--is the correct approach to the law. He is a judge's judge,  both literally and figuratively--literally, because he sits on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. He literally judges the rulings  of other judges. It is his job to decide whether other judges have done  the right thing. And he is a judge's judge figuratively in the sense  that he has the characteristics that all judges aspire to--or at least  should. He decides cases based on what the law says and not on the  basis of what a particular judge might wish the law said.   I particularly enjoyed last night listening to Judge Gorsuch speak at  the White House, his reference to what he considers an important,  telltale sign of a good judge or a bad judge. He said: ``A judge who  likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching  for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' So a bad  judge is one who necessarily likes all the results he reaches, and it  naturally follows that a good judge will, from time to time,  necessarily disagree with some of the judge's own rulings. In other  words, the outcome of the case doesn't necessarily match up with the  outcome the good judge would prefer--or the judge, an all-powerful  ruler who had the power not only to interpret the law but also make it,  establishing rules, embodying policies that would govern in all cases.   This is the essence of the conservative legal movement--the judicial  conservative movement, we might say--in which Justice Scalia was so  influential, which is why it is so fitting that Judge Gorsuch has been  named to replace Justice Scalia.   Judges do not have a roving commission specifically to address all of  the evils that plague society. They don't have a roving commission to  decide big policy questions of the sort we debate in this Chamber every  day. The judge's role, rather, is to apply the facts to the case at  hand, and, in the case of the Supreme Court, to provide guidance to  lower courts so they can resolve difficult and consequential questions  of law. Judge Gorsuch understands the difference between being a judge  and being a legislator, and that is very much reflected in his work on  the bench.   When I had the privilege of practicing law and appearing in front of  Judge Gorsuch, I was able to be the beneficiary of his skill as a judge  and of his commitment to the rule of law. Over the last few days, I  have had the privilege of reading many of his opinions. I spent hours  upon hours poring through his opinions. Knowing that he might well be  named to the Supreme Court, knowing he was one of the potential  nominees made me want to learn more about him than I already knew. I  have to say, every single opinion I read, without exception, was  impeccable to an unusual degree. They are methodical. They are careful.  They are studious. They reflect a degree of academic and professional  craftsmanship rarely seen. He treats the parties appearing before him  with dignity and respect. He takes their arguments seriously, and he  respectfully explains their arguments as he addresses them.   I know from my time in the practice of law that no one likes to lose  a case, but I doubt any litigant has read a Judge Gorsuch opinion and  felt like he failed to understand their position or that he failed to  take their views seriously with the credibility and dignity they  deserve. This is a crucial yet, sadly, often underrated factor when  reviewing the work of any judge.   Most of all, his opinions are just brilliant. They are digestible to  lawyers  [[Page S563]]  and nonlawyers alike. This is crucial because the judiciary belongs to  everyone in this country, not just to attorneys. Judge Gorsuch's  opinions are memorably written without being snarky, and he scatters  his opinions with literary and philosophical references to highlight  the legal points he is making while also just making the opinion much  more interesting. As someone who has read more than my fair share of  judicial opinions, I can tell you that Judge Gorsuch's opinions are  among the very best I have ever read. I don't just mean a few of them,  I mean every single one of them that I have read, which is a lot of  them. They are very, very good. In fact, they are Supreme Court  caliber.   Judge Gorsuch has written hundreds of opinions, but there are two  recently decided cases I wish to highlight.   He is a critic of an obscure but very significant legal rule known as  the Chevron doctrine. When the Supreme Court decided the Chevron case  back in 1984, the Justices may not have thought they were deciding a  big case. They might not have realized the extent to which the decision  in Chevron v. NRDC--the extent to which that case would have such a  profound impact on the Federal judiciary and on the state of the law in  the United States of America, but Chevron is in fact one of the most  important Supreme Court cases that most of us have never heard of. It  says that the courts must defer to an agency interpretation of a  statute if the statute is ambiguous.   The problem with Chevron, as Judge Gorsuch has pointed out, is that  it tends to divest the courts of their obligation to ``say what the law  is,'' as Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison. It  has led to a system in which executive agencies not only make and  enforce the law but also interpret the law, arrogating to themselves,  in effect, some aspects of the powers allocated to all three branches  of the Federal Government. This is a violation of the doctrine of  separation of powers, one of the most important protections in the  Constitution, one of the two fundamental structural protections in the  Constitution, as important as any other provision in our founding  document.   Worse, doctrines that have developed in response to Chevron allow  agencies to stake out a legal position, lose in court, and stake out a  new legal position that reaches the same outcome. As Judge Gorsuch  points out, that creates fair notice and equal protection problems.   Now, there are two additional points to make about Chevron. First, in  the coming days, we will undoubtedly hear some of my colleagues  complain that getting rid of Chevron will somehow make the air less  clean, our food less safe, our financial system more unstable, and  cause a whole lot of other problems, but as Judge Gorsuch has written,  ``We managed to live with the administrative state before Chevron. We  could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me that in a world without  Chevron, very little would change--except perhaps the most important  things.''   Second, it is important to note here that the Chevron doctrine is not  a particularly ideological one.   Indeed, in the 1980s, Chevron primarily assisted the Reagan  administration's deregulation efforts, and junking the doctrine today  would constrain the Trump administration's use of regulations. So  eliminating the doctrine would affect equally Republican and Democratic  policy goals. In any event, I am sure, based on his background and on  his record, Judge Gorsuch's critique of the doctrine is not about  politics; it is about first principles. At the end of the day, Chevron  is neither Republican nor Democratic; it is neither liberal nor  conservative. It is simply wrong.   In another notable case, Judge Gorsuch was the lone dissenter in a  case in which an 11-year-old student was arrested for generating fake  burps in class. As heinous a crime as some might perceive this to be,  it is not ordinarily the kind of thing that results in calling the  police. Judge Gorsuch would have concluded that clearly established law  prevented the arrest and that the child's parents should prevail in a  lawsuit against the school officials who decided to call the police in  response to this childish act in class. This is not uncommon for Judge  Gorsuch, who has voted not to provide qualified immunity in several  cases and has voted in many cases for the underdog, for someone who  might otherwise not have had a chance in court but for the willingness  of one very brave and astute and diligent judge to study the law and  the facts of that case aggressively so as to make sure that justice was  accorded to the parties.   There are other important areas of the law where Judge Gorsuch has  made an important contribution during his time on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I will be talking about some of those at  length in the days and weeks to come. He has been a staunch advocate  for the First Amendment. He has read criminal statutes to constrain the  government's power, where appropriate, and has voted in several cases  to withhold qualified immunity. All of these are important, and I look  forward to discussing them with my colleagues.   Before I close, I want to talk a bit about the confirmation process.  In 2006, Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit was so  uncontroversial that it lasted 26 minutes--just 26 minutes, less time  than a ``Brady Bunch'' episode. He was confirmed on a voice vote. Among  other notable Members of the Senate the day that Judge Gorsuch was  confirmed were Minority Leader Schumer, ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee Feinstein, Senator Durbin, and Senator Leahy.   Already, prominent liberal lawyers are praising his nomination. Neal  Katyal, who served as Acting Solicitor General under President Obama,  has a New York Times op-ed in which he urges liberals to support Judge  Gorsuch. Katyal writes:         I, for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next       justice. But since that is not to be, one basic criterion       should be paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up       for the rule of law and say no to a president or Congress       that strays beyond the Constitution and laws? I have no doubt       that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help restore       confidence in the rule of law. His years on the bench reveal       a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should       give the American people confidence that he will not       compromise principle to favor the president who appointed       him.    Judge Gorsuch is exactly the type of judge who should be confirmed,  who should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Court of the United  States. This vacancy was a central issue in the 2016 election. The  people have now spoken, and I plan to honor the results of this  election by working as hard as I can to see Judge Neil Gorsuch  confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States.
