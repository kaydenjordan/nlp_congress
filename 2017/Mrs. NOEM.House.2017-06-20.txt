 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2834) to improve the well-being of, and improve permanency  outcomes for, children and families affected by heroin, opioids, and  other substance abuse, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the amendments       made by this Act shall take effect on October 1, 2017.        (b) Transition Rule.--        (1) In general.--In the case of a State plan under part B       of title IV of the Social Security Act which the Secretary of       Health and Human Services determines requires State       legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in       order for the plan to meet the additional requirements       imposed by the amendments made by this Act, the State plan       shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the       requirements of such part solely on the basis of the failure       of the plan to meet such additional requirements before the       first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the       close of the first regular session of the State legislature       that begins after the date of enactment of this Act. For       purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State       that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of the       session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of       the State legislature.        (2) Application to programs operated by indian tribal       organizations.--In the case of an Indian tribe, tribal       organization, or tribal consortium which the Secretary of       Health and Human Services determines requires time to take       action necessary to comply with the additional requirements       imposed by the amendments made by this Act (whether the       tribe, organization, or tribal consortium has a plan under       section 479B of the Social Security Act or a cooperative       agreement or contract entered into with a State), the       Secretary shall provide the tribe, organization, or tribal       consortium with such additional time as the Secretary       determines is necessary for the tribe, organization, or       tribal consortium to take the action to comply with the       additional requirements before being regarded as failing to       comply with the requirements.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2834, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Partnership Grants to  Strengthen Families Affected by Parental Substance Abuse Act. I applaud  Mr. Davis for all of the excellent work he has done on this issue.   Most substantiated child abuse and neglect cases involve substance  abuse by a parent or a guardian. This is something we are seeing all  too often in places like my home State of South Dakota. Substance  abuse, especially alcohol and meth, result in far too many instances of  child abuse, domestic abuse, and other kinds of violent crime and  behavior.   Historically, a lack of coordination and collaboration has hindered  the ability of those working in the fields of child welfare and  substance abuse, and even the courts, from fully supporting families in  substance abuse crisis.   Families involved with child welfare have complex needs. No two cases  are alike. It is for this reason that improving outcomes for parents  and children require a coordinated effort among all systems.   This bill strengthens the Regional Partnership Grants program, which  provides funding to State and regional grantees seeking to provide  evidence-based services to prevent child abuse and neglect related to  substance abuse. Most importantly, this bill updates the RPG program to  specifically address the opioid and heroin epidemics.   By ensuring better coordination, this bill will also encourage States  to address the well-being of the family as a whole, using evidence- based approaches to help parents and children at the same time, so many  children can stay safely at home with their families.   Finally, this bill is noncontroversial and it is bipartisan.  Provisions in this bill were contained in the Family First Prevention  Services Act last Congress, which passed the House by a voice vote. The  Family First Act, as you recall, was supported by over 500 State and  local organizations representing a wide range of practitioners and  advocacy organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand with Mr. Davis in  supporting this bill today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to applaud Mr. Davis for all of his work  on this issue. I know he is passionate and has a big heart for our  children, especially those that are in difficult situations such as we  are discussing today.   This bill will help us protect the fundamental element of our  society, and that is the family. It will keep families together. It  will empower courts and child welfare workers to coordinate for the  good of children, and I am proud to support this bill.   I ask for the support of this legislation that is before us, Mr.  Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2857) to support foster care maintenance payments for children  with parents in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility  for substance abuse, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2857         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Families in       Substance Abuse Treatment Act''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 474(a)(1) of such Act       (42 U.S.C. 674(a)(1)) is amended by inserting ``subject to       section 472(j),'' before ``an amount equal to the Federal''       the first place it appears.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         (a) Effective Dates.--Subject to subsection (b), the       amendments made by this Act shall take effect on October 1,       2017.

[[Page H4969]]         (2) Application to programs operated by indian tribal       organizations.--In the case of an Indian tribe, tribal       organization, or tribal consortium which the Secretary of       Health and Human Services determines requires time to take       action necessary to comply with the additional requirements       imposed by the amendments made by this Act (whether the       tribe, organization, or tribal consortium has a plan under       section 479B of the Social Security Act or a cooperative       agreement or contract entered into with a State), the       Secretary shall provide the tribe, organization, or tribal       consortium with such additional time as the Secretary       determines is necessary for the tribe, organization, or       tribal consortium to take the action to comply with the       additional requirements before being regarded as failing to       comply with the requirements.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2857, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Supporting  Families in Substance Abuse Treatment Act, which I have cosponsored  with my colleague, Ms. Judy Chu from California.   Across the country, opioid abuse has reached epidemic proportions. In  my home State of South Dakota, drug use tears families apart. It  results in gang activity, domestic abuse, and other kinds of violence,  including many of our Native American communities throughout the State.   Congress has worked to provide first responders and healthcare  providers with tools they need to address this crisis, but we need to  do more. We need to do more to ensure the stability of families  affected by these terrible drugs.   The Supporting Families in Substance Abuse Treatment Act provides  much-needed support to families fighting to endure through substance  abuse. The bill permits Federal foster care payments for children in  foster care who are placed with a parent in a licensed residential  family-based treatment facility for a period of up to 12 months.   Programs that address parental substance abuse by housing families  together have been found to be highly effective in supporting parent- child bonding and reducing substance abuse relapses. Unfortunately,  these programs aren't utilized to their fullest extent.   This bill ensures that States incur little to no additional cost if a  child is safely placed with a parent in a family substance abuse  treatment program, rather than separating the child from their parent  and placing the parent in an individual program.   I would remind my colleagues that provisions in this bill were  included in the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016, which  passed the House by voice vote and received support from over 500  different State and local groups representing a wide range of  practitioners and advocacy organizations. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I want to thank all of my colleagues for working  with me on this legislation and collaborating on the Supporting  Families in Substance Abuse Treatment Act that is before us today.   This is a critical step in addressing the needs that we have in our  communities with the urgent opioid and methamphetamine crisis in our  country while protecting the foundation of our society, which is the  family.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this legislation that is before us  today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, you can't hardly turn on the TV today or open  a newspaper, scroll through your news feed without learning of another  outbreak of violence around the globe. Especially in a world as  volatile and insecure as ours is today, we have a responsibility to  take full advantage of proven peace-building tactics. This includes  involving women in conflict prevention and resolution.   Research covering conflicts from Northern Ireland to Africa has shown  that peace agreements are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15  years when women are involved. Even knowing this, women are many times  left out during negotiations.   The truth is that conflict knows no gender, just as peace should know  no gender. With that said, women are many times impacted by conflict in  different ways than their male counterparts.   ISIL, for instance, has used human trafficking and sex slavery, which  disproportionately impacts women, as an income-generating business for  their terrorist activities. Women need to be able to play a major role  in addressing this and finding solutions to combat it.   Moreover, in many war-torn countries, women control large segments of  the economy. In fact, women are the sole income earners in nearly one- third of all households worldwide. While their husbands and sons are  serving as soldiers, women are running the markets, the schools, other  public and private institutions. By virtue of that, they are running  the local economy and have an unmistakable voice in community  discussions. Their understanding can prove invaluable when mitigating  conflict and building peace.   Particularly in areas where increased stability creates greater  security for the United States, we must make sure that the work that we  are doing produces lasting results.   I am confident the Women, Peace, and Security Act and the  accountability it provides will help produce sustainable outcomes for  Americans, and that also touches on our national security.   While our U.S. Government, in recent years, has made efforts to  include women in peace negotiations, the bipartisan Women, Peace, and  Security Act better ensures that women have a seat at the table during  these discussions through meaningful congressional oversight. It is but  one instrument in a toolbox our military and diplomatic leaders can use  when looking at producing long-term results, and leaders can use it  when looking to produce peace, but it is still a tool that we should  not ignore.   I am grateful to my colleagues: Representative Jan Schakowsky for all  of her passionate work on this issue; Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking  Member Eliot Engel for their efforts on this legislation as well.
