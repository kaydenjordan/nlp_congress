 Madam President, I first want to thank the senior  Senator from the State of Iowa for his tenacity in pursuing the truth  and ignoring all of the false attacks lobbed against us during the  course of our multiyear investigations into corruption at the highest  levels of the Federal Government.   Both of us have been firsthand witnesses and at the same time victims  of the dishonesty of our Democratic Senate colleagues and their willing  accomplices in the media.   When it comes to our investigation into the vast web of foreign  financial entanglements of the Biden family, those attacks have had one  goal in mind, to cover up the extent to which President Biden might be  and almost certainly is compromised.   Over the course of our investigation into how Hunter Biden used his  father's position and name to enrich himself and his family, the  dishonest press published countless stories reporting on the Democrats'  false charge that Senator Grassley and I were soliciting and  disseminating Russian disinformation.   Once we issued our September and November 2020 reports, which were  based almost exclusively on U.S.-sourced documents and interviews with  U.S. citizens, the media largely ignored it. When they did write a  story, they declared that our reports found nothing new, a classic  media coverup.   I have always said the bias in the media is revealed far more in what  they don't report than what they actually do report. But all the false  attacks did not deter us. We have continued to uncover the truth and,  fortunately, our reports also served as a catalyst for others to come  forward and for more investigative journalists to keep digging.   The American people deserve the truth. That is why we are presenting  additional evidence today and over the next few days. For example, this  is the first time this document is being made public. As Senator  Grassley described in detail, it shows that money from CEFC, which is  effectively an arm of the Chinese Government, went directly to Hunter  Biden.    Bank records like this piece of evidence are pretty hard to deny and  sweep under the rug. Our reports were chockful of irrefutable evidence  like this, and yet the media buried those details in an attempt to keep  it hidden from the American people.   Because the mainstream media and our Democratic colleagues had no  substance to refute our reports, they reverted to their time-honored  tradition of lying, making false accusations against us, and engaging  in the politics of personal destruction.   Again, their goal was to destroy the credibility of our reports  before the American people even had a chance to read them. They were  fully aware that the lie can travel halfway around the world before the  truth has a chance to put on its shoes. For example, listen to what New  York Times journalist Nicholas Fandos said about our report: ``lack of  meaningful new information'' and, again, ``overlap [of the] Russian  disinformation campaign.''   The then-Democratic minority leader was quoted saying about our  report, ``as if Putin wrote it, not United States Senators.'' A  Democratic Senator described our investigation as being ``rooted in  disinformation'' from Russian operatives.   Separately, a Democratic Senator also said about our report:         Bottom line: the Johnson-Grassley investigation is       baseless. It's laundering Russian propaganda for circulation       in the U.S.    But, of course, all those quotes were disinformation, disinformation  designed to distract all of us from the truth. As Senator Grassley  reiterated, our reports were based almost exclusively on government  records from the Obama administration and transcribed interviews of  government officials.   So how did the Democrats and the liberal media allies carry out this  false attack on us? We describe part of what they did in section 10 of  our September 2020 report. Their disinformation and smear campaign  against us in our reports was extensive, but in the interest of time, I  will give you a shorter Cliff's Notes version.   On July 13, 2020, then-Minority Leader Schumer, Senator Warner,  Speaker Pelosi, and Representative Schiff sent a letter to the FBI to  express a purported belief that Congress was the subject of a foreign  disinformation campaign. The letter included a classified attachment  that had unclassified elements that attempted to tie Senator Grassley's  and my work to Andriy Derkach, a Russian agent.   The Democrats speculated that, based on this unclassified  information, Senator Grassley and I had received materials from  Derkach. This was false. Nothing could be further from the truth, but  this information purportedly linking Senator Grassley and I to Derkach  was leaked to liberal media outlets to start a false narrative to smear  us.   Until news reports of this false allegation surfaced, I had never  even heard of Andriy Derkach. We immediately and forcefully denied the  false allegation, but Democrats and the media continued to spread the  lie. To this day, no one has ever apologized to either of us for  spreading that lie, even though it was proven conclusively to be a lie  and disinformation.   Next, my staff and Senator Grassley's staff did a transcribed  interview with George Kent. During that interview, Democratic staff  members introduced Derkach's materials into our record. Then Democratic  staff members asked Mr. Kent about it. He stated:         What you are asking me to interpret is a master chart of       disinformation and malign influence.    That was Mr. Kent's evaluation of the Derkach disinformation that  Democrats were spreading that they entered into our record.   So the actual truth of the matter is that Democrats--not Senator  Grassley nor I--introduced known Russian disinformation into our  investigatory record. They did the exact thing they were falsely  accusing us of doing.   Again, not my staff, not Senator Grassley's staff, Democrats were  disseminating Russian disinformation just like they did with the Steele  dossier. Then-Ranking Members Wyden and Peters sent me and Senator  Grassley a letter asking for an intelligence briefing relating to our  investigation.   Now, such a briefing was completely unnecessary, but it was an effort  by our Democratic colleagues to further falsely taint our  investigation, hoping to discredit it and discredit the truth.   On July 28, 2020, Senator Grassley and I reminded them that the FBI  and relevant members of the intelligence community had already briefed  the committees in March of 2020 and assured us that there was no reason  to discontinue our investigation.   Then, in August 2020, Senator Grassley and I were provided a briefing  from the FBI, a briefing that we did not request that was also leaked  to the press to further smear us.   This unsolicited FBI briefing was also not necessary and was  completely  [[Page S1798]]  irrelevant to the substance of our investigation.   The FBI briefers did tell us that they weren't there to ``quash,  curtail, or interfere'' in our investigation in any way.   No government entity ever warned us that our investigation into the  Biden family's financial deals was connected to any kind of Russian  disinformation campaign--because it wasn't.   But, again, the substance of that FBI briefing was later leaked and  contorted to smear us, which was exactly why we suspect we were given  the unsolicited briefing in the first place.   Those briefers promised confidentiality. Clearly, that  confidentiality was breached and resulted in another smear operation on  Senator Grassley and me to deflect allegations of corruption and  conflict of interest that could compromise a President Biden.   To date, we do not know who all was involved in this smear campaign,  but even after repeated requests, Director Wray and Director Haines  have refused to come in and fully explain who requested and directed  this briefing and why it was provided.   I think we know why it was provided.   So to review, senior Democrats and liberal media cooperated to smear  Senator Grassley and me with false accusations of receiving and  spreading Russian disinformation. They created documents, leaked them,  asked for briefings, and then leaked those, too, and then they  themselves disseminated Russian disinformation.   You can't make this up.   Fortunately, they failed to discredit our investigation because we  stayed true to government records. We stayed true to the facts and the  evidence. And the evidence is stunning, and it is growing.   Over the next few days, Senator Grassley and I will come to the floor  to present additional evidence that has not yet been made public. These  records show extensive connections between the Biden family and  elements of the communist Chinese regime. We are talking high-dollar  transactions, some of which we have already highlighted in our  September and November 2020 reports, but our speeches will introduce  new financial documents into the record for all to see.   Now, we expect Democrats and the media to continue to use their power  to smear us and cover up for the Bidens. But the truth has a power of  its own, and we intend to continue to reveal the truth.   I yield the floor.
