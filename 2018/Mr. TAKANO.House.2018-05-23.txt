 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation's emergency  medical service workers.   When crisis strikes, we turn to EMS workers. They are first on the  scene to provide vital medical care when we need it most. Their  lifesaving work requires skill, is often dangerous, and takes a great  deal of courage.   We rely on people like Lisa La Russo, a paramedic with American  Medical Response in Riverside County and proud member of AFSCME Local  4911. Lisa has been saving lives for nearly three decades and, like  many in her field, goes above and beyond in service to her community.  Her work responding to emergencies compelled her to start Splash  Medics, a nonprofit dedicated to the prevention of drowning injuries  and deaths through education about water safety.   I salute Lisa La Russo, her fellow union members, and all of the EMS  workers across the Nation. They are the reason Americans rest assured  that help is just a phone call away.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  would create a demonstration program in the Air Force for 15 to 20 deaf  and hard-of-hearing individuals to serve their country.   This amendment is inspired by a young deaf man I met a few years ago  named Keith Nolan. He excelled at the first two levels of Army ROTC and  was prepared to take the next step when he was told that he could not  continue because he is deaf. Including this amendment is an incredible  tribute to Keith's advocacy, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to  maintain this provision.   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for including this  amendment. I am excited that we are taking this step forward to give  the deaf community a chance to defend the country that they love and  that we love.
