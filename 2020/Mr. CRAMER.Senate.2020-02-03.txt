 Mr. President, after 32 years of serving his  community in the Minot Police Department, including 8 of those years  leading it, Chief of Police Jason Olson began a well-deserved  retirement on January 31.   He became a police officer in 1988 at the age of 21, as he was  completing his criminal justice degree at Minot State University.  Starting as a patrol officer, he went on to spend 18 years on the SWAT  team.   Officer Olson became chief of police at a time of significant change  for the city of Minot and western North Dakota. The challenges this  growth and development brought to the fourth largest city in North  Dakota demanded a leader who would advocate for his staff and be open  to change. The city had the right person in Chief Olson.   Serving on the frontlines during some of the greatest challenges to  the city of Minot, Chief Olson was there for the tragic train  derailment that spread anhydrous ammonia across the city in 2002 and  for the historic flooding of the Souris River in 2011. Through the best  and very worst of times, Chief Olson exhibited his trademark calm and  collected demeanor.   Chief Olson credits his success to the experience he gained as a  young officer from the veteran officers who had served for decades.  Likewise, many of the 80-plus employees today praise him for the  lessons he taught them as the head of the department. This includes the  new Police Chief John Klug, a 25-year officer who took over on February  1, after being chosen in a national search. He speaks highly of Chief  Olson and the example he set as a mentor and leader.   We cannot thank our law enforcement officers enough for their  sacrifices keeping our communities safe and for the bravery they  exhibit every day on the job. I join the residents of Minot and all  North Dakotans thanking Chief Olson for his many years of dedicated  professional service. I wish him a well-deserved and rewarding  retirement.                            ____________________
