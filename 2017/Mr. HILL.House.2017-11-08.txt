 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during National STEM Day, to  recognize the importance of encouraging our youth to pursue their  interests in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.   As technology continues to advance, STEM occupations continue to grow  and become more valuable to the development of our society. Over the  past decade, employment in STEM occupations has outgrown non-STEM  occupations by nearly 20 percent.   I commend the House's work in implementing the annual Congressional  STEM App Challenge for students across our Nation. This competition  allows students to compete by creating an idea for an app on a platform  of their choice and is designed to engage student creativity and  encourage their participation in STEM fields.   As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the father  of a STEM student in college, I will continue to support the growth of  STEM education throughout Arkansas and our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
