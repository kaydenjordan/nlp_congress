 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the bill before us today  which will keep our government operating and make transformative  investments to tackle some of the Sacramento region's most pressing  challenges.   Despite the progress we've made with this bill, I believe we missed  an important opportunity to accomplish a bipartisan goal: securing  American telecommunications networks by fully funding the Secure and  Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program.   As an original cosponsor of the Secure and Trusted Communications  Networks Act which created the Reimbursement Program, I believe it is  both an economic and national security imperative to implement it  fully.   However, the significant funding shortfall in the Program has  introduced severe uncertainty for small internet service providers and  undercuts their ability to execute plans to rip and replace vulnerable  network equipment. This poses a very significant national security  threat and without additional resources, the program cannot fulfill its  mandate.   That is why, in May, I led a bipartisan group of 20 Members urging  our colleagues to fully fund this shortfall. As we continue to discuss  a path forward on extending the Federal Communications Commission's  auction authority and plans for the lower three gigahertz band, I  believe it must include plans for addressing the shortfall in the  Reimbursement Program.   I will be voting for this bill and look forward to working with my  colleagues on a bipartisan basis to fully fund the Reimbursement  Program.
