 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Limit, Save,  and Grow Act.   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee and Budget Committee, as  much as I want to take serious steps to lower our debt and deficit,  this legislation is not serious, it is not bipartisan, and it leaves us  with a partisan hit list.   I say that because of the way it is written. It would increase hunger  and deprive low-income citizens of healthcare. It would make  significant cuts to critical government services that could lead to the  loss of 780,000 jobs. It would cut IRS funding needed to close the tax  gap and collect taxes owed. It would do nothing to raise revenues, and  it would do nothing to find common ground on permitting reform. It  would target the cornerstone of the industrial policy that we created  last term to lower our carbon output by repealing clean energy tax  credits.   Solutions to the debt crisis need to be serious, not partisan. This  bill brings us closer to default by demanding partisan policies that  will never pass the Senate.   I will vote ``no'' on this bill, but I do look forward to raising the  debt ceiling and then having serious conversations about how we can  ensure that Congress gets serious about a solution to our debt and  deficit reduction.
