 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I stood in Fall River,  Massachusetts, and told our country the story of that proud and  resilient city.   Today, for nearly 200 working families, that resilience is being  tested because, this week, after celebrating $342 million in profits,  Philips Lighting announced that they would be closing their factory in  Fall River and moving those jobs to Mexico. Almost 200 loyal, lifelong  employees are left behind, careers upended, savings lost. Mortgages,  healthcare bills, tuition payments will be missed.   For the 61-year-old worker who is near retirement and paying off his  daughter's student loans, a meager investment in workforce retraining  is not worth all that much.   For the countless workers who sit around dining room tables in  southeastern Massachusetts tonight trying to figure out how their  family budget can absorb impossible cuts, bland lip service given by  this White House yesterday means nothing.   But that is not even the whole story. Philips Lighting shareholders  are being showered with $187.4 million in stock buybacks because of  Donald Trump's tax plan.   Make no mistake, that is the legacy of this tax bill: working  families that are left sorting through the wreckage while CEOs bask in  windfalls; lights turned off on empty American factory floors while  shareholders grin around boardroom tables; success somehow defined in  dividends and return on investment rather than in jobs, in paychecks,  in families supported, retirements earned, and dreams realized.   Yes, Fall River is a unique city, but across this country, other  families and communities find themselves in the same impossible place  as economic afterthoughts in a Republican economy increasingly tilted  towards the privileged and the powerful with a government that refuses  to hear their voices.                            ____________________
