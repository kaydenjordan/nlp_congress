 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the Rotary Club of Monroe, Louisiana.   The Monroe Rotary Club started on June 1, 1918, and its centennial  birthday marks 100 years of service, charity, and dedication from the  members over the years. Today, the club has grown to over 140 members,  and it is involved in service projects throughout the Monroe area.   The Monroe Rotary Club promotes education, local economic growth, and  clean water availability locally, nationally, and around the world just  to promote the innate ability to drink clean water.   Members of this club are the problem solvers that collaborate with  the community leaders, many of whom are members themselves, to lead and  continue to lead on issues that are facing the Monroe area.   In this year alone, the Monroe Rotary Club has donated over 1,000  books to inmates at the Swanson Correctional Center, awarded 11 $250  scholarships to high school seniors, and donated 95 bicycles to  children in need  [[Page H4587]]  during the Christmas season. Their crowning annual event is a gumbo  fundraiser, where they raise thousands of dollars for their service  projects. In this year alone, they have raised over $8,000 that will be  used to buy new playground equipment, send children to camp, and  sponsor softball teams. I am always very proud to see people and  organizations like these in the Monroe area, and in my entire district  in Louisiana.   Over the past 100 years, the Monroe Rotary Club has worked tirelessly  to improve the city and the quality of life for those who live there.                                time  1015    They inspire me and others by the changes that they direct, that they  make, and the positive impact that they bring to the Monroe area.   Today, not only do I congratulate them on their 100th anniversary,  but I stand in recognition and certainly thanks for their century of  service to the city of Monroe and the State of Louisiana.                            ____________________
