 Madam President, I rise today with Senator Jeanne  Shaheen to request that the Ukraine resolution introduced by us, along  with Senators Risch, Menendez, Cornyn, and Durbin be passed by  unanimous consent.   This is a dangerous time in the world, especially for our ally,  Ukraine. There are over 150,000 Russian troops poised on their border,  an overwhelming force that could invade at a moment's notice.   This resolution is very simple and straightforward; it makes it clear  that for 30 years Ukraine has been an independent and sovereign  country. It commends the bravery of the Ukrainian people and their  desire to integrate with the West, to align themselves with democratic  values and freedom and continue to move away from the autocratic rule  of Russia.   It also acknowledges the over 14,000 Ukrainians who have been killed  since 2014 in fighting against Russian backed separatists.   It details the ongoing illegal Russian aggression against Ukraine.   Most importantly, this resolution reaffirms our unwavering support to  Ukraine and the importance of our NATO alliance and our transatlantic  partnerships.   This is simply a strong, bipartisan show of support to our ally  Ukraine as they face a threat and danger not of their making.   I now yield the floor to my friend, Senator Shaheen from New  Hampshire.
