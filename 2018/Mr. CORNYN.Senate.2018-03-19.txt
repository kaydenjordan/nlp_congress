 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am pleased to learn that Senator Cory  Booker, our colleague from New Jersey, is the 73rd cosponsor of the Fix  NICS bill, which I have introduced and which I hope will be passed out  of the Senate soon. This bill is designed to fix the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System, which, if it had been working the way  it was designed to, would have caught the shooter at Sutherland  Springs, perhaps saving the lives of 26 people who lost their lives in  that little Baptist church outside of San Antonio; 20 more were shot  and will suffer those wounds the rest of their lives.   Today the news brought us the fact that apparently there had been a  recommendation by mental health professionals that Nikolas Cruz, the  shooter in Parkland, FL, be committed for involuntary treatment, but  apparently that never materialized. That was the recommendation, but it  never actually happened. If that had happened, under the current law,  his name would have been included in the Florida upload of background  check information, and that would have prevented him from legally  buying a firearm.   So we are starting to see the different data points that begin to  paint a picture of the sorts of things that we could do here in  Washington, DC, to save lives in these future mass shooting events. We  know the President has said to the Department of Justice that he wants  bump stocks banned. Of course, that was the instrument used to kill  dozens of people in Las Vegas and injure 851 more.   So by addressing things like the background check system, improving  the mental health response, eliminating the bump stock--which takes a  semiautomatic weapon and makes it operate essentially like an automatic  weapon--and by providing assistance to our schools so that they can  harden themselves against potential attacks, we can begin to see a  picture of the sorts of things we ought to be doing to prevent future  mass shootings like the one we saw most recently in Parkland, FL. It is  simply our responsibility to make sure we do everything we humanly can.   I know that after these horrific events, people throw up their hands  and say: We need to do something. Well, we need to do something that  matters and that will save lives in the future. I think we now begin to  have a picture of the sorts of things we can do, starting with the  passage of the Fix NICS background check system. It is the only piece  of legislation I know of that now has 73 cosponsors, with Senator  Booker of New Jersey being added as the 73rd today. It is the only bill  I know of that has that kind of broad, widespread support and that will  actually, if implemented, save lives.   Mr. President, this week we will be discussing another important  subject--one that perhaps people do not want to hear about; rather,  they would prefer that it not exist at all because it is a  manifestation of evil. The subject is online sex trafficking.  Unfortunately, it happens in the shadows of our society. Today, the  internet and other forms of technology have made certain forms of  predatory, perverted behavior easier to engage in without getting  caught.   The legislation we are voting on this week aims to protect our  children, provide justice to victims of human trafficking, and to make  sure Federal laws do not protect profiteering web domains where sex  trafficking occurs.   The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, would allow sex  trafficking victims to have their day in court by eliminating Federal  liability protections for technology providers that knowingly-- knowingly--facilitate online sex trafficking. It would allow State and  local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute providers that  violate Federal sex trafficking laws.   I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors of this legislation  and to have been working on it with my colleagues to get it to this  point today. The bill was introduced last summer after a 2-year inquiry  by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which culminated in a  report. The report found not only that sex trafficking has run rampant  in certain online spaces but also that websites have tried to cover it  up. Well, no longer. Last fall, the Senate Commerce Committee  unanimously approved SESTA, and the House passed it last month. This  week, it is our turn.   Senator Portman, the junior Senator from Ohio, has been this bill's  greatest champion since its inception. He has been informing us time  and again of the ways in which sex trafficking has moved--as he likes  to say it--from the street corner to the smartphone. He spoke on the  floor earlier this year and reminded us that even as technology  develops and gives us new opportunities to learn, to innovate, and to  connect with one another, it is not an unalloyed good. In the wrong  hands, by the wrong people, it can be misused. As Senator Portman urged  us, we need to shine a light onto the ``dark side of the internet,'' an  area he called a ``stain on our national character.'' He is absolutely  right, of course. The buying and selling of young people for sex is a  moral scourge, and how we respond is a measure of our national  conscience.   In the committee's investigation, one website in particular came up  over and over and over again; that is, backpage.com, which is  responsible for perhaps three-quarters of all child trafficking  reports--three-quarters. It eventually became clear that even though  that site was actively helping to sell young women for sex and even  though the victims and their families were suing backpage.com in  response, none of the lawsuits were successful because of what some  people are coming to believe is an outdated immunity for  [[Page S1775]]  technology providers under a Federal law known as the Communications  Decency Act. Courts have repeatedly emphasized that the broad reach of  one section of that statute protects websites that help to buy and sell  underage girls for sex. Judges across the country have said it is up to  Congress to change the law, and now it is our time to do just that.   The original law was intended to protect free speech, which, of  course, is important. I, of course, like all of our colleagues, am a  firm believer in the First Amendment, but free speech is no license to  engage in illegal activity. Free speech can't be used as an excuse to  offer young people into sexual servitude. And the internet cannot be a  safe place for terrorists and child sex traffickers.   At last count, 67 Senators have joined this effort as cosponsors. We  are joined by anti-human trafficking advocates, law enforcement  organizations, State attorneys general, the civil rights community,  faith-based groups, and tech companies like Facebook and Oracle. We  have all made clear that we stand behind SESTA.   I hope our colleagues will join me in voting for this important  legislation this week and ensure that websites and online platforms can  be held accountable for facilitating sex trafficking.                               Yemen Resolution    On another matter, Mr. President, this week, the Senate may vote on a  privileged resolution offered by three of our colleagues--the junior  Senators from Utah, Vermont, and Connecticut--which would direct the  President to cut off financial support and other support for the Saudi- led coalition in Yemen. This, of course, is a proxy war, in many ways,  between Iran, which has intervened in the civil war in Yemen, and--not  only to allow the Saudis the means to defend themselves against  incursions and attacks by the Houthis, Iranian-backed rebels, but also  to facilitate our relationship with the Saudis and the Emirates, which  is very important in terms of our anti-ISIS and anti-al-Qaida effort,  with cells of these organizations located in Yemen too.   Our support, of course, is already narrowly circumscribed--our  support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. General Mattis, our  Secretary of Defense, has described this as our alternative to putting  American boots on the ground. We operate by, with, and through our  allies by providing logistical support, intelligence, and some  technical advice. Currently, in Yemen it takes the forms intelligence- sharing, military advice, and logistical support, such as air-to-air  refueling. This is very clearly noncombatant support, at least as  traditionally defined and historically known, and it is meant to  improve processes and procedures and increase compliance with the  international law of armed conflict.   The very support we are providing aids in mitigating civilian  casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian crisis brought on by the  Iranian-backed Houthis. I know the Presiding Officer has been leading  the charge on addressing the humanitarian crisis there, which is mind- boggling, to be sure.   Contrary to the resolution's sponsors' claims, though, the U.S.  military is not engaged in hostilities in Yemen, as that term has  historically been understood and applied, since it is not in direct  conflict or exchanging fire with Houthi forces. Of course, we all share  a concern with what is at stake in Yemen and in Saudi Arabia and in the  gulf region but also civilian casualties, which this resolution creates  problems with. Almost everyone is aware that Yemen has been suffering  from a severe humanitarian crisis for years. Were we to remove U.S.  targeting and logistical support from the Saudi coalition, then the  humanitarian situation could get even worse than it has been.   Both political parties recognize the important role the United States  plays in support of our partners' efforts to push back against the  malign forces that have been coalescing in Yemen. In fact, President  Obama was the one who first implemented the refueling and logistical  support policy that remains in effect today.   In 2016, Senator Menendez--now the ranking member of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee--criticized the international community's  failure to address the Iranian-fueled conflicts that included support  to a Houthi insurgency that helped topple the internationally  recognized Government of Yemen. Senator Menendez went on to say: ``I  have a sense we are creating a permissive environment.''   I agree with Senator Menendez that we should not abandon our partners  and leave a ``permissive environment''--a vacuum, a void--for bad  actors to fill.   If there is one lesson that I thought we learned after 9/11, when  3,000 Americans were killed when two planes were hijacked--actually,  four were hijacked; two went into the World Trade Center, one into the  Pentagon, and one landed in Pennsylvania because passengers on the  plane overwhelmed the hijackers--what we learned is that what happens  in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle East. What happened in  Afghanistan is that the Taliban provided a safe haven for Osama bin  Laden and al-Qaida, and they used that safe haven to train and export  their terrorist attacks against countries around the world but  primarily against the United States. That is what happened on 9/11/ 2001.   That is why we can't allow a safe haven, a void, in Yemen, not to  mention the fact that Iran continues to use proxies in places like  Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, among others, to try to fight the United  States in a low-grade war that has been going on literally since 1979.  I should mention Iraq as one of those countries as well.   It is precisely because of the delicate and desperate situation in  Yemen that I am making the argument that any consideration to withdraw  U.S. troops from fulfilling their limited auxiliary role in this  conflict would have broad impacts on our global partnerships and  counterterrorism efforts. It is not a decision to be made in haste or a  decision to be made lightly; therefore, I believe the idea deserves the  careful consideration of the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. If the Senate takes this vote without  adequate preparation and deliberation and passes this resolution, we  lose that chance for careful consideration. We lose the chance to have  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issue a thoroughly researched  and deliberated recommendation to the entire Senate.   Even more troubling is the prospect that this resolution could set a  precedent--one in which a few Members' preferred policies are  prioritized over the normal Senate procedures and more thoughtful  committee deliberation, with unintended global impacts. Yemen is not  the only place where we are addressing challenges to peace and to our  country by, with, and through allies, without Americans engaging in  direct hostilities. So this would have unintended global impact.   Secretary of Defense James Mattis has voiced his concerns over this  resolution. In a letter to congressional leadership, he said that new  restrictions on the U.S. military could increase civilian casualties  and jeopardize our partners' cooperation on counterterrorism efforts.  On top of that list would be the Saudis and the Emirates, among others,  and other people are watching as well. And it will reduce our influence  in the key region.   He warned that a withdrawal of our noncombat support in Yemen could  embolden rebels in the area, enable further missile strikes on Saudi  Arabia, and threaten shipping lanes in the Red Sea--one of the key  chokepoints for international commerce--right there on the western  border of Yemen. All this combined could stoke the embers of an even  greater regional conflict in the Middle East with unknown consequences.  More importantly, it would damage U.S. credibility and strengthen  Iran's position in Yemen and throughout the Middle East more broadly.   I hope our colleagues will think soberly and thoughtfully about this  resolution and insist that a fulsome debate take place where it  belongs, initially, and that is within the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. I have talked to Senator Corker, the chairman of that  committee. He will speak for himself, but I think he certainly believes  that the committee can help the Senate make a good decision after  giving the committee an opportunity to have hearings and to consider  all the intended and unintended consequences of this resolution.   I know our colleagues who have offered the resolution mean well and  their intentions are good, but sometimes--particularly in the area of  [[Page S1776]]  international conflict and global interactions with different  countries--our actions beget an unintended consequence. I think it is  good to be safe in the first place and to take this matter through the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where I have every confidence that  Senator Corker, as the chairman, and Ranking Member Menendez can guide  the members of that committee through a process that will help us in  the end to make a better decision.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Arizona (Mr.  McCain), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).
