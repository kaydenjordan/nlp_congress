 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of northeast Indiana broadcasting icon, Charly Butcher.  [[Page H7784]]    For decades, thousands of northeast Indiana residents would start  their mornings with Charly, a beloved radio anchor on WOWO's morning  news program.   His talent and ability to speak directly through the radio and into  the home or car of each listener was unparalleled. Though he could have  become a radio fixture anywhere in the country, Charly chose to stay in  Fort Wayne and broadcast locally for more than 30 years.   I was fortunate to get to know Charly both on and off the air, but  our off-the-air conversations are what I will cherish the most. He was  passionate about education, as his wife Sarah is an elementary  schoolteacher, and we would often discuss my work on the House  Education and the Workforce Committee.   While our entire region mourns his loss, his irreplaceable voice will  live on for generations to come. I offer my deepest condolences to his  wife Sarah, three children, and colleagues at WOWO.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me time to remember Charly and  to honor his legacy.                            ____________________
