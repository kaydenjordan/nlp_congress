 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate took an important  step to restore sense and order to the way we approach the Executive  Calendar. It is one of this body's most important responsibilities. Yet  it has been hampered recently by a campaign of systematic and  comprehensive obstruction that stands literally without precedent in  American history.   I won't restate each part of our debate from the floor yesterday, but  the objective facts of this situation are unambiguous. For the past 2  years, we have witnessed the accelerated erosion of the norms by which  this body has historically considered Presidential nominations. We have  seen a disappointing series of records broken in the process, such as  128 cloture votes on nominations in this President's first 2 years-- more than 5 times as many as in the same period of every administration  since Jimmy Carter, combined. Forty-two executive branch positions took  cloture votes for the first time ever.   This has been a new level of paralysis, surrounding even the most  qualified and least controversial nominees. In a way, it has been the  natural outgrowth of the erosion on nominations that began back in 2003  when our current Democratic leader helped spur his side of the aisle to  walk away from longstanding institutional norms and declare the  Executive Calendar open season for regular, chronic filibuster tactics  and forced cloture votes. That is when this relatively new mess began  in earnest.   In 2013, in a truly bipartisan vote, a number of Republicans,  including me, joined with Democrats to implement new expedited  procedures for lower tier nominees. We put them in place right at the  beginning of President Obama's second term, even as we on this side  were still licking our wounds from the previous November's election  result.   This week, our Democratic colleagues had the chance to reciprocate.  They had the opportunity to do the parallel thing, exactly the same  thing, and vote to limit undue Senate delays for this Republican  administration the same way we Republicans did for President Obama's  administration. Oh, but they weren't interested.   These days, I am sorry to say, the other side of the aisle seems to  be dominated by pure partisanship over absolutely everything else.  Remember, it wasn't long ago that this current behavior would have  appeared unimaginable. Just a few decades ago, the idea of routinely  forcing 60-vote thresholds and extra delays on nominations was firmly  in third-rail territory. Well, a lot has happened since then, but I  hope my colleagues share my belief that the Senate's traditions and  norms are its greatest assets. In that respect, yesterday was a very  good day for this body as an institution.   The Senate has historically been defined by two traditions. One has  preserved the power of the minority in considering legislation--to pump  the brakes or force a second look. That includes the legislative  filibuster, which I know many of us on both sides are 100 percent  committed to preserving. In my view and in the view of many, it is  inseparable from the way this body was designed. It is what keeps the  Senate from swinging wildly back and forth between each party's entire  agenda.   I don't think my Democratic colleagues who are running for President  and publicly toying with undermining the legislative filibuster would  be too keen to see Republicans enact our entire, full-tilt conservative  agenda with just 51 votes, because some day the shoe will be on the  other foot. The shoe, in fact, always at some point ends up on the  other foot.   That is one tradition.   The second tradition, concerning nominations, has always been  different. For decades and decades, it allowed for a reasonable process  for the vast majority of Presidents' nominees. Yesterday, even though  Democrats walked away and Republicans had to act alone, we took a big  step toward restoring that second part of Senate tradition.   I am sure yesterday's progress has not resolved every sore spot. I  feel certain that we have not seen the last of our Democratic  colleagues' addiction  [[Page S2246]]  to endlessly relitigating the 2016 elections instead of moving forward.  But with yesterday's action, the Senate has begun to move past this  particularly shameful new chapter. We have turned the page on the kind  of systematic obstruction and purely partisan delays that were  completely foreign to this Chamber a few years ago but have since  become a daily routine. Now more progress can take place.   Yesterday, after two unopposed committee votes and more than a year  and a half after Jeffrey Kessler was named as President Trump's choice  for Assistant Secretary of Commerce, his nomination was subjected to a  cloture vote, 95 to 3. Because of our new procedures, he was confirmed  by voice vote just 2 hours later. Then we voted to end debate on the  nomination of Roy Altman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the  Southern District of Florida--another uncontroversial, bipartisan  nominee. Today we will confirm him as well. Then we will vote to end  debate on the nomination of Mark Calabria to direct the Federal Housing  Finance Agency, and then we will vote to confirm him too.   Nominees will now be moving at a more reasonable pace, and important  jobs are finally being filled. Already there is real progress thanks to  yesterday's pivot back to the Senate's historic tradition. We will keep  working to clear the backlog of talented individuals who are still  waiting patiently behind them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

Mr. President, today I would like to remember the life  of Frank Treadway, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 96.   Born in Bell County in southeast Kentucky, Frank was one of 12  children, and much of his childhood was spent helping on the family  farm in Noetown. During his teenage years, Frank worked at the  Middlesboro Country Club as a golf caddy, developing a lifelong love  for the game. Like so many members of the Greatest Generation, Frank  proudly answered his Nation's call to service, and he enlisted in the  U.S. Navy during World War II. Aboard the U.S.S. Kyne, Frank served  throughout the Pacific. For their meritorious participation in combat,  the crew received multiple commendations.   After Frank returned home from the war, Frank married the love of his  life, Inez. They spent 70 years together and raised seven children.  Farming remained an enduring passion, and one of Frank's proudest  accomplishments was the founding and continued success of his local  farm market, Treadway Gardens. Throughout his life, Frank remained  loyal to his childhood home and always held the people of southeast  Kentucky in high regard. Elaine and I commend this hero for his  service, and we send our condolences to Inez, their children, family,  and friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 5, S.
