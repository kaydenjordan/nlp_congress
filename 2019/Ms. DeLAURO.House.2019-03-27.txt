 Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 7, the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   It is a historic day on the House of Representatives floor, and we  are going to pass paycheck fairness, equal pay for equal work, in this  United States of America.   Madam Chair, I thank the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee for getting this bill through the committee and onto the  floor today. We have waited 8 years to be able to vote on this issue.   The United States Congress has a rich history of making a difference  in the lives of the American people: Social Security, the Fair Labor  Standards Act, the GI Bill, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act, to  name but a few.   Today, we can make a difference for working women and their families.  Today, we can address the biggest economic challenge of our time, that  Americans are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We can  address their economic struggle. And, yes, this is a bill that the  majority is passing today to address that economic need for families.   I cannot tell you how difficult it has been to break through on  something so simple: Men and women in the same job deserve the same  pay. But now, the issue and the environment have collided. Equal pay is  at the center of our public discourse, and paycheck fairness is ready  for passage today.   A bipartisan bill supported by every member of the Democratic Caucus,  the Paycheck Fairness Act toughens remedies in the Equal Pay Act of  1963 to give America's working women the opportunity to fight wage  discrimination and to receive the paycheck that they have earned.   Under existing law, damages are too insubstantial to provide women  with full restitution or provide bad-acting companies a meaningful  deterrent.   Paycheck fairness puts gender-based discrimination sanctions on equal  footing with other forms of wage discrimination by allowing women to  sue for compensatory and punitive damages. It better protects employees  from being fired for sharing their salary with coworkers. It  establishes a grant program to provide salary negotiation training for  girls and for women. It ensures that employers are not reliant on wage  history when they hire an employee.   Over 60 years ago, after Republican President Dwight Eisenhower  called for equal pay legislation during his 1956 State of the Union  Address on the floor of this House, and more than 55 years after  President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, pay discrimination is very  much still a reality in our country. In 2017, there were almost 26,000  charges of unlawful, sex-based pay discrimination filed with the U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 996 Equal Pay Act charges.    Women continue to earn 20 percent less than men, on  average, according to Census data. Women earn less regardless of the  choices they make in their career or education. Across industries,  whether you are a financial manager, a registered nurse, a  schoolteacher, or an executive, a pay gap exists between men and women.   Ten years ago, we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It  reopened the courtroom door but did not address the underlying issue at  hand today.   We have an opportunity to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. It is a  matter of right and wrong. Discrimination is unacceptable, and we are  all diminished when we fall short.   President Kennedy said, when he signed the Equal Pay Act, that this  would ``add to our laws another structure basic to democracy'' and  ``affirm our determination that when women enter the labor force, they  will find equality in their pay envelope.''   We can do this today on the floor of this House. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act and  make sure that we guarantee equal pay for equal work.                                time  1400
