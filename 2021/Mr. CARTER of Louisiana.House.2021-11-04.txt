 Mr. Speaker, let me paint a picture. It is  the east side of New Orleans in 1959. A Black man at a swimming pool  jumps off the high dive, arched in the sky. Fellow swimmers and  passersby watch him from the shade of a palm tree. A Ferris wheel turns  at the amusement park, and families picnic on the sandy shore of Lake  Pontchartrain.   That is what Lincoln Beach was like in its heyday: a beach, amusement  park, performance area, and pool for the Black community of New Orleans  who were not allowed at the all-White swimming pools in the area.   Growing up, my community had fond memories of Lincoln Beach, as it  was in the process of shutting down after courts decreed a racial  nondiscrimination policy for private facilities on public lands,  desegregating the all-White pools.   Since its closure in the sixties, Lincoln Beach has fallen into  decline. It was a site for picnics and outings. Without any  maintenance, and over the decades, mountains of debris have piled up.  This historic site, where so many Black kids and families built  communities in New Orleans East, was fenced off and forgotten to many,  but not to everyone.   During COVID-19, some inspiring local activists and community members  including Sage, Reggie, and Bliss, took it upon themselves to take the  first steps toward reopening historic Lincoln Beach. They got into some  good trouble and cleaned up the beach all by themselves, spending their  own resources, time, energy, and money.   All on their own time, their own dime, they removed hundreds of bags  of garbage and debris. About 3 tons of refuse was removed by these  good-doing volunteers. After Hurricane Ida, they are facing some  setbacks once again with flooding that floated the more than a year's  worth of trash collection away. However, these committed activists are  already back to work, cleaning up the beach and trying to remove  obstacles to the future of what can be a revitalized, renewed Lincoln  Beach.   After Hurricane Katrina, the primarily Black community of New Orleans  East repopulated essentially at the same rate as the city of New  Orleans, but businesses did not come back at the same strength. Many of  the major commercial areas are full of vacant businesses in this  thriving, rich, strong community of New Orleans East. The once-popular  mall was razed instead of being rebuilt.   In 2019, a report said that 19 percent of the homes are vacant.  Reopening a beautiful beach on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain could  be a catalyst that will attract a renaissance of economic development  in a community that has historically been underserved and should have  equitable investments.   One of the most important things a Member of Congress can do is to  fight for allocations to fund projects for development to improve the  lives of the constituents in a particular area, like New Orleans East.  This is an equity issue. This is a racial issue. This is an issue of  economic development. This is an environmental issue and a recreation  issue.   Lincoln Beach has a rich history, important cultural significance,  and a huge potential for the future of this great community. I support  the efforts of the city of New Orleans to direct RESTORE Act funds  toward the project and today, I reaffirm my commitment to support the  renewal of Lincoln Beach in any way possible from Congress, State, and  local resources.   I came to Congress to fight for the people of the Second  Congressional District, to fight for good jobs, healthy communities,  equity and opportunities. One way to achieve this fight is for us to  revitalize New Orleans East and to bring Lincoln Beach back to its full  luster and beauty for the community to enjoy, to use as a catalyst for  further economic development, to show what revitalization and community  efforts, joining with Federal, local, and State resources, can do.   We can and we will do better. The people of New Orleans, the people  of Louisiana certainly deserve it, and we will fight to continue to  bring those resources to bear.

Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 362 and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 363.
