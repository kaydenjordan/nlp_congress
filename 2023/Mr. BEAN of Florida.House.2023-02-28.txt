 Mr. Speaker, he is at it again. President  Biden's war on America's energy continues.   It started on day one with the cancellation of the Keystone XL  pipeline, and 2 years later, this administration is pushing  environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, to clog America's oil  and gas production.   The Department of Labor is seeking to weaponize American retirement  funds as part of President Biden's anti-fossil fuel agenda, all at the  expense of your retirement savings. ESG requirements not only  exacerbate high energy costs but also contribute to inflationary woes  and weaken our national security.    To be clear, ESG is more government control. ESG is less freedom for  Americans. ESG simply is a woke capitalist scam posing as responsible  corporate governance, which robs Americans of their hard-earned  retirement investments.   It is time to stand against the progressive mob, which only wants an  inch but seems to take a mile. Today, we are going to say no. We are  going to draw the line and say it ends now.   It is time to stand against the progressive mob and safeguard our  Nation's energy independence from the outstretched claws of ESG. A  correct vote on the bill today is ``yes,'' as a ``yes'' vote today says  no to ESG.
