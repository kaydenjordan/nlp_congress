 Mr. Speaker, sadly the Biden inflation  is ongoing, and families are struggling to survive as jobs are being  destroyed.   Last month I shared the Labor Department report the Consumer Price  Index for August was rising at the fastest pace in 13 years. This  continued in September, and here are a few price increase examples:  gasoline up 42.1 percent; gas utilities up 20.6 percent; bacon up 19.3  percent; eggs up 12.6 percent; children's shoes up 11.9 percent; fresh  fish and seafood up 10.7 percent.   Biden tax-and-spend policies cause inflation and destroy jobs.  Clearly, the Democrat elite think they are smarter than anyone with the  Democrat voters they see as ignorant making a claim that $3.5 trillion  will have zero costs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
