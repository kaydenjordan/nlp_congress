 Mr. Speaker, I am very humbled to stand on the floor of  this great institution with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  to co-lead this important resolution and to show that this greatest  country, the leaders of the free world, are going to stand up to the  atrocities and tyrannies that are happening right now.   I am very proud to have a strong, freedom-fighting Ukrainian  heritage. I actually was born in the Soviet Union, when Ukraine was  under that evil country.   I am so proud that strong, brave Ukrainians are willing to fight  again and again to be free. It should inspire all of us. Their bravery  and actions are unbelievable. It should teach us, and maybe remind us,  what it means to be a free country and how hard it is to get your  rights and freedoms back when you lose them. We had so many people die  for our freedoms, so let's value and cherish them.   I am very happy to see that this institution, when times are tough,  when we have to get together, we can get together and show our allies  we will stand together and show our adversaries and enemies we will  stand together. Not just stand together, but we will also lead the  world.   I also want to tell the Ukrainian people that the American people are  inspired and humbled. They see your struggles and pray with you and  stand with you. This resolution from we, the people, from this United  States Congress, is evidence of it.   I also want to tell the Russian people--I actually have some Don  Cossack heritage--I know it is tough for you. I know what President  Putin has done to you. It is awful. But you need to have the backbone  to stand up, or we will find you in history worse than you could  imagine. So you stand up and stop this atrocity before it causes more  damage. What is happening there on the ground, it is not a war. It is  slaughtering, killing of the Ukrainian people. You are killing your  fellow Orthodox Christians and East Slavs, and they went through  history with oppression and suppression. How can you stand with that? I  know that your propaganda is strong. I know they tell you things that  are awful. But open your eyes. Don't be part of it. Tell your  government that they have to stop this elimination and extinction of  people.   I also want to thank everyone here in this country for loving  freedoms, for supporting freedoms, and being willing to be part of this  challenge on the right side. Our actions should be decisive. In times  like this, they require strong leadership and strong actions.   We, as an independent branch of our Government--I always say we are  co-equal, but first among equals because we do have the power of the  purse and the power of war. So we have a lot of powers for a reason,  and that is why our Founding Fathers gave us this power, because we are  the people who should put pressure on our President to be more decisive  and strong and have some stronger actions.   On sanctions, we have to be tougher. We need to go after the energy  sector. We need to make sure that a lot of oligarchs that are not on  the list are there, they should be on the list, the key oligarchs. They  understand that it is not just the Russian people that will be feeling  the pain, that already they suppressed and stole money from them, but  they will start feeling the pain.   We also need to make sure that we will have a way to affect the  financial system much more decisively.  [[Page H1250]]    We also need to make sure that these war crimes are going to go to  international courts, and these people that make decisions on killing,  on genocide, and using illegal weapons will also bear some  responsibility.                                time  1445    I also think we have a responsibility to provide safe passage in the  humanitarian corridor, and I hope we will have other allies working  with us and help us on that.   But most important, we need to make sure that we will provide proper  defensive legal aid to the Ukrainians that they can defend themselves  from this extermination before it is too late. We must act, and I am  very honored to be part of this effort to show that we are willing to  lead as this institution.
