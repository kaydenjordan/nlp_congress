 Mr. Speaker, it is the 30th anniversary of Domestic  Violence Awareness Month.   Domestic violence is a crime that impacts every race, gender, class,  and sex.   In my home State, 33 percent of California women and 28 percent of  California men will experience domestic violence. Nevertheless, since  this month was recognized for the first time in 1987, much progress has  been made.   I began my professional career as a prosecutor back in 1996, and I  can tell you, back then it was tough to get a jury to understand and  even listen to the circumstances behind domestic violence, and it was  tough to convince jurors that domestic violence is not a private issue  that should be kept in the bedroom, but instead, it is a righteous  issue that needed to be brought out in our courtrooms.   Fortunately, there were police officers to make arrests, there were  prosecutors to try the cases, and there were advocates to give the  victims the confidence they need to come forward.   So this month we recognize those who support domestic violence  victims, we vow to hold abusers accountable, and we strive to create  and to update legislation that not only protects, but emboldens victims  of domestic violence so that they can embrace living their lives.                            ____________________
