 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the legacy of President Ronald Reagan on his birthday.   Some have called him Ronnie, the Gipper, or the Great Communicator.  No matter what you call him, he was the right President for this  country at the right time.   President Reagan came into office with the world still in crisis over  the Cold War and a country under the crushing weight of stagflation. By  the time President Reagan left office, the economy roared and Reagan's  words had inflicted a mortal blow to the Berlin Wall. Shortly after  leaving office, the Berlin Wall fell and the threat of communism along  with it.   President Reagan led this country with conviction. His conservative  principles empowered millions of people  [[Page H858]]  from coast-to-coast and across the world. His words struck fear into  the hearts of our enemies and warmed the hearts of our friends.   We have a lot to learn from President Reagan's life, his legacy, and  his leadership.                            ____________________
