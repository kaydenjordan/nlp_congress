 Madam Speaker, mahalo also to my brother and my freshman  colleague from New York for allowing me this opportunity to speak about  something really important in our country, and that is the American  Families Plan.   Today, I rise in support of our Nation's students, the future of  America, an engaged generation of young Americans working to create a  better future for our country. We must stand with them. The time is now  to do that, as they embark on their journey to unlock their potential  and achieve their dreams. But that journey starts with a quality  education and the opportunity for higher education, the great equalizer  in our society.                                time  1915    Now, our children wield tremendous potential and remind us to dream  big. However, too many of our students do not have that opportunity  because of the high costs of public higher education. Skyrocketing  tuition, application fees, student fees, overpriced textbooks, meal  plans, dorm plans all contribute to $1.4 trillion in crushing student  debt and are barriers preventing all of America's children from  pursuing higher education.   The American Families Plan will change that. The American Families  [[Page H2810]]  Plan will enable the opportunity for every student across the country  to obtain a degree or certificate through a community college for free.   The American Families Plan is built to invest in our children from  early childhood through postsecondary education. Most importantly, this  plan recognizes the importance of investing in access to community  college.   Each year thousands of students in my home State of Hawaii benefit  from community colleges across our islands, but unfortunately just 50  percent of those students are able to complete a postsecondary degree  of any kind within 6 years of enrolling. As a product of community  college myself, and an educator, I know how these public institutions  can positively impact our most disadvantaged communities, which is why  for so long I have fought to remove barriers to higher education.   The American Families Plan will redefine access to education, taking  the long overdue step of ensuring 2 years of free community college for  all students. This opportunity will invest in the future of our  students, prepare them to compete and succeed in a highly competitive  global economy, and level the playing field.   Every child in our country deserves the opportunity to live the  American Dream, but in order to achieve that, we must believe, all of  us must believe that we all have a stake in each other's prosperity.   President Biden's vision in the American Families Plan is a defining  moment in our Nation's history and will give American children head  starts and pave the way for the best-educated generation in U.S.  history.   America's students have an amazing opportunity to pursue education  beyond high school. Let us give them that opportunity.   Mahalo, Madam Speaker, and my colleague from New York.
