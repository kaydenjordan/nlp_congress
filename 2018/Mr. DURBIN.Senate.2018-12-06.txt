 Mr. President, on November 28, Quincy, IL, lost a legend  in Coach John ``Jack'' Butler Mackenzie at the age of 77. Jack was the  architect of an amazing soccer program at Quincy University. He led the  Franciscan school's soccer program to nine National Association of  Intercollegiate Athletics, NAIA, National Championships and 516  victories, making him the tenth all-time in NCAA history for wins,  regardless of division. He did all of this while setting examples as a  coach, a father, grandfather, and leader.   Jack was born on February 26, 1941, to John ``Scottie'' and Mary Jane  Mackenzie. He attended McBride High School in 1959 and earned a  scholarship to play football at the University of Missouri. After a  year, Jack left to attend Washington University in St. Louis, earning  both a bachelor's degree in physical education and a master's in  education.   Jack married his high school sweetheart, Sharon Bechtold, in June of  1962. He enjoyed telling people that he fell in love with her in sixth  grade. Jack worked at Augustinian Academy in St. Louis and was on the  cusp of making a big decision.   In 1969, at the urging of his best friend, Frank Longo, who  introduced soccer to Quincy, Jack moved from St. Louis to run the  Quincy University soccer program. QU had already won  [[Page S7352]]  two NAIA national championships in the program's first 5 years of  existence when Jack arrived, but the QU Hawks reached new levels of  success under Jack.   Jack's Hawks finished in the top three in the national tournament 12  times, including nine championships. They won five consecutive titles  from 1977 to 1981. During his four-decade career, Jack won the NAIA  National Coach of the Year four times. Thirty one All-American athletes  came out of his program.   Jack loved the game of soccer, and soccer's popularity in Quincy  exploded. The Quinsippi Soccer League formed in the late 1960s, helping  young kids learn about soccer in elementary school. Jack helped teach  adults who volunteered to coach the league, offered practice drills and  strategies for helping boys and girls learn the game.   With QU's success, the school moved to NCAA Division I in 1984 and  then to Division II in 1995, joining the Great Lakes Valley Conference.  Quincy University didn't dominate as they did in the early days of  Jack's tenure, but they regularly made the playoffs and had winning  records.   In 2011, Jack's Hawks won the Great Lakes Valley Conference for the  first time since joining the conference. It was Jack's last season  coaching the team full time. It wasn't the biggest victory he had ever  had, but it was one he loved like the others.   In retirement, Jack remained active in the community. He helped out  with Special Olympics teams. He rarely missed a home game of QU's  soccer team. Jack was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame, NCAA Hall of  Fame, United Soccer Coaches Hall of Fame, St. Louis Players, and QU  Hall of Fame. Legends Stadium, where QU plays soccer, has its playing  surface named after Jack.   Jack Mackenzie had a gift for storytelling and the ability to make  someone's day more enjoyable. He loved his ``beautiful game,'' the kids  who learned from him, and his family. His best story was really his  own. When kids play on Jack Mackenzie field, it will be remembered as a  game based on love.   Jack is survived by his wife of 56 years, Sharon, and six children-- Scott; Christopher, wife Leigh, and their children, Julian and  Isabella; Kevin, wife Susan, and their sons, Andrew, Tyler, and Luke;  Brian, wife Bonnie, and their children, Kate and Jack; Beth Hilbing,  husband Chad, and their children Jake, Grace, and Sam; and Megan Henke,  husband Adam, and their daughter, Genevieve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Saturday, at least 29 tornadoes  reportedly touched down in Illinois in Cass, Christian, DeWitt, Fulton,  Macon, Macoupin, Mason, McDonough, McLean, Montgomery, Pike, Schuyler,  and Tazewell Counties in central Illinois. The National Weather Service  is still surveying nearby areas but reports this is the biggest  December tornado outbreak in the history of Illinois.   One of the touchdowns in Taylorville caused major damage. I spoke  with Taylorville mayor Bruce Berry. Thankfully, no fatalities have been  reported, but 20 to 30 people were injured and early reports indicate  more than 400 homes and buildings were damaged. Several homes have had  roofs damaged and torn off, and others were tragically destroyed.   Two days after the storm, 310 households still did not have power,  and the schools in Taylorville were closed as a result of the damages.  The community is busy cleaning up and utility companies are working to  get electricity back on.   I am grateful for the dedication of the local first responders, who  rescued residents that were trapped inside their homes due to the  tornado damage. These responders still have task forces searching for  anyone that might need assistance. Local officials and the Illinois  Emergency Management Agency are also working to make sure communities  have the resources to protect critical infrastructure and begin to  repair damage, a feat that could take months. American Red Cross  volunteers are also providing food, shelter, and water to those in  need. Across the region, friends and family have stepped up to help  those whose homes and businesses were damaged.   The Illinois delegation and I stand ready to assist in any way we  can. I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the response  efforts so far, and all those who will take part in rebuilding damaged  homes, businesses, and schools. Illinoisans always rebuild and endure,  as we have done many times before--and we are stronger for it.                            ____________________
