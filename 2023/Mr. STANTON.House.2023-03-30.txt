 On this Transgender Day of Visibility, I want to speak  about a young constituent of mine, an 11-year-old girl from Mesa,  Arizona.   She wrote me a few days ago to say that one day she wants to grow up  to be a doctor or maybe even President. Her favorite color is pink. She  loves cats and the yellow minions. She also wants to play on the local  soccer team with her friends.   However, because of the wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in  Arizona and other legislatures around the country and right here in  Congress, she is afraid, and so is her family.   To that little girl, I want you to know that you are anything but.  You are exceptional and you are deserving of every opportunity to  pursue your passions and your dreams. Please know that you are loved  and you are not alone, and that I and many of my fellow colleagues  right here in Congress will continue to work to protect your rights.   Trans youth are kids and they should be able to spend their time  being kids, not writing their Congressman to defend their basic rights.                            ____________________
