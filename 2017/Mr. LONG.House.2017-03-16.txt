 Mr. Speaker, today I have the honor of introducing my  friend Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney.   Reverend Chaney is a third-generation minister. He serves as the  senior minister at the historic First and Calvary Presbyterian Church  in Springfield, Missouri, a church that is a special place to my  family. Reverend Chaney serves as an important spiritual voice for me  and the Springfield community.   Congress has a longstanding tradition of beginning each session with  a prayer. I am privileged and honored to have the opportunity today to  welcome Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney to the people's House as he opened  today's session with a prayer.                            ____________________
