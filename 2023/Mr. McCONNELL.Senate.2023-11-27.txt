 Madam President, before the Senate adjourned for  Thanksgiving, we voted to extend Federal Government funding into the  new  [[Page S5589]]  year. I am glad there was no appetite in the Capitol for saddling the  Nation with a harmful and unnecessary government shutdown.   The short-term funding legislation produced by the Speaker of the  House was an important step toward fulfilling Congress's responsibility  to pass full-year appropriations, and work continues toward restoring  the sort of regular order appropriations process that Senators on both  sides of the aisle have set as our goal.   But the Senate convenes today with some extremely important  outstanding business that we need to address this year. In a few short  weeks, we need to deliver on several urgent national security  priorities. For starters, a number of our colleagues are hard at work  on the conference report of the National Defense Authorization Act.  This is Congress's primary opportunity to shape America's national  security priorities and set the course of strategic competition with  major adversaries.    We need to empower our Armed Forces with a clear directive for the  many challenges they face. We need to prepare them to deter and fight  future wars, not drag them into political culture wars. We need to  focus our military on geopolitics, not climate politics.   But at this especially dangerous moment, we also need to deliver  supplemental resources to help both America and our partners defend  against linked threats from our biggest adversaries: Russia, Iran, and  China.   Make no mistake, the PRC is not deterred. Beijing didn't take a  Thanksgiving break from its historic military buildup, its threats to  the freedom of navigation in international waters, or its efforts to  meddle in Taiwan's domestic politics.   Russia is not deterred. Putin hasn't eased off on his brutal conquest  of Ukraine.   Iran is not deterred. The world's top state sponsor of terrorism has  continued to underwrite an alarming surge in attacks on U.S. personnel  in Iraq and Syria since the barbaric attacks of October 7.   Hamas is not deterred. Even during a temporary pause in fighting,  terrorists are clearly determined, with Iran's help, to wipe Israel off  the map ``from the river to the sea.''   America needs to stand with our friends and stand up to our  aggressors, and Senate Republicans have been working for weeks to  ensure that supplemental legislation includes robust investments in the  hard power and defense industrial capacity we need to confront them  head-on.   But on this side of the aisle, we also recognize that national  security begins here at home. Last month's total southern border  encounters marked the busiest October in decades of CBP records, and  the harsh reality of the Biden administration's border crisis continues  to impact millions of Americans in cities across the country.   So I am thankful that Senator Lankford, Senator Graham, and Senator  Cotton have been working diligently to produce legislation to address  this crisis head-on. Senate Republicans have been laser-focused on  actually fixing our broken asylum process, not just pouring more money  into a system that is simply not working, and our Democratic colleagues  would do well to take these efforts seriously.   The bottom line is simple: We don't have the luxury of addressing  glaring threats to our national security one at a time. Crises don't  solve themselves just because Washington can't muster the political  will to address them.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have already suggested they want to  condition urgent resources for one of our top security priorities on  not addressing another one. Apparently, our colleagues are considering  putting support for Israel on the chopping block unless we promise not  to fix the border crisis they helped to create.   So, Madam President, this sort of cynical, shortsighted politics has  denied the American people real border security too many times. The  challenges facing America are connected, and the time to address them-- each of them--is now.                            ____________________
