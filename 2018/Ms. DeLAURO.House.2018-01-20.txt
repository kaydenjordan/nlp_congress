 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon does not know  what the Health and Prevention Fund is all about. It is more than  children's health. It is vaccines; it is insulin; it is lead paint  protection programs. Know what it is. This is the majority who has  spent the better part of the year decimating an Affordable Care Act and  not caring a wit about what was happening to children and their  healthcare.   We do not fund community health centers, and children who are  eligible for CHIP will not be able to get the help they need because  they can't go a community healthcare center. And if you are really  concerned about the children of this Nation and their healthcare, bring  a clean CHIP bill to this floor and let's make it permanent. Don't  hide. Don't hide behind the children of this country.
