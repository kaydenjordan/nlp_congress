 Madam Speaker, 13 years; 13 years. I have been in Congress  now for a little while, and I cannot begin to tell you what an example  that the Delphi salaried retirees have set. It is the absolute gold  standard for activism and lobbying their government.   And I, you know, normally get up here and get pretty upset; but I  have got to kind of laugh because when I hear our friends on the other  side talk about irresponsibility and gimmicks and nanny states and  socialists, I think of all my friends in the Delphi salaried  retirement.   These are the most hardworking citizens that I have in my district.  And they show up for work. They coach the baseball teams. They work at  the church. They are veterans. They give back. They are great parents.  They are  [[Page H7216]]  great-grandparents. They are involved in the community.                                time  1615    Our job here is pretty simple. We look at the field, see what is  happening in the country, and if some person or group of people are  being wronged unfairly, it is our job to fix it. It is not a Democrat  thing. It is not a Republican thing. It is not a left-right thing, not  a free market thing, or a socialist thing.   It is about people. It is about American citizens who did everything  right. They showed up one day in the middle of a bankruptcy that, as  Mr. Kildee has articulated here, the government was organizing, and  reorganizing, the American auto industry. This isn't some private- sector bankruptcy. The government was in there manipulating everything,  and they screwed up.   There was no one screaming louder than I was at the Obama  administration, Sherrod Brown and I, in meetings with Tim Geithner and  all the rest over the last 13 years.    I thank Congressman Kildee from the Ways and Means  Committee, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Richie Neal,  Sherrod Brown, Rob Portman,  Mike Turner. The Members of Congress and  Senators who are on the ground with these families came together and  have been fighting.   Here we are, 13 years later, where we are going to vote this out of  the House, and we are going to send it to the Senate. We are going to  try to help people because that is our job.   What I really appreciate about this is that during the rescue  package, we were able to save hundreds and hundreds of thousands of  pensions for people, about 100,000 in Ohio, because there was a  problem, and we tried to fix it. That happened to be unions.   This group happens to not be union, but they deserve help all the  same. That is what we are doing here. I was proud that the Auto Workers  and the AFL-CIO are helping to support this.   We need more of this. I think this is an example of how to try to  influence your government, try to get help, try to right a wrong, and  not talk about Democrat and Republican and red and blue and all that  nonsense that we are all sick of.   We are ready to move forward. If you need help, if you have been  wronged, we are going to stand up and fight for you.   Again, I thank Mr. Kildee for his leadership here. We are going to  send this over to the Senate.   I know there are a lot of people, again, living and working and  talking to these families over the last 13 years. How many people have  passed away? How many families have been harmed? How many other people  have not gotten the healthcare that they needed because they couldn't  afford it, or they had situations in their family, and they didn't have  enough money, maybe, to help their kids or help their grandkids?   This is the right thing to do. This is the absolute right thing to  do. I am glad it is bipartisan, and I am glad we finally got it done  after 13 years.
