 Mr. Speaker, the House Agriculture Committee has held  21 hearings during the past 2 years on the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The committee has heard over 30  hours of testimony from over 60 experts, both liberal and conservative,  from all across the country. We have heard from academics, advocacy  groups, Federal and State government officials, charitable  organizations, and even a few people who have relied on SNAP for food  assistance.  [[Page H2903]]    All of our witnesses have confirmed what we know to be true: SNAP  works. It is a powerful program that helps to alleviate poverty and  food insecurity, and it is worthy of our support.   Today I would like to share with my colleagues a few of the most  important takeaways from the 21 hearings I participated in as ranking  member of the Nutrition Subcommittee.   First, SNAP benefits should not be cut. Forty-two million Americans,  including working families, veterans, seniors, children, and the  disabled, struggle to put food on the table. In the richest country in  the history of the world, I find that unconscionable. SNAP is a vital  tool that helps struggling Americans get back on their feet, and  participation has steadily declined as economic conditions have  improved.   Second, the current SNAP benefit is inadequate. On average, SNAP  households receive about $225 a month. The average benefit per person  is about $126 per month, which works out to be a meager $1.40 per  person per meal. You can't buy a Starbucks coffee for that.   Pamela Hess with the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and  Agriculture, said it best during her testimony before the Agriculture  Committee: `` . . . people can't parent well and raise happy, healthy  children who are ready to learn, and you can't work well if you are  hungry, if you are wondering where your next meal is coming from. . . .  `'   Cutting this meager benefit would be a rotten and heartless thing to  do, especially as so many in our country continue to face incredible  hardships.   Third, SNAP does not discourage work. The majority of people on SNAP  who can work, do work. Almost 70 percent of SNAP recipients aren't  expected to work because they are kids, they are elderly, disabled, or  caring for a young child or disabled family member. More than half of  SNAP households with at least one working-age, nondisabled adult do  work while receiving SNAP, and more than 80 percent work in the year  before or after receiving benefits.   Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents, known as  ABAWDs, are limited to 3 months on SNAP out of every 3 years if they  aren't working. I don't agree with that provision, but I have come to  learn that some of my Republican colleagues want to shorten that time  that these very vulnerable adults can remain in the program. Make no  mistake, such a move wouldn't help people find jobs; it would only make  them hungry and more vulnerable.   As Sherrie Tussler of the Milwaukee Food Bank noted in her testimony  before the Agriculture Committee: ``Somehow, we have determined that  punishing people with hunger will motivate them towards work. Hunger  doesn't motivate. It dulls and it makes people sick.''   Fourth, case management requires a well-funded, multiyear commitment.  Case management that helps connect those in need with tailored services  to move out of poverty can be successful, but those investments cost  money. We need to adequately fund these efforts.   Lastly, block grants threaten programs that provide an economic  ladder. Past Republican budgets have proposed block-granting SNAP, but  we know from decades of experience that funding for block-granted  programs erodes over time and does not provide the same responsiveness  to economic conditions that SNAP does.   SNAP expands during times of economic hardship and contracts as the  economy recovers. It successfully reaches those in need and is only  limited by the modest benefit calculation and hurdles to access like  the ABAWD time limit. There is no reason whatsoever, based on all of  our hearings, to undermine SNAP through structural changes, block  grants, further restrictions, more onerous requirements, or cuts.   At a minimum, the next farm bill must do nothing to make hunger worse  in this country--period. Instead, we should focus on strengthening our  antihunger safety net to make sure anyone who needs modest food  assistance benefits has access to them. We need to support and expand  innovative programs that help to increase the purchasing power of SNAP,  and we need to increase SNAP benefits to provide families who benefit  from the program access to more nutritious foods that last them through  the month.   Mr. Speaker, today, chefs and advocates from across the country are  on the Hill with Food Policy Action and Environmental Working Group to  discuss issues related to the farm bill, including our antihunger  safety net. I urge my colleagues to listen to these chefs--they are  food experts--and pay attention to them, especially when they ask you  to support policies that will be aimed at ending hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my friend, for  the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking the  gentleman for his kind words to his constituents about me on the floor.  It means a lot to me, and I appreciate it.   I should tell him, however, that, even though sometimes people don't  realize this, Massachusetts has a robust agricultural base, and, in  fact, in my district, I have 1,832 farms on over 142,899 acres,  compared to the gentleman who has 209 farms on 13,328 acres. So, in  addition to fighting hunger, I am on the Agriculture Committee to  represent my farms.   I do genuinely appreciate the gentleman's kind words, but then I look  at the rule that we are debating today and it kind of spoils the mood.   Having said that, I just want to say to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker,  that here we are again, just 1 day from our government running out of  funding and confronting yet another manufactured, totally avoidable  crisis, and instead of working on a bill to fully fund America's  biggest priorities, we are back on the floor with--the only way I can  characterize this--more filler legislation. It seems my Republican  friends care more about looking busy than actually doing their jobs.   This rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 1694, as my  colleague mentioned, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017.  It is a fine bill designed to strengthen transparency at Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac. I support the legislation. My Democratic colleagues  support the legislation. The Republican majority supports the  legislation. In fact, I haven't found one person yet who doesn't  support the bill.   Freedom of information is a good thing, Mr. Speaker, and I support  FOIA, but what about the freedom from the threat of a government  shutdown?   What about freedom from the threat of a default on our national debt?   What about freedom to know what our President's conflicts of interest  are and to see his tax returns?   What about the freedom from having our healthcare protections ripped  away, protections like essential health benefits and protections for  people with preexisting conditions?   And what about the freedom to know what Congressional Republicans and  the White House are doing to our healthcare system behind closed doors?   None of this seems to matter.   But the most troubling part of this rule is that it declares blanket  martial law, through Saturday, that allows Republicans to bring  anything--and I mean anything--to the floor between now and then.   Now, I understand the importance of rushing something to the floor  when the government is about to run out of money; although, I would  point out that we are 7 months into the fiscal year and my Republican  friends set this deadline themselves back in December, so there is  absolutely no excuse for Congress to come within hours of yet another  shutdown. But this is just the latest example of Republican  obstruction, obfuscation, and incompetence that has, once again,  brought us to the edge of the cliff. And, Mr. Speaker, this is no way  to govern.   This rule would allow Republican leadership to rush anything to the  floor within hours of it being released. Not just appropriations, it  gives them blanket authority to jam us with whatever new disaster they  cook up with the White House in the backroom of Capitol Hill, and that  includes this latest healthcare deal that I have heard so much about  this week.   Of course, with it being a backroom deal, we were relying on news  reports all week to clue us in to these terrible new provisions; and it  was only last night, around midnight, when the Republicans finally  posted their newest healthcare proposal that we were able to confirm  just how bad it really is.   Incredibly, this new amendment will make the bill even worse than  before. Honest to God, Mr. Speaker, I didn't know that was possible.   In addition to killing the requirement to provide basic, crucial,  essential benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs and  emergency services, this new amendment will also completely gut  protections for people with preexisting conditions. In fact, this  amendment directly violates the commitment made by President Trump and  House Republicans to protect those with preexisting conditions.   This newest proposal will allow insurers to charge an unlimited ``age  tax'' to older Americans, and, to make matters even worse, Republicans  have set up a system that would allow women to once again be charged  more than men for health coverage. It will bring us back to those bad  old days when insurance companies could charge women more because they  said being a woman was a preexisting condition.   Give me a break.   All of this, on top of a disaster of a healthcare bill that will  cause 24 million Americans to lose their healthcare coverage. And in  addition, their bill would cut Medicaid by close to $1 trillion, and  take that $1 trillion and give it, in the form of tax breaks, to the  wealthiest individuals in the country.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the way we should be running this House. All  of this is being done to appease the most conservative fringes within  the Republican Conference in an attempt to deliver, I guess, a  political ``win'' to Donald Trump so he can celebrate 100 days  in office. It doesn't matter what the details are, he just wants to be  able to tout a victory of some sort.    Well, this is not a victory for the American people. This would be a  disaster for the American people.   It is no wonder that my Republican colleagues have been overwhelmed  by angry calls from their constituents at home demanding that they  oppose this reckless and heartless bill. As one Republican remarked:  ``I spent the whole work period hearing from people pissed about  preexisting conditions. This isn't helpful.'' That is one of my  Republican colleagues.   Now, under this rule, these dangerous backroom deals could be rushed  to the floor without any proper deliberations, but they will have a  very real, very serious, and very dangerous consequence for millions of  Americans. Real lives are at stake here.   Now, I can't help but also note that this newest amendment exempts  Congress from the terrible impacts of this proposal. Can you believe  that? Knowing just how damaging these new provisions are, Republicans  wanted to keep healthcare protections for themselves but set up another  system for their constituents.   Now, it was only after the press caught Republicans with their hands  in the cookie jar that they introduced yet another bill to unexempt  themselves. But the new bill to unexempt Congress would require a 60- vote supermajority in the Senate. What are the odds that is going to  happen, Mr. Speaker?   Are we seriously supposed to trust that they won't exempt themselves  from this terrible plan, to trust that the Senate can muster 60 votes  to pass this provision or anything else?   Let me be clear: this maneuver is a procedural sleight of hand. This  is legislative smoke and mirrors designed to give Republicans, who  tried to pull a fast one and got caught, a talking point.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans wrote this bill, so change the damn bill.  Don't just say: ``Trust us. We will pass another bill to fix the fix,  and we will get the Senate not to make any changes. Oh, while we are at  it, we will get a supermajority in the Senate to support it.'' Who do  you think you are fooling, Mr. Speaker?   I urge all my colleagues to defeat this martial law rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleague, I don't have any  problem with the underlying bill, but I would argue with him that I  think most of our colleagues probably don't know what the hell we are  doing here because, in the scheme of things, this is not terribly  consequential. I think our problem is the fact that we are at the edge  of another crisis where, if we don't fund the government by tomorrow,  we shut this place down, we shut the government down, and that has an  impact on the American people.   I think what our objection is is that the rule that you bring to us  here today to consider the underlying bill also allows my Republican  friends to bring up anything they want between now and Saturday,  including, you know, an awful healthcare repeal bill.   And by the way, when we talk about regular order, it would be nice,  especially when it comes to the big things like health care, that we  actually do things like hearings and listen to what experts have to say  and our constituents and patients and doctors, I mean, a whole bunch of  people who have a stake in our healthcare system.   The bill that my friends brought to the floor, that they had to pull,  never had a single hearing and, in all likelihood, whatever monstrosity  they bring to the floor in the future will probably not be the result  of regular order. It will be the result of a backroom deal where very  few people have any input.    So I can't celebrate today. I am very concerned for my constituents.  I am very concerned for the millions of people who might lose their  health care. I am concerned for this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's first 100 days have been embroiled in  controversy and shrouded in secrecy. The American people deserve a heck  of a lot better. They deserve transparency from their government. They  deserve to know which special interests are getting face time with the  President and his top aides and whether the White House is being used  to personally enrich President Trump and his family.   It is our duty, as the people's Representatives, to hold this  administration accountable, an administration that has so many  conflicts of interest, financial conflicts of interest, that it is on a  collision course with corruption. So, if we defeat the previous  question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Katherine Clark's resolution, H. Res. 286, which would  force the White House to release information to us regarding the  President's many potential conflicts of interest, including his tax  returns, involvement in his business empire, and White House and Mar-a- Lago visitor logs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Katherine Clark) to discuss our  proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say to the gentleman from Georgia: he had me at hello, too. If  all he said was ``hello'' and introduced the underlying bill, we would  be done. There would be no controversy. The underlying bill is being  brought to the floor under a rule that is atrocious and that, quite  frankly, every Member of this House should be ashamed about. Under this  martial law rule, you can bring anything up at any time you want, at a  moment's notice, without people having an opportunity to actually  understand what they are going to vote on.   The gentleman talked about they might bring up the healthcare bill  between now and Saturday. He said: Yesterday, we posted the text of our  new amendment. He used the word ``yesterday'' loosely. They posted it  at midnight last night. I was asleep at midnight; I don't know about  the gentleman.   The bottom line is, there is nothing that says that they can't change  the text again and again and again and again, offer more amendments,  because that is what they have been doing since they first began their  effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.   On something as important as health care, on something that could  affect millions and millions of people in this country, that could  throw 24 million people off of health care, that will cut Medicaid by a  trillion dollars, that will compromise Medicare, that will take away  essential benefits, people ought to know what the heck they are voting  on.   We ought to have regular order on these major pieces of legislation.  Why is that so controversial? How about a hearing on health care? The  idea that we would like the opportunity to know what we are voting on,  to do this in a thoughtful way, is so offensive to my Republican  colleagues. I am flabbergasted by this--to basically defend this  process.   We have to use a procedural motion to be able to try to force a  debate or bring to the floor the bill of my colleague, Katherine Clark,  which basically calls on the President to release his tax returns and  calls for some transparency with regard to visitor logs at the White  House and Mar-a-Lago. We have to resort to a procedural motion because  the Republican majority basically blocks us from bringing anything to  the floor under a normal process.   The Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die.  Yet the bill that we have before us, the underlying bill that we are  going to consider later today, could probably pass on a suspension.   By the way, we have no problem with giving you same-day authority on  suspension bills. Those aren't controversial. We don't even have a  problem, although you should have prepared for this, with you being  able to bring a bill to the floor quickly to keep the government  running.   It is the broad authority that you have given yourselves to bring  anything at a moment's notice, without anybody having a chance to  review it. That is what we have a problem with. Quite frankly, my  Republican colleagues ought to have a problem with that, too.   Mr. Speaker, shortly after taking the gavel, Speaker Ryan said: ``I  want to  [[Page H2916]]  have a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative,  more participatory, and that is what we are trying to do.'' That was  the Speaker of the House.   Unfortunately, Republicans do not appear to be trying very hard. The  current Congress is on track to become the most closed in history, with  an incredible 26 closed rules in this year's first quarter out of 42  total rules. The Republican majority shut out all amendments from both  Democrats and Republicans on fully 62 percent of the legislation  considered by the House under a rule.   Do Members realize that? On most bills, even they are not allowed to  offer amendments. No amendments at all. Under a closed rule, you can't  even offer an amendment to fix a typo.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to take a look at this  chart. This shows closed rules in the past decade and for the first  quarter of the year.   Do you see this really long red line on the top? I am happy to bring  it over to my colleagues here. If you see that line, you will see that  the bottom line is that this shows that this Congress has an abysmal  record with regard to an open, fair process.   When we were in charge from 2007-2010, we averaged only 8 closed  rules in the same timeframe. This Congress is more than three times as  closed. We have 26 closed rules in the first quarter alone; that is not  to mention zero open rules. You are even crushing your record for 2015,  the year that you beat the all-time closed rule record. This is not  something to be proud of.   What has this historically closed process brought to the House?  Complete chaos. Virtually no legislative accomplishments. A lousy  process usually leads to lousy legislation. We learned that from your  awful, disastrous attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Act.   By the way, I should point out that while we were meeting here  today--I guess some of the advocacy organizations had a chance to read  the language you posted last night at midnight--so far, the American  Hospital Association, AARP, the American Medical Association, March of  Dimes, and America's Essential Hospitals have all come out against this  terrible, new Republican health proposal. In fact, the American  Hospital Association said: ``The amendment proposed this week would  dramatically worsen the bill.''   I would just say to my colleagues: We don't have a problem with  suspensions. We don't have a problem with a rule that will allow us to  keep the government running. We have a problem with your closed,  authoritarian approach to the legislation. We have a problem with the  prospect that you might bring a healthcare bill to the floor that will  impact millions and millions of Americans, and nobody will have read  it, nobody will even have any guarantee that what you posted last night  at midnight will even be what we are voting on.   This is a big deal. It affects my constituents and it affects your  constituents. We ought to be doing a better job around here, and this  process, quite frankly, stinks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Simply, again, I reiterate that everybody in this House, Democrats  and Republicans alike, should be ashamed at the way this House is being  run. The American people who are watching should be appalled by the way  this House is being run.   I don't care whether you are a liberal or conservative or fall  somewhere in the middle. You ought to have some confidence that what  the people's House is doing is actually thoughtful and is actually in  the best interest of the people of this country. That is not what is  happening here.   Yes, the underlying bill that we are going to talk about later today,  we have no problem with it. It could have passed overwhelmingly under a  suspension vote. I am happy to support it. No problem.   I have no problem, by the way, with bringing up suspensions to fill  up time as we try to get a resolution to the continuing resolution. We  have no problem, quite frankly, with bringing up a continuing  resolution in a quick fashion.   This rule continues a lousy process that has been embraced by the  current Republican leadership in this House. There is no excuse for  this. When it comes to big bills, big legislation, like health care,  which is a very personal thing to people in this country, the American  people deserve much better than this.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on  this lousy rule and stand up to your leadership and demand that they  open this House up not only to Democratic amendments but to Republican  amendments as well. This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to  deliberate.   On big issues like health care, it ought not be some backroom deal  that a few people put together. We saw the result of those backroom  deals with a lousy, terrible, awful bill that would hurt millions of  Americans. We ought to do it out in the open.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
