 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to  improve early voting in rural communities.   My amendment would ensure that early voting locations in rural  communities are placed strategically in communities to provide the  greatest access to rural voters seeking to cast their ballots.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.   My amendment, Mr. Chairman, gets to the heart of what we have been  trying to do here today with H.R. 1, and that is to make voting easier.   My amendment builds on the underlying text of H.R. 1 that directs  States to locate early voting locations within walking distance of  stops on public transportation routes by recognizing that rural  communities face very different challenges to voting as compared to  voters in urban communities.   In many rural communities, Mr. Chairman, like the ones that I  represent in eastern North Carolina, there is no public transportation  in many of those communities, so polling locations in these communities  need to be located where these voters will have the best chance to let  their voices be heard in our elections, and my amendment would simply  ensure that that happens.   Mr. Chairman, rural communities are facing many challenges, but their  ability to participate in our elections should not be one of those  challenges. I think all of us on both sides of the aisle can agree on  this.   During the markup at the committee, I got a good feeling about it,  and I hoped my friend from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) would be willing  to work with me in getting this amendment passed.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2481]]                                     time  1715     Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Illinois would  remember that at the subcommittee markup, or the full committee markup,  we did have a very healthy conversation about this topic. I acknowledge  that no amendment was offered at the committee, but I felt a consensus,  Mr. Davis, when we discussed it at the committee, and I thought that it  would be accepted by the other side.   But suffice it to say that rural communities deserve to have polling  locations that are convenient to all of its citizens. We are talking  about Federal elections, not local elections, so I would ask my  colleagues to reconsider and support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman for his  comments and thank him for his friendship. The gentleman is right; we  do serve on the House Administration Committee together. He is the  ranking member of the committee and Ms. Lofgren is the chair. We will  have many opportunities to work together, and I look forward to working  with the gentleman and all of the committee on very important issues as  we go forward.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
