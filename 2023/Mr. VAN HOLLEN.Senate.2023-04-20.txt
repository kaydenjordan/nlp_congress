 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 85 as provided  under the previous order, and I ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, our firefighters put their lives on  the line every single day, charging into danger whenever duty calls.  That is why we have a duty to back them up--not just in words but also  in deeds by providing them with the resources and facilities they need  and deserve.   The underlying bill today extends critical programs to provide  training, equipment, and personnel, and I commend the chairman of the  committee and the full committee for their action on this. But there is  also an urgent need to repair crumbling, insufficiently safe  firehouses. Nearly half of the fire stations across the country require  major repairs. Forty-six percent of them do not have systems that  prevent our first responders from being exposed to mold or cancerous  carcinogens.   Some have proposed that we address this by taking funds from the  assistance to firefighters grants for station construction, but that  program is already overprescribed. In fact, in 2020 alone, over $2  billion in requests competed for just $319 million. That is why the  firefighters oppose the amendment to poach moneys from the underlying  fund.   This measure--this amendment does not poach those moneys. It adds an  authorization so that we can have additional funds, when appropriate  and if appropriated by the Congress, to provide for fire stations that  are crumbling.   This is based on a bill, a bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator  Murkowski, and I appreciate her support for this amendment. In the  House, this is also a bipartisan bill led by Congressman Bill Pascrell.  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
