 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5905, the  Department of Energy Science and Innovation Act, sponsored by my friend  and colleague Representative Weber. His bill contains the text of my  bill, the Low-Dose Radiation Research Act, which unanimously passed the  House this past February.   The language directs the Department of Energy to utilize $20 million  to carry out a research program on low-dose radiation within the Office  of Science. This program will increase our understanding of the health  effects that low doses of radiation have on biological systems.   Research has consistently shown us the adverse health effects  associated with high doses of radiation, but we are a long way from  accurately assessing the effects of low doses of radiation. As the  product of industrial activities, medical procedures, and naturally  occurring systems, humans are exposed to low doses of radiation every  day, and it is imperative we can accurately assess this risk.   There is broad consensus among the radiobiology community that more  research is necessary for Federal agencies, physicians, and related  experts to advance the use of radiation technologies. We have  invaluable diagnostic tools today, such as CT scans, which emit low  doses of radiation. It is vital that physicians are able to inform  patients of the health risks associated with these types of imaging  processes. As a physician in my home State of Kansas, I have a  firsthand understanding of the crucial importance of verified research  and ensuring the best medical outcomes for my patients.   I am proud to support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same.
