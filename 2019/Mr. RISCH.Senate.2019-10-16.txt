Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.   Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements of Section  36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended, we are  forwarding Transmittal No. 19-0J. This report relates to enhancements  or upgrades from the level of sensitivity of technology or capability  described in the Section 36(b)(l) AECA certification 18-43 of November  27, 2018.            Sincerely,                                                Gregory M. Kausner,        (for Charles W. Hooper, Lieutenant General, USA, Director).        Enclosures.                            Transmittal No. 19-0J       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Prospective Purchaser: Qatar.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 18-43; Date: 27       November 2018; Military Department: Air Force.        (iii) Description: On November 27, 2018, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       18-43 of the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(l) of the       Arms Export Control Act, of forty (40) AIM-120C-7 Advanced       Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and one (1) spare       AIM-  [[Page S5834]]       120C-7 AMRAAM Guidance Section. Also included were one (1)       spare AIM-120C-7 control section, eight (8) AMRAAM Captive       Air Training Missile (CATM-120C), missile containers,       classified software for the AN/MPQ-64Fl Sentinel Radar, spare       and repair parts, cryptographic and communication security       devices, precision navigation equipment, other software, site       surveys, weapons system equipment and computer software       support, publications and technical documentation, common       munitions and test equipment, repair and return services and       equipment, personnel training and training equipment,       integration support and test equipment, and U.S. Government       and contractor, engineering, technical and logistics support       services, and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The estimated total cost was $215 million.       Major Defense Equipment* (MDE) constituted $95 million of       this total. This proposed sale was in support of Qatar's       procurement of the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile       System (NASAMS) via Direct Commercial Sale (DCS).        This transmittal reports the inclusion of up to eighty       additional (80) AIM-120C-7 missiles, one hundred twenty (120)       AIM-120C-7 ER missiles, thirteen (13) Multifunction       Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-      LVT) Block Upgrade 2, and associated materiel, support, and       services. These additional MDE items will result in an       increase in MDE cost of $461 million, for a total MDE value       of $556 million. Non-MDE cost will increase by $16 million.       Total case value will increase to $692 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       these additional missiles represent an increase in capability       over what was previously notified. This equipment meets       Qatar's requirements for a NASAMS capability providing a full       range of protection from imminent hostile cruise missile,       unmanned aerial vehicle, rotary wing, and fixed wing threats.       The MIDS-LVT BU2 will contribute to the crypto capability of       the NASAMS to enable Qatar's self-defense capabilities, and       enhance its interoperability with the United States and       regional partners.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale supports the foreign       policy and national security objectives of the United States       by helping improve the security of a key partner that has       been, and continues to be, a significant host and member of       coalition forces in the Middle East.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology Statement contained in the original notification       applies to the AIM-120C-7 missiles. The AIM-120C-7 ER       missiles have the same capability and sensitivity of       technology as the AIM-120C-7 but with a larger rocket motor       to allow it to travel further. The MIDS LVT BU2 is classified       CONFIDENTIAL and is a secure data and voice communication       network using the Link-16 architecture. The system provides       enhanced situational awareness, positive identification of       participants within the network, and secure voice capability.       The system provides the critical ground link for simultaneous       coordination of air, land, and maritime forces.        (vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: October 1, 2019.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The       estimated cost is $140 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a major ally that is a force for political       stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.       It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Japan in       developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-      defense capability.        The proposed follow-on technical support is critical to       ensure Japan Maritime Self Defense Force's (JMSDF) Aegis       Destroyer fleet and JCPTS remain ready to provide critical       capabilities in the defense of Japan. Japan's AEGIS       Destroyers provide ship-based ballistic missile defense       capabilities and build upon a longstanding cooperative effort       with the United States to provide enhanced capability with a       valued partner in a geographic region of critical importance       to Japan and the United States. Japan will have no difficulty       absorbing this support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Moorestown,       NJ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of two contractor representatives to Japan to       support the program.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

It is not expected additional U.S. Government personnel will       be required in country for an extended period of time.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-70       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:         1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. The system       weighs 49.5 pounds and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500       meters. The system is highly lethal against tanks and other       systems with conventional and reactive armors. The system       possesses a secondary capability against bunkers.         2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.         3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor operating       in the 8-10 micron wavelength and has a 240 x 240 pixel       scanning array with a Dewar-coolant unit.         4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       contains an infrared seeker with a 64 x 64 pixel element       Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (HgCdTE) Focal Plane Array (FPA)       operating in the 8-10 micron wavelength. The missile has an       advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the top       attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.         5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the       documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. The missile software which       resides in the CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensitivity       is primarily in the software programs which instruct the       system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The       overall hardware is also considered SENSITIVE in that the       infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted       countermeasure development.         6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.         7. A determination has been made that Ukraine can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary to further the U.S. foreign policy       and national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.         8. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Ukraine.                            ____________________
