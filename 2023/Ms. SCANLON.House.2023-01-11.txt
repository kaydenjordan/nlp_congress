 Mr. Speaker, the American people expect Congress to  address the issues they care about, kitchen table issues like being  able to afford prescription drugs or get a good-paying job and  addressing the gun violence that is plaguing our neighborhoods.   But instead of getting to work for the American people, House  Republicans, held hostage by MAGA extremists, spent their first week  engaging in power struggles and brawls and political stunts. Instead of  lowering costs for American families, they voted to help wealthy tax  cheats and greedy corporations avoid paying their fair share of taxes,  a move that would raise the Federal deficit by over $100 billion.   Instead of creating better-paying jobs, they launched a new committee  to chase down conspiracy theories and settle scores for the disgraced,  twice-impeached former President.   Instead of working to make our communities safer, they doubled down  on their crusade to criminalize women's healthcare and end reproductive  rights across this country. The party that once claimed to stand for  family values has no interest in solving the most pressing issues  facing American families.   I am disappointed but never discouraged.   No matter what political stunts House Republicans pull, my colleagues  and I will remain focused on delivering for the people we represent. We  will keep working to create better-paying jobs and opportunities for  our children, to lower costs for families, and to make our communities  safer.                    Political Violence is Never the Answer     Mr. Speaker, as political violence rises in our country  and abroad, our Nation's leaders should be united in condemning  political violence in all forms, as well as the vile rhetoric that  fuels it.   From Charlottesville to Pittsburgh to El Paso, we have seen the  tragic results when lies spill blood and words echo as gunshots. These  attacks ripple through communities stealing innocent lives,  traumatizing survivors, and inflicting pain on those left behind.   The underlying drivers of domestic violent extremism, antigovernment  sentiment, racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism are constant as threats  and attacks move from one community to the next.   We all have a moral responsibility to combat this scourge of hateful  rhetoric, to ensure that every American can live free from bigoted  speech and hate-fueled violence.   But the resolution presented by Republicans today continues that  pattern of stoking grievances and chaos in our communities rather than  helping our communities work together to ensure domestic tranquility.   Their resolution is far from a clean condemnation of political  violence. By condemning only vandalism and violence against anti- abortion facilities, it gives tacit approval to the far more frequent  attacks against abortion clinics and other medical centers disfavored  by the radical right.   Political violence is never the answer.  [[Page H156]]    I look forward to working with our colleagues across the aisle when  they are ready to take seriously the very real threat of political  violence, condemning such violence in all forms, rather than using this  issue to stir up more division, chaos, and ultimately more violence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose this grotesque  attempt to politicize abortion care and criminalize doctors.   Politicians should not be in the business of mandating that women  carry dangerous or unwanted pregnancies to term. They should stay out  of the doctor's office when Americans are exercising their fundamental  right to decide when or if to have children.   But rightwing extremists have made it their first order of business  in this new Congress to attack abortion rights and spread  disinformation.   This bill is deliberately misleading. It is harmful to both people  facing pregnancy complications and to the doctors who provide their  care. If passed, it would cause more maternal deaths in this country,  which are already a national shame.   Congress has a responsibility to legislate honestly, and this bill is  not honest. The American people deserve better than having Congress  waste time on political stunts, pretending to fix problems that do not  exist.   Americans don't want MAGA extremists to criminalize women's  healthcare, and they don't want politicians in their doctor's offices.
