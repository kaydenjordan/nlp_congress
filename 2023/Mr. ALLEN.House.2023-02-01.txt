 Mr. Speaker, America has always been a Nation of  trailblazers. From the automobile to the iPhone, the entrepreneurial  spirit of the American people is the engine of progress that moves our  world forward toward a better tomorrow.   As we chart a course toward rebuilding the world's greatest economy,  we must ensure that this engine has the fuel it needs to get us where  we want to go.   That is why earlier today I introduced the Startup Act, alongside my  colleague from California (Mr. DeSaulnier). This bipartisan bill equips  entrepreneurs and future entrepreneurs with the training and resources  they need to start a business, create jobs, and grow our economy.   Having built several small businesses from the ground up, I know just  how difficult that process is. I wonder how many Americans never make  that leap simply because they don't know where to start.   The Startup Act is about removing barriers to entrepreneurship and  expanding access to programs and tools that will help countless people  turn their version of the American Dream into a reality.                            ____________________
