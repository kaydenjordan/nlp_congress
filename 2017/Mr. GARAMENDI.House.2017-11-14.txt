 Mr. Speaker, a moment ago, you heard from my colleague  from California (Ms. Judy Chu) about the tax bill. She put the first  page of H.R. 1 up and she added this little percentage, H.R. 1 percent.  I thought that was not only accurate, but it really does reflect what I  was going to show a moment ago, and then I decided to use hers.   H.R. 1 is really about the 1 percent. The top 1 percent wealthy  Americans would get 50 percent of a $1.5 trillion gift from the  American people, which really amounts to an enormous transfer of wealth  from the working men and women of America who depend upon programs like  education--and that was discussed by my colleagues a few moments ago-- and depend upon medical services from Medicare, Medicaid. In  California, we call it Medi-Cal.   But what is going to happen here with this $1.5 trillion tax cut--and  when you add the interest to it, basically, a $2.3 trillion bogus deal  that our Republican colleagues are putting forth--is what I call the  Texas two-step. This really is Mr. Brady from Texas' program to really  do a two-step, together with the Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan.    The two-step was laid out in the budget bill, and the two-step is  this:   First, make a monumental tax cut that really is for the superwealthy.  And then as soon as you get that signed by President Trump, you do the  second step, which is to do massive cuts so that you can deal with the  deficit.   So I am going to just bring up the issue of the deficit for just a  moment with this. I don't expect you to really look at all of these  numbers, but this is the structural deficit that exists today: $563  billion structural deficit. Every year--this year and in the past  years--we are running a serious deficit: $1.5 trillion. Ten years from  now, it is going to be over a $1 trillion-a-year structural deficit.   So what does H.R. 1, the 1 percent bill, do to you?   What it does is it adds to the structural deficit this year $115  billion; and, in 2027, it will add $155 billion.   You can look at it this way--and perhaps this is a little easier to  understand. It is about the deficit, and this is why the two-step is  going to happen.   By the way, all of the deficit hawks that once occupied that entire  array on the right side of the congressional House of Representatives  disappeared. They migrated. They migrated south or somewhere. But I  will tell you this: as soon as this H.R. 1 percent passes, the deficit  hawks will return with a mighty force to make cuts.   So here is what happens to the deficit: it starts down there--this is  the annual, not the total deficit--and rises to this in 2027. This  little orange across the top is what will be added. We don't deal with  the deficit directly.   So here is the deal, folks: cut taxes now so that the superwealthy,  five of which are in President Trump's administration--oh, yes,  eliminate the estate tax. Great idea.   Do you know what that means to the Trump family?   If his wealth is $10 billion, as he says, what it means is that  somewhere around a $4 billion tax avoidance. Eliminating the estate tax  and the Trump family immediately saves $4 billion. But maybe his net  worth is really only $4 billion. So maybe it is just a $1 billion tax  savings. That is just on the estate tax alone.   This is a bad deal for Americans. It will increase the deficit and it  will create what we call the Texas two-step. Or maybe we should call it  the Speaker Ryan two-step.   Mr. Speaker, let me introduce a couple of my colleagues who have  joined us today from the State of New York.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi) to  comment on this piece of legislation and what it means to his  constituents.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Suozzi for his remarks. I  appreciate him bringing to my attention the SALT--the State and local  tax.   What basically happens is the Republicans are putting salt on the  wound and causing an enormous amount of pain for Americans--certainly  in California, another high-cost State; Illinois; New Jersey; and  Massachusetts. This is a problem for about 50 percent of the population  of this Nation that is going to see enormous things.   In my own State, there are 120,000--not 250,000, as in the  gentleman's State, but 120,000--who are looking at somewhere over a  $12,000 loss deduction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, there is one additional factor--I know  this is the case in California and also in New York--and that is both  New York and California are net contributors to other States. In our  State of California, even with this deduction, far more tax revenue  flows to the Federal Government than Federal Government revenue comes  back to the State of California. It is probably in the 15 to 20 percent  net loss range to the State of California, and I think in New York it  is similar.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Suozzi and I could probably spend a  couple of hours going back and forth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal), who comes from the far side of the continent from New York,  Washington State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much,  Representative Jayapal, for her comments. She brought to our attention  the inconsistencies that are in this piece of legislation.   Everywhere I go and people talk about this, they say: I don't  understand why they want to do that. I don't understand why, with a  growing economy and the economy actually moving along pretty well, 4  percent-plus unemployment and growth somewhere in the 3 percent range,  why they want to totally turn the American economy upside down in a way  that does not create growth.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  bouncing back across the continent and picking up, once again, in New  York. I thank the gentleman for joining me, and I look forward to his  words and the wisdom that he brings from Manhattan.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing us the  view from New York. He is quite correct about what happened during the  great crisis in 2008, 2009. The American public, probably to the tune  of about $1 trillion, bailed out Wall Street. And here we go again.  Major support for the American corporations who are hiding trillions of  dollars overseas.   Let me just give you one other example. There is a lot of talk around  here from our Republican friends that somehow, if we reduce the  corporate tax rate, we will see jobs being generated and some $4,000 a  year of new money in the pockets of American workers.   Really? You think so?   Let me give you an example of one of America's great corporations,  AT&T. I think we all know AT&T. We probably have them on our  smartphone. In the last decade, AT&T was capable, using various tax  loopholes and deductions, to lower its effective corporate tax rate,  not to 20 percent, but to 8 percent.   So over that period of time, while they were reducing their effective  tax rates, that is their real tax rate, from whatever it was to 8  percent during that decade, did they create new jobs? No.   What they did was to lay off 80,000 workers. And at the same time,  guess what? The CEO, he raked in $124 million.   So what is going on here?   The American corporations, back in the seventies and sixties,  actually invested more than 50 percent, almost 60 percent, of their  after-tax profits in expanding their business--investment in plants and  equipment and wages and hiring people.   Today, less than 10 percent is spent on expanding their businesses.  Instead, they are pumping up their stock prices with buybacks and with  dividends.   So what is going down?   Tell me that this is going to somehow create jobs.   And, by the way, the gentleman didn't quite pick this one up, so let  me add to the weight of this terrible bill. They use what is called  territorial tax system. Terrific. Corporations will not be taxed for  their profits globally, but, rather, they will only be taxed for their  profits within the United States, so it is even a further incentive to  offshore your jobs to the lowest tax place in the world: Bahamas. Used  to be Ireland, but the EU decided that Ireland was cheating the rest of  the European countries; put a stop to that, so now they are off.   Apple, a great California company, abandoned Ireland and is now, I  think, located in the Jersey Islands off the coast of Great Britain.   Scheme, scam, the American public is going to be the beneficiary? No.  It is going to be the victim, is going to be the victim of this great  transfer of wealth.   The gentleman had one more point to make, and then I would like to go  to my colleague, also from New York and what we still call the East- West Show.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Hastings).    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, as an esteemed member  of the Rules Committee, there is an emergency meeting to push this bill  to the floor without any public hearings. Is that correct?    Mr. Speaker, my recollection in the 1986 Reagan tax  reform, it took 2 years of public hearings all around the country and  some 30 hearings in the House Ways and Means Committee, probably a  similar number on the Senate side before the bill came to the floor.  There were many, many amendments that were offered.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work that the gentleman  does there trying to protect the American public from this hasty--Mr.  Hastings, thank you so very much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, very, very much.  There has been much discussion. We are going to be yielding this floor  to our Republican colleagues, and I see them beginning to assemble, all  of them who, just 3 weeks ago, were deficit hawks.   I am going to point this out, and I am going to leave it here for my  colleagues who will be talking about why we ought to increase the  deficit.   The current structural deficit is about $500 billion. We are going to  add, just this year, $115 billion on top of that. You can see that. But  over the next decade, that present structural deficit will grow to  nearly $1 trillion a year, and we will add to it another couple hundred  billion dollars.   The deficit hawks have a choice. They can live with the deficit,  forget they ever were deficit hawks and just increase the deficit with  this 1 percent tax bill, H.R. 1, or they could do what I call the Texas  two-step.   Keep in mind, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is a  Texan. The Texas two-step is first you seriously cut the revenues with  this tax bill that is not a reform but, rather, a bill that actually 50  percent of the $1.5 trillion reduction goes to the American  corporations and the top 1 percent. Forget about the deficit or do the  Texas two-step: cut the revenues and then cut the programs.   What are the programs?   You mentioned Medicare. Already in the budget that passed this House  with Mr. Ryan as Speaker was a $500 billion reduction to Medicare and a  $700 billion or $800 billion reduction to Medicaid, 60 percent of which  goes to the elderly in nursing homes. That is what they have in mind.                                time  1830    Secondly, they are going to talk about a trillion-dollar  infrastructure. No way. The money is gone. There will be no  infrastructure program, no roads, no trains, no buses, no levees, no  repair.    Exactly, and you might add education to that. So what  do you do? Student loans of which $1.4 trillion and nearly a trillion  of that is owned by the Federal Government, these students are paying  interest to the Federal Government; and to add to that, we are going to  deny them the ability to deduct the loan interest that they are paying.   This is really just hypocritical, and it is very harmful to the  economy. We want to do job training. Forget it. The money is gone. The  Texas Two Step will deny us the money that we need for education,  reduce the revenues, and then cut the programs to attempt to bring back  under control the deficit. It did not work. It will not work. And what  it means is, the American economy that is recovering is going to be  given a wallop on the side of its head, and we are going to see some  real serious problems as we attempt to build the foundation for future  economic growth. The money will not be there.   Mr. Speaker, I suspect that that emergency meeting of the Rules  Committee is to specifically deal with the problem that was announced  by the Congressional Budget Office just 3 hours ago that said this tax  bill will, because of the sequestration law--it is a law--will create  an automatic $25 billion reduction in Medicare immediately and another  $111 billion reduction in programs, not to be determined by the  Representatives of the people of the United States but, rather, by Mick  Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, who is known  to be really weird in his budgeting proposal.   He will make a $111 billion reduction all on his own, if this tax  bill passes as it is written today.   This is serious business, Americans. This is about your future. This  is about your ability to have a decent job in America, a decent  infrastructure, a decent education system, and medical services.   What about the children's health program which is not yet in place?  It is unbelievable that, without one public hearing, the Republicans  are determined to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut of which 50 percent of  the benefit goes to the top 1 percent, and America's corporations are  given yet another reason to offshore their jobs with what is called  territorial pricing.   This is where we are, folks. Wrap it up, if you will.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly right. Finally,  as we turn this floor over to our Republican colleagues, I am really  interested in hearing why--and I see one of our colleagues from my  area--why in the Central Valley of California where anywhere from  110,000 to 150,000 families who pay taxes are going to lose their State  and local tax deduction? They will lose somewhere between $7,000 and  $12,000 of deductions.   That amounts to an increase in taxes anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000.  I want to hear them explain why that is good tax policy. We will see  what they have to say. They will be on the floor in a few moments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
