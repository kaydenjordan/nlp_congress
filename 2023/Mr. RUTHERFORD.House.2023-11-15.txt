 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bonnie Faye  Haddock Jackson on the occasion of her upcoming 100th birthday.   Bonnie was born in Kings Ferry, Florida, to Louis and Mattie  Henderson Haddock on November 26, 1923. Bonnie spent her life investing  in our community.   Bonnie attended Eagle Academy in King's Ferry and Hilliard High  School in Hilliard, Florida. She then met the love of her life, Fred  Jackson, a U.S. Army officer, who served our Nation during World War  II.   Together, Bonnie and Fred raised a family and built a legacy in  northeast Florida that is carried on by their 11 grandchildren, 19  great-grandchildren, and 14 great-great-grandchildren.   A steadfast steward of her faith, Bonnie has been a lifelong member-- that is 100 years of membership--at Ephesus Baptist Church in Hilliard.   Her family values and dedication to those around her have earned her  a reputation as a meticulous housekeeper, an amazing cook, a talented  gardener, and a faithful and devoted matriarch to her growing family.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity to wish Bonnie a  very  [[Page H5881]]  happy 100th birthday from the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Bonnie and her family for all they do to enrich  our northeast Florida community. Her impressive legacy sets an example  for all of us to follow.   Mr. Speaker, God bless Bonnie in her 100th year of life.                            ____________________
