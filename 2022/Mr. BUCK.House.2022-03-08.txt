 Madam Speaker, I am here to have a discussion with the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend, about President Putin's  actions in Russia.   Putin is waging an unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine. Over  the past 2 weeks, his attacks have become increasingly violent. The  attacks have become more severe, even targeting residential areas.   At the same time that Putin is engaged in a bloody war with tragic  consequences for the people of Ukraine, he is also engaged in a  propaganda war. His disinformation campaign is geared toward: first,  his own people, who have largely been kept in the dark about the  atrocities of this war against Ukraine; and, second, the entire world.   In justifying his war to the world, Putin has relied on the  ridiculous claim that he is the appointed person to denazify Ukraine.   The Russian Government released a statement on March 1 through the  Russian Embassy in Canada, stating: ``Russia continues its special  military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine. The Russian  army does not occupy Ukrainian territory and takes all measures to  preserve the lives and safety of civilians. The strikes are targeting  military facilities only. . . . The tasks to clear Ukraine of Nazism .  . . will be accomplished.''   Congressman Roy, there is a lot of evidence that Putin's army is  targeting civilian targets.    Madam Speaker, I think it is worthwhile to take a look at  who this leader is.   Who is Vladimir Putin? He began his career, not surprisingly,  Congressman, at the KGB. He came to power in 2000, winning the  presidency after having served as a Secretary of the Security Council  of Russia and as the Director of the Federal Security Service.   Putin served as President until 2008, when he was constitutionally  prohibited from seeking a third term, but Putin had little regard for  the Russian Constitution. He orchestrated a maneuver in which one of  his yes-men would be installed as the new President, and Putin would  assume the role of Prime Minister.   After serving as Russia's top leader, but in the capacity of Prime  Minister, Putin then did the unthinkable and ran again as President in  2012. With protests and allegations of mass fraud in his background, he  assumed another 6-year term and then again ran in 2018.   Even more alarming, in April of last year, Putin signed into law a  series of constitutional amendments that would permit him to run for  President two additional terms, serving a total of 36 years.   Putin's regime has become increasingly totalitarian, and Putin  himself has put his KGB background to use, employing Soviet-era  repressions against the people of Russia.                                time  2130    He has cracked down on free speech, seized control of the media, and  had his opponents and critics assassinated.   Congressman, I know you feel strongly about how President Putin has  put his KGB background to use.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    And, Congressman Roy, I just want to go through one of  these slides again, if I can. I don't know if you got a look at this,  but this is the before and after. This is a man who left, went to  England, was poisoned, and this is what he looked like before, and that  is after he was poisoned with radioactive materials.    Radioactive material. He was poisoned, and that is how he  looks afterwards. Unbelievable that one human being can do this to  another human being, much less a leader of a major nuclear power in the  world.    Right. No disagreement in the world. And what is so  significant is when Vladimir Putin says this is what is happening in  Ukraine, who can believe him?    In fact, you can pretty much go to Vegas and bet your money  on the opposite of what this man says. If he is able to do something  like this, one, he is a coward, and two, he is a monster.   During his more than two decades of ruling Russia, Putin has  displayed a callous disregard for human life. As part of Putin's war on  Chechnya, he ordered the destruction of Chechnya's capital Grozny. Tens  of thousands of civilians were killed in this brutal assault.   In 2008, Putin waged another war, this time in Georgia, another part  of  [[Page H1369]]  the former Soviet Union. The Georgian President during Putin's assault  in 2008 had this to say in The Wall Street Journal, and, Congressman  Roy, I want you to really hear this because it is so unbelievable how  similar what the Georgian President said in 2008 is to the game plan  that Putin has orchestrated in Ukraine.    ``Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia  openly backed separatist militants--that sounds familiar--launched  cyberattacks and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs  of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces  entering Georgian territory didn't even cause enough concern to order  Georgian military officials back from their holidays. . . .   ``But in August 2008, under the auspices of securing the separatist  enclave, Russia invaded my country . . .   ``Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a  nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took  place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin's  claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to  an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful  preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian- Georgian border.''    And I think what is really important to point out here is that  President Putin has used the exact same plan, the exact same formula  down to the T, claiming that there are Russian-speaking people and he  is trying to protect those people in Ukraine, down to the absurd claim  that Ukraine is a Nazi government now. All these claims are made up,  they are nonsense to try to justify in the minds of the Russian people  what Putin is engaged in.    An immoral person does not wage a moral war, does not  poison people, does not continue to commit the war crimes and the  illegalities--murdering a political opponent just blocks away from the  Kremlin. That kind of immoral person doesn't have the standing to talk  to the world about what is going on in Ukraine.   I know, Congressman, you were a prosecutor. I was a prosecutor. When  we had a criminal defendant who lied, that was a special treat, because  we got to put witnesses on the stand, and we called it a false  exculpatory. And Vladimir Putin has gone through his entire political  career using false exculpatories; telling people one thing happened  when, in fact, something else happened.   And the reason it is so important to point out false exculpatories  is, it is a sign of guilt. And in this case, Vladimir Putin knows what  he is doing is in violation of international law. He has committed  numerous war crimes through his military; indiscriminately bombing  civilian targets. And he is a war criminal, and he should be brought to  justice.   But my question to you now is, Congressman, are we doing everything  we can as a country to make sure that we bring this thug--as you put  it--this animal who is violating international law, killing children,  destroying billions of dollars worth of infrastructure in Ukraine. Are  we, as Americans, are we, as the civilized world working with Western  Europe, working with NATO, are we doing everything we can to bring this  man to justice and to stop the tragedy that is going on in Ukraine?    Yes.    And one more thing, when the press holds us to account, we  stand up. We may disagree with them. We may offer another version of  the facts, but we don't shut down the press. We don't close their  doors. We don't turn off the TV station when they call something a war.  When they call a war a war, we don't shut them down. That is exactly  what is happening in Russia right now.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, to go back a little bit in history, when  President Putin invaded Crimea, President Obama refused to give legal  assistance to Ukraine. It wasn't until President Trump came in that  legal assistance was given to Ukraine.   And then to President Biden's credit, he ramped up that lethal aid as  the threat got greater. And we have seen a great deal of lethal aid  going to the Ukraine military. They are using it wisely. They are  fighting a courageous war against a much, much greater military power.   But I agree with you, Congressman. We could be doing more. We could  be sanctioning more, the source of Russia's money, their income, their  revenue for waging this war. And we should be doing that. And that is  just one of the areas, just one of them.    We should be doing more in banking. We should be doing more in trade,  in blockades. But one of the ways that we can sanction them is by  producing more natural gas, more fossil fuels here at home. We should  be shipping liquefied natural gas to our allies in Western Europe to  wean them off the reliance on energy from Russia.    In addition to that, it is time that our allies in NATO  step up, spend the money they are supposed to spend on their military,  on their defense structure, and move forward with us. It is not time  for Americans to constantly fight wars in other countries when other  countries haven't stepped up and recognized the dangers of a man like  Vladimir Putin.   I don't know if it is the equivalent of our Secretary of Defense or  Army Chief of Staff, or maybe the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, but the head of the German military mocked his own military,  talking about how unprepared they would be in the event of a conflict  with Russia.   Putin knows that. Putin has intelligence agents. And they have  scoured the Western European countries. They know exactly what the  strength is of those countries. They know what their willingness is to  fight. And Putin has made a decision that he can take Ukraine with very  little consequence. That is a serious issue.    Madam Speaker, I just want to echo what he is saying and  tell you that right now the dictator who is the most threatening to us,  we are going to pull away from his energy and we are going to go with  dictators who aren't quite as dangerous to us. That isn't a strategy.  That is just looking at the wrong end of a revolver.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his time tonight  and it is always a pleasure to speak with him.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
