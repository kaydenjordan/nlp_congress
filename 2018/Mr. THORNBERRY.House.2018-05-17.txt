 I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to commend the  chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Conaway, for his work not  only in formulating this bill but in promoting and protecting the  interests of rural America. I think it is a great tribute to him  dealing with a number of complex issues, and I appreciate very much a  job well done.   Mr. Chairman, when we go to the grocery store, we make decisions  about what type of beef and what grade of beef we are going to  purchase. The challenge is that the grades are different from place to  place because there is not a uniform grading system across the country.   My amendment requires USDA to set up three training centers to train  graders so that there can be more standardization. If you are going to  buy a prime or a choice steak in one place, it should be roughly the  same as a prime or choice steak in another place.   This will benefit consumers. It will benefit the beef industry, and I  hope our colleagues will support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
