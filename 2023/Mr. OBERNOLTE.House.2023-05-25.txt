 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page H2607]]  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise to thank this body for passing  my bill, the Streamlining Aviation for Eligible Veterans Act, or SAFE  Veterans Act, as part of the VET-TEC reauthorization bill that the  House passed this week.   This bill will make a meaningful contribution to allowing more of our  veterans to receive vocational flight training and enter our Nation's  workforce as pilots following their service in our military.   Madam Speaker, in 1980, over two-thirds of our Nation's pilots were  veterans. Today, that number is less than 30 percent. This bill will  not only ameliorate that situation but also help us honor the  commitment that we have made to those who served in our Armed Forces.   Madam Speaker, I urge its passage in the Senate and its transmittal  to the President, and I thank this body for supporting it.                            ____________________
