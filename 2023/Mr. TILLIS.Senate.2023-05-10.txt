 Madam President, North Carolina Baptist Hospital  opened on May 28, 1923, as an 88-bed hospital in Winston-Salem, with a  simple commitment: to be a place of healing and teaching.   Since 1923, North Carolina Baptist Hospital has served the community  and the region through educational programs. The School of Nursing  educated nurses from 1923 to 1974, and the Bowman Gray School of  Medicine graduated its first class in 1943.   Today, the hospital plays a pivotal role in research and education  for Wake Forest University School of Medicine, a nationally known  leader in groundbreaking research and experiential medical education,  and the academic core of Advocate Health. North Carolina Baptist  Hospital has grown over the years. Now known as Atrium Health Wake  Forest Baptist Medical Center, the hospital continues to grow to meet  the needs of those it serves.   Today, Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, has grown to  become an 885-bed tertiary care hospital that includes Brenner  Children's Hospital, and the health system includes five community  hospitals, more  [[Page S1601]]  than 300 primary and specialty care locations, and more than 2,700  physicians. It has over 20,000 employees and is Winston-Salem and  Forsyth County's largest employer. In 2022, construction began for a  new critical care tower at the medical center. The investment in this  world-class facility will transform emergency and critical care  throughout the region.   The hospital and the health system continues to expand services, make  research discoveries to bring medical innovations to patients more  quickly, and educate the next generation of healthcare professionals-- to meet the growing needs of the communities it serves and to improve  health, elevate hope, and advance healing--for all.                            ____________________
