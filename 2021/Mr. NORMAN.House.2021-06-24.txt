 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for offering this  Special Order. It couldn't come at a better time and a better place in  history.   Mr. Speaker, Americans have been subjected to one of the most testing  years we have ever seen. Just as they are starting to get back on their  feet and the great economic engine that is the American economy is  starting to turn over, this administration and my Democratic colleagues  are proposing to shut down the engine that we had running so robustly  for the last 4 years under President Trump.   Six trillion dollars in spending, with no offsets, is downright  irresponsible and unfair to the American taxpayer. We are not going to  get this economy on the right foot by expanding our Government even  more.   Growing inflation concerns have already begun to hit our constituents  where it hurts the most, at the gas pump--have you tried filling up  your car lately? It has hit you in the grocery stores. It has hit you  in the checkbooks.   This oncoming crisis is putting hardworking Americans on rocky  footing, and this President is proposing to pull the rug out from  underneath them. Another cash infusion will do nothing more than kick  those Americans while they are down by driving prices up even more.  Enough is enough.   Businesses are opening up, construction projects are expanding our  neighborhoods and cities, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel  and the light is a bright one. Don't shut the door on that light by  throttling the demands of everyday items.   Ultimately, there are a variety of reasons for these rising prices,  many of which are industry specific. However, it is important to  remember that big government spending is only going to make this  problem worse.   I was elected to Congress to take care of the American people. I was  not elected to bankrupt this country. I was not elected to burden them  even more. It is clear that the American economy wants to make a  comeback. The only question is, will bureaucrats, will politicians,  will government get out of the way.                                time  1715
