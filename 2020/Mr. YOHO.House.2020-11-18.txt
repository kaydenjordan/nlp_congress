 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1033, Chairman  Engel's resolution condemning the violation of Hong Kong's freedom. On  June 30, the Chinese Communist Party, or the CCP, used its sham  legislature to enforce a dystopian national security law on Hong Kong.   This law criminalizes basic civil liberties, destroyed the one  country, two systems model of autonomy for Hong Kong, and inserts the  CCP's police state in Hong Kong to crush dissent. After more than a  year of a prodemocracy movement that inspired people around the world  to fight for liberty over tyranny, this law was the CCP's response.   Rather than tolerate criticism and consider reform, they doubled down  on totalitarianism. The CCP violated their international obligations,  obliterated Hong Kong's freedom, and shredded the Sino-British Treaty  that guaranteed human rights in Hong Kong.   Since the law was enacted, we have seen countless young people  arrested for free speech. Others have disappeared into mainland Chinese  black prisons. The CCP has canceled elections to prevent opposition  victories. Just last week, the CCP used its sham legislature to assert  full control over the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, destroying Hong  Kong's last remaining shreds of self-government.   They know that the Communist Party cannot survive with free-thinking  people. The CCP's human rights abuses in Hong Kong are far from over,  but neither is Hong Kong's fight for freedom.   Chairman Engel's resolution continues our bipartisan work to call out  the CCP's abuse and stand with Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, we no longer see American flags flying over the  thousands of protesters in the streets of Hong Kong. Displaying our  symbol of liberty has become a criminal act punishable by life in  prison. But even though the freedom-loving people of Hong Kong can no  longer ask for our support, we still hear their call. It is more  important than ever to continue to stand with Hong Kong.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for offering this resolution,  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 697, recognizing the  genuine autonomy of Tibet and the vital work the Dalai Lama has done to  promote peace around the world.   Over 60 years ago, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama was forced into  exile by the Chinese Communist Party's full-scale military takeover of  Tibet. To this very day, the CCP uses propaganda, violence, and  oppression to assert totalitarian control over Tibet and the Tibetan  people. The CCP sees Tibet's cultural and religious heritage as a  threat to its control. Just as they have done with Islam and  Christianity, the CCP is trying to stamp out Tibetan Buddhism and  Tibetans' way of life--even though Tibet is guaranteed autonomy under  China's constitution.   Despite these challenges, the Dalai Lama has stood as a leader in the  promotion of human rights and religious harmony and the preservation of  Tibetan culture and religion. The Dalai Lama's contribution to peace  and nonviolence has been revered by the international community, and  for decades the U.S. Congress has remained committed to strengthening  the relationship between the U.S. and the Tibetan people.  [[Page H5880]]    I would like to thank His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama for his  dedication to the Tibetan people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, since 1959, the U.S. Congress, on a bicameral,  bipartisan basis, has remained committed to strengthening the  friendship between the U.S. and the Tibetan people.   There are over 31,000 individuals of Tibetan descent living in North  America, and our people share similar values of freedom and  understanding.   His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has dedicated himself to three  principles: the promotion of human values, the promotion of religious  harmony, and the preservation of Tibetan culture and religion.   I would like to thank the Dalai Lama for his vital contributions to  the Tibetan people and the world.   As Mr. Perry said, the Communist Party knows they cannot survive with  free thought, and that is what religion does for people around the  world. They put a deity or a higher power above them, whereas, in  China, the highest power that can be achieved is the Communist Party,  and therefore it will not survive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Securing America from  Epidemics Act.   I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Dr. Bera, for introducing  this bill--and I co-introduced it--for his work to address this  important issue.   COVID-19 has shown that pandemics know no borders and that the United  States must be prepared to respond to disease outbreaks around the  world. This bill authorizes the United States to participate in the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an alliance of  countries and private partners that are financing and coordinating the  development of new vaccines for infectious diseases. These are the  emerging diseases that they are studying so that we are prepared for  them.                                time  1245    In addition to COVID-19, CEPI has developed a list of priority  diseases with epidemic potential, including viruses that cause Middle  East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS. By leveraging contributions from  member states with expertise and funding by private partners, CEPI  seeks to develop vaccines before the disease outbreak occurs.   CEPI estimates that COVID-19 could cost the global economy $4.1  trillion, or close to 5 percent of global GDP.   Of course, the impact of viruses like COVID-19 is not just measured  in the disruption of economic stability in nations around the world,  but also, unfortunately, in the lives lost.   Developing vaccines and treatments for emerging infectious diseases  is not just an issue of individual health but of national security. Our  committee has worked together on many pieces of legislation in response  to COVID-19. The SAFE Act is another example of this bipartisan effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues who believe we must do all we  can to prevent another pandemic like COVID-19 from emerging in the  future to support this legislation, as it is a critical component to  that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I once again thank Representative Bera for  his work on this important legislation. The U.S. international  community and the private sector must continue to work together to  develop the tools we need in response to emerging infectious diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 349, a  resolution to reaffirm the vital role of the U.S.-Japan alliance in  promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.   For over six decades, the U.S.-Japan alliance has served as a  cornerstone for security in the Indo-Pacific region and will continue  to be fundamental to the protection of our shared interests.   Our two democratic nations maintain close cooperation on a multitude  of issues, including nonproliferation, global health, and maritime  security. In recent years, our alliance has stood as a crucial check to  China's increasing regional aggression and North Korea's continued  nuclear ambitions.   As the security environment in the Indo-Pacific continues to become  more complex, our alliance will prove to be more significant than ever.  This resolution reaffirms the importance of this longstanding strategic  relationship in the face of the new threats and challenges that impact  both U.S. and Japan.   Mr. Speaker, as we face what some would consider the greatest threat  in our generation, the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, the United  States must reaffirm support for our alliance with like-minded nations  like Japan. It is only through mutual cooperation that we can continue  to protect democratic values and freedoms around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 809, expressing the  importance of the alliance between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea.   South Korea continues to be one of our most important strategic and  economic partners in the Indo-Pacific region. While our alliance  focuses heavily on our shared concern of a nuclearized North Korea, our  two nations also cooperate in areas such as democracy, global health,  and counterterrorism.   Together, we have made it a priority to support and uphold rules- based order in the Indo-Pacific region and protect the democratic  values and freedoms that both of our people hold so dearly. As bad  actors in the region continue their aggressive campaign against  democracy and stability, it is critical that we reiterate the  importance of our relationship with nations like South Korea.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for decades, our alliance with the Republic of Korea has  served as a testament to the power of freedom and democracy. Our  relationship is built upon strong ties and shared values, and more than  1.7 million Korean Americans call the United States home.   I look forward to many more years of close cooperation between our  two nations as our alliance evolves and strengthens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1012, recognizing the  70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War and the  transformation of the U.S.-Korea alliance into a mutual beneficial,  global partnership.   Since that momentous day, our two nations have worked together to  promote and protect democracy and freedom in the Indo-Pacific region  and around the world.   American and South Koreans alike understand the importance of  defending democracy against malign actors who seek to undermine it at  every turn.   I would like to thank the 5.8 million U.S. servicemembers who served  during the Korean War, including 36,574 who paid the ultimate sacrifice  in the defense of the Republic of Korea.   The fight to protect freedom and democracy will continue for years to  come, but we are fortunate to have partners like the Republic of Korea  by our side.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for those  who fought to defend freedom during the Korean War. Because of their  sacrifice, South Koreans can live freely and without fear of  oppression.   Through new and unforeseen challenges, the U.S.-ROK alliance  continues to strengthen and evolve, and we look forward to close  cooperation and friendship in years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4644, the Libya Stabilization  Act. Despite a U.N. arms embargo, foreign actors are continuing to  support both sides of the conflict.   For example, Russia is supporting General Haftar's Libyan National  Army. AFRICOM publishes pictures of advanced Russian aircraft in Libya.  AFRICOM also estimates that Russia is supporting thousands of  mercenaries from the Wagner Group and from Syria to fight for Haftar.  Turkey has brought in more than 5,000 Syrian mercenaries to support the  Government of National Accord.   Flooding Libya with foreign mercenaries and heavy weaponry could  destabilize the country and region for generations.   We need to incentivize all parties to embrace a political track to  establish stable governance in Libya and end the violence. That is the  purpose of this legislation before us today.   I am pleased that since our committee first considered this bill over  the summer, the U.N. has managed to broker a ceasefire. The parties are  using this opportunity to continue negotiations regarding the future of  Libya.   Unfortunately, as we have seen many times in this conflict, there is  still the possibility that spoilers could upend this peace process.   That is why, under this legislation, if individuals are threatening  the peace, security, and stability of Libya, they will be subject to  sanctions. But the bill clearly states that if there is a ceasefire in  place, as there is at this time, at this very moment, then the  sanctions do not apply.   We are using our leverage to support the emerging political process  and a peaceful future for the people of Libya.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson)  for their leadership in introducing this bill, which I support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1062, reaffirming the U.S.- Iraq bilateral relationship.   In recent years, the United States and Iraq worked together to defeat  the caliphate and free the Iraqi people from ISIS' tyrannical rule.   The American people are committed to supporting a sovereign and  democratic Iraq. We have provided billions of dollars in foreign  assistance to help Iraqis recover from the devastating impact that ISIS  has had on their lives.   This year, the United States and Iraq held a strategic dialogue to  further our bilateral relationship and discuss how we can continue to  work together for our shared benefit.   With this resolution, the House is reaffirming our commitment to  helping the Iraqi people and calling on the Iraqi Government to fulfill  its commitments too.   The Iraqi Government needs to protect the United States' diplomats  and servicemembers and hold accountable those involved in attacks  against our Embassy, such as earlier this year.   The Government of Iraq also needs to hold accountable those  responsible for violence against peaceful protesters.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for his work on this bipartisan  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Allred) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler)  for their leadership in introducing this bipartisan resolution, which I  support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FENTANYL Results Act.   The opioid crisis continues to have a devastating effect on Americans  across this great Nation. It is imperative we use all the tools at our  disposal to fully address this problem.   The FENTANYL Results Act ensures that we leverage the role of the  State Department in this whole-of-government effort. Specifically, this  bill requires the Secretary of State to  [[Page H5895]]  prioritize efforts to combat international trafficking in synthetic  drugs and new psychoactive substances.   A key provision of this bill authorizes the Secretary to provide  assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies, including those in  drug-transit countries, to stem the illicit flow of fentanyl and other  synthetic drugs across our borders.   This bill requires the Secretary to foster greater partnerships with  international drug agencies and increase data collection to keep pace  with emerging synthetic drug use that could be exploited by the  international trafficking networks.   It also addresses the demand side of this problem by authorizing an  action change program to provide educational and professional  development on demand reduction matters.   This bill is an important measure to continue our aggressive fight  against this deadly fentanyl epidemic, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I want to thank Representative Trone for his work on this  issue.   We all know someone, unfortunately, who has suffered from addiction.  We must remain committed to defeating substance abuse and saving  American lives. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I, too, would like to thank Chairman Engel for his years of  dedication and service to the State of New York and to this Nation and  his friendship. It has been an honor to work with you, sir. It has been  an honor to know you, and I wish the best of life to you and Pat in the  future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
