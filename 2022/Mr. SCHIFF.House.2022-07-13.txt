 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment, which has  passed the House three times and which clarifies the authority of  military commission judges to order court proceedings at Guantanamo Bay  to be broadcast on the internet.   At its core, this amendment has a simple goal: transparency. By  passing this amendment, we will show the American people that we  believe they have the right to observe military commission proceedings,  including those against the individuals who planned the 9/11 attacks.                                time  1600    We owe transparency to the loved ones and families of the victims. We  should also provide transparency for journalists, academics, NGOs, and  all concerned Americans who are understandably deeply interested in  these vital proceedings.   Importantly, this bill does not require particular proceedings to be  in open session--that will still be for the judges to decide. When they  are open to the public, they should be accessible, so victims do not  need to travel to Guantanamo to bear witness.   I will continue to work to permanently close the prison at Guantanamo  Bay, but in the meantime, Congress must act to ensure transparency for  the American people.   This bill is fully protective of classified information, I encourage  all Members to support our amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, is there time remaining in opposition or  should I close?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill. Again, this  bill does not require proceedings to be available  [[Page H6229]]  online, but it does ensure that judges have that authority.   I think that this is something that the victims would like because  the victims would like to be able to observe the proceedings without  having to travel all the way to Guantanamo. In the interest of those  victims, I would urge support for the passage of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment, which passed  the House last year by a unanimous voice vote. The Posse Comitatus Act  of 1878 currently prohibits the Army and Air Force from enforcing U.S.  laws without authorization by the Constitution or Congress. Today, I  offer an amendment to strengthen that existing law to include the  Marines, the Navy, and the federalized National Guard and Reserve  components.   My amendment would also prohibit the use of evidence unlawfully  obtained by or with the assistance of the military in a court of law or  other legal proceedings.   Put plainly, it would prevent any President of either party from  unlawfully using the military as a domestic police force, and it would  ensure that evidence obtained because of unlawful acts isn't used  against any American. I would hope that this is a proposition that both  parties can support.   Last year, as I said, this amendment passed by voice vote and with  broad support. However, this year, conspiracy theorists, including some  who served in this body when this amendment was passed previously, have  announced their opposition. I guess it is fair to say that they were  for it before they were against it.   You may hear some of these conspiracy theories this evening, so let  me be very clear. This amendment has one goal: to prevent any President  from unlawfully using our Nation's Armed Forces against Americans  exercising their constitutionally protected rights.   Last year, my friends on the other side of the aisle didn't want  evidence obtained illegally by the military to be used against people.  This year, well, we will see.   This amendment will ensure the government cannot use evidence  obtained by the military if acting unlawfully and allow us to better  protect the fundamental freedoms enshrined in our Constitution. Surely,  we can all agree on that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, my colleague says that we already have laws against the  military unlawfully engaging in the enforcement of domestic policy. We  only have laws against certain branches of the military doing that.  This bill would expand that to any branch of the military. So, this is  not covered by existing law.   I am rather struck by the argument I hear against this amendment that  if the military engages in unlawful activity, it appears they are okay  with using that unlawfully obtained evidence in a court of law. That  wouldn't be allowed in any criminal proceeding if law enforcement  obtained evidence unlawfully. It shouldn't be allowed if the military  obtains evidence unlawfully.                                time  0110     Mr. Speaker, the only thing that has changed from last  year when this passed on a unanimous voice vote to this year is,  apparently, this year, some of my colleagues are willing to have the  military enforce domestic policy in violation of the law and use the  fruits of that illegal action against American citizens. I don't think  that is right.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer amendment 451 as the  designee of Mr. Malinowski.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of amendment  No. 451 for my colleague, Congressman Malinowski.   Before I do, though, I am glad that I have the opportunity to respond  on my previous amendment regarding the Posse Comitatus law. My  colleague in opposition made the claim: Well, what if evidence is  obtained by the military lawfully? Would the amendment exclude that? I  sought recognition to answer his question, but he did not want to  recognize me, and I understand why, because the answer is quite simple  from the text of the amendment.   The amendment reads: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  any information obtained by or with the assistance of a member of the  Armed Forces in violation of section 1385 of title 18, shall not be  received in evidence,'' and that is the pertinent part of that  provision.   So the simple answer to my friend's question, what about evidence  gathered lawfully? Well, obviously that is not impacted. It is only in  the case that the military is used unlawfully, and evidence is gained  unlawfully that it would be excluded, much as the fruit of the  poisonous tree doctrine that my colleague recognized. If that is true  in criminal court, it ought to be true when the military acts in  violation of the law.   Let me now turn to amendment No. 451 for my colleague,   Tom  Malinowski.   This is a simple and straightforward proposition. It requires a  review of any actions by the military in Brazil to  [[Page H6468]]  interfere with their upcoming elections. This is not coming out of the  blue, but responds to clear and concerning signals including:   Number 1, in April, President Bolsonaro repeated a falsehood that  officials count votes in a secret room. He then suggested that voting  data should be fed to a room ``where the Armed Forces also have a  computer to count the votes.''   Number 2, senior generals have already begun to publicly question the  integrity of the election.   Number 3, the Minister of Defense sent a preemptive and unfounded  formal complaint to electoral authorities expressing ``concerns'' about  the election, and generals are getting involved in digging up electoral  fraud stories.   Number 4, thousands of military officers have been appointed to run  the Brazilian Government, more than under the military dictatorship.  Eleven officers in the Cabinet and military officers atop the national  oil company indicating that they are already well positioned to  maintain and expand the military's power and influence.   Number 5, senior officials are advocating the reintroduction of  military laws from the dictatorship that would eliminate constitutional  protections, furthering concerns about the health of Brazil's  democracy.   These are concerning signs, and we must be vigilant to advocate for  democracy, particularly in the largest country in Latin America with a  population larger than Russia and also a country that is a major non- NATO ally.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0130     Mr. Speaker, I want to just say that I am in complete  agreement with my colleague about the cold, but I am not in agreement  about the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, there is a profound concern that we all ought to share  that President Bolsonaro may be preparing his own big lie about the  Brazilian elections and that he may bring the military in to help  propagate a big lie about fraud in the elections in Brazil. He seems to  be laying the foundation for making such a claim.   It would be a compounding of the tragedy we have experienced in this  country if America's chief export to Brazil turned out to be a big lie  in how to undermine integrity and faith in our elections and  institutions.   This is a simple reporting requirement of a list of possible actions  by military officials in Brazil surrounding the elections. It is a  sense of Congress that whatever findings are made about military  intervention in the elections ought to be assessed in terms of whether  the coup clause has been triggered; that is, of course, the annual  appropriations clause that prohibits U.S. assistance to countries where  a coup has taken place.   Mr. Speaker, in light of the warning signs in Brazil, I urge support  of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
