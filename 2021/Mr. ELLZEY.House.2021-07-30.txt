 Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank my Lord and Savior,  Jesus Christ; my family--my beautiful wife, Shelby, my incredible  daughter, McCall; and my incredible son, Jack; my parents in Texas and  California; and papa looking down on me from Heaven.   I thank my family in the Sixth District of Texas. I will serve you  with quiet professionalism.   I would like to read for you Philippians 4:8-9.         Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever       is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is       lovely, whatever is commendable--if there is any moral       excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy--dwell on       these things. Do what you have learned and received and heard       from me, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with       you.    I believe America is exceptional. I love my country. It is an honor  to serve. I would appreciate the prayers of all of those in here as I  learn my job.   Madam Speaker, I would like to leave you with a moment of silence for  your colleague, our friend, and my predecessor, Ron Wright, and his  family.                            ____________________
