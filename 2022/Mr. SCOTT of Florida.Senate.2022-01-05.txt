 Madam President, last month I was proud to see  the Senate come together in a bipartisan effort and pass a  Congressional Review Act measure to overturn President Biden's  unconstitutional Federal vaccine mandate on private businesses. In that  bipartisan vote, a majority of U.S. Senators sent a clear message that  these job-killing mandates are wrong and have no place in our country's  fight against COVID-19.   Then, just days after Christmas, President Biden said something very  interesting. While he was talking with Governors about the COVID-19  pandemic, he admitted:         Look, there is no Federal solution. This gets solved at a       State level.    This is President Biden's message: States should be leading the  effort. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't a role for the Federal  Government. But what we have seen from the Biden administration is no  progress, just worsening cases, and the horrible job-killing  consequences of his unconstitutional mandates on private businesses.   I want to be clear: His unconstitutional mandates are job killers.  Back in October, the Federal Reserve reported that vaccine mandates  were widely cited by businesses as a reason for low labor supply and  hiring and retention issues. It was a finding my Republican colleagues  and I have been warning about for months before their report, and it is  directly tied to inflation.   When the labor supply is reduced, prices go up, and families,  especially those on low and fixed incomes, suffer. Restaurants, grocery  stores, gas stations, and small businesses all have to charge more.   I heard about a restaurant owner in St. Petersburg, FL, who had to  take certain items off the menu because they simply cost too much, and  he can't pass the cost on to his customers. He has even seen the price  of oil and to-go boxes more than double.   I talked to an operator of a food bank in Osceola County, FL. She  used to see 15 families each day, and now she is seeing upward of 70  families. Food prices have gone through the roof. It is more expensive  for her to get food to give to people hurting at the very time demand  is up. This is the reality for families and small businesses all across  America, and vaccine mandates do nothing but make these problems even  worse.   I can't imagine why, just when our country is working to get back on  its feet, the President of the United States would be pushing policies  that kill jobs, but that is exactly what he is doing. Now lockdown- loving Dr. Fauci and President Biden want to double down on their  insane mandates and are considering forcing every American who wants to  fly to show proof of vaccine before boarding an airplane. This is just  another Orwellian response from the Biden administration and radical  Democrats that does nothing to protect the American people.   Providing information about the virus, providing tests, supporting  vaccine and therapy developments, and getting the economy back on track  should be the only role of the Federal Government in this pandemic.   Congress has to take a stand and protect the American people from  these  [[Page S39]]  communist China-style policies that are meant to divide us. That is why  a few months ago, I introduced the Prevent Unconstitutional Vaccine  Mandates for Interstate Commerce Act. The bill would prevent Federal  Agencies, like the Department of Transportation and Department of  Commerce, from requiring proof of vaccination for companies trying to  do business across State lines.   Importantly, it would block the Federal Government from making  airline passengers show proof of vaccine before catching a flight,  which is exactly what Dr. Fauci wants to do.   This bill also protects truckers and will ensure that the Biden  administration can't ruin our supply chains even more. Our truckers are  the key to fixing Biden's supply chain crisis, and we should do  everything we can to protect them.   President Biden has continually showed us his track record of failed  policies and a mandate for domestic airline passengers would only add  to his growing failures and blame shifting. We saw it in his failed and  deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. We have seen his administration's  complete failure to handle the crisis across the southern border. We  see it every day in President Biden's inability to fight inflation by  stopping reckless spending. We continue to see his failure and complete  void of leadership in how this administration is fighting COVID-19.   Now, I am sure my Democrat colleagues will say that this legislation  isn't needed because at this exact moment, there is not a vaccine  mandate to fly on a plane, but they said the same thing last year when  we tried to preemptively block vaccine mandates for private businesses.  They claimed the President has committed not to do that. We know the  President broke that promise.   The American people deserve better than politicians who continue to  mislead them on the Federal Government's failures to fight COVID  properly. The back-and-forth has to end.   We must end these ridiculous, unconstitutional vaccine mandates and  focus on getting our economy back on track. That is why, as I mentioned  earlier, the U.S. Senate passed a Congressional Review Act measure to  invalidate President Biden's vaccine mandate on a bipartisan basis. The  Senate, along with the majority of Americans, doesn't believe that the  Federal Government should force people to choose between taking the  vaccine and losing their job. That is why I am again demanding that the  Federal Government stop trying to force the American people to follow  draconian, job-killing mandates that hurt families.   This is the second time I have come to the floor to try to pass this  bill and protect the rights of American families and businesses. I  would like to thank Senators Cynthia Lummis, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and  Roger Marshall for joining me in introducing this important and  urgently needed legislation. This is a commonsense bill, and I hope all  my colleagues will support it.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2895 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.   I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    First off, I want to make sure my colleague  understands what this bill would do. This bill would prevent Federal  Agencies, like the Department of Transportation and the Department of  Commerce, from requiring proof of vaccination for companies trying to  do business across State lines.   So what this bill does is say that the Federal Government is not  going to mandate this. If a private business wants to say that you have  to have a vaccine to come in, that is a decision that private business  gets to make. But government shouldn't be in the position to tell a new  business that they have to require a vaccine. I mean, that is not what  you do.  [[Page S40]]    What this does do is it is killing jobs. It is killing people and  killing the jobs of people who worked their tail off in the prior 12  months.   Now, I don't know why this is controversial. The Senate, on a  bipartisan basis, just passed a Congressional Review Act measure  striking down President Biden's vaccine mandate. On a bipartisan basis  we already decided we don't believe in what the President is doing.   We have got families and businesses all across this country that are  struggling to keep up with the cost of inflation, and the government  should be doing everything it can to reduce inflation and get the  economy going.   Look, I know what it is like to go hungry because groceries cost too  much. I watched my mom and my dad struggle for years. When prices rose,  my mom took in odd jobs. When she struggled, we didn't have as much  food on the table.   It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to improve the  economy and help families get ahead. We know the vaccine mandates are  absolutely causing prices to rise. When prices rise, people are getting  hurt, and they are making interstate commerce much more difficult.   So instead of taking action to help families and curb inflation, the  Biden Administration is taking every possible step to make it harder  for them to put food on the table and afford to live in this country.   The President has already said that this must be handled at the State  level. I agree. And the Federal Government can take a step in this  direction by ensuring vaccine passports won't be required for  interstate commerce.   They shouldn't be required to get on a plane. They shouldn't be  required to carry goods across State lines.   Even our Nation's healthcare providers know that mandates don't work.  They stopped doing it in most cases. Just last month we saw hospitals  across this country delay or suspend their vaccine mandates because  they knew it was killing jobs.   We know that Biden's unconstitutional mandates are going to make it  more difficult to retain staff and deliver quality care to their  patients. I don't understand why my colleague wants to give the  government more power, more power, more power--upholding regulations  that are causing prices to rise and forcing people to choose between  keeping their jobs and getting a vaccine.   We ought to give people the freedom to live their lives, to do  exactly what my colleague just said: If a business wants to require a  vaccine, they should require that. But if they don't, the government  shouldn't be doing that. Our government should be giving people  information, and let them make the decisions they want to make.   I trust American families. I trust American businesses. They are  smart enough to make informed decisions about their health. But my  colleague's objection is bad for American families and bad for business  owners, and I hope she will reconsider her objection.
