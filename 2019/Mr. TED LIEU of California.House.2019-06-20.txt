 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to the Interior Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2020. In 2013,  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Office of Law Enforcement  established the Wildlife Detector Dog Program as part of a national  effort to combat illegal wildlife trafficking. Certified canines and  wildlife inspector handlers go through a 13-week training course at the  U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Detector Dog Training Center  in Newman, Georgia, and they are trained for real work environments  such as mail facilities, ocean containers, and air cargo warehouses.  Since the program's inception, USFWS has added more wildlife detectors.  There are now six detector dogs deployed at USFWS designated ports of  entry: Dutton in Houston, Texas; Beans in Chicago, Illinois; Viper in  Miami, Florida; Samm in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Dock in Anchorage,  Alaska; and Lockett near my Congressional District in Los Angeles,  California.   These highly intelligent canines, paired with highly trained  handlers, are able to detect many wildlife scents, such as elephant  ivory, sea turtle skin, dried seahorse, python skin, and rhino horn.  USFWS has reported that the use of these dogs is far more efficient  than deploying human inspectors. For every 1,000 packages sniffed by  dogs, 10 packages are properly inspected by humans.   The Wildlife Detector Dog Program strengthens and expands USFWS'  inspection capabilities on illegal wildlife products. With more than 18  major ports of entry across the country, I would like to take this  opportunity to urge more attention and resources be dedicated to the  growth and expansion of this program.   My amendment will designate $200,000 of Department of Interior  appropriations for the Wildlife Detector Dog Program, which is the  estimated cost of adding an additional K-9 unit to the program. I thank  Chairwoman McCollum for her support on this amendment and I urge my  colleagues to join us in passing it.
