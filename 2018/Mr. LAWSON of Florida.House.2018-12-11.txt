 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  congratulate Florida State University women's soccer team for winning  the NCAA national championship over the North Carolina Tar Heels.   I know we have a lot of Tar Heels here, and I would like to  congratulate them for their work, too.   These extraordinary women trained day in and day out to become the  champs that they are today.   Coach Mark Krikorian's work and relationship with his players speaks  volumes to the work they have been able to accomplish and to develop a  program that will continue to produce remarkable results in the future.   I hope these young women continue to work hard as they grow to new  heights. I encourage them to carry over the same training, mind-set,  and attitude into all the things that they do here in life.   I join my fellow alumni and fans from across the Nation to say  congratulations, and go Noles.  [[Page H10087]]                                ____________________
