 Mr. Speaker, 1 Corinthians 12:26 reads:         If one member suffers, all the members suffer together.    I stand today to show my support for my colleague, Congressman Steve  Scalise, his wife, and his family. We pray for their strength, their  courage, and their faith as they deal with the unthinkable.   I pray for Steve's speedy recovery. We know he is a fighter, and we  pray he will be back soon fighting for the people of Louisiana's First  District.   We offer prayers for Matt and his family, who was also injured during  the shooting.   I rise today to remember the courageous Capitol Police officers who  were injured; our heroes. If not for their bravery, more people could  have been wounded and possibly killed. They risk their lives to protect  us. The U.S. Capitol Police do this every day for us, for our staff,  and for the public.   We stand together during this challenging time. When it happens to  one of us, it happens to all of us.                            ____________________
