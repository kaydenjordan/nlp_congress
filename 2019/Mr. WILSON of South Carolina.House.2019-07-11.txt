 Mr. Speaker, Congress should strive for  Democrats and Republicans in Washington to truly work together. When  the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act reached 365 bipartisan  cosponsors, I was grateful to share the good news. That is a remarkable  more than 80 percent of Congress.   House Democrats had the ability to bring the Military Surviving  Spouses Equity Act to the floor tomorrow to repeal the widow's tax.  Instead, Democratic leadership has diverted a vote by tacking it onto a  flawed and hyperpartisan bill without notice late at night, which they  know will not receive support on both sides of the aisle.   This is heartbreaking for the 65,000 military widows in America.  However, it is not too late to do the right thing and keep this as a  standalone bipartisan bill.   I encourage our colleagues across the aisle to put H.R. 553 on the  Consensus Calendar. Together, we can give servicemembers and their  families the recognition they deserve.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
