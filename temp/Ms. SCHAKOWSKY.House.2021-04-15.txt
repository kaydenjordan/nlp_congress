 Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 58th anniversary of  the Equal Pay Act. Despite the goal to ensure equality for women in the  workplace, nearly 60 years later, the pay gap still exists.   Women today, on average, make 82 cents for every dollar earned by a  man. For women of color, the disparity is worse, with Black women  making 63 cents on the dollar, AAPI women making 60 cents, and Latinas  making 55 cents.   This disparity is unacceptable, and it is unfair.   Let us come together right now to pass H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness  Act.   When women get equal pay, our families and our entire economy will do  better.   I include in the Record a letter from the United Church of Christ in  favor of H.R. 7.                                         United Church of Christ         Dear Representative: We are writing to ask for your support       in passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7), and to       ensure that passage in the House is done without amendments       that diminish the protections provided by the bill.        There is ample evidence to show that despite equal pay       laws, the gender pay gap exists. These lost earnings add up       to a loss of over $400,000 in a lifetime. The wage gap is       even more significant for women of color  [[Page H1810]]       with Black women working full time making only 63 cents for       every dollar paid to men, Native American women only 60       cents, and Latinas only 55 cents, for every dollar paid to       their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts.        As people of faith, we believe that each person deserves to       be treated with dignity and humanity. When women are paid       less for the same work that is a concrete and explicit way of       showing that their work and personhood are valued less.       Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act will strengthen and       update the Equal Pay Act and provide women with the legal       means to fight the gender pay gap and challenge gender pay       discrimination.        The work done by women, and particularly Black and brown       women, is undervalued and underpaid. Even though much of that       labor is what keeps people fed, clothed, and cared for. The       work of women, so important to how a society functions is       always relegated to less pay and less value. This is a gross       injustice--and part of the systemic racist structures that       undergird the economic system in the United States. God's       vision for our world is one where all are valued, no matter       their gender, race, or credo.        We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without       harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections.
