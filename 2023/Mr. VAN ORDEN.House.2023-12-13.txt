 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  painting a vivid and completely disingenuous picture of junior high  school students being held down and having milk forced down their  throats in a school cafeteria.   I will also take the opportunity--I can't believe I am doing this-- the milk fat content of whole milk is actually 3.25 percent making it  96.7 percent fat-free.   So when we look at the science, we read this definition: Milk means  the lacteal secretion practically free from colostrum obtained by the  complete milking of one or more healthy cows.   The reason soy milk is not in there is because it is not milk.  Neither is almond milk. Milk comes from a mammal.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support this bill, and I am looking forward to  having our children have healthy and nutritious choices in their  schools.
