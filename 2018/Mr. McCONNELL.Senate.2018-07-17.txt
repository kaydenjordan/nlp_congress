 Madam President, last night the Internal Revenue  Service made an important announcement. It is particularly welcome news  to those of us who are intently focused on defending the First  Amendment, for those of us who, over the years, have raised concerns  during the last administration about activist regulators punishing free  speech and free association.   It is a straightforward, commonsense policy decision. The Internal  Revenue Service is cutting back on the amount of nonpublic information  it collects and stockpiles about Americans who donate to nonprofit  causes. The IRS will no longer pointlessly demand private contributor  lists from whole categories of tax-exempt organizations. I say  ``pointlessly'' because the identity of nonprofit donors serves no  compelling purpose under sections 501(c)4, and 501(c)6 of our Tax Code.   Contributions to these organizations are not tax deductible--not tax  deductible--so the IRS does not need to see this data for accounting  purposes. These organizations are not required to release that  information under the public inspection and availability requirements.   Let me repeat. The identity of the donors to these organizations is  not necessary for accounting and is not required for public inspection  by the Internal Revenue Code.   It raises the question that if the IRS isn't permitted to do anything  with this set of Americans' private information, why collect it in the  first place?   Unfortunately, we know exactly what happens when the government  stockpiles private data about the donations through which Americans  participate in the public discourse. We know exactly why many on the  left are keen for bureaucrats to have this confidential information.  Where it leads is Americans being bullied for exercising their First  Amendment rights. This bullying is established by bureaucrats and, in  some cases, by elected officials.   Sometimes the government itself does the bullying. Case in point: the  Obama administration's IRS scandal. The agency slow-walked the  applications of groups that appeared conservative, including some of my  own constituents. Donors and groups faced unusually aggressive  questioning, unreasonable deadlines followed by unreasonable delays.  These were Federal authorities using the weaponry of government to  punish Americans for supporting speech they didn't like.   Other times, government simply enables the harassment. It fails to  protect this private information from leaking to the army of angry  leftwing activists who stand eager to harass and bully anyone who is  contributing to national conversations with political views with which  they disagree.   Back in 2014, the IRS had to settle a lawsuit on this very issue. An  IRS worker broke the law and leaked an unredacted copy of a group's  confidential tax forms which wound up in the hands of a liberal  organization on the opposite side of the issue. Needless to say,  private information about Americans' political speech was quickly  weaponized for political purposes. In one case, the CEO of a technology  organization was hounded from his job by liberal activists for daring  to see this subject differently than they did.   Some State governments began demanding their own copies of the  information the IRS was gathering. There were similarly troubling  results. In 2012, California, which had promised nonprofits that donor  lists would only be seen by the State's Registry of Charitable Trusts,  accidentally--accidentally--published the donor lists of hundreds of  nonprofits from across the political spectrum. More States, like New  York, have sought to copy California, allowing more activist regulators  to access this information.   So the pattern is unmistakable. This particular political movement  wants to erase our age-old tradition that citizens should be able to  keep their private views and the causes they privately support private.  [[Page S4974]]    Back in the 1950s, it was the NAACP who took on the State of Alabama  over precisely this issue. The State government tried to get their  hands on the NAACP's donor list. The issue went all the way to the U.S.  Supreme Court, where the NAACP won a big victory for the First  Amendment.   Here is what Justice Harlan wrote in that opinion: ``Inviolability of  privacy and group association may in many circumstances be  indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly  where a group espouses dissident beliefs.''   He said that forcing private organizations to disclose their donors  was not so different from forcing people with certain views to wear  armbands or other clothing, advertising their beliefs to the world.   In both cases, the government's action would be inviting harassment  and intimidation upon Americans--those whose beliefs were either  unusual or unpopular or, in today's culture of intimidation, those  whose beliefs the left disagrees with. The result is, more speakers  stay silent, fewer Americans choose to exercise their right of free  association.   It is bad enough to wield government power to chill political speech  and invite harassment of citizens based on what an angry mob might  assume their opinions are, based on their private financial records. It  is even more egregious to pursue that nakedly political goal while  calling it--believe it or not--good government.   In this country, good government means protecting citizens' First  Amendment rights to participate in the competition of ideas, not trying  to shut down that competition. We persuade. We don't intimidate.   So I welcome this announcement and applaud the leadership of  Secretary Mnuchin and Acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. I am glad  this step will make the right of Americans to freely advocate for their  strongly held beliefs less vulnerable to the malice of some in  government and to the proven failures of bureaucracies. I urge  continued vigilance for all of us who cherish the First Amendment.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a different matter, it is becoming  a historic year for favorable economic news. There are plenty of ways  to measure how American workers, job creators, and entrepreneurs are  writing a new chapter.   After nearly a decade of stagnating pay and vanishing opportunities,  recent months have brought remarkable milestones. Optimism among  American small businesses has reached its highest level since President  Reagan's first term. Sixty-seven percent of Americans believe that now  is a good time to find a quality job in the United States--the highest  percentage in 17 years of Gallup polling. Just last month, a  manufacturing industry measure reported growth in 17 out of 18 sectors,  from textiles to precision technologies.   It is no surprise, then, that the National Association of  Manufacturers found last month that a record-high 95.1 percent of  American manufacturers have a positive view of their company's outlook.   What do these numbers mean to real workers on the floor of American  factories? At Mack Molding, an injection molder and contract  manufacturer, with locations in Statesville, NC, and Arlington, VT, it  means a $5.4 million investment in facilities with preparations to hire  100 new workers. At Sabel Steel, based in Montgomery, AL, it means  large pay raises for most of the company's 230 employees and new, more  efficient equipment at facilities across the South. Both companies  credit last year's historic tax reform law with helping make their 2018  success possible.   Our Democratic colleagues can talk all they like about repealing  middle-class families' and job creators' historic tax cuts and sending  that money back to Washington instead, but this united Republican  government is proud of the new prosperity they are building. We will  not let the Democrats take away their tax cut.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
