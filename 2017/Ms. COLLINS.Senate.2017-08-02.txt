 Mr. President, in 2001, Maine's legendary Ellsworth  American newspaper celebrated its 150th year by launching a new  enterprise, the Mount Desert Islander, dedicated to covering every  aspect of life in a place of extraordinary beauty. It is a pleasure to  congratulate the two outstanding journalists who have guided the  Islander since its inception, publisher Alan Baker and editor Earl  Brechlin, for being recognized with the 2017 Sunbeam Award from the  Maine Seacoast Mission.   The recipient of numerous State and national awards for excellence,  the Mount Desert Islander is a great example of the value provided by  community newspapers. From Acadia National Park, local government, and  businesses, to education, sports, and the arts, the Islander's  dedicated staff writes the history of their communities as it occurs.  They keep people informed and help them be more involved as citizens.  They follow State and national issues, always with an eye on how they  affect their neighbors.   This dedication starts with committed leadership. After achieving  success in journalism and publishing in Philadelphia and New York City,  Alan Baker returned home to Maine and, in 1986, joined the Ellsworth  American's management team, eventually purchasing the newspaper. In  this age of media consolidation, Mr. Baker strongly believes that  newspapers should be owned by individuals who are in touch daily with  the readers they serve. As a former member of the Maine State  Legislature, he is an effective voice for accountability and  transparency in all levels of government.   A former ``Maine Journalist of the Year,'' Earl Brechlin has covered  Mount Desert Island for more than 35 years, and he has been recognized  with more than 100 awards for news, feature writing, and photography.  His commitment to journalism is evident in his election as president of  both the Maine and New England press associations. A Registered Maine  Guide, Mr. Brechlin is the author of nine books that reflect his love  for our State's natural beauty, history, and character.   The Maine Seacoast Mission is a nondenominational, nonprofit  organization founded in 1905 to support island and coastal communities  in Downeast Maine, and its boat, the Sunbeam V, helps to connect people  in those communities with essential services and with each other.  Through their dedication to the craft of journalism, Alan Baker and  Earl Brechlin have strengthened that support and those community  connections, and the Sunbeam Award is a fitting recognition of their  many contributions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my  friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, in introducing  the Reach Every Mother and Child Act of 2017. Our legislation would  make it the policy of the United States to lead an effort to end  preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children in the  developing world by 2030.   Due in part to American leadership and generosity, many lives have  already been saved. Since 1990, the annual number of deaths of children  under the age of five has been cut in half. Nevertheless, far too many  mothers, newborns, and young children under the age of five still  succumb to disease and malnutrition that could easily be prevented, if  only we could reach the mothers and children with simple, proven, cost- effective interventions that we know will help them survive.   Every day approximately 800 women will die from preventable causes  related to pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, more than 16,000  children under the age of five will die each day of treatable  conditions such as prematurity, pneumonia, and diarrhea--with  malnutrition being the underlying cause in nearly half those deaths.   According to USAID, a concentrated effort could end preventable  maternal and child deaths worldwide by the year 2030; however, U.S.  leadership and support of the international community are critical to  success.   To achieve this ambitious goal, our bill would require the  implementation of a strategy to scale up the most effective  interventions to save as many lives as possible. This idea is central  to our bill. We do not have to guess at what interventions will work-- the reality is that more than 16,000 children under 5 years old die  each day of conditions we know today how to treat.   These life-saving interventions include clean birthing practices,  vaccines, nutritional supplements, hand-washing with soap, and other  basic needs that remain elusive for far too many women and children in  developing countries. This must change.   In addition, our bill would establish a Maternal and Child Survival  Coordinator at USAID who would focus on implementing the ten-year  strategy and verifying that the most effective interventions are being  scaled up in target countries.   The bill would also establish an interagency working group to assist  the Coordinator in promoting greater collaboration among all the  federal agencies involved in this effort.   To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill requires  that detailed reporting be published on the Foreign Assistance  Dashboard, where it can be assessed by the public, Congress, and non- governmental organizations to track the implementation of the strategy  and the progress being made.   Finally, our bill would encourage USAID to pay for successful  programs run by non-governmental entities. The message we want to send  to all our partners in the private sector, the non-profit sector, the  faith community, and in local and international civil society groups is  this: if you can figure out a way to increase the likelihood that  mothers and their children will survive childbirth and the first five  years of life, we want to reward you for your contribution.   Improving the health and well-being of mothers and children around  the world has far-reaching social and economic benefits as well. An  independent group of economists and global health experts from around  the world, known as the Lancet Commission, found that for every $1  invested in health initiatives in the developing world, there is a  return of $9 to $20 in growing the gross domestic product of the  country receiving the investment.   Other bipartisan initiatives, such as the successful President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by  President George W. Bush, demonstrate that results-driven interventions  can turn the tide for global health challenges. Applying lessons  learned from past initiatives, our bill would provide the focus and the  tools necessary to accelerate progress toward ending preventable  maternal and child deaths.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coons and me in supporting this  bill to save the lives of mothers and children around the world.
