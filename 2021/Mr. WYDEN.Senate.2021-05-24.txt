 Madam President, the Senate is now debating the nomination  of Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services.   This is clearly one of the most important healthcare jobs in America.  Ms. Brooks-LaSure brings decades of health policy experience to the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and I think it would be  fair to say that she has worked on healthcare from just about every  angle short of scrubbing into the operating room herself. I am going to  talk, in a minute, about her qualifications, but I also want, as we  start this discussion, to recognize that this is a job that requires  urgent, hands-on professionalism--exactly the kind Ms. Brooks-LaSure  brings to this.   We are, obviously, still working through enormous challenges on the  COVID-19 pandemic. There are efforts by colleagues on both sides of the  aisle on healthcare, and we, in particular, on this side want to expand  healthcare coverage, bring down the cost of prescription medicine, and  bring the Medicare guarantee into the 21st century. The American people  need a chief of Medicare and Medicaid as soon as possible, and blocking  this nomination slows down important work that needs to be done.  Senators on the other side have objected to moving forward with the  nomination. So I am going to talk for just a few minutes about these  concerns--but, first, a little bit more about Ms. Brooks-LaSure.   Starting out, she worked at the Office of Management and Budget on  Medicaid policy and the CHIP program, the Children's Health Insurance  Program. So she was, long ago, focused on trying to improve healthcare  for the millions of Americans who every single day walk an economic  tightrope in balancing the food bill against the fuel bill and the fuel  bill against healthcare costs. She was there for them.   She then moved to the House Ways and Means Committee as a senior  staff member. She helped to write portions of the Affordable Care Act  dealing with expanding coverage and updating the Medicare guarantee.   When the Affordable Care Act became law, she went to Health and Human  Services, and there she played an important role in implementing the  law. She was the leader in the effort to create marketplaces for health  insurance with strong, built-in consumer protections. She has been a  leader when it comes to defending and expanding women's healthcare  under the Affordable Care Act and other essential programs. After  leaving HHS, she went to the private sector and continued to work on  policies that expanded coverage and made healthcare more affordable.   Ms. Brooks-LaSure has the qualifications, the experience, and the  know-how to run Medicare and Medicaid, and there are absolutely no  questions about it.   Now, our colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, has raised objections  to moving the nomination forward. His objections relate to a decision  by the Biden administration to rescind a Medicaid policy waiver that  the Trump administration rushed to grant the State of Texas in mid- January. There are a few key points Members ought to understand about  this issue.   First, nothing is going to change for health providers and patients  in Texas for more than a year as a result of this decision. That means  there is plenty of time to work out a solution that doesn't get rushed  and follows the right process with public comment.   Second, Ms. Brooks-LaSure had nothing to do with the decision that  Senator Cornyn is unhappy about. She wasn't on the job when it was  made.   Third, she made clear in her Finance Committee hearing that she is  committed to working on a bipartisan basis with State officials, and  she said that to Senator Cornyn and to other Republican members on this  issue as well. She has the track record and the experience to get that  done.   I want to state again to our colleague from Texas and to every Member  of the Senate: I probably spent as much time as any Member of the  Senate working on the issue that the Senator from Texas is concerned  about, and that is the process for granting waivers. I authored what is  called section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act that was designed to say  that progressive States that, for example, wanted to pursue a public  option or aggregate Medicare and Medicaid money would have a chance to  do it as long as they would adhere to the guardrails. Conservative  States that sought to try their own approaches based on their ideas of  a conservative approach to healthcare could do it as long as they met  the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.    I want to state again to Senator Cornyn, as I did in the Senate  Finance Committee, that I am going to work very closely with him, after  we confirm this nominee, to address the issues that he discussed in the  committee that have concerned him.   To every Member who has issues with respect to waivers, I want each  to know that there will be bipartisan interest in trying to bring  people in their States together and adhering to the ideas in the  Affordable Care Act, which states that States are free to pursue their  own ideas for expanding coverage as long as they stay within the  guardrails of the program.   We understand that Democrats and Republicans aren't going to agree on  every health policy question. What I do know is that Ms. Brooks-LaSure  is going to be the kind of CMS Administrator who can bring two sides  together exactly as we envisioned in the Affordable Care Act with the  waiver law and exactly as I have committed to working with Senator  Cornyn on.   The Finance Committee has demonstrated that it can work together on  big issues. In 2017, the committee passed the CHRONIC Care Act, which  was a fundamental transformation of Medicare.   I have told my colleagues that back when I was director of the Gray  Panthers, Medicare was about acute care. There was Part A, which was  for hospitals, and Part B, which was for doctors. That was it. That was  Medicare. When I taught gerontology, the first question on an exam was,  What is the difference between Part A and Part B? That isn't Medicare  anymore. Medicare, today, is primarily about chronic disease: cancer  and diabetes and heart disease and stroke and chronic pulmonary  disease.   The Finance Committee wrote the CHRONIC Care Act on a bipartisan  basis. At that point, Chairman Hatch was chairman of the committee, and  I was the ranking Democrat. We worked in a bipartisan way, but the  Trump administration, after the retirement of Chairman Hatch, basically  put everything on the back burner.   When we confirm Ms. Brooks-LaSure--and I am convinced that she is  going to be confirmed--she will work with Democrats and Republicans to  [[Page S3326]]  make sure we are updating the Medicare guarantee for this century. In  particular, what that involves is making sure that there are more  opportunities for those who receive traditional Medicare to get the  benefits of the CHRONIC Care Act. Already, the CHRONIC Care Act works  well for what is called Medicare Advantage. We need to do more to make  sure it is available for those who receive traditional Medicare.   Now, there are other issues the Finance Committee is working on that  Ms. Brooks-LaSure will play an important role in--one being improving  mental healthcare because mental healthcare has gotten short shrift in  America for far too long. We know that Americans feel like they are  getting mugged when they walk into a pharmacy and go to the window to  get their prescription medicines. Look, for example, at insulin.  Insulin prices have gone up twelvefold in recent years. The drug is not  12 times better. It is the same drug, but they are getting clobbered  because the pharmaceutical companies can get away with it. So those are  the kinds of practices that Ms. Brooks-LaSure is going to take on, and  she is going to do it in a bipartisan way.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is right at the center  of taking on these and other important healthcare challenges. This  critical Agency--one of the most important places in American  healthcare--needs a leader, and it needs one now. She is, in my view,  an excellent nominee. She is going to work with both sides here in the  Senate, including on the issue our colleague Senator Cornyn has raised.  I want to restate my interest in working with both Ms. Brooks-LaSure  and Senator Cornyn on this matter my colleague from Texas has raised.   We are going to be voting in a couple of minutes, colleagues, and I  urge a strong vote for an eminently qualified nominee, Ms. Chiquita  Brooks-LaSure.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  members from my personal office and Committee on Finance teams be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Congress: Jake  Pasner, Jonathan Beier, Erik Schnotala, Raghav Aggarwal, and Marisa  Dowling.
