 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protect and  defend our DREAMers.   Now that President Trump has failed all of us by rescinding DACA,  Congress must now move immediately to protect these courageous,  patriotic DREAMers like my constituent and aspiring cardiovascular  surgeon, Cinthya Moran.   Cinthya just wants an opportunity to contribute to her community, and  in her own words: ``We are only here to contribute to this amazing  country.''   Like Cinthya, all DACA recipients are our friends, they are our  neighbors, they are soldiers on the battlefield, they are new  homeowners, they are entrepreneurs, they are students.   I urge my colleagues to support our DACA constituents and pass  legislation that protects these brave young people, and I ask you to do  that as soon as possible.                            ____________________
