 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about yet another  healthcare debate we are having here in the Senate. As many people know  and have been following this over the last number of months, we had a  long debate and then a vote here at the end of July. At that point,  despite all of the conflict and all of the debate and arguing about  healthcare for not just months but for years, we moved to a new  chapter, and that new chapter for a number of weeks has been very  positive.   When I went home to Pennsylvania, I went to 32 counties in the month  of August, and in a lot of those counties, I tried to give a bit of  good news on healthcare despite all of the conflict about it. I was  able to say that since July 28, when the vote was held, we have had  very positive bipartisan discussions. I was part of several of them.   The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee--the so-called HELP Committee--Senator Lamar Alexander from  Tennessee, announced, in agreement with Senator Patty Murray of  Washington, that they were going to preside over bipartisan healthcare  hearings in that committee--probably the first bipartisan hearings in a  long time. What that meant was that we were going to finally have  hearings and a thorough examination of a few issues, not a sweeping  bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and decimate Medicaid  the way the prior bills would have but take elements or pieces of some  of the challenges we have before us and try to fix those problems. That  took place over the last 2 weeks and was among the most positive  healthcare moments we have had in the Senate in a long, long time.   What did we do? Well, we were focused on making sure that the cost- sharing payments were made--hoping we can get a bipartisan bill on that  in the next couple of days--and focused on problems in the individual  market, real problems, serious attention to serious issues--not a game,  not a political exercise, not an ideological exercise; Democrats and  Republicans sitting down and working together in the HELP Committee to  solve some of--not all of but some of the problems in our healthcare  system. It has been a very positive development for the committee, for  the Senate, and for the Nation.   There is a little more good news. Both parties have come together to  make sure that the Children's Health Insurance Program continues. It is  one of the most important programs in Pennsylvania. These are  approximate numbers, but about 175,000 children in Pennsylvania get  their healthcare that way. So both parties came together on that as  well. It is very bipartisan. Since its enactment way back in the  midnineties, CHIP has been bipartisan. There have been a couple of  rocky roads here and there, but it has been mostly bipartisan for 20  years, and it will be again at this time in the Senate.   It is very personal to me. My father was the Governor of Pennsylvania  in 1992 when CHIP passed. I think we might have been the largest State  with a children's health insurance program, and those kinds of State  models became the basis for Federal legislation.   It is deeply personal to families across Pennsylvania who, absent the  CHIP program, would not have healthcare. The same is true of Medicaid,  which, of course, is a much bigger number. A lot of children in the  country have healthcare solely because of Medicaid, and some adults  have healthcare solely because of Medicaid--millions of them.   I think when we have these debates, we should remind ourselves about  the value, the importance, the significance of these programs and the  consequence of undermining them or wiping them out. In the case of  Medicaid, what some earlier versions of the Republican healthcare bills  would do would be to decimate Medicaid over time. Maybe not in year 1  or year 2, but over time they would have a terribly devastating impact  on Medicaid.   What is Medicaid? It happens to be the program through which 40  percent of all children get their healthcare and 60 percent of all  children with disabilities get their healthcare. About two-thirds of  nursing home care is paid for by Medicaid. Ask a family member who has  a loved one with a disability what Medicaid means to that family.  Medicaid is life or death.   I know we have debates around here where people talk about Medicaid  as if it is just another program, just another budget matter, just  another healthcare talking point. Well, one of the reasons these bills  have not passed is because a lot of Americans--Democrats and  Republicans and Independents out there far away from Washington-- realize what would have happened if we passed some of these bills, what  would have happened to the Medicare Program that covers more than 70  million Americans.   No one here would lose their healthcare, by the way. No Senator, no  House Member, or their families would lose their healthcare. But folks  here were perfectly willing to support legislation that would result in  millions--not a few million; double-figure millions--15 million, maybe,  would have lost their healthcare and Medicaid if these bills had passed  and several million more in the exchanges or otherwise.   That is what we were debating, but, as I said, since July 28, we have  had a lot of bipartisan moments and that is a good thing.   Where are we right now? Well, here is where we are: with a piece a  legislation--the shorthand is Cassidy-Graham, the two Senators who are  leading the bill. What would it do? Well, it would do a couple of  things that we should never allow to pass, in my judgment. It  establishes a per capita cap on Medicaid. That is a bad idea. We should  reject that. It ends Medicaid expansion as we know it, the part of  Medicaid that now covers 11 million people.    In the context of how difficult it is for States and counties and  communities across the country to deal with the opioid crisis, I hope  they don't say: We are going to pass a bill that will end Medicaid  expansion as we know it, because we know that the biggest payer--the  program that has the most impact on treating people who are in the grip  of the opioid epidemic, who are gripped by that addiction--Medicaid  expansion provides more help than any other program. At last count,  68,000 Pennsylvanians with an opioid issue got their help from Medicaid  expansion. Solely because of Medicaid expansion, they can get help for  opioids. So ending the Medicaid expansion as we know it is another bad  idea.   It rolls back protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.  I thought we settled this, that this would be a guarantee going  forward, that no matter what bill--Democratic, Republican, or  otherwise--we would make sure that was a national standard, that no one  had to worry about preexisting conditions again. Well, here we are  again concerned about what might happen as a result of this legislation  and what a State might do to take away the protections on preexisting  conditions because they waive it, and they are allowed to waive it  under these bills.   It allows States to impose burdensome work requirements as a  condition  [[Page S5818]]  of coverage. That is another result of the bill.   It takes coverage away from millions of Americans. We mentioned that,  but it bears repeating.   This isn't just a policy debate; this is about folks whom we all  represent. I represent families in Pennsylvania, many of whom wrote to  me, have contacted me telling me their stories. One of them was Pam  Simpson.   Pam is from southeastern Pennsylvania, Coatesville. Her son Rowan was  diagnosed on the autism spectrum a number of years ago. Prior to having  the protection of Medicaid--what we call in Pennsylvania Medical  Assistance--that family had a big challenge. Challenges continue even  after the coverage.   What Pam said to me in a letter was how much benefit there was to her  family in terms of getting the treatment and the help from Medicaid.  She said:         Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full-time       to support our family. We would be bankrupt or my son--    Meaning Rowan--       would go without the therapies he sincerely needs.    So here is a child who was 5 years old when he was diagnosed, and  here is a mother telling me that their lives are a lot better because  they have the protection of Medicaid because their son has a  disability. And there are a lot of families in which a child might have  more than one disability. And even some families who have wealth or  very good healthcare coverage still need Medicaid if they have a child  with a profound disability. So this isn't just about one group of  Americans; this cuts across all incomes, all regions, all parties, all  beliefs. That is what Medicaid does, because do you know what Medicaid  is? It is an American program.   We are the greatest country in the world. We have the strongest  economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the world. And  we can do all that and still have a program that says to any family who  has a loved one with a disability: We are going to help you. We don't  care where you live--we are going to try to help you because your  family member has a disability. If you are low income, we are going to  make sure your child has healthcare and gets all the excellent  screening and diagnoses that take place early in a child's life to  prevent disease, to prevent all kinds of challenges in the life of that  child, because we are a great country.   We are called America, and that is what America does--we take care of  people who need help. And if it costs some more, we find the money to  do it, just as we find the money to protect our security when we have a  conflict. We all come together as a country, and we protect the  country.   Well, it is about time that Washington came together to protect  people who have the benefit of a great program called Medicaid or other  healthcare programs because that is what a great country does.   If we do to Medicaid what some here have wanted to do, we will be  diminished as a country. We will all be diminished. Do we want to live  in a country where we just had 20 million people gain healthcare  coverage and go backward, have more people without health insurance,  have more children lose their Medicaid coverage? Is that the country we  want to be? I don't think so. I don't think any Republican believes  that, and I don't think any Democrat believes that--if you call  yourself an American, because that is what America does. We take on big  challenges and we solve problems.   Medicaid is not the problem here. We have problems in our healthcare  system; Medicaid is not one of them. Medicaid is helping a lot of  people, and we are going to protect it.   This idea that we have come together in the HELP Committee on fixing  the parts of the system that we have to fix and doing a thorough  examination and having hearings--isn't that a radical idea? I just  heard in the last couple of hours that there is a healthcare hearing on  Monday. Oh my goodness. Isn't that wonderful? So there will be a  hearing on Monday, and I guess they want to pass the bill on Thursday.  That is what counts for thorough examination or regular order on one of  the most complicated challenges we have? Why don't they agree to do it  the way Lamar Alexander did, as the chair of the HELP Committee? He  said we are going to take these discrete, individual challenges and  examine them closely, come together on a bill, and then pass the bill,  and then we are going to move to the next problem and the next  challenge and solve them one at a time or two at a time, not take a  meat ax to Medicaid and hope it works out for people who don't have any  healthcare coverage. That is what a great Senate would do. We would  have months of hearings on this bill that some people want to pass by  the end of September.   But I will go back to the positive plane that we have been on. There  has been good work on the HELP Committee on some issues, good work on  the Finance Committee on the Children's Health Insurance Program  getting reauthorized. While all of that collaboration is going on, all  of those good discussions, all of that back-and-forth about policy, no  yelling, no screaming, no finger-pointing, all the while, just in the  last couple of days, this bill is moving through Washington quietly,  but it is moving and it is starting to pick up momentum, like a snake  in the grass. That is what this bill is--it is like a snake in the  grass. You may not see it yet, you may not know much about it, but it  is coming. And if they pass it next week, you may not feel the impact  in 2017, you may not feel the bite of that serpent in 2018, you may not  feel it in 2019, but you are going to feel it. And if we allow that  snake in the grass to inject its venom into people--my analogy for  losing your healthcare coverage--then we are not the Senate we should  be. We are not the government we should be.   We should be an institution--the U.S. Senate--that protects people  from those kinds of adverse consequences. And this bill is that kind of  a threat to people. It will bite, and that bite will have a lot of  venom.   Why do I say that? Well, think of what would happen to the Medicaid  Program. By one estimate, starting in 2027, funding would be cut off  completely, leaving 32 million Americans without access to health  insurance of any kind and leaving States with zero Federal dollars to  replace Medicaid expansion, marketplace tax credits, and cost-sharing  reductions. So please don't make the argument that Medicaid is going to  be just fine when you are block-granting it, which is a rather benign  description of giving a block of money to a State and hoping that it  works out, hoping that it is enough money or enough funding to pay for  that State's Medicaid needs.   What if you have more children with disabilities? What if that number  grows? This bill basically says to the State: Good luck, State. The  State has to balance its budget, by the way. The Federal Government  doesn't have to do that. The State has to balance its budget, and they,  by definition, will have to cap services and treatment to people with  disabilities. So that is what this is all about in the end. It is about  sending the problem back to the States and calling it flexibility.  Isn't that a nice word? All these benign words--flexibility, block  granting, per capita caps--all sound so benign. There is a lot of venom  in those policies.   What does it mean for one State? I will just give you one example. In  Pennsylvania, we had more than 700,000 people obtain health insurance  through Medicaid expansion--over 700,000 people. In the marketplace or  the exchange, there are another over 400,000 people. So more than 1.1  million people got healthcare in one State through Medicaid expansion  or through the marketplace.   How about rural Pennsylvania? We have 67 counties. How about the 48  rural counties in my State? How many people living in rural  Pennsylvania got healthcare? At last count, it was over 278,000  people--almost 280,000 people--and 180,000 obtained health insurance  through the Medicaid expansion. The balance was through the exchanges.  What are we going to say to rural Pennsylvania? I know 180,000 of your  neighbors, friends, and family members got health insurance through  Medicaid expansion, but we are going to wind that down, and you will be  just fine. Don't worry; Washington will guarantee that you are just  fine. That is a big lie, if you try to make that argument to rural  Pennsylvania and to other parts of our State as well.   What do we say to rural hospitals that have very thin margins  already?  [[Page S5819]]  Some of them are on the brink of having a major problem and depend upon  the support they get from Medicaid. In rural Pennsylvania we have a lot  of folks who have illnesses and challenges that maybe some of the rest  of us don't have. They tend to be older folks who have those  challenges, too. What do we say to them?   Are we saying to them that we are just going to wind down the support  that Medicaid provides in a State like Pennsylvania?   So my plea to my colleagues is this. Don't allow this snake in the  grass to get close to anyone and to bite them and to inject venom in  them. Don't allow that to happen. Don't allow this bill to rip away  healthcare from millions of people, just like the bill before that and  the bill before that. Work with people in both parties to do what we  are doing in the HELP Committee and, to a certain extent, although very  limited, in the Finance Committee. I think we have a good model to work  together, but I can't go back to Pam Simpson and say: Pam, you know  what; I know that you are happy with the Medicaid that Rowan is  receiving, and I know it is working out for you, but there are some  people in Washington who just had a different idea for you. So you are  on your own. You and your family are on your own.   I don't think that is what we do as Americans. Forget being Senators;  I don't think that is an American thing to do. We help people that need  help. All of us in our lives need help at some point or another. No one  is immune to some of these challenges.   I will just read one or two sentences from the end of the letter that  Pam Simpson wrote me months ago, in the earlier part of this year, when  she talked about how important Medicaid was to her. She is pleading  with me at the end of this letter to protect her son and to protect her  family. I would just ask that my colleagues consider this when they are  considering how to vote.   Pam talked about all the benefits that Medicaid provides her son  because of his disability and her family. She said: Please think of  Rowan, my son. Please think of my husband and me, she said. But here is  how she concludes:         Please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna--    That is Rowan's younger sister--       who smiles and laughs at her brother daily. She will have to       care for Rowan later in her life after we are gone. Overall,       we are desperately in need of Rowan's Medicaid assistance and       would be devastated if we lost these benefits.    I hope we can all say to Pam Simpson and her family and to any family  who benefits from Medicaid or Medicaid expansion or the protections of  the Affordable Care Act that we are guaranteeing that you are going to  have those protections. We are going to guarantee that those  protections are going to be there for you.   Hopefully, every Member of the Senate can say that and vote in  accordance with that promise. I would use an old expression and ask  Members of the Senate to examine their conscience. Is this what you  want people to remember you for--this kind of vote, where Rowan's  mother has to worry, Rowan has to lose his Medicaid coverage, a poor  child in a big city has to lose their healthcare coverage, or a child  in a rural area or someone working at a rural hospital loses their job  because of these massive ideologically driven cuts to Medicaid?   I hope you can answer the call of your own conscience when you vote  that way.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Hawaii.
