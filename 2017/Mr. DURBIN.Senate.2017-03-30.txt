 Mr. President, most Americans agree--and I think last  week's vote in the House indicated--that there is something special  about healthcare. This just isn't the right of every American to own an  SUV; it is the right of every American to have access to healthcare.  That is really at the heart of our healthcare debate.   There are some who believe that health insurance ought to be another  product on the shelf, and if you have enough money, you can buy it. But  there are others, like me, who believe it is more fundamental.   Healthcare in America, as far as I am concerned, should be a right-- not a privilege, a right--so that it doesn't go just to wealthy people.  Everyone should have that peace of mind.   I have told the story many times on the floor of the Senate--and many  of us are products of our own life experience. My wife and I got  married when I was a student in law school here at Georgetown, in  Washington. God sent us a beautiful little girl right away, but she had  some medical problems--serious ones--and I didn't have any health  insurance. I was a law student, had no real income, a wife, and a baby  with a medical problem.   I ended up sitting in the charity ward of the local children's  hospital with a number in my hand, waiting to see who would come  through the door to provide me with healthcare for my little girl. I  had never felt worse in my life as a father, as a husband, to think  that I had reached this point where I didn't have health insurance, and  I wasn't sure that I was bringing the very best medical care to my  little girl.   Well, I never forgot that experience in the many years since, and I  never will. I don't believe anybody should be sitting in that chair,  worried because they don't have health insurance--whether they have the  kind of healthcare that their family needs.   I think that is at the heart of this debate on our healthcare system  in America and its future. What we are talking about today is part of  it, as well, because we had decided 40 years ago--maybe more--that we  were going to make sure, if you were poor in America, as a woman, you  would still have access to basic healthcare. Poverty would not exclude  you from healthcare. So we created this title X program to provide  healthcare primarily for low-income families but for women and  children. The services that are provided are basic life-and-death  services--everything from breast and cervical care screening, high  blood pressure screening, anemia, diabetes testing, and so on.   There is not much debate as to whether we should provide those  services, but you know what this is all about. It is not about what I  just read. It is about family planning, and it is about abortion. That  is what this is really all about.   The Republicans who are voting to deny women access to healthcare are  saying: We are doing this to reduce the incidence of abortion.   There is something they should admit: You cannot spend one penny of  Federal money for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest,  or where the life of the mother is in danger. Not here in the United  States, not overseas.   What they say instead is: Well, we don't want to provide any money to  any place that might use their own funds for abortion services, like  Planned Parenthood. So we have this amendment before us.   For thousands of women and families in my State of Illinois, as  Senator Murray has explained, it means the Republicans--who were all  for choice in  [[Page S2133]]  healthcare--don't want women of limited means to have their ultimate  choice of Planned Parenthood for their services. So the Republicans  have brought in the Vice President of the United States to vote in the  Senate Chamber.   For those who are following the Senate, that doesn't happen very  often. It has to be a big deal. And it must be a big deal to the Vice  President and to the Republican Party to bring back one of our  colleagues, who has been on the mend from medical care, and to bring in  the Vice President to make that difference.   Their argument is: Well, we are just trying to reduce the number of  abortions.   Well, if you have taken anything beyond Birds and Bees 101, there are  some things that you might know. We had a study in St. Louis that was  reported in 2012 that tells many people who are at least aware of the  basics of how children are born something that we knew already and knew  intuitively. Here is what it found:         The abortion rate in the St. Louis area declined by more       than 20 percent from 2008 to 2010, coinciding with a research       study that gave free birth control to thousands of area       women.        Although the drop in abortions in St. Louis cannot be       attributed solely to the project, the abortion rate for the       rest of Missouri--    Not in the study--       remained constant.        Contraception is key to reducing unintended pregnancies and       abortions, said Dr. Jeff Peipert. ``We need to remove cost       barriers,'' Peipert said. ``I think all women should have       equal access.''        Teenage participants--    In this study--       experienced a birth rate of 6.3 babies per 1,000 girls,       compared with the national rate of 34.3, according to the       study published . . . in the journal Obstetrics and       Gynecology.        There were an average of six abortions a year for every       1,000 women in the project, compared with the national rate       of 20.    Coincidence? I don't think so.   When you make family planning accessible to potential mothers and to  the families, people are educated and make informed choices. There are  fewer unplanned pregnancies. There are fewer teenage pregnancies. There  are fewer abortions.   So the Republicans, by reducing the access of women to clinics and  agencies that are providing family planning, reduce the likelihood they  will get the information they need and the likelihood that abortions  will increase--exactly the opposite of what they say they are trying to  do.   Common sense dictates that--whatever your position is on abortion and  choice--if you believe that an uninformed and uneducated young mother  is the right person to make this decision as to whether they are going  to have a family, I think you understand what all of us do:  Information, assistance, and quality healthcare is critically important  for women to make the right choice for themselves and their families  and to avoid unplanned pregnancies.   We are now experiencing the lowest rates of unplanned pregnancies in  the United States in the last 30 years and the lowest incidence of  teenage pregnancies in the last 30 years, and the abortion rate is  going down. It works. It is connecting.   This vote that the Republicans are forcing us to take--which the  President, I am afraid, would sign, if it were sent to his desk--really  gets at the heart of the issue. If you want to reduce the number of  abortions in America, if you want to make them safe, legal, and rare,  as they say, for goodness' sake, provide basic family planning  information and services to women who otherwise might not have it.   This is a war against Planned Parenthood and a few other facilities  that is mindless. It really is stopping information from people who  desperately need it. Without that information, there will be bad  results--bad results that often lead to abortions.   So I would just say flat out that we don't talk a lot about the A- word, ``abortion,'' on the floor, but that is really what is driving  this debate. That is what is really behind it.   I hope that one more Republican colleague will decide that if you are  truly against abortion, you should be in favor of family planning and  giving basic information and counseling to young women who need it.  That was proven in St. Louis. It is proven by our human experience. I  hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this effort.   I thank the Senator from Washington for leading this debate on the  floor.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for 7 years, Republicans in Congress have  promised to ``repeal and replace ObamaCare,'' but not once during those  7 years did they actually put together a piece of legislation to make  good on that promise.   Not once during those 7 years did Republican leaders actually convene  serious hearings and meetings with patients, hospitals, insurers, and  medical groups to discuss how best to reform our healthcare system,  instead preferring to just rail against the law.   Not once during those 7 years did congressional Republicans actually  try to sit down with Democrats and work on a bipartisan basis to  improve upon the law.   But here is what they did do: They did everything possible to gum up  the works, with many Republican Governors even refusing to expand  Medicaid, denying millions of their constituents access to healthcare.   They went on TV, did interviews, and held campaign rallies about how  all of  [[Page S2147]]  the challenges facing our healthcare system, challenges that we faced  even before we passed the ACA, was the fault of ObamaCare and made  empty promises about ``repeal and replace.''   Congressional Republicans voted over 60 times to repeal the  Affordable Care Act when they knew President Obama was in office and he  would veto repeal--60 times.   Now, with Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, the White  House, you know what they are doing? Nothing--they cancelled their vote  last Friday to repeal the law.   Why? As evidenced last week, they are incapable of developing a  proposal that garners the support of their own Republican Caucus. They  are incapable of bringing a piece of legislation to the House Floor for  a vote, despite having a large Republican majority in the House.   Now, after 17 legislative days of trying to ram through a bill that  would have thrown at least 24 million people off their health  insurance, reduced protections for 178 million people who have  employer-based coverage, increased costs for seniors and rural  communities, and given a huge tax break to drug companies and the  wealthiest Americans, Republicans are giving up.   Time to move on, they say; time to tackle tax reform, they say.   Well, I, along with the majority of Americans who have benefited from  this law, am relieved.   The Affordable Care Act is not perfect--no law is.   It made sure 20 million more Americans could get health insurance,  including 1 million Illinoisans. As a result, our uninsured rate is at  its lowest level in our Nation's history.   Young people are staying on their parents' plans till age 26, and  seniors are seeing big savings on their prescription drugs.   Women can no longer be charged more than men for the same coverage,  and people with preexisting conditions can no longer be discriminated  against.   Annual and lifetime caps on benefits are a thing of the past, and  people now have access to maternity and newborn care, as well as mental  health and substance abuse treatment.   Now that Republicans have acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act  is, as Speaker Ryan stated, ``the law of the land . . . for the  foreseeable future,'' it is time to start building off of it.   Like Medicare and Social Security before it, it is time to make some  bipartisan modifications that can help improve the law.   We need to increase insurer competition because, in too many of our  communities, there are not enough options.   We need to address individual market premium increases because, for  too many of our constituents, an affordable health plan is still out of  reach.   I, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, have put forth ideas  to deal with some of these issues.   I support the creation of a ``public plan,'' which would both  increase competition in areas that are lacking and drive down premiums  since, as Medicare has demonstrated time and again, the Federal  Government can be more efficient than private for-profit companies.   I support legislation to bring down the high cast of prescription  drugs, which are driving up premiums for families nationwide.   BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois now pays more for prescription drugs  than they do on inpatient hospital costs, and they readily admit that  drug costs are contributing to premium hikes.   We need to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. We need to end  ``pay for delay'' agreements and get cheaper drugs on the market  quicker. We need to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising. We need  more transparency into how drug prices are set, and we need penalties  on drug companies that gouge the American public.   I also support enforcing portions of the law that Republicans have  sabotaged and undermined since its inception. We need to allow the  ``risk corridor'' program to operate unimpeded. We need to expand  Medicaid in all States, especially since we know that premiums are  highest and competition lowest in nonexpansion States, and we need to  enforce the law--which is why the very first order of business going  forward must be for President Trump to rescind the Executive order he  issued on January 20.   The President's order directed the heads of all Federal agencies  responsible for implementing and enforcing the Affordable Care Act to  stand down, to not implement the law, to not enforce the law.   Now that the page has hopefully been turned on the ugly ``repeal''  chapter of this saga, it is time for the President and his  administration to faithfully implement, enforce, and help improve this  law.   I am calling on the President and congressional Republicans: Now is  the time to stop undermining the law that is enjoying record support  from Americans.   Now is not time to throw sand in the law's eyes, put a spoke in its  wheel, and then turn around, gloat, and blame Democrats when it does  not function properly.   The Affordable Care Act while championed by Democrats and President  Obama, included over 100 Republican amendments and, for better or  worse, borrowed heavily from Republican ideas for the marketplace.   Let's end these partisan games.   This law--the good and the shortcomings--is on all of us to improve.   Democrats have ideas, but we cannot do it alone. Remember, the  Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White House.   They are in charge. If improvements are going to be made, Republicans  are going to have to get serious.   Now that the half-baked repeal effort has collapsed, my hope is that  Republicans will finally be willing to sit down and work with  Democrats. I know I am ready to pull up a chair.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week in testimony to the House  Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Comey confirmed what many of us  have been urging for months: the need for an independent commission to  look into the Russian act of cyber war on our election and any possible  collusion with members of the Trump campaign.   Comey confirmed that the FBI was ``investigating the nature of any  links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the  Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the  campaign and Russian efforts.''   He continued that FBI agents would pursue the investigation ``no  matter how long that takes.''   This is incredible. I am not surprised, but it is incredible. Our  Nation's top law enforcement agency is investigating possible links  between those involved in President Trump's campaign and a foreign  adversary known to have conducted an aggressive intelligence operation  to help him get elected, and all the while, this President continues to  deny any such attack, praise the dictator who launched the attack, and  pursue policies that mirror those of the attacker, including the  weakening of the Western security alliance.   Yet what has been the priority of the majority party amid this  mounting and serious breach, one we already knew about 5 months ago?   Has it been to set up an independent commission to look into this  unprecedented threat to our Nation and democracy? No.   Has it been to work with the White House to disclose all information  in an open and transparent manner to clear up any concerns or  suspicions? No, in fact the opposite--we still haven't even seen the  President's tax returns to get answers on Russian money in his  businesses.   Has it been to pass sanctions on Russia for its attack on our Nation?  No.   Has it been to pass meaningful cyber security legislation,  legislation blocked by the majority in the last Congress to make sure  our next elections in less than 2 years are secure from attack? No.   So what has been the priority instead? Well, last week, the majority  voted to make it easier to kill baby bears and their mothers in their  dens. The majority also reversed internet privacy protections for  consumers. A few weeks ago, the majority voted to reverse a law to help  mitigate corruption in some of the world's most impoverished nations.   Of course, the majority failed to advance TrumpCare, which would have  [[Page S2148]]  stripped 24 million Americans of healthcare, a cruel bill that would  have disproportionately hurt those who voted for President Trump.   This is a dereliction of our responsibility here in the Congress. Not  one of these issues is more important than getting to the bottom of  possible collusion with the Russians or of the possibility that some in  the White House have been compromised by a foreign government.   I want to praise the few on the majority side who have spoken out on  the need for an investigation, including Senator Graham and Senator  McCain. They noted early on the need for an independent investigation.   Today a majority of Americans also want an independent commission. I  am again calling for the same. We need an independent commission, one  led by American statesmen or women of unquestioned reputation, say  Sandra Day O'Connor or Colin Powell.   We did this after the attack of September 11, and this attack and its  unanswered questions demand nothing less again today.                            ____________________
