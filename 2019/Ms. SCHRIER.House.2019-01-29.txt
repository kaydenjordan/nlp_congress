 Madam Speaker, today is different because today I would  like to honor my father, Joel Schrier, who celebrates his 80th birthday  this weekend.   He grew up in the Bronx in a one-bedroom apartment with his parents  and his three siblings, including his twin sister, Gloria, who will  also celebrate this weekend.   He went on to study physics and work as an aerospace engineer, marry  my mom, Joan, in 1964, and be a phenomenal father to my brother, Marc,  and me. He was engaged and involved in our upbringing at a time when  most fathers weren't. He taught me to bike and skate, showed me how to  make the best French toast from Friday night challah, and inspired me  to study physics. When I was diagnosed with diabetes, he helped me with  shots and checking my blood sugar levels. Weekends were always for  family. And for that, mom, Marc, and I are deeply grateful.   Of course, it is the values that he and mom instilled in me that  really led me to run for Congress. A strong sense of justice and  fairness, and an ethic that if something is wrong in the world, you do  something about it: to be an upstander and not a bystander.   So, Dad, thank you, and happy birthday. We love you.                            ____________________
