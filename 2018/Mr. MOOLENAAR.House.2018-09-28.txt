 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the members of the  Michigan delegation and the House of Representatives for their support  and unanimous passage of my legislation earlier this month to rename  the Beaverton Post Office in honor of the late Colonel Alfred Asch.   Alfred was born and raised in Beaverton, and, as a young boy, he was  fascinated by aviation. In September of 1941, after graduating high  school, he entered the Army Corps. He flew more than 70 missions over  north Africa and Europe, earning numerous decorations, while  documenting his experiences in letters to Naomi, his girlfriend and  wife-to-be. He continued to serve in the Air Force until 1968, and he  made contributions to military and civilian flight.   His work took him away from Michigan, but he always kept his hometown  in his heart. He funded a scholarship at Central Michigan University  for students from Gladwin County, and proceeds from his memoir helped  fund the Beaverton Activity Center.   I am proud to have the support of Colonel Asch's family and his two  sons, David and Peter, who have said their father's childhood in  Beaverton helped him face life's early challenges before taking on the  world.   Alfred Asch was a great American and a hometown hero for Beaverton,  Michigan.                            ____________________
