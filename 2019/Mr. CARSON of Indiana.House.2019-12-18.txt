 Madam Speaker, as we continue and consider  this historic impeachment vote, let's be clear that the President's  actions seriously jeopardize not only America's national security but  the security of our closest allies. His actions threaten the goals of  the U.S.-led NATO alliance.   You see, Ukraine is a nation working hard to make its democracy  stronger. Make no mistake, Ukraine is on the front lines of Russian  aggression. Thankfully, U.S. military aid helps Ukraine defend itself  against Russia and integrate itself into the European community.   When our European allies are stronger, America is stronger. We are  better equipped to promote democracy and put a stop to tyranny.   But, Madam Speaker, to President Trump, strengthening this valuable  national security objective was not as important as smearing a  political rival.   Madam Speaker, we know that he held nearly $400 million of aid to  Ukraine until President Zelensky agreed to help him dig up dirt on his  potential 2020 opponent.                                time  1715    This aid was approved by Congress with strong bipartisan support.   President Trump's actions hurt American diplomacy and undermine the  integrity of our Nation's promises to our allies. We will not allow our  leaders to trade away our national security.   We cannot allow Russia's continued threats to democracy to go  unanswered, and we must not allow our own President of these United  States to get away with breaking his own oath of office.   Madam Speaker, that is why we take this solemn but necessary vote to  impeach.
