 Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment,  sponsored by my colleague and fellow farmer, Mrs. Spartz. The amendment  states that none of the funds made available by this bill may be used  to carry out commodity checkoff programs.   These may have started out as well-intentioned, but it is pretty well  known in Washington, D.C. that this program has gone rotten, and it no  longer serves farmers. In fact, we have just sent a bipartisan letter  from Senators and Members of this House to Secretary Vilsack reminding  him that the USDA is required to report annually to Congress,  describing activities conducted accounting for the receipt and  disbursement of all funds and including an independent analysis of the  effectiveness of the program. Yet the USDA hasn't submitted this report  since 2019.                                time  0120    Yet, the USDA hasn't submitted this report since 2019. Since that  time, American dairy farmers have paid nearly a billion dollars into  this promotional program. At the same time, we have witnessed the loss  of more than 6,000 dairy operations across our communities.   Let me talk about the Beef Checkoff program. In 2010, an independent  audit examining the equivalent of just 9 days of Beef Checkoff program  spending found that the primary Beef Checkoff contractor, the National  Cattlemen's Beef Association--that is right; I am calling out names-- had improperly spent more than $200,000 in checkoff dollars on lobbying  and overseas vacations.   Despite a Freedom of Information Act request and complaint, a full  audit has not been released to the public. Additionally, this  organization, NCBA, gets 70 percent of its revenue from the checkoff  program. They are prohibited from lobbying, but they are one of the  biggest lobbyers up here in Washington, D.C. They lobby against things  that are antithetical to cattlemen. For instance, they were up here  lobbying with the money paid to them by the cattlemen against country  of origin labeling.   They represent less than 5 percent of the industry. It is time to put  them back to work for farmers. It is time to adopt Mrs. Spartz'  amendment.    Madam Chair, as a cattleman myself who interacts with and  supports thousands of cattlemen in Kentucky, I rise in support of Ms.  Hageman's very important amendment, which prevents funds from being  used to mandate electronic identification ear tags for cattle and  bison.   The cattlemen in Kentucky know this isn't just another extra expense  for them. It is the beginning of the end of the American rancher, of  the American cattleman. It is the beginning of the end of  multigenerational farms in Kentucky because this is an on-and-off  switch that will prevent farmers from marketing their cattle if they  are not in compliance with thousands of rules, a never-ending list of  rules. This is why we should oppose it.   We should quit listening. I implore my colleagues who have been  lobbied on this issue--we have all been lobbied on this one. I implore  my colleagues to quit listening to the lobbyists who pretend to  represent farmers and start listening to their farmers back home and  support Ms. Hageman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  states, ``None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to  fund any grant related to any transgenic edible vaccine.''   Does the term transgenic edible vaccine sound farfetched? Well, it is  not. We are funding it.   In fact, scientists from the University of California, Riverside,  funded with your taxpayer dollars, have been studying whether they can  turn edible plants such as lettuce and spinach into mRNA vaccine  factories, thereby creating a transgenic edible vaccine.   One associate professor at UCR explained that ``Ideally, a single  plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person. We are  testing this approach with spinach and lettuce and have long-term goals  of people growing it in their own gardens. Farmers could also  eventually grow entire fields of it.''   I don't think this is a good idea.   I don't think the American people should be funding this, and I would  hope that we have learned something from the COVID experience with  SARS-CoV-2 that some of our science projects aren't the best ideas.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, my colleague on the other side of the aisle  talks about keeping prices low. I think there is more to it than that  for the American people. He also speaks as if these vaccines, these  transgenic edible plant vaccines, are only used for livestock.   Well, in fact, they have been used for livestock--I will get to that  in a second--but they are also being used for people. That is the  intended outcome of many of these programs that we are funding with  money from the USDA.   What could possibly go wrong with this research?   Well, we found out a few years ago when a biotech company was  experimenting, growing, in corn, a vaccine to keep pigs from getting  diarrhea.   What happened? Well, the next year where the corn was grown the prior  year, the corn came up and it got commingled with soybeans that were  being grown there.   It contaminated 500 bushels of soybeans, which were then commingled  with 500,000 bushels of soybeans. Those all had to be recalled and  destroyed.   Luckily, they caught it.   Do we want humans eating vaccines that were grown in corn meant to  stop pigs from getting diarrhea? I don't think we want that to happen.  Yet, that almost happened, and it could happen.   There is another case where the pollen cross-contaminated another  crop of corn, and 155 acres of corn had to be burned. What are the  cases where we are not discovering this?   I think it is dangerous to play God with our food. I think we need a  safe food supply.   Mr. Chair, this is about food safety. Ultimately, the people in this  country need to know what is in their food, and if we start  contaminating the DNA of our food with DNA from other animals or  viruses, the pollen could spread, and we don't know what could happen.   I would hope we have learned a lesson from the Wuhan lab that  sometimes things escape, sometimes things don't go as you plan. That is  why I think it is a bad idea to fund transgenic edible plant vaccine  research from the USDA.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  states in part that, ``None of the funds made available by this Act may  be used to issue any new rule related to (1) regarding the number of  owners of an animal for purposes of the custom slaughter exemption of  the Food Safety and Inspection Service; (2) limiting the persons that  may own an animal; or (3) requiring custom operators to keep records.''   My amendment simply states that no funds in this bill can be used to  create new rules and regulations related to the custom slaughter  exemption, limiting the number of people who may own an animal, or  placing additional recordkeeping burdens on custom slaughter exemption.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respectfully disagree with my colleague's  characterization of this amendment that it changes permanent law. In  fact, all it does is limits the spending that can be used to promulgate  any new rules. Its only period is for the extent of a year. The next  year, the next fiscal year.   In fact, were it changing permanent law, we would not have allowed it  as an amendment to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I serve on the Rules Committee, and we vet hundreds of  amendments for this very constraint. This is not one of the amendments  that changes permanent law.   If I could change permanent law, would I change permanent law? You  are sure right that I would, and we will try that in the farm bill, but  we can't change permanent law on an appropriations bill.   The reason I have introduced this amendment is I have found on the  USDA website, they haven't done the rule yet, but they are thinking  about doing a rule to limit how many families could share an animal.   Listen, there are four meat-packers that control over 80 percent of  the meat that is processed in the United States. Our President himself  said it from that very podium during a state of the Union speech. It is  a problem. We all know it.   There is one exemption that allows people to get out from under the  thumb of the multinational corporations that process most of the meat  in this country, and that is the custom slaughter exemption that allows  somebody who owns an animal to have it processed for themselves.   It seems somewhat ridiculous that the USDA thinks they have the power  to say two families can't share that animal. Yet, that is what they are  proposing in a PowerPoint slide on their website.   My amendment is simple. It says we are not going to allow the USDA to  promulgate a rule that keeps families from getting healthy meat from  their local farmer.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
