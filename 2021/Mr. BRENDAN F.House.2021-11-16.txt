 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the last  President made the term ``infrastructure week'' a running joke. Under  President Biden and Democrats in Congress, infrastructure decade is now  a reality.   That decade officially began yesterday afternoon when my colleague  and I and many others were over on the South Lawn of the White House to  watch President Biden sign into law this historic investment in our  Nation's infrastructure.   There are two points that I want to make about it. First, this was  absolutely needed. Both the International Council of Engineers as well  as the American Council of Engineers rated the state of America's  infrastructure anywhere as good as a C-minus to as bad as an F,  depending on the given year.   If you went back a century ago, the United States of America was the  unquestioned leader in infrastructure. That is how we were able to  build the American century. The fact that a century later we don't lead  in that area should bother all of us as Americans.   I want America to be number one. That is what we are called to do, to  lead. Yet, the state of our infrastructure over years and years and  decades had been allowed to fall behind. Well, not anymore. That is  point number one, that it is needed.                                time  1630    Point number two, what it will produce is jobs. Frankly, the  bipartisan infrastructure deal is a blue-collar blueprint for America.   My family's background is one that is typical of so many of us in  Philadelphia--blue-collar, working-class background. There used to be  jobs aplenty if you didn't have a college education, but the reality  is, as the United States and most of the West has transformed into a  knowledge economy, if you are a blue-collar American, the last several  decades have not been that good for you.   Well, here is a piece of legislation to address that, to create  millions of jobs that don't require a college degree.   I passionately believe, as cofounder and co-chair of the Blue Collar  Caucus, that it is not sufficient to say to a whole swath of Americans:  Well, if you don't have a higher education, too bad. Just go get  retrained, figure it out on your own.   That is not good enough. We are talking about millions and millions  of Americans who deserve to have family-sustaining jobs, who are smart,  who are hard working. They just need their government to invest more in  them, to create those opportunities.   Well, sure enough, that is exactly what this bill does. My colleague,  my fellow Pennsylvanian went down the list of the investments that we  are making: Roads, bridges, rail, mass transit, replacing lead pipes,  high-speed internet. The list goes on and on. It is an investment in  America and our people.   I am very proud that I voted in favor of this legislation, proud to  have worked with my colleagues and this President to make this a  reality.   And, finally, I do just want to pay a special thanks to the 19 Senate  Republicans and 13 House Republicans who did the right thing and joined  with us. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of votes for this  legislation came from Democrats, but it really says something in this  highly partisan time that we were able to get a significant number of  friends from the other side of the aisle to join with us and do the  right thing on this piece of legislation.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Yes.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Let's face it, we are in a  worldwide competition, especially against China. And let me be clear, I  am speaking about the Chinese Government, not its people. The Chinese  regime does not share our values. It is not committed to democracy. Far  from it. President Xi or dictator-for-life Xi actually challenges  whether or not democracy will survive. We know that China, through its  Belt and Road Initiative, is making infrastructure investments not only  in China but in other parts of the world because they want to gain a  foothold.   I feel passionately about this. As a proud American, I make no  apologies for the fact that I want us to be number one in the world.  But I believe that it is actually best, not just for the United States,  but best for all people in the world who yearn to breathe free.   This infrastructure bill will help us not just domestically, but I do  believe that as the United States grows, as we grow our economy, as we  make an investment in people for whom the modern economy has not  necessarily been a good deal, I believe we will help set a shining  example to the rest of the world.
