 Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 1789, according to a  story, there was a famine in France. The people didn't have enough  bread to eat, and they approached the queen, and they said: Queen Marie  Antoinette, the people do not have enough bread to eat.   According to the story, she said: Well then let them eat cake.   Showing the most callous disregard for what the lives of the people  actually was like, assuming that without enough bread to eat they  actually had cake lying around, that is ridiculous.   Mr. Speaker, that is almost certainly an apocryphal story; it didn't  really happen. But now, here, in America, we have a real-life American  Marie Antoinette.   Showing the most caviler disregard for the plight of the American  people, allowing UI to expire without negotiating, without talking,  without trying to extend relief, Senator Mitch McConnell, don't risk  letting our economy  [[Page H3993]]  slide into a Great Depression. Don't be Marie Antoinette.   Let's come to the table and get this done.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  combination of appropriations bills, this minibus.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss this CJS  component of the bill.   First, I would like to thank, again, our overall chairwoman of  appropriations for her amazing dignified service in the Congress and to  the Appropriations Committee.   I also want to express my appreciation to Chairman Jose Serrano,  whose leadership of CJS has been unmatched.   Thank you to the staff, Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford, T.J. Lowdermilk,  Shannon McCully, B.G. Wright, Faye Cobb, Trisha Castaneda, and also  acknowledge the good faith and the assistance of Ranking Member  Aderholt and the minority staff as well.   The fiscal year 2021 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill  includes a total of $71.473 billion in discretionary budget authority,  which is actually a $1.7 billion decrease below last year's level. This  reflects the natural decline in the funding requirement due to the  decreased needs associated with the completion of the 2020 Census.   But even at this overall funding level, the CJS bill sustains strong  increases to invest in jobs and economic  [[Page H4121]]  development, reduce gun violence, address climate change, sustain  scientific leadership in the world, and implement police accountability  and police reform.   On this last score, this bill takes immediate steps to start the  process of police reform and accountability and to better protect civil  rights. To do that, the bill increases funding for the Civil Rights  Division of the Justice Department, as well as for the U.S. Attorney  and the FBI to conduct pattern and practice reviews of law enforcement  agencies. We include language to roll back Justice Department policies  that have hindered this oversight.   The bill provides funding for a national task force on law  enforcement oversight and national police misconduct database.   In addition, the bill funds nearly $500 million in new grant programs  authorized in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. These grants  will help improve law enforcement practices and accountability by  funding State-level pattern and practice reviews and independent  reviews of law enforcement, as well as funding better training for  police community, organization efforts, and more.   Finally, we include sensible requirements for COPS and Byrne JAG  grants to implement numerous reform efforts at the local level. These  changes show that the Federal Government is deeply serious about  ensuring police accountability and protecting American civil rights.   The bill does these things without neglecting important priorities  elsewhere. We reject the administration's proposed cuts to climate  change research programs at NASA and NOAA and, instead, provide  responsible funding increases to that.   We promote jobs and better wages by supporting significant  investments at the Economic Development Administration, through the  Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and the Minority Business  Development Agency.   We help policing against gun violence by increasing ATF's budget by  $150 million, by sustaining funding for the NICS program and grants,  and by increasing funding for the STOP School Violence Act.   We promote criminal justice reform with large increases for both the  First Step Act and the Second Chance Act, and we increase funding to  address the ongoing opioid epidemic.   This bill also ensures that our Nation's scientific leadership in the  world can continue by increasing funding by $270 million for the  National Science Foundation, by $35 million for the core NIST  activities, and by over $101 million for NOAA.   We also include significant funding for the educational components of  NASA, National Science Foundation, and NOAA to ensure that we are  training the next generation of scientists in America to continue this  important work.   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, and more, I urge the adoption of  this minibus.
