 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Emily Aho  of Jaffrey as June's Granite Stater of the Month. Aho has stepped  forward and provided emotional support for healthcare workers on the  frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting our State's commitment  to the idea that every individual can make a difference in times of  critical need.   Aho is the executive director of the Newfoundland Pony Conservancy in  Jaffrey, a nonprofit organization that provides a safe living  environment for the endangered Newfoundland pony. Up until December  2019, Aho was also a registered nurse until some physical ailments made  it difficult for her to work in a hospital.   Shortly after her retirement, COVID-19 began to spread rapidly  throughout the United States, and Aho found herself feeling helpless as  she watched her loved ones succumb to the deadly virus, including her  father, a World War II veteran who was a guard during the Nuremburg  trials.   After her father's death, Aho went searching for her father's old  photos and memorabilia and found them in the closet where she also kept  her materials for equine-assisted learning. Her discovery of those  materials was an inspiration and a reminder that, despite her loss, she  had much to give.   Through a partnership with True Hope Therapeutic Horsemanship, Aho  helped establish the Heal the Heroes program, which provides free  therapeutic sessions with ponies and horses for healthcare workers who  have experienced heightened mental and physical challenges amid the  pandemic.   The healthcare workers visit Aho's conservancy once a week for 4  weeks, where they learn to communicate and connect with her  Newfoundland ponies. Due to social distancing guidelines, the program  can only take two people in one session, and all the equipment is  properly sanitized to avoid spreading the virus. After 4 weeks with the  Newfoundland ponies, the participants graduate to True Hope Therapeutic  Horsanship, where they continue therapeutic work with horses, both  ridden and unridden.   This pandemic has impacted people and organizations throughout our  State, including nonprofit organizations like the Newfoundland Pony  Conservancy that Aho operates. But despite her own financial struggles,  Aho still found a way to give back to her community and provide support  to those on the front lines of this crisis. Aho's empathy and  commitment to improving the mental wellness of her fellow community  members exemplifies the best of our State and what it means to be a  Granite Stater. I am honored to recognize her.                            ____________________
