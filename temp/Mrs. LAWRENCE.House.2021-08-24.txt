 Madam Speaker, like in many States, Republicans in  Michigan's legislature have introduced legislation to suppress the  right to vote. Make no mistake about it, the fundamental right to vote  in this country is under assault. That is why my dear friend, John  Lewis, once said: Voting is the most powerful, nonviolent tool we have  in our democracy.   Today, we fight back. Today, we have an opportunity to restore the  power of the vote. I urge my colleagues to support the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.
