 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment  being offered and in support of the underlying bill and the increased  oversight in transparency it provides to the body of the intelligence  community and the American public that it protects.   I thank the ranking member and also Chairman Goodlatte for allowing  me to have this time.   Mr. Speaker, I want Americans at home to know what this program is  not. It is not a dragnet surveillance program; it is not a program that  could ever be used to target Americans; and it is not an unchecked  intelligence tool. In fact, it may be one of the most heavily overseen  programs that we have. This bill strengthens that accountability.   As former ranking member of the Intelligence Committee and  Representative of the district that is home to NSA, I have taken many  of my colleagues in this Chamber on trips to NSA so that they can see  firsthand how these programs work to protect Americans and also to  protect our freedom and civil liberties.   This is not a debate on constitutionality. The Federal courts have  affirmed that this program's current authorization and operation are  legal and consistent with the Fourth Amendment. This body has voted  several times with bipartisan majorities to reauthorize it.
