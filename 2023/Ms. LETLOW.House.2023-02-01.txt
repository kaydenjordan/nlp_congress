 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Charles  MacDonald, an outstanding public servant who has left an incredible  legacy across the State of Louisiana.   Dr. MacDonald dedicated his career to education--working as a high  school teacher and principal before becoming an administrator at the  University of Louisiana Monroe.   After working 17 years on ULM's campus, Dr. MacDonald won a seat in  the Louisiana House of Representatives. While serving in the  legislature, he authored the bill that created the Taylor Opportunity  Program for Students, or TOPS, a scholarship program which has enabled  hundreds of thousands of Louisiana's best and brightest to obtain a  college education. I was fortunate to be one of the first recipients of  the program over 25 years ago.   To this day, Dr. MacDonald's work in higher education continues, as  he currently serves on the Louisiana Board of Regents.   He has been a mentor and friend to so many, including myself, helping  guide young educators on their career paths, and we are so thankful.   Mr. Speaker, today the House honors an outstanding Louisianian, Dr.  Charles MacDonald.                            ____________________
