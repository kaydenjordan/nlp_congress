 Mr. President, I realize the hour is late. I will move  quickly to my unanimous consent request, but I want to quickly state  that this is so important that this can't wait, and I am really asking  a pretty simple request of my colleagues that we stop playing games  with people's lives because it is well past time that we passed the  Right to Try. The Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and  Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018.   We passed this unanimously through the Senate in August. The House  has acted now. I am just asking my colleagues, please, these desperate  patients are terminally ill, and they have waited far too long.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 5247, which was received from the  House. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I do want to point out the fact that the  Right to Try bill only allows access to drugs that have already passed  phase 1 safety approval from the FDA. There has been an awful lot of  misunderstanding from that standpoint.   All we are asking is, what this bill would do is allow terminal  patients who have no other options--they have exhausted all treatment  options, they do not qualify for a clinical trial, they are near death  or, according to the House bill, subject to severely premature death.  It just gives those individuals the right to choose for themselves, not  have a faceless bureaucrat at the FDA make that decision.   We passed this unanimously from the good efforts of my colleague, the  Senator from Indiana, who will speak shortly, but also Senators  Alexander and Murray. We spent many hours in discussion crafting a bill  that passed unanimously.   By the way, that didn't surprise me because out of the 39 States that  passed Right to Try through their legislature, 38 have passed it and  signed it into law. Of the legislators who voted for Right to Try, 98  percent have voted yes. That is a vote tally of 5,604 to 126 because it  makes so much sense to give those terminally ill patients the freedom  to make those decisions themselves.   The good news is, the House passed the Right to Try bill--not  unanimously--with bipartisan support. The vote was 267 to 149, and 35  Democrats joined, most Republicans voting yes. A lot of that was due to  the good efforts from my Democratic colleague, the Senator from  Indiana.   I want to give a brief history on Right to Try in terms of my  involvement. I first went to the Goldwater Institute in 2014. They,  through their efforts, decided to go through the strategy of having  States pass it, and Colorado was the first State to pass Right to Try  in 2014.   Shortly after that meeting, I met a young mom, Trickett Wendler, a  mother of three children. She had ALS. I just mentioned the fact that I  had met with the Goldwater Institute, and I was fully in support of  Right to Try, and tears started streaming down the face of Trickett  Wendler. That is when I decided to become the champion and lead sponsor  of Right to Try in this body. Unfortunately, Trickett Wendler lost her  battle with ALS in March of 2015.    I want to briefly mention the other individuals for whom this bill is  named. Matt Bellina, a former lieutenant commander, Navy pilot, married  to  [[Page S1982]]  his wife Caitlyn Bellina, and he has three boys.   This is what Matt Bellina said in testimony:         Please let them know that I have had ALS too long to meet       the exclusion criteria for any promising trials. No drug       company will offer me treatments under the current expanded       access guidelines. Two reputable companies have already       indicated that they would try to treat me under the rules of       this bill. A vote against this is essentially a vote to kill       me. It is a vote to make my wife a widow and leave my boys       fatherless. I can't stop anyone from voting that way, but       please ask them to have respect to look my family in the eye       when they cast their vote.    Frank Mongiello is another victim of ALS. I just met with him a few  hours ago. I first met with him when he could speak--he can no longer  speak--but he spoke at our press conference, and here is his quote. He  paraphrased Abraham Lincoln and he said:         President Lincoln said, ``If I am killed, I die only once;       but if I dread it, I die over and over again.''    Frank went on to say:         I have an 80-percent chance to be dead in 2 years, and, for       me, seeing these potential drugs out on the market and not       being able to take them is like dying over and over again.    The final namesake of this bill is little Jordan McLinn. We met him  when he was 6 years old, and now he is 8. His mother Laura is a  tireless advocate. I know the Senator from Indiana knows the McLinns  well.   The FDA advisory committee on April 25 heard from, I think, 55  witnesses about a drug called eteplirsen to treat Duchenne's muscular  dystrophy. The advisory committee, having heard from people like Laura  and Jordan McLinn wanting access to that drug, voted no. Fortunately,  the FDA--and this is pretty rare--overruled the advisory committee, and  Jordan now is at least being treated. They are tireless advocates for  Right to Try.   These are the people we need to help. These are the people whom Right  to Try was meant for.   I don't know why it took the House 7 months to craft a bill and  finally vote on it. I can't tell you how many people during that 7  months sought treatment in other countries. I can't tell you if anyone  during that time period possibly lost their life because they didn't  have access to treatment. I don't know why the House felt compelled to  change the bill that we carefully crafted that passed unanimously. I  don't know why they simply didn't take up the Senate bill and pass it,  but I do know Right to Try saves lives.   I will quote one example, Dr. Delpassand, a courageous oncologist  from Houston. He was engaged in an FDA trial treating an aggressive  form of endocrine cancer. It was working. So he petitioned the FDA to  allow additional patients to be added to the trial. The FDA said no,  but Dr. Delpassand had a Right to Try bill in Texas. It didn't have  liability protection. He risked his career and all of his possessions  and he signed up additional people under the Texas Right to Try laws.   In the end, he signed up 176 people. We just checked with Dr.  Delpassand, and 148 of those individuals are still alive today because  of his courage. That is why we need to pass a Federal Right to Try law,  so individuals with that level of courage don't risk their careers, and  those patients have a chance to live.   I would like to yield to the Senator from Indiana for his remarks.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana who has  been a real champion and a real partner. I know he tried to get as many  House Members to vote for the House bill as he could.   By the way, that was the good news. I am calling on the House now,  since we have an objection in the Senate on their bill, to please take  up the Senate bill. It is a nonpartisan bill that passed unanimously  through the Senate. Don't wait another hour. I know they are in recess  for a couple weeks, but I am calling on them, as soon as they come back  from recess, take up the Senate bill, pass it, and get it on the  President's desk. It is well past time to give these patients, these  terminally ill patients and their families, the Right to Try and the  right to hope. So I want to again thank the Senator from Indiana.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of H.R.  4547 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the junior  Senator from Oklahoma be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or  joint resolutions from Friday, March 23, through Monday, March 26,  2018.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of  [[Page S1983]]  the Senate, the President of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and  the majority and minority leaders be authorized to make appointments to  commissions, committees, boards, conferences or interparliamentary  conferences authorized by law, by concurrent action of the two Houses,  or by order of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn, to then convene for  pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted, on the  following dates and times, and that following each pro forma session,  the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Monday, March 26  at 11:30 a.m.; Thursday, March 29 at 3:45 p.m.; Monday, April 2 at 12  noon; Thursday, April 5 at 11:30 a.m. I further ask that when the  Senate adjourns on Thursday, April 5, it next convene at 3 p.m. on  Monday, April 9; and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Boom nomination; finally, that notwithstanding the  provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motions filed during today's  session ripen at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 9.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:01 a.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 26, 2018, at 11:30 a.m.                            ____________________
