 Mr. Speaker, shooting swimming caribou from a  motorboat, bear baiting, dogs for black bears, using artificial light,  shooting wolf pups and bear cubs in their dens are outrageous practices  that were banned under a 2015 rule from the Obama administration, which  the Trump administration has now announced that it seeks to reverse.  This is absolutely outrageous.   Our national parks and reserves have always had special status, and  the Trump administration wants to roll that back, essentially making  them into game parks. It is important for people to reflect on what  this means.   Think about what goes on in Yosemite National Park or Yellowstone  National Park. Would that experience be enriched by having these  extreme hunting tactics to eliminate some of the top-line predators to  be able to have more things to hunt? Absolutely not. Three hundred  million people a year visit these national parks, and the draw is the  wildlife. National parks without animals is just scenery.   Mr. Speaker, it is important that people focus on why this is such an  outrageous policy. These are low-density animals with low reproductive  rates. In Alaska, there is no conflict with livestock. They have very  little interaction with people, other than the people who want to see  them.   Mr. Speaker, it is wrong on three fundamental levels.   First of all, it is just wrong. All animals suffer, and hunting them  down with these extreme methods is cruel and is repugnant to virtually  all Americans.   It is wrong ecologically. For millions of years, we have seen these  animals co-exist, and the national parks--like Yosemite or what is  happening in Alaska--are some of the few places where that ecological  balance continues to work. Human beings cannot improve upon it; they  can only damage that delicate balance.   It is also wrong economically. The economic impact for gateway  communities, for these 300 million tourists, is profound. If we are  going to turn these national treasures simply into game parks, hunting  preserves, they are going to lose their allure, the economic impact  will be dramatically diminished, as well as upsetting the ecological  balance, and the fact that it is morally wrong.   What we should be doing, in this Congress, is raising our voices in  outrage over the latest attempt by the Trump administration to roll  back sensible, commonly supported protections. And while we are at it,  not just raising our voices, but maybe taking some action on the floor  of this House on animal protection.   We have the animal cruelty PACT Act that has 282 cosponsors, which  could be on the floor Monday. The House Republican leadership has  refused to act on the PACE Act, the Parity in Animal Cruelty  Enforcement Act, which just got 359 votes on the floor of the House  with an amendment. Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, 246  cosponsors. The Pet and Women Safety Act, 248 cosponsors. The Shark  Finning Prohibition Act, 238 cosponsors. The Puppies Assisting Wounded  Servicemembers, providing service animals for our veterans, has a  majority of sponsors in the House of Representatives.   Why can't the Republican leadership allow us to debate and pass these  provisions to improve animal welfare and add our voices to the latest  outrage of the Trump administration in its assault on our animal  friends?                            ____________________
