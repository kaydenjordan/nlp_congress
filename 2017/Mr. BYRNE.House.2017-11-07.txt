 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life and  contributions of Judge Robert Lee Byrd, Jr.   Judge Byrd was born in Birmingham in 1932. He received his bachelor's  degree from Vanderbilt University in 1954, before attending the  University of Alabama School of Law.   He was in private practice in Mobile for over 20 years and was later  appointed circuit judge in Mobile County. Judge Byrd was a dedicated  member of the Mobile community. During my time as an attorney in  Mobile, I had the privilege of practicing in his court where he  conducted himself with immense dignity and professionalism. Judge Byrd  recently passed away, but his impact will live on.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Alabama's First Congressional District,  I want to share my deepest sympathies with his wife, Mary, and his  three daughters. Judge Byrd will never be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 607 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 607         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3043) to modernize hydropower policy, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill       for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill. The       committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against the committee       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be in order except those printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3441) to       clarify the treatment of two or more employers as joint       employers under the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair       Labor Standards Act of 1938. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       Education and the Workforce now printed in the bill shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce; and       (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 607 provides for  consideration of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of  2017, and H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act.   H.R. 3043 would modernize Federal regulatory permitting processes for  the licensing of hydropower projects. Specifically, the bill would  designate the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as the  lead agency for these projects.   I am a proud supporter of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that  allows for not only American energy independence, but for American  energy dominance.                                time  1230    Hydropower should be a part of that strategy. In the Pacific  Northwest especially, hydropower is a clean and reliable energy source  that is particularly abundant. There is remarkable potential for the  hydropower industry in this region and around the United States.   In 2015, hydropower accounted for approximately 6 percent of total  U.S. electricity generation and 46 percent of electricity generation  from renewable sources. However, less than 3 percent of dams in the  U.S. produce electricity. That shows just how great the potential is  here.   Through this legislation, we can help ease regulatory burdens and  streamline the permitting process by naming FERC as the lead agency for  coordinating all Federal authorizations. This will result in balanced  and more timely decisionmaking and reduce the current duplicative  oversight regime.   So how does this benefit the average American?   Well, having a reliable power source is essential to the world today.   Even more, this legislation also has the potential to lower energy  costs and create good-paying jobs. By doing so, we can help Americans  put away and keep more of their hard-earned money.   Currently, the hydropower industry employs a workforce of  approximately 143,000 people, and that number would certainly rise  under this legislation as we unlock our full potential.   Now, some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this  legislation could hurt the environment, so I want to address that.   First, hydropower is an entirely clean source of renewable energy.  Increasing hydropower production actually helps protect the environment  and promote better public health.   Second, the legislation makes clear that these permitting reforms  should have no effect on this Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife  Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors  Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Those laws and their  protections will remain in place.   This is simply about promoting a reliable power source, lowering  energy costs, creating jobs, and unlocking the full potential of an  all-of-the-above energy strategy.   Mr. Speaker, I will also note that this rule will provide for  consideration of four amendments to H.R. 3043, including one minority  and one bipartisan amendment.   The other bill covered by the rule is H.R. 3441, the Save Local  Business Act. As the sponsor of this legislation, I am thrilled to see  this body taking action to protect millions of jobs and provide clarity  to America's workers.   Jesus said that no man can serve two masters, and there is real  wisdom behind what He said as there is wisdom behind everything He  said. His teachings are important every day, but that basic principle  seems particularly important in the context of this legislation.   For decades, there was a commonsense legal test that determined when  two or more separate businesses could be considered joint employers and  held jointly responsible for the same group of employees. Employers had  to share direct and immediate control over essential terms and  conditions of employment. As a former labor and employment attorney who  practiced in this area for decades, I can assure you this was the  standard that everyone knew and appreciated.   Well, in 2015, the activist National Labor Relations Board issued a  ruling  [[Page H8536]]  in Browning-Ferris Industries that upended this cornerstone of Federal  labor law and created a vague and totally unworkable new joint employer  policy.   Making matters even worse and more complicated, Federal agencies then  incorporated the new standard in their regulatory agenda. Under this  new standard, two independent businesses could be considered joint  employers if they make a business agreement that ``indirectly'' or  ``potentially'' impacts their employees. Under some of these standards,  you can actually be reserved power.   Just think about the uncertainty and ambiguity this standard could  cause. It is hard enough for people to even agree on what exactly those  terms mean. Imagine how confusing it is for Main Street businesses to  understand and follow that.   This is not some abstract issue. In fact, I have been hearing and  talking with job creators and workers in my district about this for  years. I have sat around the restaurant tables and heard real stories  and concerns.   Bob Omainsky, the owner of Wintzell's Oyster House in my home  district, had this to say about the confusion caused by the new joint- employer standard: ``If we hire an outside landscaping company to keep  our lawns lush, I could be considered a joint employer if I show the  landscapers where to mow. Or, if I contract a food supplier for certain  ingredients, I could become part of a lawsuit if one of their workers  complains about overtime pay. The uncertainty is nothing more than  governmental overreach that is crippling eateries like Wintzell's and  discouraging growth throughout the restaurant industry.''   This story and example is not unique to my district. These stories  exist all over the country from Seattle, Washington, to Miami, Florida;  and we heard a whole bunch of them in the hearings that we held in  committee. This is why this bill has earned support from both sides of  the aisle. This is not a partisan issue, but instead this is about  protecting jobs and providing clarity to workers.   Workers shouldn't have to wonder who their employer is. They deserve  better than a vague and confusing rule that the American Action Forum  found threatens 1.7 million jobs. Even the Progressive Policy Institute  issued a statement saying the expanded standard ``may do more harm than  good.''   I also want to make one thing perfectly clear: this legislation does  not remove a single worker protection. All worker protections provided  by the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and  the Equal Pay Act remain unchanged and are still available.    I also want to dispel the myth that this legislation is some  departure from the norm. In fact, this legislation simply restores the  agreed-upon legal standard that existed for decades.   The reality is that the new standard has created so much confusion  and ambiguity that no one really knows what the law is. There are at  least nine different legal tests nationwide to determine joint employer  status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and there are more to come.   This patchwork of standards creates regulatory uncertainty,  especially for job creators doing businesses in multiple States.  Ultimately, this legislation is about providing clarity to workers and  job creators. It is about protecting the rights of workers and ensuring  employers have clarity on their responsibilities to their employees,  and it is about preserving the small businesses that are the backbone  of our local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 607 and  the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of the work that the Rules  Committee has done this year and of the leadership in this Congress and  how we have handled legislation.   Unlike our Democratic colleagues who would shut the doors and refuse  to accept late amendments from Members, the chairman of our committee  has made it a point to ensure every single Member has the opportunity  to submit their amendments and come to the committee to share their  thoughts and concerns.   Under this model of transparency and openness, the committee has  spent countless hours listening and considering Member testimony. In  fact, we have welcomed over 330 Members to testify, this Congress  alone, before the Rules Committee. We have made in order 864  amendments, including 403 from Democrats, 341 from Republicans, and 120  bipartisan amendments.   Unfortunately, our friends across the aisle have become more  interested in derailing legislation than actually improving  legislation. For example, Democrats politicized an open appropriations  process by offering poison pill amendments meant to kill legislation  they had no intention of supporting, regardless of the outcome.   These tactics have fundamentally changed the way we do business.  Instead of offering thoughtful ideas intended to shape a measure, their  dilatory tactics are for one purpose and one purpose only: to score  political points.   The Rules Committee will not let these political games get in the way  of fulfilling the promises we made to the American people who elected  this majority. That is why the chairman of our committee has made it a  priority to listen to all Members. I would ask all of you who come to  the Rules Committee to watch our committee listening to all Members.   We are also committed to moving the majority's progrowth agenda  forward. As a result of our efforts, we have had a record of success in  this House. To date, we have passed almost 400 bills out of the House.   This further underscores that the House is here to work, we are here  to serve, and we are here to get results. But the proof is in the  facts. John Adams said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''   As of November 7 of this year, in just the first session of this  Congress, we have provided for the consideration of 864 amendments on  the House floor. Under Speaker Pelosi, during the entirety of the 111th  Congress, both sessions, she had only made in order 778. You tell me  who has an open House and who had a closed House.   There is no shame on this side at all. There is great pride in the  work we are doing for the American people, and we are not going to let  anyone get in the way of our making sure that we fulfill the promises  we made.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when I was giving the statistics earlier, I left one  very important one out. I can't believe I forgot this.   Of the almost 400 bills we passed in this House this year, 80 percent  of them have been bipartisan. So this record production of bills we  have had in the House this year has benefited both sides of the aisle  as we have  [[Page H8539]]  worked together to come up with commonsense policies for the American  people.                                time  1300    I am very proud of that work and that progress we have made in this  House. The gentleman from Minnesota acted as if this bill, the Save  Local Business Act, is something to benefit big companies, but let me  tell you who I, and virtually all of us who are supporting this bill,  have heard from: small businesses in our districts that are begging us  to pass this bill.   I have had dozens of meetings in my own district. I know of hundreds  of meetings that have been held across the country between Members of  this House on both sides of the aisle and small businesses in their  districts that say: Please pass this bill.   This isn't for the big businesses in America. This is for the small,  Main Street businesses in our communities and for the people who work  there.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman), one of the newest Members of the House who  has already made a distinguished mark here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased and very proud of the bipartisanship  that we have had in this House this year to pass all these bills. Let  me note just two very substantive bills, one last week and one today.   Last week, we passed a bill that got rid of this IPAB group that is  going to take money, is proposed to take money out of Medicare. It was  cosponsored by 45 Democrats, and dozens and dozens of Democrats voted  for it on the floor last week. Today, this Save Local Business Act is  bipartisan in its sponsorship and, I predict, on the vote of the floor  today.   Now, how important is that? Let me read to you just a few of the  organizations that support this bill: the American Hotel and Lodging  Association, the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, Associated  Builders and Contractors, Associated General Contractors, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, the  Coalition to Save Local Businesses, The Latino Coalition, National  Association of Home Builders, National Association of Manufacturers,  National Council of Chain Restaurants, National Retail Federation, U.S.  Travel Association, the Capital Research Center, Generation  Opportunity, Heritage Action for America, Hispanic Leadership Fund, the  Independent Women's Institute for Liberty, the James Madison Institute,  the National Taxpayers Union, the Tea Party Nation, Food Marketing  Institute, National Franchisee Association, National Apartment  Association, Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the Workplace  Fairness Institute, and I could have dozens and dozens more.   The truth of the matter is, these are very important bills that we  bring before this floor, and most of them are bipartisan. The ones we  have today are bipartisan bills.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to you that this House has a lot to be proud  of, of the great work we have done this year, and I am most proud of  the fact that, in most of those cases, we have been working together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when we adopt this rule later on this afternoon, when we  adopt my bill, let me tell you who is going to be happy. Tens and tens  of thousands of small businesses and hundreds of thousands of their  employees across America, that is who is going to be happy.   And you know what, we are not here to make ourselves happy. We are  here to make the people who sent us here and expect us to do their  business, we are here to make them happy, and we are going to make them  happy today, as we have done over and over again this year, by passing  legislation that works for them, not for us.   So there may be some unhappiness in the room because we haven't made  every little amendment in order for this floor, but we have made the  amendments that matter to the American people, and, more importantly,  we passed legislation that matters to the American people, and I am  very proud of that, and the American people, indeed, are happy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a very open process. At the beginning, you  recognized me for an hour and I gave, as is customary, half of my time  to the other side so that they could present their side.   In our committee, the Rules Committee, we let anyone who wants to  come--any Member who wants to come and basically say whatever they want  to say for as long as they want to say it. We don't really have any  rules in the Rules Committee because we want to have it so open, we  want to give everybody such an opportunity, that we let everybody come  and say whatever they want. Then we take it all into account and we  make some amendments in order and some not.   Because we have done our job so well this year, we have had so many  bills in the House--and the House has passed them all--that this House  is just about a record-breaking House in terms of what we are passing.  Yes, our friends over in the Senate haven't passed a lot of them. I  don't think the American people like that. I think the American people  want the Senate to get to work like the House has been at work.   This is important work, and we are here to do it and not play games.  The bills that are under this rule are very important bills.   I have heard a lot about climate change. The gentleman may suggest  that people on our side of the aisle don't understand science. I am not  a scientist, but I do understand climate change. I do understand from  the people who are worried about it, and a lot of people are  legitimately worried about it. The only thing you can do about that is  to have alternative sources of energy.   Hydroenergy is one of those sources. You don't release any carbon  molecules in the air when you generate electricity using water. So one  of the bills addresses that.   The other bill--my bill--the Save the Local Business Act, is a very  important bill, a bipartisan bill. There are bipartisan sponsors on  this bill. As I said earlier, there are tens of thousands of businesses  around America and hundreds of thousands of employees of those  businesses that are aching for us to pass this bill.   So far from being small things that don't matter--by the way, saying  nice things about teachers isn't a small thing. I think it is a big  thing. These are important pieces of legislation, and I am proud of the  work that this House has done to make sure that we consider them and  pass them.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  607 and the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 607 Offered by Mr. McGovern:         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution       (H. Res. 367) to establish the Select Committee on Gun       Violence Prevention. The first reading of the resolution       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the resolution are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the resolution and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Rules. After general       debate the resolution shall be considered for amendment under       the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions       in the resolution are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the resolution for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the resolution to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one       motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the resolution, then on the next legislative       day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order       of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the       resolution.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 367.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled  [[Page H8543]]       ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the       previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported       from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to       amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2)       Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for       the previous question on a resolution reported from the       Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the       opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper       amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate       thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on  this issue and for her continued leadership of our committee.   Mr. Speaker, today is a big day. Today is an opportunity for this  House to stand up for our Nation's workers and to protect the small  local businesses, which form the backbone of the American economy.  Today is about restoring decades-old labor law. Ultimately, today is  about giving clarity to workers and job creators all across our  country.   I have heard from our friends across the aisle that somehow someone  can be an employee without there being an employer. I call that the  immaculately conceived employee. There is no such thing under the law,  nor has there ever been.   This bill does not change the definition of employer. It simply takes  the definition of joint employer back to the way it was a few years  ago.   It is a shame that we are even having to have this bill. But the  activist National Labor Relations Board in 2015 issued a decision that  fundamentally upended labor law as we knew it. This change didn't come  through the democratically elected Congress, but, instead, from a panel  of unelected bureaucrats.   The NLRB's decision and the resulting regulatory agenda have caused  deep uncertainty among job creators. For workers, they are left to  wonder who their boss really is. That is an incredibly confusing  situation to be in.   Under the new joint employer standard, what does it mean to have  ``indirect'' or ``potential'' control over an employee?   I have practiced labor and employment law for decades and I do not  know what that means, so I can only imagine the confusion Main Street  businesses are facing due to this standard.   Currently, there are at least nine different legal tests nationwide  to determine joint employer status under the Fair Labor Standards Act,  and more to come. This patchwork of standards creates regulatory  uncertainty, especially for job creators doing businesses in multiple  States.   So, despite what some on the other side want to believe, this is not  an abstract issue. I have visited numerous local businesses in my  district, and they are very worried about this scheme. I have heard  from workers who want to remain an employee of a locally owned business  with an owner who knows them, instead of becoming just another employee  in some large corporation.   Clearly, I am not the only one who heard these concerns. This  legislation is cosponsored by 123 of my colleagues, including Members  from both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan issue because it  isn't about politics. Instead, it is about saving jobs and supporting  locally owned businesses.   Let me make something crystal clear: this bill does not remove a  single protection for today's workforce. Despite the scare tactics  being used by big labor bosses and their trial lawyer friends, the same  important protections exist under this legislation, and any  irresponsible employer can be held accountable.  [[Page H8568]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to take the side of our  locally owned businesses, to take the side of our small business job  creators, and to take the side of American workers.
