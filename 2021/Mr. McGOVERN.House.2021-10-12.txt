Sec. 10.

House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 667, agreed to       September 21, 2021), is amended by striking ``October 27,       2021'' each place it appears and inserting (in each instance)       ``November 18, 2021''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 716, for four measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 2119, the Family  Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act, under a structured  rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Scott,  provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and  Labor, makes in order eight amendments, provides en bloc authority, and  provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3110, the PUMP for  Nursing Mothers Act, under a structured rule. The rule self-executes a  manager's amendment from Chairman Scott, provides for 1 hour of general  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Education and Labor, makes in order two  amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3992, the Protecting  Older Job Applicants Act, under a structured rule. It provides for 1  hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor, makes  in order two amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Additionally, the rule provides that the House hereby concurs in the  Senate amendment to the House amendment to S. 1301, an increase of the  public debt limit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to  [[Page H5615]]  en bloc requested roll call votes on previously considered suspension  bills through October 22, 2021, and provides recess instructions,  suspension authority, and same day authority through November 18, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, Republican Teddy Roosevelt once said: ``The government  is us; we are the government, you and I.''   He knew that government is at its best when it brings all of us  together while also working for every single one of us. That means a  system that allows every American the chance to put a roof over their  head, food on their table, and a job that allows them to put some money  in the bank, and where education and healthcare are affordable and not  a luxury for the precious wealthy few.   Unfortunately, as a deadline loomed, those discussions have had to  give way to a debate about whether our Nation will pay its debts.  Rather than coming together to get this done, some on the other side  advocated an approach that would stop government in its tracks and open  the door on default for the first time in our history.   We all know what that would mean. It would send our economy off a  cliff and make the cost of virtually everything skyrocket, all at a  time when we should be helping families recover from the economic shock  of the COVID pandemic.   Last week our Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, said that defaulting  our debt would risk the benefits of more than 2 million military  retirees and roughly 400,000 survivors.   Mark Zandi is chief economist at Moody's Analytics and previously  worked for Republican Senator John McCain. He recently said that  defaulting ``would be financial Armageddon.'' That is what has been at  stake here, Mr. Speaker, financial Armageddon.                                time  1615    The debt ceiling has been raised or suspended roughly 80 times in our  Nation's history, often in a bipartisan way. And I am grateful that,  after much debate, we are finally doing the right thing again here  today.   I took to the House floor two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, and stressed  the importance of preventing default. I spoke about how I voted to  raise the debt ceiling when I was in the majority and in the minority,  when there was a Democrat in the White House and when there was a  Republican in the White House, and I asked Republicans to do one thing:  If they weren't going to help us raise the debt ceiling, I asked them  to get out of the way so that Democrats could prevent default on our  own.   Now, I want to thank the minority leader in the Senate, Mitch  McConnell, for taking that advice. He crafted the initial framework of  a deal that will temporarily increase our debt limit into early  December. And after voting with just 10 other Republicans to allow  debate on that compromise, he got so far out of the way that he  couldn't even bring himself to vote for the deal that he pushed for.   But the deal was made, and the compromise passed the Senate, and I am  hopeful that we can send this bill to the President today and avert a  totally self-made, unnecessary catastrophe.   And let me say, for the record, the first time we saw a dramatic  increase in our Nation's debt was under President Ronald Reagan, a  Republican, who added $4 trillion to our Nation's debt; part of that  was to pass tax cuts, again, primarily for those at the top.   So please spare us the lectures on taxes and spending today. Let's  just finally do the right thing.   I want to thank all of those who will join with us today in making  this possible. I pray that those who vote ``no'' will have their wisdom  enlarged because what is before us is ultimately a stopgap. We will  need to find a long-term solution in a matter of weeks; one that  protects the full faith and credit of the United States, hopefully,  without lurching from one short-term deadline to the next.   That is one of the most basic tasks of Congress and, on behalf of our  economy and the American people, we will have to get this done. We  always have. And we cannot afford not to this time around.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me also urge passage of the three underlying  bills that are also included in this rule; legislation that will extend  protections for nursing mothers in the workplace, prevent  discrimination of older Americans in the workforce, and combat intimate  partner violence. They are important ways for us all to show our  support for protecting our Nation's children, families, and workers.   I urge all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  bills. Let's show that the words of Teddy Roosevelt haven't completely  fallen on deaf ears. Let's show that America pays its bills; and let's  show that we can keep making government work better for every single  American.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me remind my good friend that the compromise we are voting on was  designed by Republican leader Mitch McConnell. It is not what I wanted.  I wanted to get this out of the way and make it longer, quite frankly,  so we weren't lurching from one deadline to another.   I would also say to my friend on the Rules Committee that it is a  little bit hard for us to stand over here and to listen to some of my  Republican colleagues complain, because what we are doing here is we  are paying for the bills that Donald Trump and the Republicans  accumulated.   I didn't like the tax cut that my friends forced through, by the way,  with no Democratic support or consultation. It added trillions to our  debt. But we have to pay for it.   It is like my Republican friends went out to a fancy restaurant,  drank champagne and ate caviar and ran out of the restaurant before  paying the bill, and now they want us to take the responsibility to pay  for their bills.   Well, you know what? We have some experience in cleaning up the  messes that have been left behind by our Republican colleagues. The  last time Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White  House, they shut the government down, and then the new Democratic  majority had to come in and try to fix all that. So my friends are  really good at creating messes and piling up big bills, by the way, and  then they say to us, you clean it up.   Well, you know what? We are putting our country first, and so we are  going to clean up this mess, and we are going to move forward. And we  are going to have a reconciliation bill, by the way, that will be  mostly paid for. And if my friends don't like that, they can vote  against it.   But let's be clear. Ninety-seven percent of what we are covering here  are bills accumulated by Donald Trump and my Republican friends; I  mean, 97 percent. So I don't know what the controversy is on the other  side of the aisle.   You didn't want to accumulate all this debt? I remember during the  tax debate we were talking to you about debt and you didn't want to  hear anything about it. We had some Republicans say that debt doesn't  matter on this floor. And now all of a sudden it does; now that we have  a Democratic President and, by the way, a Democratic Congress that is  trying to pay the bills that you accumulated. This is ridiculous. It is  absurd that we are having this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, let me just state for the record that the  House rules do not ban the use of any of the words that the gentleman  is referring to. It is another one of these rightwing conspiracies.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman, my colleague on the  Rules Committee, none of what he just stated has anything to do with  what we are debating here today. What we are debating here today is  whether or not we are going to pay the bills that have been  accumulated, whether we are going to pay the bills accumulated as a  result of an unpaid-for tax cut, mostly for wealthy people, and other  spending.   The gentleman complains about gas prices. Imagine what is going to  happen to gas prices if we default on our debt, if we destroy the  entire economy. Imagine the harsh impacts on everyday, average  citizens.   All of the other stuff is nice rhetoric, but we are talking about  here today whether or not we should pay the bills that many on the  other side voted to accumulate. But now, all of a sudden, they don't  want to pay the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I heard the news today that Mr. Yarmuth will not be  running for reelection, and I think it is a sad day for this  institution. He conducts himself with grace, with dignity, always  sticking to the facts, and he has a demeanor about him that I think all  of us should try to emulate. It is kind of sad to hear that news today,  but I do admire him greatly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Yarmuth), the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, you wonder why people hate Congress. I  mean, we have somebody on the Budget Committee who is trying to make us  believe that, in fact, raising the debt limit somehow controls  spending.   The bottom line is the debt limit is about paying the bills that have  already been accumulated, including many of the bills that my friend  who just spoke voted to accumulate, including a tax cut bill that  benefited the well off and the well connected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer), the distinguished chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say to my good friend, the gentlewoman from Minnesota,  yes, individual Democrats on occasion have voted ``no'' on the debt  ceiling, and the party in control ends up carrying the day.   But I guess I would ask her, does she know how many times Democrats  threatened to filibuster the raising of the debt ceiling in the Senate  to make it virtually impossible for the party in control to be able to  pass it?   I am happy to yield to her, but the answer to that is zero. Zero.   I said this before when we debated this a couple of weeks ago. You  know, I don't expect my Republican friends to do the responsible thing,  but I expect them to get out of the way so that we can. That is what is  at stake here today.   Again, let me remind all my colleagues what happens if, in fact, we  don't extend the debt limit. Again, according to the nonpartisan  Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi says such a crisis could result in a loss  of 6 million U.S. jobs, and $15 trillion in household wealth would be  wiped out. Obviously, it is something that we cannot easily recover  from, if we could ever recover from it, especially after the  coronavirus pandemic.   Let me just say, I am so happy to hear that my Republican friends  finally have seen the light on the debt. Where have you been? Where  were you when Donald Trump brought his tax cut bill for the well off  and the well connected? You had no problem at all piling on $2 trillion  to the debt. Remember the debate we had on the floor? No big deal, no  big deal.   I mean, would you reconsider that vote now? Or do you want to take  back the vote that many of you cast--I think wisely so--to help provide  COVID relief money to families that were struggling because of the  worst pandemic in our lifetimes? Do you want to take that back?   Come on. This debate is embarrassing. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, oh my goodness. The gentleman says that we  buried the debt limit somehow in this  [[Page H5625]]  rule. I will lend him my glasses. It says in the title: Increase the  public debt limit.   I don't know how much clearer it could be. It is in the title. Did  you not read the rule?   Mr. Speaker, by the way, we met in the Committee on Rules on S. 1301  on September 29--2 weeks ago. On that same day, we debated the bill on  the House floor and voted on it--up or down. Fully transparent--218  Democrats voted yes; 1 Republican voted yes; 2 Democrats voted no; 210  Republicans voted no.   It was a fully transparent process. What are you talking about?   Mr. Speaker, what we are dealing with today is a Senate amendment to  that very same bill. We don't need to start the process of hearings and  markups and debate all over again for a Senate amendment to a bill that  we have already debated and voted on--and by the way, a Senate  amendment that was inspired by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.   So don't just come here and make stuff up. The debt limit is in the  title of the rule, for goodness sake.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am hearing two things from the other  side.   One, is that they are fine with ignoring the debt if it is on things  that they like. And then two, I am hearing that they are fine with  defaulting on the debt, therefore throwing our economy into ruin. Talk  about irresponsibility.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to save my breath, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how many more speakers the  gentlewoman may have.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We  are on the precipice of what economists call financial Armageddon,  financial Armageddon. Mark Zandi has said: ``Even if resolved quickly,  Americans would pay for this default for generations.''   Their answer, according to virtually all Republicans, is to go home.  Really? If we defaulted, 6 million jobs would be lost, unemployment  would skyrocket to 9 percent, and $15 trillion in household wealth will  be wiped away. Don't take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. That is  according to the nonpartisan Moody's Analytics.   The only solution my Republican friends can come up with is to leave  town.   Senate Republicans tried to filibuster this deal that Mitch McConnell  developed to temporarily raise the debt limit. Now House Republicans  have used the tools that they have here to unleash their own form of  obstruction.   This isn't about whether you like Mitch McConnell's compromise. I  sure don't. I wanted to take the debt ceiling head-on in a longer term  way. But this is about whether you want to lose 6 million jobs, see  unemployment at 9 percent, and watch $15 trillion in household wealth  evaporate, whether or not you want to cause a financial catastrophe  that will be felt for generations.   Members just cast their votes. We know which side they are on. Mr.  Speaker, 198 Republicans voted to leave town to adjourn this Congress  without solving the massive problem in front of us. That is stunning,  Mr. Speaker. This is the sort of thing that can make you cynical about  Congress and about the direction of our country.   But I choose to focus on the 223 Members, including five Republicans,  who voted to stay here today to pay our bills.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule, vote ``yes'' on  protecting the full faith and credit of the United States of America,  and vote ``yes'' on preventing financial Armageddon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
