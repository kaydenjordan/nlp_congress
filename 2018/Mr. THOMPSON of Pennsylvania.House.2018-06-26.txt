 Mr. Speaker, it has been more than a  year since the House of Representatives unanimously approved the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   I am proud to see that, this week, the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee will consider career and technical  education legislation. It is welcome news that this important topic  will be examined by our congressional colleagues in the United States  Senate. Career and technical education, or CTE, has helped countless  men and women acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in  the workforce.   By empowering State and local leaders, improving alignment with in- demand jobs, increasing transparency and accountability, and ensuring a  limited Federal role, we can modernize and strengthen career and  technical education and help more individuals build successful and  fulfilling careers.                                time  1030    Career and technical education can help restore rungs on the ladder  of opportunity. All Americans deserve a good-paying, family-sustaining  job, and they might just need some new skills to get one.   America is still facing a widening skills gap that puts our workforce  at a disadvantage to succeed in a 21st century economy. Today, there  are an estimated 6.7 million jobs that are open and available in the  United States.   While companies across the country have openings for high-paying  jobs, and are anxious to hire, many workers lack the skills and  adequate education needed to qualify and compete for these jobs, Mr.  Speaker.   We have also seen students pushed down the college-for-all pathway.  That just doesn't work for some students. There are many different  pathways to success and life in this country.   One of the biggest challenges facing career and technical education  is the stigma associated with it. Through the years, we have seen  wrongheaded claims that students involved in the trades lacked  ambition. Those misplaced assumptions are slowly subsiding, but not  soon enough.   CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving  students choose in pursuit of industry certifications and hands-on  skills they can use right out of high school, in skills-based education  programs or in college.   By modernizing the Federal investment in career and technical  education programs, we will be able to connect more educators with  industry stakeholders and close the skills gap in this country. There  are good jobs out there, but people need to be qualified to get them.   I remain dedicated to working with my colleagues in the Senate on  this effort. All education is career education and every American  deserves a fair shot at learning the right skills to obtain a good- paying job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  an outstanding student from Coudersport, Pennsylvania, who received an  award from the Potter County Conservation District for being an  outstanding FFA student.   Miss Lakota Timothy is this year's recipient of the Henry Staiger  Agriculture Education and FFA Award. Henry was an agriculture teacher  for many years in Potter County and was instrumental in developing the  conservation district.   Each year, this award goes to the most involved and outstanding Spud  Growers FFA student from Coudersport High School.   Lakota is the daughter of Scott and Wendy Timothy of Sweden Valley.  Throughout her FFA career, she has been involved in numerous leadership  and development events, including: forest evaluation, land evaluation,  environmental and natural resources, dairy evaluation, livestock  evaluation, and public speaking.   She also has presented at Kindergarten Ag Day and other community  events where she teaches elementary students about various agricultural  topics.   Mr. Speaker, Lakota has been an excellent role model to both her  peers and younger students who are interested in agriculture.   I congratulate her on this outstanding achievement and wish her the  best of luck in the future.                            ____________________
