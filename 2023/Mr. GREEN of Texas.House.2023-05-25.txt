 Madam Speaker, and still I rise; and I rise today  with a very simple message. The debt ceiling has outlived its  usefulness. It is time to eliminate the debt ceiling.   We have to do so because these issues that we are dealing with  currently are only the genesis. The revelations will lead us to other  issues involving the social agenda. Budgetary items will not be the  only items on this extortion agenda.   It is time to end the debt ceiling and let us move forward and  negotiate as we appropriately should and have done lo these many years.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And still I rise  a proud descendant of the enslaved people who are the foundational  mothers and fathers of the United States of America.   They are the foundational mothers and fathers because many of them  had their entire lives sacrificed so that the country can have the  economic foundation that it had in the early stages of its existence.   These foundational mothers and fathers are the persons who were  kidnapped, brought to this country, placed into slavery, forced into  labor, centuries of labor, not compensated, no remuneration. I am a  proud descendant, and I am a proud descendant because they ought to be  respected.   It is time to respect the foundational mothers and fathers who laid  the economic foundation upon which this Nation stands today.   I am also proud to be here today to speak about the conscience  agenda.   We want to make sure that we have a slavery remembrance day, August  20. On August 20, 1619, the White Lion docked in Point Comfort,  Virginia, near what we now call Norfolk, Virginia. On this White Lion  were persons who were placed into slavery in this country.   August 20, 1619, a moment in time that will impact the rest of time,  we will never be able to escape the fact that it happened. It was a  seminal moment in time. August 20 ought to be slavery remembrance day.   We ought to also do something to acknowledge those persons whom I  call the foundational mothers and fathers. I am a proud descendant of  them.   In 1956, we accorded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate  soldiers, to those persons who would enslave persons or maintain  slavery. This Congress did it, a Congressional Gold Medal.   Well, why not have a Congressional Gold Medal for the enslaved, the  foundational mothers and fathers?   This is part of the conscience agenda, a Congressional Gold Medal for  the enslaved.   In this country that I love, I salute the flag; I say the Pledge of  Allegiance; and I stand for the national anthem. It means something to  me to be an American.    By the way, the greatness of the country won't be measured by whether  I do these things. The greatness of the country will be measured by  whether I would defend those who choose not to salute the flag, who  choose not to say the Pledge of Allegiance. The greatness of America is  in how we tolerate persons who have opinions that are not popular.   That is the greatness of America, in part. There are many other  aspects of it.   The truth is, in this country that I am proud to be a part of, proud  to say I am an American--the United States is my home; the origin of my  descendants was far away--we revere the enslavers and revile the  enslaved.   How can we possibly allow this to continue? These were human beings.  They merit a Congressional Gold Medal.   If we can give a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslavers, the  Confederate soldiers, then we can accord one to the enslaved people who  were the foundational mothers and fathers who worked for hundreds of  years to make this country the great Nation that it is.   That is all a part of the conscience agenda. Today, however, having  spoken of these things briefly, I am going to focus on the third item  on the conscience agenda.   The third item on the conscience agenda is removing the name of  Richard Russell from the Russell Senate Office Building.   To properly address this, I have to lay a predicate. We have to talk  first about beneficial bigotry.                                time  1330    And to properly explain beneficial bigotry, we have to address a  concept. It is this notion that those who tolerate bigotry perpetuate  bigotry. Those who tolerate bigotry, because of that toleration of  bigotry, you are perpetuating it because you're not doing what you can  to stop it.   We ought not tolerate bigotry. The Russell Senate Office Building is  named after Richard Russell, a self-proclaimed white supremacist. That  is what he called himself. He was a person who fought antilynching  legislation. That means he did not want us to pass antilynching  legislation.   He was a person who fought integration. If he had his way, there is a  good likelihood I would not be standing here today. He was the person  who coauthored the Southern Manifesto. Richard Russell, his name is on  the Russell  [[Page H2627]]  Senate Office Building. He identified himself as a white supremacist.   Well, dear friends, his name ought not be there. We ought not  tolerate his name being there. To tolerate his name there is to  perpetuate the bigotry associated with his many exploits.   Richard Russell's name should be removed from the Russell Senate  Office Building, and it should be replaced with the name that it had  before it became the Russell Senate Office Building. I don't have a  person's name that I would call to the attention of the Congress, I  don't. There will be some debate about that.   I do believe we can let it revert to the name that it had prior to  becoming the Russell Senate Office Building, and that was the Old  Senate Office Building. I think it should be called the Old Senate  Office Building. Let it revert back to this, then take as much time as  you need to acquire an honorable name to go on the building.   The Russell Senate Office Building is currently a symbol of national  shame. It is. The Senators ought to be ashamed because they have the  power to remove this name from the building. They have the power to do  it, the Senate. The same Senate that voted on removing names from  military bases can remove this name from the Russell Senate Office  Building.   The toleration of bigotry is the perpetuation of it. Allowing this  name to stay there is the toleration of bigotry, especially when you  have the power to remove it. We ought to use that awesome power that  the Senate has to do not the right thing but the righteous things. It  would be a righteous thing to remove this name from the building.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk about beneficial bigotry, this is a  part of my predicate. When you benefit from bigotry, if you believe it  benefits you in some way, you tolerate it.   I, by the way, have not been afforded that luxury. If I say something  that is bigoted or if I am near bigotry, I have to apologize. I have  apologized, by the way, for things that I found to be unacceptable. I  have. I have to. I am not allowed the luxury of having the benefits  that beneficial bigotry can afford people.   There are many who fight bigotry until it benefits them. They don't  have to apologize. They can let a building be called the Russell Senate  Office Building, fight bigotry everywhere but in the building wherein  they happen to have offices. They fight it everywhere but here, the  Russell Senate Office Building, with this name.   Let me give you some examples of what beneficial bigotry allows.  Beneficial bigotry will allow a country to name a town after a bigot.  Beneficial bigotry. Beneficial bigotry allows some people the luxury of  associating with bigots and justifying it. That is what beneficial  bigotry accords some people.   We ought not allow the benefits of bigotry to allow us to tolerate  bigotry, such that we perpetuate bigotry. That is what is happening  with the Russell Senate Office Building.   My friends, I live today to live to see the day that this name will  come off of this building. I don't know when it will happen--it will.  But I do know how the system works, and it is beneficial to know how it  works.   The system functions such that when some people demand things of  others who have the power to make the change, they will not make that  change because of the simple fact that the demand was made, and they  don't want it to appear as though they had to succumb to the demand  that was made. I am demanding. I am demanding. I am not begging. I am,  in a sense, pleading. I am demanding that the name come off.   You see, when you do this and when you are bold enough and you have  the courage enough to demand that the righteous thing be done, there  are some people who are not going to do the righteous thing simply  because they can't let it be said that they have caved in, as it were-- to borrow the parlance of many persons--that they caved in to a demand  to do the righteous thing. They can't accept that.   What they will do is they will try to find a way to do this, to  remove the name, and proclaim victory because it was done for some  other reason, not because of the demand, but for some other reason. I  am okay with that. Just remove the name. Find a clever way to do it.   Usually they will find some person that they find favor with to  become the person that actually caused it to happen. History is replete  with examples of where persons of African ancestry have not been  properly credited for what they have done in history. I can think of  some examples that are in my book that I will share with you at a later  time.   The point is this: We cannot allow persons to simply decide that  because they have the power, and they get to set the agenda that they  won't do it. There is nothing preventing the Senate from changing this  name, removing it, saving will. Just the will. Remove the name of the  bigot from the building. There is nothing preventing it except for  will.   My prayer to the Senate is that the Senate would do the righteous  thing. Don't tolerate bigotry. You don't have to. Your offices are in  the building. Your offices are in the building, in the Russell Senate  Office Building, a symbol of national shame. You ought to be ashamed  that it is there--your office.   What is wrong with us?   I know how the system works. I am a part of it, I ought to. There is  some positive news related to Richard Russell, and the positive news is  that one of my colleagues of whom I am proud to associate with, as it  relates to this, the Honorable Bonnie Watson Coleman is proposing  legislation that would take Richard Russell's name off of a bill--off  of legislation. I came to this floor some time ago, and I brought up  the fact that his name is on more than a building, his name is on  legislation. There is a lunch program that his name is on.   Mrs. Watson Coleman has legislation that would rename the National  School Lunch Program Act. It is going to remove his name and substitute  it with another name. I compliment you, my dear friend, Mrs. Watson  Coleman. I compliment you for doing this.   This is the honorable thing to do. I appreciate it. I am going to  appreciate it. I am going to, if allowed, be her co-lead on this  legislation.   I made a commitment, and I want the world to know that I try my best  to honor my commitments. I made a commitment, and the Record of the  Congress will reflect that on April 28, 2023, Volume 169, Number 72 of  the Daily Edition, there is a topic styled ``The Conscious Agenda.'' It  is part of the Congressional Record.   I stood right here in this very spot, and I made a commitment. About  halfway through my message, you will find the commitment where I am  speaking of legislation that bears the name of Richard Russell--the  same person whose name is on the building.   I said: ``It is the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch  Program.'' That is what I am talking about. I indicate that this  legislation bears his name. Here are my exact words: ``His name  shouldn't be on a school lunch program.'' I go on to say: ``I am filing  legislation''--and I said--``this is the update''--because the last  time when I spoke on this topic it was an update--I say, ``this is the  update.''   ``I am filing legislation--this is the update--to have Richard  Russell's name removed from all legislation that happens to bear it  currently--all legislation--and to never have his name listed again.''  And I go on to say: ``He is a symbol of national shame. His name should  be removed.''   I still stand by that. So while I am going to support and co-lead and  am proud to know that Mrs. Watson Coleman is filing her legislation, I  will file my legislation to keep my commitment that I have made to  people who chronicle the things that I do. I want them to know that I  am following through. I will be filing my legislation, notwithstanding  the fact that I will support, proudly, Mrs. Watson Coleman's  legislation.   Friends, we live in a country that accords us free speech. This is a  priceless possession to have, free speech. There are so many places in  the world where one cannot stand as I am standing today before the  world, literally, and say the things that I have said. This is one of  the reasons why I love my country because of the free speech.   Here is a question that we have to ask ourselves: If we have free  speech and free speech can be the methodology by which we can bring  about change, and if we are tolerant of bigotry, is that free speech  really being used to  [[Page H2628]]  the benefit of the people who actually accorded us or afforded us the  free speech, the people who are the Framers of the Constitution?   I have great respect for them. The Framers who thought this thing was  so important that they put it in the Constitution.   I am standing here to take advantage of and use that free speech.  That free speech allows me to stand here and tell you that beneficial  bigotry is going to become the shame of many persons in this country.   I have here invitations. These are all invitations. I won't turn them  toward the camera because I really don't want to today expose the names  of the persons who sent me these invitations.   Here is one that is for a luncheon that took place in the month of  May. I won't give the date because I am not interested in identifying  the organization. They are inviting me to an event taking place in the  Russell Senate Office Building.                                time  1345    Obviously, if you know me, you know that I didn't go.   I am a one-person protest. I refuse to go into the Russell Senate  Office Building except to protest. I am not going into that building  unless I am to protest, and I will go in for that purpose.   However, my friends, whose names I shall not reveal, sent me this  request and I wrote them a letter in response. I will come back to the  letter in just a moment.   I have other friends having an event in the month of May at the  Russell Senate Office Building. I didn't attend. I sent them a letter.  I will come back to the letter in just a moment.   I received another offer to attend the Russell Senate Office Building  and be a part of an event. I did not attend. I sent them a letter.   Now, all of these are just for the month of May, and while not  calling names, some of the people who sent me these invitations are  people who fight bigotry vehemently, who stand against bigotry in all  its forms. They do, but they have events in the Russell Senate Office  Building.   How can you have events in the Russell Senate Office Building and say  that you are antithetical to bigotry, that you are going to fight  bigotry?   There are some places that if I went into, I would have to apologize  because those places are associated with bigotry, but not my friends  over in the Senate, in and out on a daily basis. I have friends  inviting me to come to events there, be a part of programs. The Russell  Senate Office Building is a benefit to them. You cannot allow  beneficial bigotry, my friends, to cause you to tolerate bigotry.   When you do this, you perpetuate bigotry. I told you I sent a letter  to my friends explaining my position. I am just going to read some  excerpts from the letter, and the reference is, invitation to luncheon,  leaving out the rest of it, and it is in the Russell Senate Office  Building.   I am going to say ``friend'' so as not to identify the persons, Dear  friend: ``Thank you for your invitation to the luncheon,'' without  getting into the details. ``I am compelled to decline your invitation  as I am boycotting the Russell Senate Office Building wherein the  luncheon will take place.''   Yes. The ``yes'' is not here. That is just a part of me expressing  myself because I feel good about what I did. Yes.   I write: ``Richard Russell was an unapologetic bigot and a white  supremacist who claimed that America was `a White man's country.' ''  Check the records if you don't believe me. It is all there. We are  talking about the same Richard Russell that the building is named  after, ``a White man's country.''   He goes on to say: `` `We are going to keep it that way.' '' It is ``  `a White man's country . . . and we are going to keep it that way,' ''  meaning, we are going to keep it a White man's country.   I know this is uncomfortable for many people to hear. We would rather  have Al Green simply tolerate bigotry and perpetuate bigotry. That is  what we would like to do when it is beneficial bigotry and it benefits  other folk.   Let me go on, if I may. ``He not only successfully filibustered  antilynching bills, but also voted against the 1964 Civil Rights  Act''--Richard Russell--that is my commentary--``calling it''--these  are his words--`` `shortsighted and disastrous.' ''   The man whose name is on a building paid for by taxpayer dollars,  many of whom are people of color, indicated that the 1964 Civil Rights  Act was ``shortsighted and disastrous.''   Richard Russell, a beneficial bigot, whose name is on the Russell  Senate Office Building.   Permit me to read on. These are my words: ``Furthermore, he  coauthored the `Southern Manifesto' in opposition to racial  integration.''   I won't read it in its entirety. I am going to go to the next to the  last line in the letter.   I indicate: ``For these and other compelling reasons, I will not  enter the Russell Senate Office Building (except to protest) until the  name of the bigot is removed from the building.''   I know there are people who are saying, Who let him say that? How  could you let Al Green come to the floor of the House of  Representatives and say these things? Here is how: Free speech. Here is  how: Speaking truth.   This is how it happens. I am here to do what we say we will do but  many times do not. I am here to speak truth to power.   Yes, there are consequences, but at some point in life you ought to  decide that you are not going to tolerate beneficial bigotry,  especially when you are not allowed to tolerate it and to see others  tolerate it while demanding that you not tolerate it, that is also  hypocritical, I indicate, until his name is removed from the building,  upon which I still stand.   Now, I would go on record saying this, just as I went on record  saying that I would file the bill to remove his name from legislation,  and I will. I have my bill prepared, and I am going to sign on to  Congresswoman Watson Coleman's bill, but now my commitment is this: I  am going to send a letter now to all of my friends in the human rights/ civil rights movement, because many of the folk who wrote me these  letters that I have, many of these people are in the human rights/civil  rights movement.   I am going to send them all a letter, do not invite me to attend  meetings in the Russell Senate Office Building. Be so kind as to not  insult me. I am not a perfect victim. I am not the victim who is going  to tolerate the bigotry and witness your toleration of it because it is  beneficial, so don't send me a letter, don't invite me. I am not  coming.   They can continue to tolerate the beneficial bigotry that they enjoy  by being in the Russell Senate Office Building, but know this: There  will come a time when this name will be removed. There will. It will  come down. The universe is constructed, such as Dr. King put it, the  arc, ``the moral arc is long, but it bends toward justice.''    This will be the just thing to do, to remove Richard Russell from the  Senate Office Building.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I just want to say that people  don't know the relationships that people have. They don't know. We can  respect people that we don't agree with. That is the greatness of  America, respecting people that we have antithetical views with, but we  can respect them. If we work with them long enough, we will find common  ground. Thank you.
