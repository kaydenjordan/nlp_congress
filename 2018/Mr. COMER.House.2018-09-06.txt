 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nick Ratliff, a  native of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and a senior at Campbellsville  University, who recently earned the title of individual champion at the  2018 Carhartt Bassmaster Classic College Series.   The grueling competition at Milford Lake in Junction City, Kansas,  tested Ratliff's endurance and fishing prowess, with only 4 ounces  ultimately separating him from his competitor. After 3 days of  challenges, and battling stormy conditions, Ratliff emerged the  champion with a 13-pound, 8-ounce catch.   Following this incredible victory, he has earned the right to compete  at the 2019 Bassmaster Classic on the Tennessee River in March of 2019  in Knoxville, Tennessee.   I join with his family and friends, as well as his coach, Pete  Hedgepath, in congratulating him on this great accomplishment. I wish  him the best of luck in his future competitions, and look forward to  many more titles and championships as a result of his continued  dedication to his sport.                            ____________________
