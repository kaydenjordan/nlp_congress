 Mr. President, few issues are as important or personal  to the American people as healthcare, which is why this debate has been  so fervent and ignites such passion.   On the one hand, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, has allowed millions  of individuals and families to obtain health insurance for the first  time. It has also brought important patient protections like those for  people with preexisting conditions and prohibitions on annual and  lifetime limits on insurance payments for needed care.   On the other hand, too many Americans face skyrocketing premiums and  unaffordable deductibles coupled with mandates that give them few, if  any, choices. Some insurance plans have become so restrictive that  families find they can no longer go to the doctor or hospital of their  choice. In addition, the ACA's employer mandate discourages businesses  from creating jobs or giving their workers more hours, while its tax  credits and subsidies are designed so poorly as to cause ``wage  lock''--``where working harder to get ahead can instead make some  Americans fall further behind.''   Despite President Obama's campaign promise that his health plan  ``would save the average family $2,500 on their premiums'' per year,  the opposite has happened as premiums are increasing in nearly every  State, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally last year.  Today, despite the implementation of the ACA, 28 million Americans  remain uninsured.   These problems require a bipartisan solution. The Democrats made a  big mistake when they passed the ACA without a single Republican vote.  I don't want to see Republicans make the same mistake.   Earlier this week, I voted against proceeding to healthcare reform  legislation--the American Health Care Act of 2017--that passed the  House of Representatives last May without a single Democratic vote. For  many Americans, this bill could actually make the situation worse.  Among other things, the bill would make sweeping changes to the  Medicaid Program--an important safety net that for more than 50 years  has helped poor and disabled individuals, including children and low- income seniors, receive health care. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office, CBO, projects that the number of uninsured Americans  would climb by 23 million under this bill.   Senate leaders, recognizing that the House bill did not have  sufficient support, advanced their own substitute proposal that would  make similar structural changes to the Medicaid program, as well as  many other changes. CBO estimates that this plan would reduce the  number of people with insurance by 22 million, cause premiums and other  out-of-pocket costs to soar for Americans nearing retirement, and shift  billions of dollars of costs to State governments. It also would  undermine the financial stability of rural hospitals and long-term care  facilities and likely lead to the loss of important consumer  protections for many Americans, while doing virtually nothing to  address the underlying problem of escalating healthcare costs. Earlier  this week, this body struck down that proposal by a vote of 43 to 57.   A separate proposal that would simply repeal the ACA without a  replacement also failed, by a vote of 45 to 55. That legislation,  according to CBO, would result in 32 million people losing their  insurance, bringing the total number of uninsured Americans to 60  million a decade from now. Clearly, that is going in the wrong  direction.   In a final effort to reach consensus, Republican leaders have pieced  together a plan that would repeal key portions of the ACA while punting  on many of the more difficult questions. While I support many of the  components of this plan, this approach will not provide the market  stability and premium relief that is needed. In fact, a bipartisan  group of Governors wrote Senate leaders this week, urging rejection of  this so-called skinny plan, which they say ``is expected to accelerate  health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and  result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.''   I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record  following my remarks.   Also included in all of these plans is a misguided proposal that  would block Federal funds, including Medicaid reimbursements, from  going to Planned Parenthood. Millions of women across the country rely  on Planned Parenthood for family planning, cancer screening, and basic  preventive healthcare services. Denying women access to Planned  Parenthood not only runs contrary to our goal of letting patients  choose the healthcare provider who best fits their needs, but it also  could impede timely access to care.   If Planned Parenthood were defunded, other family planning clinics in  Maine, including community health centers, would see a 63 percent  increase in their patient load. Some patients would need to drive  greater distances to receive care, while others would have to wait  longer for an appointment,   Let me be clear that this is not about abortion. Federal law already  prohibits the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion except in cases  of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.   This is about interfering with the ability of a woman to choose the  healthcare provider who is right for her. This harmful provision should  have no place in legislation that purports to be about restoring  patient choices and freedom.   We need to reconsider our approach. The ACA is flawed and in portions  of the country is near collapse. Rather  [[Page S4408]]  than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should  work together to address these very serious problems. In their letter  to Senate leaders, the bipartisan group of Governors correctly notes  that, ``True, lasting reforms can only be achieved in an open,  bipartisan fashion.''   Healthcare is extraordinarily complex, and we must work together  systematically in order to ``do no harm'' and improve our healthcare  system. In developing legislation, our focus should be on the impact on  people, premiums, and providers.   We are dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans and  one sixth of our economy, and we need to approach reforms in a very  careful way. That means going through the regular process of committee  hearings; receiving input from expert witnesses such as actuaries,  Governors, advocacy groups, and healthcare providers; and vetting  proposals with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It needs to  be a much more deliberative process, and I am pleased that Chairman  Alexander has expressed a willingness to begin hearings in the Senate  Health Committee.   Neither party has a monopoly on good ideas, and we must work together  to put together a bipartisan bill that fixes the flaws in the ACA and  works for all Americans.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       As the Senate debates the House-passed American Health Care       Act (H.R. 1628), we urge you to set aside this flawed bill       and work with governors, both Democrats and Republicans, on       solutions that will make health care more available and       affordable for every American. True, lasting reforms can only       be achieved in an open, bipartisan fashion.        We agree with Senator John McCain that the Senate should       ``return to regular order,'' working across the aisle to       ``provide workable solutions to problems Americans are       struggling with today.''        Congress should be working to make health insurance more       affordable while stabilizing the health insurance market, but       this bill and similar proposals won't accomplish these goals.       The bill still threatens coverage for millions of       hardworking, middle class Americans. The bill's Medicaid       provisions shift costs to states and fail to provide the       necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out,       including the working poor or those suffering from mental       illness or addiction. The Senate should also reject efforts       to amend the bill into a ``skinny repeal,'' which is expected       to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market,       increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having       access to coverage.        Instead, we ask senators to work with governors on       solutions to problems we can all agree on: fixing our       unstable insurance markets. Improvements should be based on a       set of guiding principles, which include controlling costs       and stabilizing the market, that will positively impact the       coverage and care of millions of Americans, including many       who are dealing with mental illness, chronic health problems,       and drug addiction.        The next best step is for senators and governors of both       parties to come together to work to improve our health care       system. We stand ready to work with lawmakers in an open,       bipartisan way to provide better insurance for all Americans.            Sincerely,          John W. Hickenlooper, Governor of Colorado;          Steve Bullock, Governor of Montana;          Brian Sandoval, Governor of Nevada;          Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland;          Tom Wolf, Governor of Pennsylvania;          John Bel Edwards, Governor of Louisiana;          Terence R. McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia;          Charles D. Baker, Governor of Massachusetts;          John R. Kasich, Governor of Ohio;          Phil Scott, Governor of Vermont.
