 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work of the Civil Air Patrol, otherwise known as CAP. I have had  personal experience with Civil Air Patrol, as my son, Trey, was a  member of the Civil Air Patrol while in high school. He gained valuable  leadership skills that led him to graduating from the U.S. Naval  Academy and now serving as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps.   The Civil Air Patrol protects our homeland by serving as the Air  Force's official auxiliary. CAP is active in all 50 States.   Last year alone, the Civil Air Patrol saved 130 lives while  responding to devastating natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes,  tornadoes, and wildfires. CAP also helped States distribute COVID-19  test kits, personal protective equipment, and other essential goods,  making it their largest mobilization effort since World War II.   Greater funding for the force will allow the Civil Air Patrol to  train more pilots, continue its cadet program, and purchase much-needed  equipment. I want to thank the Civil Air Patrol national legislative  coordinator, Dr. Gerald Marketos, for his strong leadership and  compassionate commitment to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to join me  and Representative   Mike Thompson to support Civil Air Patrol funding  appropriation requests for fiscal year 2022.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson so much for holding this  very important evening of Special Orders to honor National Police Week.  I am so honored to be here on behalf of our men and women in blue, who  do such a great job supporting us.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to put out a few facts on this that I  thought would be interesting to our listeners. There are over 800,000  law enforcement officers across the United States serving and  protecting our communities, and I commend them as they serve at great  personal risk.   These public servants intervene daily in dangerous and life- threatening situations to deescalate tensions, to provide emergency  care, to apprehend criminals, to defend the most vulnerable, and to  protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.   Over the past year, law enforcement officers have faced unprecedented  challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising violent  crime. In 2020, 264 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.  In my community alone, we have tragically lost friends in law  enforcement, over a dozen in just my community who were killed in the  line of duty. That is just way too many.   In 2021, across the Nation, 49 law enforcement officers have died,  making it the deadliest period for law enforcement in decades.   Amidst these unparalleled challenges, unfortunately, politicians in  Washington and around the country have perpetuated this idea that law  enforcement officers are the enemy. If any of you watched or saw the  wonderful law enforcement officer, who is also the mother of a young  child, saving that toddler shot in Times Square, carrying this young  child to safety, it would warm anyone's heart.  [[Page H2258]]    We know how hard they work and how much they care for their  communities.   But, unfortunately, some have gone so far as to create a dangerous  movement, known as defund the police, that demonizes the police,  imperils our public safety, and needlessly divides our communities.   My priorities in Congress are to support law enforcement and bring  our communities back together. We must move beyond the divisive and  damaging rhetoric, mend the relationships between police and the  communities they serve, and give our police officers the legal  protections and tools they need to do their jobs safely and  effectively.   We have done some of this in our community, and I want to highlight  just one chief of police, Mark Williams, from the city of Utica, who  has worked extensively in community policing programs, which has  tremendously brought down the crime rate in terms of interactions with  police. We still have challenges out there, but he is working hard to  try to invest in community policing programs.   We need money and resources to do that, and we would not be  successful if we actually defunded the police and didn't give them the  opportunity to work with these communities to recruit people, people in  the neighborhoods who want to protect their own communities and who  actually care.   Toward these objectives, I look forward to working with my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle. We have to solve these problems. It is  essential to our safety. It is an essential role of government to keep  us safe. Our constituents are depending on us.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for doing this. I  really appreciate the effort.
