 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I was privileged to be able to  pay my respects to Representative John Lewis as he lay in state in the  Capitol Rotunda--a fitting place for an American hero.   His death is a loss, but his dauntless courage and deep conviction  have carved out for him a permanent place in American history. When we  tell stories of those who have made America greater, John Lewis's name  will always be among them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, Senate Republicans introduced  the next phase of our coronavirus relief effort, the Health, Economic  Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools Act, or the HEALS Act.   This bill has been carefully targeted to address the most pressing  issues facing our Nation right now: getting kids back to school,  getting workers back to work, and ensuring that we have the healthcare  resources necessary to defeat the virus.   The HEALS Act will provide economic incentives to help businesses  retain workers. It will give additional support to hard-hit small  businesses. It will provide checks to American families to help them  weather the economic challenges that they are facing. It will give  schools more than $100 billion to help them safely reopen so kids and  college students aren't missing out on the academic, social, and  emotional benefits of in-person learning.   It will direct funds to diagnosis, vaccines, and treatments. It will  ensure that medical professionals, small businesses, and school  districts doing their best to protect Americans don't face frivolous  lawsuits from predatory trial lawyers.   It will provide incentives for manufacturing personal protective  equipment in the United States to help ensure that we never again face  the kinds of shortages we have seen with the coronavirus. And more.   Now it is time for Democrats to come to the negotiating table so that  we can arrive at a bipartisan bill and get this relief into the hands  of Americans. I was disappointed to hear of the Democratic leader's  partisan screeds yesterday and today on the Senate floor, although I  did appreciate his ability to--with a straight face, I might add-- simultaneously characterize Republican relief efforts as insufficient  while touting a House bill that mentions the word ``cannabis'' more  often than the word ``job'' and actually contains less money for  schools than the Republican bill.   No one is going to get everything they want with this bill, and  Democrats are not going to be able to implement their socialist wish  list, but if we work together, we can get real relief into the hands of  Americans. I hope the Democrats will join us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, during New York's toughest moments during  the pandemic, medical professionals from around the country came to  hard-hit New York City to help. They formed an essential part of the  city's medical response, and they undoubtedly saved lives. They are  deserving of New York's profound gratitude--and apparently of something  else: tax bills. That is right. In May, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  announced that New York would be levying income tax on any money these  medical professionals made while they were there.   Now, individuals can generally receive a tax credit in their home  State for income tax paid to another State, thus avoiding double  taxation of their income, but since New York has one of the highest  income taxes in the country, a lot of these medical professionals will  be facing a higher than normal tax bill on any money they earn in New  York. The situation is even worse for residents of States without an  income tax, like my home State of South Dakota. Medical professionals  from those States will simply have to absorb the full cost of this  unexpected bill.   The healthcare workers who traveled to New York are not alone in  facing a complicated tax situation. For Americans who regularly spend  limited time working in different States throughout the year, the  situation can be even worse. A traveling nurse, for example, or a  corporate trainer might work in not just one but several additional  States during a given year, and navigating the resulting income tax  situation can be incredibly complicated.   Some States, like New York, aggressively tax individuals they deem to  have earned income within their borders, even if the income in question  is just the salary they earned from their employer while attending a 2- day training conference in the State. Other States allow nonresidents  to work for longer periods--as long as 60 days in some cases--before  they require an individual to file an income tax return.   Navigating different States' requirements can be a real burden for  both employees and employers and can discourage interstate commerce. It  is particularly challenging for small businesses, which frequently lack  the in-house tax staff and tracking capabilities of larger  organizations.   This situation cries out for a solution. For the past four  Congresses, I have introduced legislation--the Mobile Workforce State  Income Tax Simplification Act--to create a uniform standard for mobile  workers. Under my bill, if you spent 30 days or fewer working in a  different State, you would be taxed as normal by your home State. If  you spent more than 30 days working in a different State, you would be  subject to that other State's income tax in addition to the income tax  in your home State. Having a universal rule like this would make life a  lot easier for workers and for employers.   In June I introduced an updated version of my mobile workforce bill-- the Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act, which I am pleased to announce  [[Page S4531]]  has been included in the HEALS Act, the phase 4 coronavirus relief  package the Republicans introduced yesterday. Like my original mobile  workforce bill, the Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act would create a  uniform, 30-day standard governing State income tax liability for  mobile workers, but my new bill goes further and addresses some of the  particular challenges faced by mobile and remote workers as a result of  the coronavirus.   The Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act would establish a special 90- day standard for healthcare workers who travel to another State to help  during the pandemic. This should ensure that no healthcare worker faces  an unexpected tax bill for the contributions he or she makes to  fighting the coronavirus.   My new bill also addresses the possible tax complications that could  face remote workers as a result of the pandemic. During the coronavirus  crisis, many workers who usually travel to their offices every day have  ended up working from home. This doesn't present a tax problem for most  employees, but it does present a possible problem for workers who live  in a different State than the one in which they work.   Workers who live in a different State from the one in which they work  are subject to income tax from both States, but under current State tax  laws, they usually pay most or all of their State income taxes to the  State in which they earn their income rather than their State of  residence. However, now that some workers who usually work in a  different State have been working from home, there is a risk that their  State of residence could consider the resulting income as allocated to  and taxable by it as well. That could mean a higher tax bill for a lot  of workers.   My bill would preempt this problem by codifying the pre-pandemic  status quo. Under my bill, if you plan to work in North Carolina but  had to work from home in South Carolina during the pandemic, your  income would still be taxed as if you were going into the office in  North Carolina every day, just as it would have been if the pandemic  had never happened.   Relief for mobile workers is a bipartisan idea. A version of my  original mobile workforce bill has passed the House of Representatives  multiple times, and the only reason it hasn't advanced so far in the  Senate is because of the opposition of a handful of States that  aggressively tax--you have got it--temporary workers.   Now that the pandemic has highlighted the challenges facing mobile  workers and the potential challenges facing remote workers, I am  pleased that my legislation will be considered here in the Senate as  part of the broader coronavirus relief package that we hope to pass in  the next couple of weeks. I am grateful to Chairman Grassley for his  support for this legislation.   It is unconscionable--unconscionable--that we would allow healthcare  workers who risked their own lives to care for individuals in  coronavirus-stricken States to be punished with unexpected tax bills.  We need to make sure that Americans who work from home to help slow the  spread of the virus don't face a complicated tax situation or an  unexpectedly high tax bill as a result.   Americans have faced enough challenges over the past several months.  Let's make sure tax problems are not among them.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
