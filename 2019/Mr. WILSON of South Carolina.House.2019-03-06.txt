 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1,  rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the  Congressional Bulgaria Caucus, I appreciate Ambassador Tihomir  Stoytchev and Mrs. Lubka Stoytchev for their hosting a reception  yesterday in recognition of National Day of the Republic of Bulgaria at  the Library of Congress, celebrating 141 years of liberation.   Bulgaria is a close strategic ally and partner of the United States.  This month, we celebrate 15 years since Bulgaria joined the NATO  alliance.   During his time recently in Sofia, NATO Secretary General Jens  Stoltenberg noted: ``Bulgaria has contributed to strengthening the  Alliance.'' He also thanked Prime Minister Boyko Borissov for his  government's commitment to reach the NATO defense spending goal of 2  percent.   I am confident the partnership between the United States and Bulgaria  will continue to grow in the years ahead. It will be mutually  beneficial to promote peace through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
