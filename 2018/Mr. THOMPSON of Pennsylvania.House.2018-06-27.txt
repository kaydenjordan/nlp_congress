 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the service of Colonel John P. Lloyd, commander of the Pittsburgh  District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   Colonel Lloyd assumed command of the Pittsburgh District on July 29,  2016. As the commander, he is responsible for carrying out the  district's mission within the Ohio River basin, which includes more  than 328 miles of navigable waterways on the Allegheny River,  Monongahela River, and upper Ohio River.   The Pittsburgh District's 26,000 square miles include portions of  western Pennsylvania, northeastern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, western  Maryland, and southwestern New York. Colonel Lloyd oversees 23  navigation locks and dams, 16 multipurpose flood damage reduction  reservoirs, 80 local flood damage reduction projects, and other  projects to protect and enhance water resources.  [[Page H5753]]    Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of getting to know Colonel Lloyd  during his tenure as commander of the Pittsburgh District, and he is a  true public servant. He oversaw the Task Force Power Restoration effort  in Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria tore through in 2017. He  mobilized and deployed a specialized team of Army Corps personnel to  rebuild the island's electrical system of power generation,  transmission, and distribution.   Colonel Lloyd's team worked with FEMA, the Department of Energy, the  power industry, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and other  stakeholders to restore more than 85 percent of Puerto Rico's prestorm  power grid within 5 months. He displayed truly remarkable leadership.   Colonel Lloyd also took the time to travel to my district to meet  with the Punxsutawney Borough Council to discuss modifications for its  levees.   His expertise is second to none, and we have been fortunate enough to  have Colonel Lloyd at the helm in the Pittsburgh District.   Prior to his assignment in Pittsburgh, Colonel Lloyd served in a  variety of engineer command and leadership positions, including  battalion commander of the 19th Engineer Battalion at Fort Knox,  Kentucky. Before that, he served as the Army fellow assigned to the  Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, Hawaii.                                time  1015    Colonel Lloyd is a man with numerous military awards and decorations,  and the accolades surely do match his commitment and dedication to his  job.   I wish Colonel Lloyd the best as he departs the Pittsburgh District  for his next assignment. He has done an outstanding job for the  citizens of northwestern Pennsylvania, and it has been an honor and a  privilege to get to know this fine individual over the past 2 years.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I welcome Megan  Smith to the Capitol. Megan is the winner of the Pennsylvania Fifth  Congressional District's Congressional Artwork Competition.   The annual art competition, organized by the Congressional Institute,  showcases the artwork of high school students across every  congressional district in the country.   Megan just graduated from Bellefonte Area High School earlier this  month. Her artwork titled, ``Spoons,'' is a drawing of five different  spoons on top of blue, pink, and white collage paper.   All of the winning pieces will be displayed for the year in the  Cannon tunnel where they will be viewed by Members of Congress, staff,  and the many visitors of the Capitol every day.   I am looking forward to spending time with Megan and her parents at  this afternoon's reception where she and her fellow winners from across  the country will be honored for their work.   I congratulate Megan and all of the students who participated in the  competition, and I am excited to see all of the new artwork hanging in  the tunnel.                            ____________________
