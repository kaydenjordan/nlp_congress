 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I hope that later this evening we will be  able to have a vote that would allow us to open the government back up  and recommence negotiations on immigration and a whole range of other  issues that are currently of concern to Members here and, I think, of  concern, fairly, to the American people. So I hope we will have the 60  votes that are necessary to do that when we have that vote later today.   In fact, what we will be voting on later today has been modified from  what was originally sent over from the House, which was a 4-week  continuing resolution. This, I believe, will be a 3-week continuing  resolution, modified at the request of some Democrats here in the  Senate. I hope we can get the government up and functioning again. It  is really important, in my view, that we do that.   There has been a lot of discussion throughout the course of the  afternoon here on the floor and in the previous days leading up to this  about who is to blame and all that sort of thing. I don't  [[Page S417]]  think the American people, frankly, care much. They just want to see  their elected officials work together to get results.   The one thing I will point out--because a number of my colleagues  here on the Democratic side have spoken earlier today and consistently  said that this is President Trump's fault somehow--is that the  President of the United States doesn't appropriate a single dime. That  is not his authority under the Constitution. That is the authority of  the Congress. That is our article I power. Congress has the ability to  appropriate funds. The President of the United States--let me repeat-- cannot appropriate a single dime. So the idea that this is somehow the  President's fault is completely missing the point and is simply an  attempt to try and dodge responsibility.   I would also point out, as many of our colleagues have come down here  today and tried to blame the President and tried to blame Republicans,  or whatever, that I think the American people get this, and it seems  like the news media seems to get it. These are headlines.   This is from the Associated Press: ``Senate Democrats derail bill to  avert shutdown.''   New York Times: Senate Democrats blocked passage of a stopgap  spending bill to keep the government open.   Bloomberg: Senate Democrats block GOP funding plan as shutdown kicks  in.   Those are just a few of the coverages of this by the media.   The point I would make is that I think it is not being lost on people  outside this Chamber what is happening here. This is purely an attempt  to hijack the Senate over a debate on an issue which, frankly, doesn't  have an urgent deadline. There is nothing that says we have to have the  issue of DACA solved tomorrow, or even the day after that. There is a  deadline in March, and there were good-faith negotiations under way  between Republicans and Democrats in the House and in the Senate to  resolve that issue, and it is an issue which, frankly, needs to be  resolved. There is great sympathy on both sides of the aisle here in  the Senate for how to deal with those young people who were brought  into this country illegally, through no fault of their own--a  tremendous amount of sympathy, I would say. The President has said he  wants to see that issue resolved, which is why those negotiations and  discussions were under way--the House of Representatives and the  Senate, Republicans and Democrats. Bicameral, bipartisan negotiations  were under way to address that issue.   The other thing that was included in the funding resolution, of  course, was an extension--a reauthorization--of the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which I think pretty much everybody here supports.  There may be some who would vote against that, but I doubt it. I think  it enjoys broad bipartisan support. It is a 6-year extension. That is  something we needed to get done as well. That is included in this  funding resolution that the Democrats are objecting to.   Now, one of the reasons for objecting, interestingly enough, as I  listened this afternoon, was that it should have been done last year.  Yes, OK, so does that mean we can't vote for it now? We have a fix in  place. We have a solution in place, a 6-year reauthorization of the  CHIP program. I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. When we reported  it out, it was 5 years. So it has added an additional year. There is a  6-year reauthorization of CHIP, and all of a sudden now, Democrats say:  We can't. I don't know why we are voting on it now; we should have  voted on it last year.   When does it become too late in the game to solve a problem that  needs to be solved?   I think, notwithstanding their assertions this afternoon on the  floor--that somehow that ought to prevent us from moving forward with  that legislation or give them an excuse to vote to shut down the  government--that that is just beyond me. I find it incredibly hard to  believe.   The other thing that was pointed out, which the Democrats have said,  is that they have made this about DACA, which I get. It is an issue  that they are very passionate about and, as I said before, there is  passion on both sides about that issue, and there is a real desire to  find a solution. But I am not sure that you are in the best position to  find that solution in the middle of a government shutdown.   I want to point out what Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, said  back in 2013. This was on a Sunday morning talk show, ABC's ``This  Week,'' in the context of the 2013 shutdown. Senator Schumer said then:         Basically, it's sort of like this. Someone goes into your       house, takes your wife and children hostage and then, says,       let's negotiate over the price of your house. You know, we       could do the same thing on immigration. We believe strongly       in immigration reform. We could say we're shutting down the       government, we're not gonna raise the debt ceiling, until you       pass immigration reform. . . . It would be governmental       chaos.   It was governmental chaos in 2013, according to Senator Schumer then,  now the Democratic leader--governmental chaos to shut the government  down or hold the government hostage and try to get another issue  addressed. Interestingly enough--it is almost prescient here--he made  that same argument about immigration. He went on to say that there are  Democrats here.         We could do the same thing on immigration. We believe       strongly in immigration reform.    Of course, at the time that the shutdown happened in 2013, it had to  do with ObamaCare, and, in fact, the roles were reversed or flipped in  that situation. It was the Republicans, and, frankly, President Obama  at the time did a fairly effective job of pointing out, as I am  pointing out right now, that he can't appropriate money. That is the  role of the Congress.   But the point is, at that time, the Democratic leader thought it  would create governmental chaos to shut the government down, and it  should not be done to try to solve some other unrelated issue. Yet here  we are, 2 days into a government shutdown that could have been totally  avoided. We had a vote a couple of nights ago--a bipartisan vote, I  might add--to keep the government open.   So what do we have so far? The House of Representatives has sent a  resolution to fund the government, to keep the government open, and to  give us some additional time now to resolve some of these outstanding  issues, including the DACA issue. The President of the United States  has expressed support for that funding resolution to keep the  government open. He has made it very clear that he wants the government  to stay open. He has also made it very clear that he wants a solution  on DACA and is willing to engage in conversations and discussions about  how to resolve that issue.   Then, we had a vote in the Senate, which was bipartisan--a bipartisan  majority in the Senate. Five Democrats joined Republicans here in the  Senate on a resolution to keep the government open and functioning, and  to keep it from shutting down.   So we have bipartisan support in the Senate for that--majority  support--and the House of Representatives and the President are all on  record. The only thing right now preventing us from opening up the  government and getting back to where we were, discussing and debating  those issues, and to extending health insurance coverage to 9 million  children in this country--the only thing standing in the way of that-- is the Senate Democrats.   So I am hopeful that this evening, when the time comes to vote, we  will have a sufficient number of Democrats here in the Senate who will  join with Republicans. We had a bipartisan majority, as I said, Friday  night on the vote, but we didn't have the 60-vote threshold necessary  to keep the government from shutting down. Now it is going to take 60  votes to open it back up. I am hoping there will be Democrats who will  find their way to see that this does create, as Senator Schumer  described, governmental chaos--a situation in which it is very  difficult for people to see clearly and to have a fair, reasonable,  thoughtful discussion about how to solve big issues like DACA--a  discussion, which, as I pointed out, is already under way.   It is pretty clear what is going on here. The media understands it.  The American people, I think, understand it. And attempts by our  colleagues on the other side to obfuscate it or try to dodge it or try  to run away from it or deflect it or create some other shiny object for  people to look at just aren't going to work. It is clear. It is a  matter  [[Page S418]]  of record. It is a vote. We had the vote once on Friday. We will have  another vote tonight, another opportunity for Senate Democrats to go on  the record and say: We aren't going to shut this government down; we  are not going to keep this government shut down, and we are going to  move forward in a reasonable way to deal with the issues that we think  need to be dealt with on behalf of the American people--not in the  middle of a crisis mode or, as described by Senator Schumer, in the  middle of governmental chaos.   Let's get on with that. Let's have the vote, and let's hope that we  have a bipartisan 60-vote threshold that will allow us to get this  government back open and get these discussions and negotiations back on  track.   I yield the floor.
