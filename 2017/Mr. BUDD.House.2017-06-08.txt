 Mr. Chairman, I draw a distinction between political costs  and real costs. In no city in the country are the political costs  treated as more real than Washington. But the truth is that for the  other 99 percent of the country, the real costs are what count.                                time  1430    The real costs of the Durbin amendment have been amply documented.  Community banks have seen interchange revenue fall 20 percent. The low- income consumer has seen his checking fees double. The small-ticket  merchant has seen his interchange cost increase.   For those of us who campaigned on a platform of free markets and  limited government, which is most of our party, I suggest that a  principle that is followed only when it costs nothing is not much of a  principle at all.   The principle that government shouldn't be setting prices, ended up  having a political price of its own. And for some, that was the only  reality of this debate. I only wish that I could say the same for the 1  million people the Durbin amendment has driven out of the banking  system.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.
