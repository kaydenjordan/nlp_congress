 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for  yielding the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is here in the Capitol today. The  President of Ukraine left his war-torn country to come to the United  States to plead for our help in repelling Putin's murderous and  unlawful invasion, in protecting his people, and in preserving their  democracy.   As he did so, Putin unleashed a devastating missile attack on Kyiv  and was captured on video drinking champagne and toasting the downfall  of Ukraine if its Western allies falter.   President Zelenskyy came here to ask the United States to stand tall  and honor its commitment to an ally, its commitment to democracy, and  its commitment to upholding international law. In response, the United  States House of Representatives is debating the merits of chocolate  milk.   We will not long remember the MAGA majority's great gas stove war of  2023 or their attempts to make it easier to kill the endangered lesser  prairie-chicken, but the sad fact is, these bills have consumed weeks  of precious floor time this year as the House majority struggles to  pass any legislation of note.                                time  1230    The world will, however, remember if the United States fails to  support Ukraine in its hour of need.   President Zelenskyy, our NATO allies, and the American people should  expect better from this Congress. Under this extremist majority, they  are doomed to disappointment, which again brings us here today to  debate chocolate milk.   When I was home this past weekend, I had the chance to talk with many  of  [[Page H6830]]  my constituents. I met with women small business owners to discuss  their challenges. I talked to college students about their concerns  regarding attacks on reproductive freedom here in the United States. I  gathered with people in our community who have lost loved ones,  neighbors, and friends to gun violence, and I listened to their calls  for action on commonsense gun safety legislation.   Overwhelmingly, people came to talk to me about making our country a  place where all Americans, all children, can thrive. That means  bringing down the cost of healthcare, childcare, household energy, and  high-speed internet so families can care for their kids, heat their  homes, and stay connected. This means investing in infrastructure,  good-paying jobs, and public education so we can strengthen our  economy, lower costs, build safer communities, and create opportunities  so everyone has a shot at a brighter future.   These are the things I came to Congress to do.   In these last legislative days of the year, these aren't the things  that House Republicans are doing. I would call it unbelievable except  we have seen the same story play out over and over again in this  Chamber all year.   For months on end, MAGA extremists have dragged our country to the  brink of default, nearly shut down the government twice, and even  ousted their own Speaker. Pushed by the most extreme members of their  Conference, they have brought chaos to the House floor. They have put  up bills only for them to tank and have to be withdrawn as they fight  among themselves. They spent 25 days just arguing over which one of  them should be Speaker. This is all on the American people's dime.   Now, with pressing challenges at home and around the world, they are  pushing a completely discredited impeachment inquiry and other naked  political stunts, all to distract from their own inability to govern.  They have done nothing to deliver for the American people, and  Americans deserve better than this.   House Republicans refuse to get their act together. Today, they have  brought to the floor two misguided and marginal bills that fail to  address any of the major threats or concerns our country or our  constituents face. Both bills open the door to the influence of more  special interests in our government's functions.   I should note that, today, we were supposed to consider two  additional bills impacting our national security and individual rights.  Due to infighting among Republicans and their own committee chairs,  these measures were pulled last night from the schedule, leaving us  with another wasted day of chaos and incompetence.   The first bill we have today is H.R. 1147, which makes changes to  school nutrition standards in a way that would undermine science and  undo important progress made over the past 13 years.   Schools play an essential role in our kids' health. For so many  children, the meals they get at school represent the majority of  calories and the most nutritious meals they consume all day.   We saw this reality clearly during the first days of the pandemic  when, as schools closed down, the prospect of missed school breakfasts  and lunches threatened the health of children across America.   The meals served in schools are based on the most recent set of  dietary guidelines as determined by child nutrition experts. These  guidelines stay current and are updated at least every 5 years. In  fact, in February of this year, the Biden-Harris administration began  the latest update.   When I served on my local school board, and before as a Home and  School president, I was involved in efforts to improve and implement  what was at the time new Federal improved nutrition standards for our  district's meals.   Through that experience, I know just how important nutritious meals  are to helping students succeed and form lifelong healthy habits. We  have seen immense benefits since Congress passed the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act in 2010.   The research shows that the millions of children who participate in  school meal programs have better overall diet quality than those who do  not. Studies prove, despite arguments to the contrary, that students  eat and enjoy these meals. When presented with healthy choices, they  take them.   Allowing whole milk, particularly flavored whole milk, to be served  in schools is against current dietary recommendations and against the  recommendation of experts, including the Academy of Nutrition and  Dietetics, the American Heart Association, and the American Academy of  Pediatrics.   We know that too much saturated fat can raise bad cholesterol levels,  a known cause of heart disease. Most troubling, many varieties of  flavored milk that are pushed by this bill contain unhealthy chemicals,  such as artificial colors and flavors, and nearly twice the amount of  sugar as plain milk.   At a time when one in five school-age children already has adverse  cholesterol levels, we should not be making it easier to serve  unhealthier meals in schools.   This bill blatantly ignores the science.   Even if you deny these facts, everyone should be able to admit we are  long overdue for a comprehensive child nutrition reauthorization. We  owe it to students and their families to consistently improve the meals  that schools are serving. The last comprehensive reauthorization of the  laws governing school meal programs was done 13 years ago.   I wish the Republican majority would spend more time helping to pass  comprehensive policies to support our schools as they work to provide  healthier and more satisfying meals to our students within current  nutritional standards. We should not waste time on this one-off change  to serve special interests that circumvent the normal process for  updating meal standards.    I think we owe it to our children, their health, and their futures to  let the experts guide what we are providing them to eat in schools. We  should not allow politicians to make the decisions in what should be a  science-based process.   Today, we are also considering H.R. 357, another attempt by the  Republican majority to derail the Federal rulemaking process. This is  an unnecessary and vague bill designed to undermine the critical work  of Federal agencies.   It is part of a MAGA narrative that unfairly and untruthfully paints  hardworking Federal employees, nonpartisan experts in their fields, as  faceless bureaucrats who are somehow hostile to everyday Americans.   The fact is that the regulatory process that our Republican  colleagues seek to frame as a battle against some vast bureaucratic  conspiracy is actually an essential part of ensuring that we all have  clean air and water to breathe and drink, healthy food to eat, and safe  planes, trains, and automobiles to travel in.   The truth is that Congress already has a wide range of ways to  exercise oversight and control over rulemaking.   If the majority is so concerned about improving the process, they  would join Democratic efforts to ensure corporate interests can't game  that process. They would advocate for incorporating more public  feedback in those agencies' decisions.   They don't really want to make the process better. Instead, bills  like this would create a bottleneck in our government's operations that  will prevent rules that the Republican majority doesn't like.   This bill would politicize the process of confirming nominees to  administrative agencies even more than it is already. Individual  Senators would have even more incentive to block an administration's  nomination for partisan and corporate goals. More corporate influence  would be allowed to infiltrate the Senate confirmation process.  Ultimately, our agencies would be obstructed from doing important work  to protect the American people's health and safety and making  government function better.   It is clear my Republican colleagues don't want to make our  government work better. These aren't traditional conservatives. They  are nihilists dedicated to grinding government to a halt.   With this bill and their previous efforts to decimate Federal  rulemaking, they prefer to upend the regulatory process, even if it  improves the lives of Americans every single day.   The Federal Government has long played an important role in promoting  [[Page H6831]]  the health, safety, and welfare of the American people. We should  ensure that it is able to continue doing so.   Again and again, we have seen this Republican majority prioritize the  wrong things this year, and today is no different. They are using  valuable floor time and committee time to pass marginal bills, enable  their own infighting, and launch an act of petty political vengeance  against the current President. Then, they are going to call it a year  and go home for the holidays. This is an unacceptable way to govern. It  is not governance at all.   Mr. Speaker, I deeply oppose this rule, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The epidemic of gun violence has touched every corner of America,  tragically devastating families, tearing apart communities, and  scarring schoolchildren.   In 2022, nearly 50,000 people died by guns, an average of one person  every 11 minutes. This includes almost 20,000 homicides. Mass shootings  skyrocketed from 272 in 2014 to 645 last year. In 2020, firearms became  the leading cause of death for American children and adolescents. From  2013 to 2022, there was a staggering 87 percent increase in the child  and teen firearm death rate.   In 2023, the heartbreak has only continued. As of today, there have  been over 40,000 lives lost and over 630 mass shootings. Over 800  schoolchildren 11 years old or under have been killed or injured with  guns. Over 4,000 school-age teens have been touched by gun violence.   The American people are crying out for Congress to act. Yet, the  House of Representatives is using its precious time to debate chocolate  milk. The American people deserve better.   House Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to tackle this  epidemic. If we defeat the previous question today, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 715, a bipartisan bill to  require a background check for every firearm sale.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, as well, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   With the rule we consider today, the Republican majority ends a  failed year in the choke hold of its most extreme members. They are  finishing out 2023 as they started: unproductive, ineffective, and  unconcerned for the American people. They have ignored the real  problems facing our Nation today, issues like the gun violence crisis,  ongoing threats to Americans' fundamental freedoms, access to economic  opportunity and good-paying jobs, and threats to our national security.  [[Page H6832]]    They have filled this Chamber with culture wars and conspiracies and  pushed policies that would hurt our children, families, students,  seniors, members of the Armed Forces, and workers. They have turned  their backs on our allies: democracies standing in the breach against  forces that pose serious threats to our own national security. They  have wasted days, weeks, and months with cheap political stunts all to  the detriment and on the dime of our constituents.   Congress is supposed to work for the people, and this is not what the  people sent us here to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to put people over politics and to  oppose the previous question and the rule, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
