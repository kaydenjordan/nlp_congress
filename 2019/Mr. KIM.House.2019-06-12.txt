 Madam Chair, earlier this month, I held a town hall in Toms  River, New Jersey, focused on the opioid and addiction crisis.   At this town hall, and nearly every day since I was sworn in to  represent the Third District of New Jersey, I have heard heartbreaking  stories from people in my community on how they've struggled with  opioid addiction issues.  [[Page H4562]]    The bill we're debating today provides important funding to fight  this epidemic.   This amendment directs that funding to prioritize funding for  medication assisted treatment.   This treatment is proven to make a positive impact in the lives of  those dealing with these issues and proven to save lives.   According to the CDC, more than 70,000 Americans died in 2017 due to  drug overdoses. Reducing that number should be an absolute priority of  this Congress and is the intent of this amendment.   I want to thank Congressman Foster for his leadership on this issue  and urge support and passage.
