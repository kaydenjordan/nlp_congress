 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, and I rise today  for a very special occasion. It is special to me because I have the  opportunity today to acknowledge the friendship that I have had for  some 15 years with a member of this august body but not as a Member of  Congress.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, to pay honor and homage to a great and noble  American, a person who has made a difference in my life. This great and  noble American works here on the floor of the House of Representatives.  I can tell you that she has done her job well. While she is a comely,  courtly, stately lady, she is a person who is well respected. She is  well respected because her job as Assistant Sergeant at Arms requires  her to sometimes approach us when we are out of order.   I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am a recidivist, a repeat offender.  On more than one occasion, she has had to bring me to order. I remember  the first time when I was on my phone, and she came over to me and  kindly asked that I put my phone away. There was a second time, and she  kindly came over to me and said, ``You know better,'' and I did.   I always respected her, and I believe all the Members respect her for  one principal reason, that reason being, Mr. Speaker, of all the people  in Washington, D.C., there are very few who come to work and do not  associate themselves closely with one party or another.   Now, I don't know what her political affiliation is, but I think I  speak for a good many people. Let's just say I speak for myself and  everybody who agrees with me. A good many people believe that she could  be a member of either party because of the way she has treated her job.  She has been exceedingly fair at all times. I believe that she truly  deserves the position that she has as the first African-American woman  to be the Assistant Sergeant at Arms, and that makes her also the only.   She has done her job well. My prognostication is this: While she may  be the first, because of the way she has conducted herself, she will  not be the last.   I would add this, as I come to my close, Mr. Speaker: There are times  when you feel good about what you are doing, yet you are saddened  because you know that something is about to happen that will, at some  point, cause you to lose contact with a friend. I see her on a daily  basis when I am here. Knowing that she is leaving does sadden me, but  knowing that she has set a record for others to follow makes my heart  warm.   I would say to her, you truly have come a long way from the  watermelon patch, the tobacco fields, and Broadway, North Carolina. You  have come a long way.   No one could have prognosticated at your birth that you would sit in  that seat and hold this position, but you are a God-fearing person, and  you have said to me that you believe that it was destiny.   I am proud that you have fulfilled your destiny here, but there are  still greater things for you to do. I want to keep in touch with you,  and I want to be a part of them to the extent that I can.   I want you to know that we appreciate the great job that you have  done. You have served your country well.   You have earned the title the Honorable Joyce Hamlett, the first but  not the last African American to hold the position of Assistant  Sergeant at Arms.   God bless you, and thank you. I have a few special gifts that I will  present to you, and I look forward to continuing to serve you in other  ways.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud Member of  the Congress of the United States of America, always honored to have  this preeminent privilege of standing here in the House of  Representatives in this Chamber, proud to do so, proud to be an  American.   I am one of the persons who likes to stand and sing the national  anthem, stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. However, that is not what  makes America great, having Al Green stand for the Pledge of Allegiance  or singing the national anthem. The thing that makes America great is  that we, Members of Congress, and other persons of good will, will  defend the right of those who choose not to stand for the Pledge of  Allegiance, who stand not to sing the national anthem, nor do they  choose to stand when the national anthem is being played. That is the  greatness of America, that we can tolerate each other when we have  differences.   Tonight, I am proud to be here, Mr. Speaker, proud to stand here and  have this privilege. No one could have predicted at my birth that I  would be here to give this message tonight. This is a special message  that has to do with something happening in my congressional district.   I have in my hand a copy of an article from the Houston Chronicle.  The person who is the writer for this particular article is Juhi Varma,  a very good writer, I must add. Juhi writes,  [[Page H4133]]  and this is the style of the caption, the title, if you will:  ``Missouri City to change street named after KKK leader as fight  against Confederate themes continues.''   I thank Ms. Varma for writing this article because she captures the  very essence of what happened. I would like to give just a brief  recitation, if I may, on some of what I know about this circumstance.   Some years ago, I discovered that we had an area in my congressional  district in a city known as Missouri City, Texas, an area in Vicksburg  Village of Shiloh, a subdivision with some 200 homes or more, a  subdivision with more than a thousand people, a subdivision that had  streets with Confederate names.   In 2021, 2022, somewhere thereabouts, this came to my attention. A  subdivision in this day and time with Confederate street names. Someone  would say that is not a big deal. Maybe not, but let's explore it.   There was a Confederate Drive, Confederate Court, Confederate South  Drive, and then among the many others, Bull Run Court, Stonewall Court,  Pickett Place. Among them there was also a Bedford Forrest Drive and a  Bedford Forrest Court.   For edification purposes, Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first Grand  Wizard of the KKK. First Grand Wizard. For further information, the  KKK, for those who may not know--my suspicion is that most who will  hear this will know, but the KKK was an organization devoted to  suppressing the rights of African Americans. Devoted. Some might say  they did a pretty good job over the years of suppressing the rights of  African Americans.   We have these streets with the names that I have articulated and some  others, but we have these streets. I took it upon myself to engage with  the mayor and council about changing the names. This is when I  discovered that to change the names you had to have at least 90 percent  of the residents to sign off on it, 90 percent.   Well, 90 percent is a good number, but it is not a good number if you  are trying to get the name of a street changed, I found, because it was  most difficult to get it done. I went out personally and talked to  people about getting the names changed, and it was very difficult, to  say the very least. I won't say it was impossible, but we didn't get  any names changed at the 90 percent level.    We got a new mayor and council, a mayor and council with persons who  were a little bit more sensitive to the issue. There was a  Councilmember Boney, a councilmember who is a historian, lay historian,  and who understood what these names meant, a councilmember who decided  that he was going to do something about this.   I am proud to say that Councilmember Jeff Boney was able to lower the  threshold from 90 percent to 70 percent. At the 70 percent threshold,  we were able to get some names changed.   We had a couple living in the neighborhood, the Gilbos, they were out  front in getting names changed. Let's just reflect for a moment before  I continue with the Gilbos and others in the neighborhood on this. One  of the chief proponents of leaving the names as they were was a person  of African ancestry.   I personally talked to this person, tried to convince the person that  it would be appropriate to get names that would be more inclusive, as  Ms. Varma has mentioned in her article. The person said to me: The  people shouldn't have bought the land. They knew what the name was when  they bought it, and they shouldn't have bought homes in that  neighborhood.   I choose not to live in a neighborhood that has streets with  Confederate names. I choose not to live in a city that has streets with  Confederate names. I choose not to live in a country that has streets  with Confederate names. That is why I am doing what I can to change  these names. I don't think we ought to have a street, especially one  with people of color--I would imagine all people of good will would  agree that we ought not have a street named after the first Grand  Wizard of the KKK, but everybody is entitled to their opinion.   We worked through the process with Councilmember Boney, who took the  lead to lower the threshold so that we could change some names.  Confederate Drive under his leadership, and with the aid and assistance  of the residents, especially the Gilbos, Rhonda and Beau, the  Confederate Drive street was changed to Prosperity Drive. That is where  they live now. They didn't want to live on Confederate Drive.   Confederate Court was changed to Prosperity Court, Confederate South  Drive to Prosperity South Drive. I thought that after the name changed  from Confederate to Prosperity, I thought after that name change, we  would have little difficulty changing the name from Bedford Forrest  Court and Bedford Forrest Drive to some other names.   I thought that there would be little challenge to these two with a 70  percent threshold. I thought that people would gladly change the names.  Regardless of their station in life, it just seemed to me that in the  United States of America, liberty and justice for all, an inclusive  country, the country I love, where I say the Pledge of Allegiance, sing  the national anthem, I just thought that it would be relatively simple  to move on these streets with this name. How wrong I was. How wrong I  was.   After much work, time, energy, and effort, the name Nathan Bedford  Forrest--actually Bedford Forrest, Nathan wasn't there--was not  removed. Thank God for Councilmember Boney. He went back to the  council, and the council had to lower the threshold to 60 percent. It  was only after we lowered the threshold--I say ``we,'' it was the city  council and the mayor in Missouri City, Texas. The mayor's name is  Elackatt. By the way, he is of Indian ancestry, born in India, mayor in  Missouri City, Texas. It is a wonderful thing to know that we can have,  appreciate, and celebrate this level of diversity.   With that mayor and council, it was lowered to 60 percent. As a  result, the Pearsons, Rodney and Angie, don't have to live on a street  now that bears the name Bedford Forrest.                                time  1815    That name will change on August 7 of this year. It will become  Liberty Way. Liberty Way Drive is the street that they will live on and  there is a Liberty Way Court. But it will become Liberty Way.   Inclusive speaks to something associated with the founding principle  of this country, liberty, justice for all in the Pledge of Allegiance.  That is a wonderful thing to see occurring. Perhaps we will get to Bull  Run Court, Stonewall Court, and some others, Pickett Place, Confederate  General Pickett, or maybe we can get to these in the near future.   But I am proud of what has been done, and I commend Councilmember  Boney. I commend the Pearsons. I commend all of the persons who were  associated with these endeavors, the Gilbos, for what they have done to  bring a sense of justice to the people who live in this neighborhood.   There is something more sinister that has taken place that I want to  call to your attention with reference to this, and the best way to  explain it is to tell you about my flight that I took in from Houston  to Washington, D.C. I fly over 100 times a year.   On this occasion, a couple of weeks ago, I saw a movie while I was on  the plane. It was a movie that was heart-wrenching for me, a movie  about a young man who was born to a father who was a wealthy plantation  owner and a mother who was a slave. The name of the movie is Chevalier.  I won't spoil it for you. I am going to go right to the gravamen of my  message, the heart of this.   The essence of it is this: He was talking to his mother and they were  talking about how evil had caused some physical harm. I won't spoil the  movie for you because I think that it is worthy of seeing. But they  were talking about how evil had caused this harm, physical harm.   His mother said to him, she reminded him, yes, of the physical harm,  but it is really the evil that has impacted our minds that she called  to his attention; how evil had caused people to accept things that were  unacceptable to other people, unacceptable to the masses, but evil can  teach you to accept things.   There were people who accepted the notion that this was all right, to  live on a street named after the first Grand Wizard of the KKK. Evil  can do this. It  [[Page H4134]]  can convince you that what others would not accept and what you would  not accept for them you will accept for yourself.   This gets back to the person that I told you of African ancestry who  was one of the chief proponents of maintaining the names, convinced  that it was okay for people of African ancestry to live on a street  named after the first Grand Wizard of the KKK, but was not convinced, I  assure you, that he or would have anyone live on a street that had a  name associated with the Third Reich.   I wouldn't live to on a street with a name associated with the Third  Reich. I would dare say that there are few people in Congress--there  may be one, but I can't imagine there being one who would tolerate it.   Yet, people who will tolerate living on a street, who happen to be of  African ancestry, will tolerate living on a street named after a Grand  Wizard of the KKK would not tolerate living on a street or having  anyone else live on a street named after someone associated with the  Third Reich.   This is the essence of what this mother was conveying to her son  about the evils and how they can impact the mind. Evil can have a  sinister impact on the mind.   Unfortunately, in this country, the country I love, for too long we  have allowed ourselves to be disrespected, our ancestors to be  disrespected. We have allowed the enslavers to be revered and the  enslaved to be reviled.   Our minds have been corrupted to the extent that we find it  acceptable to send our children to a Lee high school named after a  Confederate general but would not dare send our children to a high  school named after someone associated with the Third Reich. I wouldn't  have a child go to one.   Our minds have been corrupted. We tolerate living in a country where  we preach liberty and justice for all, a country founded, to a certain  extent, on the principle of persons having inalienable rights--I think  the way it is stated in the Constitution is unalienable--but  inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet,  we, many people of color, accept what we would not accept for others  under other circumstances.   I marvel at how we have arrived in the year 2023 and we have a  building on the campus, on this campus, named after a person who was a  white supremacist, a person who fought against anti-lynching laws, a  person who fought integration, a person who was a segregationist, and  we have a building named after this person and we, people of color,  tolerate it.   I am a one-person protest. I do not go in the building unless I am  going there to protest; and, of course, I am talking about the Russell  Office Building.   Richard Russell is the person of whom I speak, the person who was one  of the coauthors of the Southern Manifesto. Richard Russell, the Senate  has a building named after Richard Russell.   I have here what we refer to as the Conscience Agenda. The third item  on this agenda is to remove Richard Russell's name. Taxpayer dollars,  my dollars, taxpayer dollars ought not be on the name of a building  that would honor a bigot and a racist, Richard Russell.   Here is the amazing thing about this, other than the fact that we  have persons of African ancestry who will accept it, who could do  something about it, but accept it.   Here is the amazing thing. The United States Senate changed the names  on military bases, changed the names of Confederate generals, removed  them. In concert with the House and the signature of the President, we  did it. We changed the names.   The same Senate that has changed the names on these military bases  named after and in honor of Confederate generals, that same Senate will  not take Richard Russell's name off of the Russell Senate Office  Building. Same Senate.    It shows a lack of respect. The Senate ought to be ashamed. The  building itself is a symbol of shame. I marvel at how this has been so  accepted that it is commonplace.   People just walk in and out of the building like it is any other  building. The Richard Russell Office Building. The same Senate that  took the names off of these Confederate bases, names on military bases  named after Confederate soldiers, usually generals, the same Senate has  not removed this name.   Now, the question becomes why. Here is what I have been told. I have  been told that the Senate can't agree on another name; this is why the  Senate will not remove the name that is offensive to me and many of my  friends and relatives. They said they can't agree on a name.   But I have a solution. Let it revert to the name that it had before  it became Richard Russell. Let it revert to the Old Senate Office  Building, and then choose any name you want. Take as much time as you  need, but you can change the name.   I beg the Senate, and I demand of the Senate that you do not just the  right thing but do the righteous thing and remove Richard Russell's  name from this office building, just as you have done it for military  bases around the country. This would be the honorable thing to do.   Members of the Senate, you dishonor the flag when you do this,  liberty and justice for all. You dishonor the anthem. Stand up for  justice. Stand up for people of color who are offended by this name.   I am grateful for the time. I want the persons who make it possible  for me to have the time to know that I appreciate them. I also want  people to know that I love my country, and I love it enough to want to  see the best of it and remove the notion that we can tolerate this  level of injustice being perpetrated on a daily basis by people who  have the power to change it almost overnight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 27 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, July 28, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
