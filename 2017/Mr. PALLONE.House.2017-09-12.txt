 Mr. Speaker, last week I was outraged when President  Trump announced that he would be ending the DACA program. DACA  recipients are contributing members of our society, have no criminal  record, and have known only this country as home. They work at leading  American companies. They have served our country in the military.   On the day of the President's decision, I met with several young  people at Rutgers University in my district who may now face  deportation. I was impressed by their courage in coming forward to tell  their stories and to challenge the President's reckless action.   Some examples: Yeimi, a 17-year-old from Freehold, left Mexico when  she was 1 year old. She said at the meeting I had: ``I do want to  become something in life, because that is why I am here. I do not want  this dream to be shattered because DACA, apparently, is going to be  killed.''   Then there is Alma, a 23-year-old from Perth Amboy in my district,  who added: ``DACA has opened doors for me that I never knew existed.  The elimination of this executive order without an appropriate  replacement would not only be devastating for DREAMers but to the  country as a whole.'' And I agree with Alma.   Mr. Speaker, these New Jerseyans embody the best America has to  offer, and I will continue to stand by their side as we work together  to protect their DACA status. We need to pass the Dream Act as quickly  as possible.                            ____________________
