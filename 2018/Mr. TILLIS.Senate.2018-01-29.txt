 Mr. President, I am here to talk about a vote we will be  considering later this afternoon on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act.   I thank Senator Graham and my fellow cosponsors on the bill. I think  it is a very important bill. I think it is a balanced bill as it is a  bill that has the support of the vast majority of the American citizens  and would make us consistent with all but only seven other nations in  terms of restricting abortions to a limited number of exceptions after  20 weeks. Those exceptions would be a threat to the life of the mother,  someone who may have been raped, or someone who may have been the  victim of incest.   This is a balanced bill, and it is a policy that most of the world  population agrees should be in place. I think it is our job to make  sure this restriction is put into place, with medical science today  suggesting that after 20 weeks an unborn child can experience pain,  while still allowing for the choice of the mother. We could discuss  different opinions about that in the earlier terms but certainly after  20 weeks. I think this is balanced policy and is something I hope my  colleagues will support and ultimately send to the President's desk.   I was speaker of the house in North Carolina for 4 years. We worked  on commonsense changes to protect the lives of the unborn, changes that  also received the support of the majority of North Carolinians. This is  just another example of where we at the Federal level can enact a law  that I think can help us to demonstrate that the life of the unborn is  a precious life. We as Members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress  are tasked with making sure we protect all lives in America. This is  just a very important, precious, helpless part of the population. I,  for one, think this is a great, modest step forward, and I encourage  all of the Members to support it.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.
