 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a number of  points--first of all, to acknowledge the killing and mass murder in El  Paso, in Dayton, and in Odessa. I think it is calling upon this  Congress not only to pray but to do, and I plan to do.   Let me also indicate that this is the Year of Return, 400 years that  enslaved Africans came to the United States. Millions were enslaved and  came. From 1789 to 1865, the institution of slavery was  constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned.   I am glad to have been part of a historic trip to Ghana with my  colleague and the Speaker of the House to honor the Year of Return and  thank the Ghanan leadership for its welcoming of those of us who came  to honor that history, although tragic with the loss of life and the  issue of wealth being created in this Nation.   Let me also remind our colleagues that we are glad that our neighbors  in the Southeast survived, but I want to remind us of the devastation  in the Bahamas. We must not let our neighbors suffer. We must rise up  with funding. We must recognize that they are our neighbors. We must  deal with immigration laws, and we must be receptive, Mr. Speaker, to  helping them get back on their feet. I know this Congress and this  House will work together when our fellow neighbors are suffering the  way they are suffering.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee for anchoring this Special Order recognizing the 400th  anniversary of the first slave arriving in America.   Four hundred years ago the first slave arrived in America, ships set  sail from the west coast of Africa and in the process, began one of  mankind's most inhumane practices: human bondage and slavery.   For two centuries, human beings--full of hopes and fears, dreams and  concerns, ambition and anguish--were transported onto ships like  chattel, and the lives of many forever changed.   The reverberations from this horrific series of acts--a transatlantic  slave trade that touched the shores of a colony that came to be known  as America, and later a democratic republic known as the United States  of America--are unknown and worthy of exploration.   Approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved  in the United States and colonies that became the United States from  1619 to 1865.   The institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily  sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through  1865.   American Slavery is our country's original sin and its existence at  the birth of our nation is a permanent scar on our country's founding  documents, and on the venerated authors of those documents, and it is a  legacy that continued well into the last century.   While it is nearly impossible to determine how the lives touched by  slavery could have flourished in the absence of bondage, we have  certain datum that permits us to examine how a subset of Americans-- African Americans--have been affected by the callousness of involuntary  servitude.   We know that in almost every segment of society--education,  healthcare, jobs and wealth--the inequities that persist in America are  more acutely and disproportionately felt in Black America.   This historic discrimination continues: African-Americans continue to  suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships  including but not limited to having nearly 1,000,000 black people  incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the current white  unemployment rate; and an average of less than 1/16 of the wealth of  white families, a disparity which has worsened, not improved over time.   A closer look at the statistics reveals the stark disparity in these  areas.   Black household wealth is less than one fifth of the national  average.   The median black household had a net worth of just $17,600 in 2016.  Yet in that same year, the median white house hold held  [[Page H7556]]  $171,000 in wealth while the national household median was $97,300.   The black unemployment rate is 6.6 percent, more than double the  national unemployment rate.   Approximately 31 percent children live in poverty, compared to 11  percent of white children. The national average is 18 percent which  suggests that the percentage of black children living in poverty is  more than 150 percent the national average.   In the healthcare domain, the disparities suffered by African  Americans is also troubling.   Over 26 percent of African Americans do not have health insurance,  compared to a national average between 8.8 percent and 9.1 percent.   One in four African American women are uninsured.   Compared to national average, African American adults are 20 percent  more likely to suffer from asthma and three times more likely to die  from it.   Black adults are 72 percent more likely to suffer from diabetes than  average.   Black women are four times more likely to die from pregnancy related  causes, such as embolisms, and pregnancy-related hypertension, than any  other racial group.   In our nation, among children aged 19-35 months, black children were  vaccinated at rates lower than white children: 68 percent versus 78  percent respectively.   Education has often been called the key to unlocking social mobility.   African American students are less likely than white students to have  access to college-ready courses.   In fact, in 2011-12, only 57 percent of black students have access to  a full range of math and science courses necessary for college  readiness, compared to with 81 percent of Asian American students and  71 percent of white students.   Black students spend less time in the classroom due to discipline,  which further hinders their access to a quality education.   Black students are nearly two times as likely to be suspended without  educational services as white students.   Black students are also 3.8 times as likely to receive one or more  out-of-school suspensions as white students.   In addition, black children represent 19 percent of the nation's pre- school population, yet 47 percent of those receiving more than one out- of-school suspension.   School districts with the most students of color, on average, receive  15 percent less per student in state and local funding than the whitest  districts.   And, of course, we cannot consider the disparities between black and  white in America without considering the intersection of African  Americans and the Criminal Justice system.   There are more Black men in bondage today who are incarcerated or  under correctional control, than there were black men who were enslaved  in the 1800s.   The United States locks up African American males at a rate 5.8 times  higher than the most openly racist country in the world ever did:   South Africa under apartheid (1993), African American males: 851 per  100,000   United States (2006), African American males: 4,789 per 100,000   Incarceration is not an equal opportunity punishment. For example,  incarceration rates in the United States by race were:   African Americans: 2,468 per 100,000   Latinos: 1,038 per 100,000   Whites: 409 per 100,000   African American offenders receive sentences that are 10 percent  longer than white offenders for the same crimes and are 21 percent more  likely to receive mandatory-minimum sentences than white defendants  according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.   Looking at males aged 25-29 and by race, you can see what is going on  even clearer:   For White males ages 25-29: 1,685 per 100,000;   For Latino males ages 25-29: 3,912 per 100,000;   For African American males ages 25-29: 11,695 per 100,000. (That's  11.7 percent of Black men in their late 20s.)   Overall, one in 50 murders is ruled justified--but when the killer is  white and the victim is a black man, the figure climbs to one in six.   A handgun homicide is nine times more likely to be found justified  when the killer is white and the victim is a black man.   Hand gun killings with a white shooter and a black male victim  exhibit an even more dramatic bias: one in four is found justified.   But then again, we knew these inequities existed I because for many  Black Americans, these disparities are just a part of daily life.   This is why, in 1989, my predecessor as the most senior African  American on this September Judiciary Committee, the honorable John  Conyers, a past Chairman of this Committee introduced H.R. 40,  legislation that would establish a commission to study and develop  proposals attendant to reparations.   Though many thought it a lost cause, John Conyers believed that a day  would come when our nation would need to account for the brutal  mistreatment of African-Americans during chattel slavery, Jim Crow  segregation and the enduring structural racism endemic to our society.   I would like to take this moment to personally thank the estimable  John Conyers for his work on this legislation for the last thirty  years.   With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression  during the Trump administration, the discussion of H.R. 40 and the  concept of restorative justice have gained more urgency, garnering the  attention of mainstream commentator, and illustrating the need for a  national reckoning.   H.R. 40 is intended to create the framework for a national discussion  on the enduring impact of slavery and its complex legacy to begin that  necessary process of atonement.   The designation of this legislation as H.R. 40 is intended to  memorialize the promise made by General William T. Sherman, in his 1865  Special Field Order No. 15, to redistribute 400,000 acres of formerly  Confederate owned coastal land in South Carolina and Florida,  subdivided into 40 acre plots.   Since its introduction, H.R. 40 has acted to spur some governmental  acknowledgement of the sin of slavery, but most often the response has  taken the form of an apology.   However, even the well intentioned commitments to to examine the  historical and modern day implications of slavery by the Clinton  administration fell short of the mark and failed to inspire substantive  pubic discourse.   Since my reintroduction of H.R. 40 at the beginning of this Congress,  both the legislation and concept of reparations have become the focus  of national debate.   For many, it is apparent that the success of the Obama administration  has unleashed a backlash of racism and intolerance that is an echo of  America's dark past which has yet to be exorcised from the national  consciousness.   Commentators have turned to H.R. 40 as a response to formally begin  the process of analyzing, confronting and atoning for these dark  chapters of American history.   Even conservative voices, like that of New York Times columnist David  Brooks, are starting to give the reparations cause the hearing it  deserves, observing that ``Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to  execute, but the very act of talking and designing them heals a wound  and opens a new story.''   Similarly, a majority of the Democratic presidential contenders have  turned to H.R 40 as a tool for reconciliation, with 17 cosponsoring or  claiming they would sign the bill into law if elected.   Though critics have argued that the idea of reparations is unworkable  politically or financially, their focus on money misses the point of  the H.R. 40 commission's mandate.   The goal of these historical investigations is to bring American  society to a new reckoning with how our past affects the current  conditions of African-Americans and to make America a better place by  helping the truly disadvantaged.   Consequently, the reparations movement does not focus on payments to  individuals, but to remedies that can be created in as many forms  necessary to equitably address the many kinds of injuries sustained  from chattel slavery and its continuing vestiges.   To merely focus on finance is an empty gesture and betrays a lack of  understanding of the depth of the unaddressed moral issues that  continue to haunt this nation.   While it might be convenient to assume that we can address the  current divisive racial and political climate in our nation through  race neutral means, experience shows that we have not escaped our  history.   By passing H.R. 40, Congress can start a movement toward the national  reckoning we need to bridge racial divides.   Reparations are ultimately about respect and reconciliation--and the  hope that one day, all Americans can walk together toward a more just  future.   We owe it to those who were ripped from their homes those many years  ago an ocean away; we owe it to the millions of Americans- yes they  were Americans--who were born into bondage, knew a life of servitude,  and died anonymous deaths, as prisoners of this system.   We owe it to the millions of descendants of these slaves, for they  are the heirs to a society of inequities and indignities that naturally  filled the vacuum after slavery was formally abolished 154 years ago.   And let me end as I began, noting that this year is the 400th  commemoration of the 1619 arrival of the first captive Africans in  English North America, at Point Comfort, Virginia.   Let us proceed with the cause of this morning with a full heart, with  the knowledge that this work will take time and trust.   Let us also do with the spirit of reconciliation and understanding  that this bill represents.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to help address the harm that  slavery has had on our nation by supporting H.R. 40.  [[Page H7557]]                                ____________________
