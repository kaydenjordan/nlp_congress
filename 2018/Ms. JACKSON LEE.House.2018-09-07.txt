 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate one of my  great school districts. I have many in my congressional district, but I  particularly want to cite the Houston Independent School District  suffering from Hurricane Harvey and under the threat of the Texas  Education Agency to be closed.   What a state of mind for parents and children, many of whom have been  displaced.  [[Page H7925]]    Now, let it be very clear, there are a number of school districts in  my congressional district, and I salute them all and the teachers and  students; but in this instance, over the past couple of months, there  was a question of, on opening day, would six or seven schools of HISD  be closed.   I always went throughout the community to the meetings when I was in  the district, and the refrain was: The schools will not be closed.   I am an optimist. I believe in our children and our teachers. And on  August 27, a few days before, the TEA had indicated that the test that  the children take, the scores that came out in early August, that they  had passed, and the schools that were in jeopardy of closing were not  going to close, and others had been given an extension because of the  devastation of Hurricane Harvey and the complete displacement of our  children.   So on that opening day of August 27, I went to four or five of my  schools. I went with the mayor and the school board members, and I  thanked them and our great school superintendent, because a lot of the  work attributed to their success, TEA noted it was the great  superintendent that we have in HISD. And I believe we should keep her.  She is doing an excellent job.   Congratulations to the children, the teachers, the school district,  because our children are our most precious resource.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I will take the opportunity to say good morning to the manager of the  bill, my co-member on the House Judiciary Committee. I start this way,  Mr. Speaker, and to my colleagues, because I always want to emphasize  when I am on the floor that the Judiciary Committee has had many  instances of bipartisanship.   I am very glad to have been on the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations Subcommittee for more than a number of  years. I have seen our work, and it has certainly been in a bipartisan  mode.   I want to acknowledge the chairman of the committee, Mr. Goodlatte,  and the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Nadler. In many instances  on the crime reform issues, we have tried to work hand-in-hand  together.   It seems that criminal justice reform has partners on both sides of  the aisle. It is certainly an issue that draws a vast number of  stakeholders, particularly my friends in the faith community; social  justice community; my friends in the libertarian community, if you  will; and, certainly, giants like the ACLU, the Lawyers' Committee, and  many others that have been engaged in these issues, the NAACP Legal  Defense Fund. So you can see that we bring people together.   So I rise to discuss H.R. 6691, the Community Safety and Security Act  of 2018, which amends section 16 of title 18.  [[Page H7927]]    Section 16 sets forth the universal definition of what constitutes a  crime of violence for the entirety of the criminal code. Therefore,  this definition is critically important, and I am deeply concerned that  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are introducing such an  important amendment in such a hasty, precipitous manner.   Although my colleagues claim that the introduction of this bill has  not been hasty and that it has been vetted for months on their side of  the aisle, on our side of the aisle, we have had no engagement.   This bill has been laid before us for 7 days. Last Friday, it was  singly introduced when Members were not here and, as well, before a 3- day weekend.   Let me be very clear. Criminal justice reform is not a sausage. We  would work over the months and years with academic experts; victims;  law enforcement--that is our family; and beyond, our prosecutors; our  law enforcement; and, certainly, the Sentencing Commission, for  example; our judges. We are concerned about thei viewpoints.    So I know there may be one or two who have written and may be  supporting this, but this is not the way we get to the floor.   H.R. 6691 would expand the definition of crimes of violence in  section 16 in two ways: enumerating certain offenses that do not  currently exist under Federal law, and it would have been good to have  a hearing or a series of hearings on this to be recognized for crimes  of violence for Federal purposes; and by adding alternative definitions  to already-existing Federal offenses, in order to have these new  definitions also qualify as Federal crimes of violence.   Again, here is the trigger: More and more people incarcerated maybe  could find another way of addressing these questions, even by law  enforcement.   The Supreme Court recently decided Sessions v. Dimaya, holding that  subsection (b) of section 16, known as the residual clause, is  unconstitutionally vague. Subsection (a) in the Dimaya case left  untouched defines a crime of violence as one that requires as an  element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force  against the person or property of another.   In response to Dimaya, my colleagues are now putting forth a bill to  substitute subsection (b) for a list of crimes of violence, many of  which have no element involving the use, attempted use, or threatened  use of force.   In addition, even the residual clause stricken down by Dimaya  requires that a crime of violence at least be a felony. H.R. 6691  strips away the felony requirement.   For these reasons, this bill radically amends section 16. We go back  to the old days of throwing everybody in jail.   This bill does not just list a few statutes that are obvious crimes  of violence. It enumerates at least 32 separate crimes, some of which  are not Federal crimes. It even offers alternative definitions for  several Federal crimes. This requires careful consideration.   How dare anyone suggest that anyone on this side of the aisle is soft  on crime. Some of my best friends, as we have heard others say in other  settings, are law enforcement. I speak to my police officers every time  I see them in the district. I am talking to the command frequently.  Sometimes I congratulate them for a successful capture of a dastardly  criminal.   Obviously, many of those crimes are State laws. But I know the State  of Texas has been working to reduce the numbers of persons  incarcerated. There is no doubt with law enforcement who the bad actors  are. On the Federal level, it is the same.   But here we are, with a 1-week-old baby that has not been vetted and  helped and nurtured to be able to make it work. This is serious work  that we do here. So rather than proceeding through regular order by  having a hearing to ascertain the relevant information from experts  that will help us establish the best approach for dealing with the  constitutionality of section 16, and the Federal definition of crimes  of violence, we have been given 1 week to vote, with no markups to  allow amendments germane to the bill's purpose.   Mr. Speaker, regular order is not a crime. Instead of taking the time  to fashion a definition that takes into consideration the many legal  ramifications of changing this term as proposed, the bill's sponsors  are haphazardly pushing forward an overly expansive definition of crime  of violence for political purposes.   Where are my civil libertarians? Where are my persons who believe in  the Constitution, due process?   The bill is overbroad; two, unnecessary; and three, it could have  substantial harmful effects.   First, the bill is overbroad and includes in its list of crimes of  violence a number of offenses that have no element of violence or force  at all. No one likes burglary, but burglary, for example, is included  in the enumerated list of crimes of violence, though it would simply  mean remaining in a building without authorization and, while there,  forming the attempt to commit even a minor, nonviolent offense.   Likewise, the bill lists coercion through fraud as a violent felony,  though violence plays no part in that criminal offense.   The bill would also make simple assault a crime of violence, even in  the circumstances where the underlying act is merely a push or a shove.   None of us applaud any of that, but we recognize in this vast country  that our citizens have basic rights. One of the more egregious examples  of an offense listed as a crime of violence is fleeing by automobile,  which is knowingly operating a motor vehicle and failing or refusing to  comply with a law enforcement officer's signal to bring the motor  vehicle to a stop, or fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement  officer. This definition does not even require intent to elude law  enforcement.   Under this bill, what could have amounted to a traffic violation is,  instead, a crime of violence.   It doesn't mean that we do not utilize these elements, but we are  able to have vetted it in a way that truly is the crime that law  enforcement seeks to protect themselves against and the public against.   Another specific area of concern is in the context of juvenile  justice. If the Federal Government is prosecuting a juvenile, this bill  would authorize the government to seek the transfer to adult court of  someone as young as 15 years old if they were accused of committing a  felony crime of violence. That may be a burglary, unintentionally in a  building. We note where teenagers are and how they behave.   Under this new definition is even interference with a flight crew or  an argument with a flight attendant over a Diet Coke.                                time  0930    And we want safety everywhere, on the highways and byways, throughout  our neighborhoods and schools. We want to make sure that we attend to  this, but this is serious work and it should have been done in regular  order.   The consequences of H.R. 6691 are dangerous, especially as we look to  the new attitude of the Justice Department, which is charging on every  offense. Unlike the comprehensive and collaborative manner previously  utilized in the past administration, working with faith leaders,  working with law enforcement, working with advocates for social and  criminal justice, U.S. attorneys were directed to not charge up, to  focus on the highest crime.   Now we have the tendency to use a sprawling, overbroad definition of  violent crime to justify more arrests and prosecutions and long prison  sentences.   Has anybody met an ex-felon, many of them wanting to do right? I see  a lot of them where good businesses have hired them. They want their  head down, they want to work, they want to get an apartment, they want  to support their family. They are not interested in going back again,  nor are they interested in being accused of a minor offense and being  ``felonized,'' if you will.   Second, a new definition of ``crime of violence'' is unnecessary,  even in light of Dimaya. The court in Dimaya held that the residual  clause is unconstitutional, but left in place subsection a. While  perhaps not an ideal formulation, subsection a can, for now, suffice as  a placeholder until Congress can undertake a more deliberate approach.  Even so the Senate would have a companion bill, which to our knowledge,  it does not. It is important to take note of the fact.   Third, changing the definition of a crime of violence can have other  harmful effects; for example, it could have  [[Page H7928]]  significant exclusionary effects for criminal justice reform  legislation. There is proposed legislation that excludes people  convicted of a crime of violence from pretrial release considerations,  expungement of crimes, and receiving visitors. So it would exclude  people convicted of a crime of violence from pretrial release  consideration, expungement of crimes, and receiving visitors while in  custody. Unnecessarily expanding who is ineligible for these provisions  is both unwise and counterproductive.   So as I have indicated, it is important that when we work together,  we must work together through the goals of reforming our criminal  justice system, which Congress has acknowledged needs dire fixing.  Let's work together.   I am pushing for the revisions of criminal justice reform for  juveniles. Reforming the juvenile justice system that locks up  juveniles forever and ever because they are not sentenced in many  instances. Certainly there are few juveniles in the Federal system, but  in our State systems. And when we use the bully pulpit, States begin to  reform their systems.   In addition, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, ACLU, Center for  American Progress, and several others have opposed this bill.   We are on the Judiciary Committee. We believe in justice. Along with  the advocates, we need true experts, and we are experts on these  subject matters. And we are troubled by the reckless speed in which  this bill was brought to the floor.   We understand the intent. We welcome it. But I have listed the  fractures, the problems, the undermining of due process, the throwing  the key away on good people who want to do better or who did not intend  to exercise some of the elements that are in this bill.   So I ask my colleagues in this instance to recognize that this is too  fast and to vote ``no'' on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 6691, the ``Community Safety and  Security Act of 2018,'' which amends section 16 of Title 18.   Section 16 sets forth the universal definition of what constitutes a  ``crime of violence'' for the entirety of the criminal code.   Therefore, this definition is critically important and I am deeply  concerned that my colleagues on the other side are introducing such an  important amendment in such a reckless manner.   Although my colleagues claim that the introduction of this bill has  not been hasty and that it has been vetted for months, on this side we  have had this bill for seven days. It was introduced exactly one week  ago today, on the day before a three-day weekend. That is reckless.   H.R. 6691 would expand the definition of crimes of violence in  section 16 in two ways: (1) by enumerating certain offenses that do not  currently exist under Federal law to be recognized as crimes of  violence for Federal purposes; and (2) by adding alternative  definitions to already-existing Federal offenses in order to have these  new definitions also qualify as Federal crimes of violence.

The bill would also make simple assault  a crime of violence even in circumstances where the underlying act is  merely a push or a shove.   One of the more egregious examples of an offense listed as a crime of  violence is ``fleeing by automobile'' which is ``knowingly operating a  motor vehicle and--(A) failing or refusing to comply with a law  enforcement officer's signal to bring the motor vehicle to a stop; or  (B) fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer.'' This  definition does not even require an intent to elude law enforcement.  Under this bill, what could have amounted to a traffic violation  becomes, instead, a ``crime of violence''.   Another specific area of concern is in the context of juvenile  justice. If the Federal government is prosecuting a juvenile, this bill  would authorize the government to seek transfer to adult court of  someone as young as 15 years old if they are accused of committing a  felony ``crime of violence'' under this new definition--even for  something as minor as getting in an argument with a flight attendant  over a Diet Coke.   The consequences of H.R. 6691 are dangerous, especially in the hands  of a Sessions Justice Department, which has displayed a general  tendency to use a sprawling, overbroad definition of violent crime to  justify more arrests and prosecutions and longer prison sentences.   Second, a new definition of crime of violence is unnecessary, even in  light of Dimaya. The Court in Dimaya held that the residual clause is  unconstitutional, but left in place subsection (a). While perhaps not  an ideal formulation, subsection (a) can for now suffice as a  placeholder until Congress can undertake a more deliberate approach,  instead of the reflexive one proposed by H.R. 6691.   Third, changing the definition of a crime of violence can have other  harmful effects. For example, it could have significant exclusionary  effects for criminal justice reform legislation. There is proposed  legislation that excludes people convicted of a crime of violence from  pretrial release considerations, expungement of crimes, and receiving  visitors while in custody. Unnecessarily expanding who is ineligible  for these provisions is both unwise and counterproductive to the goals  of reforming our criminal justice system, which Congress has  acknowledged needs dire fixing.   Families Against Mandatory Minimum (FAMM), ACLU, Center for American  Progress (CAP), and several other organizations have opposed this bill.   We on the Judiciary Committee, along with advocates that are true  experts on these subject matters are troubled by the reckless speed  with which this bill was brought to the floor today.   We should take the time to explore why.   According to a recent report by the Pew Research Center on January  12, 2018, the number of African Americans in prisons are 33 percent.  The number of Hispanics are 23 percent. Therefore, together they make  up 56 percent of today's prison population.    Mr. Speaker, if I might respond to the gentleman's  presentation.   Due process is denied and could be denied, based upon the fact that  there is no element of the offenses that are just listed in a laundry- list type. That would come about if we had done this in an extensive  manner of review.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory  Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law and a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, reserving the status quo is the very  point we are making, that the status quo is the unclarity, if you will,  and, therefore, it is important that we pursue this in a manner of  constructively understanding what is the best approach to protect the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), the vice ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, if I might inquire how many speakers  the gentlewoman from Georgia has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, earlier I indicated the work of the  Judiciary Committee, and it has been enhanced by the ranking member,  Mr. Nadler. We have worked on criminal justice issues bipartisanly, and  I want to thank Mr. Nadler for doing so. That is the tragedy of this  legislation.  [[Page H7931]]    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, sometimes vagueness is the extinguishing of  constitutional rights. I know, and I will have the numbers, that the  predominant numbers of incarcerated persons throughout the Nation are  African Americans and Hispanics. That is men and women. A rising number  of women are being incarcerated, some of them tied to crimes of their  boyfriend, husband, or other significant other.   Juveniles are also being incarcerated throughout the State system.   Mass incarceration is a big deal, so it behooves us to be diligent.  In this particular bill, yes, Mr. Speaker, it should have been  collaborative and bipartisan, because none of us will yield to a  dastardly criminal act that impacts our constituents or the American  people. But a fact is a fact. This generates racial disparities.   As my friend from California indicated, individuals who put on the  uniform, who may be legal permanent residents, veterans, have the  potential, in spite of the uniform that they put on and their  willingness to sacrifice their life for America, caught in the wrong  situation, could be deported.   This is not to be taken lightly. Frankly, if my friends had studied  the Constitution and read the Supreme Court decision, they would have  seen the statement that Justice Kagan made, and that is that this is  dividing the Federal appellate courts. She raised the question: Does  car burglary qualify as a violent felony under 16(b)? She indicated  that some courts say yes, some courts say no.   She went on to say, residential trespass, what is that? The same is  true. She went on to say, it does not exhaust the conflict in the  courts.    Well, you don't answer the conflict by doing as was stated in the  Families Against Mandatory Minimums letter dated September 6. On  substantive grounds, H.R. 6691 has the potential to have severe  unintended consequences on sentencing in our justice system writ large.   Under this bill, seemingly nonviolent offenses will be considered  violent offenses, for example, under H.R. 6691, burglary of an  unoccupied home. How many teenagers--I am not condoning that--may we  find in an unoccupied home? I am not condoning burglary, but it would  be considered a violent offense.   Burglary is a serious offense, but should it be considered violent if  the perpetrator does not even interact with another person? Yes, they  should be prosecuted. But you have in this bill violent offense.   Then, of course, in this legislation, legal service providers who  filed an amicus brief, these are the guys and ladies who are our public  defenders who see these people every day--the indigent, and many of  them minority--they wind up, as everyone says, up the road in these  large, massive prisons, and their lives are ruined because we have not  fixed the criminal justice system.   Legal service providers who filed the amicus brief in the Dimaya case  described the different applications of subsection (b) of section 16  across Federal circuits, using the example of residential trespass,  which was considered a crime of violence by the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals but not by the Seventh Circuit. This bill does little to  resolve the inconsistent way courts apply the crime of violence based  on subsection (b) because it includes vague definitions of offenses and  creates definitions for the same crimes that differ from those  currently in the criminal code.   That is a denial of due process, and that is not taking on this  important issue. As was mentioned, there is a list of important  elements. I support the fact that these are difficult and a terrible  dilemma. But it can be done in a manner that is preferable, and that is  through unceasing commitment and effort.   Mr. Speaker, this is why we are here today having different  positions. I cannot yield to what will be claimed as individuals who do  not understand how important this bill is when I know the young African  American men and young men of color who are entrapped in this system,  and that the better approach and the better angels are for us to do  comprehensive criminal justice reform and, I might add, immigration  reform as well.   But let me indicate that we support victims of crime, especially  those who are victims of violent crimes. We want relief for them.   This bill dangerously leads to overcriminalization, and we should not  take the task of amending the definition of ``crime of violence''  lightly.   In the Rules Committee, we addressed overcriminalization and mass  incarceration. Representative Torres aptly stated that we should not  proceed with haste, which will further exacerbate the overcrowdedness  in our prisons.   One Member suggested, in the Rules Committee, just build prisons,  that is how we stop this criminal siege, as indicated, even though the  FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics have indicated that crime is  going down.   Yes, we have our concerns. Even conservative groups that work with  these very complicated and important criminal justice reform issues,  like the Cook Foundation and Right on Crime, do not agree that building  more prisons is the answer. Right on Crime states that, by reducing  excessive sentence lengths and holding nonviolent offenders accountable  through prison alternatives, public safety can often be achieved.   We recognize that the violent perpetrators should be incarcerated. If  that is the case, I would stand with my colleague.   I would also stand with the Mothers of the Movement who saw their  sons gunned down, in that we need to have relief in that direction.   There are many issues of criminal justice reform that should be on  this floor--as I mentioned, sentencing reduction and juvenile justice  reform--but we have not come to that point.   So I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues vote ``no,'' because  as Justice Kagan said in her opinion, the interpretation of crime and  violence has divided the Federal appellate courts because the answer is  not obvious. Therefore, we must carefully consider the alternatives to  the approach prepared in this bill. We must do more than eliminate  vagueness. We must achieve a just and fair result.   Nothing in this Supreme Court opinion, nothing, says, go alone, put a  bill on the floor for 1 week, give Members no chance to amend, try to  deny due process, build more prisons, make sure that the disparities of  those who go into our jails rises and goes up, rather than giving our  young people opportunities, a fair chance, and justice. So I ask my  colleagues to oppose this bill.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the ACLU, the  Center for American Progress, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the  National Center  [[Page H7933]]  for Lesbian Rights, and immigrant rights organizations ranging from the  National Immigrant Justice Center to others.                                                           ACLU,                                                  September 6, 2018.      Re The ACLU Says Vote NO on H.R. 6691 Community Safety and           Security Act of 2018.       Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), we write to urge       you to vote NO on H.R. 6691, the Community Safety and       Security Act of 2018. H.R. 6691 is overbroad and expands the       definition of a ``crime of violence'' to include a number of       offenses that have no element of violence which will further       fuel mass incarceration for low level offenses. The ACLU will       include your vote on The Community Safety and Security Act in       our voting scorecard for the 115th Congress.        For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's       guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and       communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and       liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United       States guarantee everyone in this country. With more than 2       million members, activists, and supporters, the ACLU is a       nationwide organization that fights tirelessly in all 50       states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. for the principle       that every individual's rights must be protected equally       under the law, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual       orientation, disability, or national origin.        The Community Safety and Security Act is a flawed attempt       to address the unconstitutionally vague definition of a crime       of violence after the Supreme Court's decision in Dimaya v.       Sessions. To the contrary, the bill does not fix the       vagueness issue, but actually renders the statute even less       clear and concise than the unconstitutional language that the       Supreme Court struck down.        h.r. 6691 will exacerbate mass incarceration by expanding the                    definition of ``crime of violence''         While H.R. 6691 amends only one definition, it has far       reaching impact. The definition of ``crime of violence'' in       18 U.S.C. Sec. 16 is referenced throughout U.S. Code in       various contexts including in immigration law. Amending the       definition of a ``crime of violence'' would expand the impact       of a number of federal sentencing provisions as well as       impact pretrial detention decisions. It would allow for       severe, costly, and punitive sentences to apply to low level       crimes, and could prevent people accused of misdemeanors from       being released pretrial. This hastily drafted legislation       would have wide, costly, and harmful consequences.                        vagueness has not been solved         While attempting to address the vague language found       unconstitutional in Dimaya, this bill creates even more       statutory uncertainty in its wake. In the Dimaya decision,       sub-section (b) of Section 16 was declared unconstitutionally       vague in the immigration context due to the arbitrary and       unpredictable decisions that were sure to result from its       wording. H.R. 6691 however, creates new, imprecise       definitions of crimes, adding confusing and ambiguous       language to the statute.        Perhaps most concerning is this bill's inclusion of conduct       and offenses unrelated to actual violence in a definition for       a ``crime of violence.'' For example, the definitions of       fleeing, coercion, burglary, and carjacking in H.R. 6691       would include within their list of qualifying conduct for a       ``crime of violence'' acts without threats to or actual       bodily harm. The definition of coercion for example, includes       coercion by fraud, carrying no risk of actual bodily harm,       threatened bodily harm, or fear of bodily harm to the victim.       By not connecting behavior that is actually violent to the       meaning of a ``crime of violence'' the legislation diminishes       the meaning of violence and opens the door for people       convicted of low level, nonviolent offenses to face the same       severe sentences as those convicted of more serious offenses.        Legal services providers who filed an amicus brief in the       Dimaya case described the different application of subsection       (b) of Sec. 16 across federal circuits, using the example of       residential trespass which was considered a ``crime of       violence'' by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals but not by       the Seventh Circuit. This bill does little to resolve the       inconsistent way courts applied the ``crime of violence''       based on subsection (b) because it too includes vague       definitions of offenses and creates definitions for the same       crimes that differ from those currently in the criminal code.        For instance, this legislation offers new and alternative       meanings to carjacking, fleeing, coercion, and extortion       among others without amending the respective criminal code to       make them consistent. The definition of carjacking in the       bill expands the language to include acts without intent to       cause death or serious bodily harm as well as acts that are       considered merely unauthorized use of a vehicle. The most       confusing and ill-advised expansion in the bill is       ``fleeing'' as a ``crime of violence'' offering one       definition of the offense as simply failing to comply with an       officer's signal to pull over. On top of being somewhat       confusing and vague, these new definitions could include       routine traffic stops and joyriding. This bill is so broad as       to include acts considered nonviolent while creating a       numerous conflicting definitions of the same conduct.        Instead of attempting to expand the definition of crime of       violence to the point of rendering the word ``violent''       meaningless, a more thoughtful approach would be to adopt the       U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines list of ``crimes of       violence'' in Sec. 4B1.2 that hold true to the meaning of       ``violent'' while solving the vagueness issue found in       Dimaya. Sec. 4B1.2 offers a definition of ``crime of       violence'' as ``a murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping,       aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson,       extortion, or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm       described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5845(a) or explosive materials       defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 841(c).''   h.r. 6691 is duplicative and excessively punitive when applied to cases                              of deportations         The term ``crime of violence'' is included in one of the       harshest provisions of our immigration laws--triggering       mandatory detention and leading to deportation with little to       no due process. By expanding the existing ``crime of       violence'' definition, H.R. 6691 would lead to generally non-      violent offenses--such as communication of threats or simple       assault (which could include minor offenses such as spitting       on another person)--triggering no-bond detention and       deportation. Currently, immigrants who have had contact with       the criminal justice system are often subject to harsh and       overbroad immigration penalties. Residents who have lived       here for decades, including lawful permanent residents, can       face deportation for minor offenses like shoplifting or using       a false bus pass. Given there is already an exhaustive list       of crimes that are addressed by current immigration laws,       this bill is unnecessary, duplicative, and excessively harsh.       At a time when resources are limited and the public is       concerned with over-criminalization, this bill would expand       the way in which our laws criminalize immigrants and       communities of color.                                  conclusion         H.R. 6691 would impose a sweeping and unwise expansion of       what are known as ``crimes of violence'' that would have       significant and wide-ranging impacts on immigrant communities       and communities of color and further burden our failing       criminal justice system.        For these reasons, the ACLU urges you to vote ``No'' on       H.R. 6691 the Community Safety and Security Act of 2018. If       you have any additional questions, please feel free to       contact Jesselyn McCurdy, Deputy Director.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        National Political Director, National Political Advocacy       Department.      Jesselyn McCurdy,        Deputy Director, Washington Legislative Office.                                   ____                   [From the Center for American Progress]                Community Safety and Security Act--H.R. 6691                                   analysis         The Center for American Progress is deeply concerned about       H.R. 6691, a bill to amend Title 18, United States Code,       which purports to clarify the definition of a ``crime of       violence'' in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 16. The bill was written in       response to the Supreme Court's decision in Dimaya v.       Sessions, which held that subsection (b), known as the       ``residual clause,'' is unconstitutionally vague. Yet,       instead of taking time to fashion a definition that takes       into consideration the many legal ramifications across       federal proceedings of changing this term, the bill's       sponsors are recklessly pushing forward a definition of a       crime of violence for political purposes. The bill is       unnecessary, overbroad, and could have substantial harmful       effects.        The bill is overbroad and includes in its list of crimes of       violence a number of offenses that have no element of       violence at all. Burglary, for example, is included in the       list of crimes of violence though it is defined as the       unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building. Likewise, the       bill lists coercion through fraud as a violent felony though       no element of violence is part of that criminal offense.       Simple assault is also considered a violent crime even in       circumstances where the underlying act was merely a push or       shove.        One of the more egregious examples of an offense listed as       a crime of violence is ``fleeing'' which is described as       ``knowingly operating a motor vehicle and, following a law       enforcement officer's signal to bring the motor vehicle to a       stop, (A) failing or refusing to comply; or (B) fleeing or       attempting to elude a law enforcement officer.'' Depending on       factual circumstances, this provision elevates what could       have amounted to a traffic violation to a crime of violence.        The bill dangerously expands the definition of violent       crime which leads to overcriminalization. Every existing       definition of a crime of violence in federal law or for       federal purposes includes as an element the use, threatened       use, or attempted use of force--see 18 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 924(c)(3), 3156; Uniform Crime Reports. But H.R.       6691 omits this crucial and basic requirement. The       consequences are  [[Page H7934]]       dangerous, especially in the hands of a Sessions Justice       Department which has displayed a general tendency to use a       sprawling definition of violent crime to justify more arrests       and prosecutions and longer prison sentences. The residual       clause, while expansive, at least had the requirement that       the crime of violence be classified as a felony that involves       a substantial risk of force against person or property, but       even that requirement has been removed by H.R. 6691.        A new definition of crime of violence is unnecessary, even       in light of Dimaya. The Court in Dimaya held that the       residual clause is unconstitutional but left in place       subsection (a) which defines a crime of violence as ``an       offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or       threatened use of physical force against the person or       property of another.'' While not an ideal formulation, it can       for now suffice as an adequate placeholder until Congress can       undertake a more deliberate approach instead of a reflexive       one.        H.R. 6691 could have significant exclusionary effects on       federal criminal justice laws and legislation. Carelessly       expanding the definition of a ``crime of violence'' will       change criminal procedures under current law and lead to more       people being unnecessarily detained both pretrial and post-      conviction. This goes against bipartisan efforts to reform       the criminal justice system. For example, proposed       legislation such as H.R. 4833 (Bail Fairness Act); H.R. 5043       (Fresh Start Act); and H.R. 5575 (Pathway to Parenting Act)       bars people convicted of a crime of violence from pretrial       release considerations, expungement of crimes, and receiving       visitors. Expanding the definition of a crime of violence       would exclude some of the very people meant to be helped by       these bills.                                   ____                  [From Asian Americans Advancing Justice,]                           AAJC Opposes H.R. 6691         Asian Americans Advancing Justice--AAJC, a national civil       rights organization, urges Members of Congress to vote NO on       the House Community Safety and Security Act (H.R. 6691)--a       measure that would dangerously expand the definition of a       ``crime of violence'' to include many offenses that have no       element of violence at all, leading to overcriminalization       and unnecessary detention.        This bill's overly broad definition opens the door to a       massive increase in people being unjustifiably detained both       pre-trial and post-conviction because the bill omits the       crucial requirement that a ``crime of violence'' involve the       use, threatened use, or attempted use of force. Such severe       adverse consequences are highly likely to occur, especially       since the Department of Justice has exhibited an alarming       tendency to use an overly broad definition of a violent crime       to justify increased arrests, prosecutions, and harsher       prison sentences.        Congress owes a duty to the American public to carefully       craft a definition of a ``crime of violence'' that takes into       consideration the many harmful legal consequences that might       flow from changing such a key term. Instead of following a       reasoned, deliberate approach to lawmaking, the sponsors of       this bill have hastily proposed a damaging definition that       would frustrate current bipartisan efforts to reform the       criminal justice system.        We oppose any expanded definition of ``crime of violence''       that would criminalize at-risk and marginalized communities.       We need more fairness and relief within our criminal justice       system, not less. This bill would disproportionately harm       communities of color, including Southeast Asian refugees who       are already being deported in high numbers for old criminal       convictions. A new, sprawling definition for ``crime of       violence'' would have negative ripple effects for community       members' eligibility for immigration relief, further fueling       Trump's draconian, anti-immigrant enforcement agenda.        We urge Congress to stand with us against this harmful and       reckless bill.

Dear Member of Congress: The National Center for Lesbian       Rights urges you to vote ``No'' on HR 6691, Community Safety       and Security Act of 2018. This bill would only serve to       exacerbate mass incarceration and racial inequality in our       country. The bill vastly broadens the scope of the federal       term ``crime of violence,'' a definition with sentencing       repercussions throughout the federal criminal code.       Additionally, because the term is also referred to in various       immigration statutes, the bill would also expand the already       vast category of crimes that render even lawfully present       immigrants subject to immigration mandatory detention and       deportation.        This bill will likely lead to more lesbian, gay, bisexual,       transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people being incarcerated or       detained, where they are more likely to experience violence       than non-LGBTQ people. Currently LGBTQ people, especially       those of color, are disproportionally incarcerated due to       higher rates of poverty and to a history of anti-LGBTQ       discrimination, including by law enforcement. For adults 40%       of incarcerated women and 9% of incarcerated men are sexual       minorities. Additionally, one in eight transgender people       have been incarcerated; among transgender women, that number       jumps to one in five. The rate of incarceration is higher for       transgender people of color, with one in four trans Latinas       and nearly half of Black trans people experiencing       incarceration. In the last year, transgender people were       incarcerated at twice the rate of the general population,       with Black (9%) and American Indian (6%) transgender women       being the most impacted.        Incarceration exposes LGBTQ people to verbal, physical, and       sexual harassment and abuse. LGBTQ prisoners are       significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison,       with 12% of gay and bisexual men and 40% of transgender       people reporting a sexual assault in 2011. In a survey of       LGBTQ inmates, 85% of respondents had been placed in solitary       confinement--many purportedly for their own protection--and       approximately half had spent two years or more in solitary.       LGBTQ, and especially transgender inmates are often denied       needed medical care while incarcerated including transition-      related care, HIV-related care, and mental and behavioral       care. In the previous year 37% of transgender people who were       on hormone treatment were denied medication once       incarcerated. Furthermore, LGBTQ individuals held at federal       immigration detention centers are 97 times more likely to be       sexually assaulted than other detainees.        By causing more people to be deported, this bill will lead       to LGBTQ immigrants being sent back to countries where they       have little to no legal rights and are more likely to       experience anti-LGBTQ violence and possibly death. Nearly 80       countries criminalize same-sex relationships and many without       explicit laws remain very dangerous for the LGBTQ community.        We urge you to vote ``No'' on HR 6691, because this bill       would hurt LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ people, especially those who       are of color and immigrants. As a community that experiences       high rates of violence, LGBTQ people understand the important       of addressing violence in our communities. However,       incarceration is not the solution to violence. Instead,       Congress should support community-based prevention strategies       and address the structural causes of violence.

The       bill vastly broadens the scope of the federal term ``crime of       violence,'' a definition with sentencing repercussions       throughout the federal criminal code. Because the term is       also referenced in one of the harshest provisions of       immigration law, the bill would also expand the already vast       category of crimes that render even lawfully present       immigrants subject to immigration detention and deportation.       The bill will cause numerous harms, outlined here and       described in detail below:        1. H.R. 6691's expansion of Section 16 of Title 18 of the       United States Code, the definition of a ``crime of       violence,'' will expand the criminal justice and       incarceration systems. Because this definition is cross-      referenced widely throughout the criminal code and       incorporated into federal immigration law, this bill will       trigger a significant expansion of the penalties attached to       even minor criminal conduct in federal criminal court,       exacerbate the mass incarceration crisis, and render even       more immigrants subject to the disproportionate penalty of       deportation.        2. H.R. 6691 broadens the ``crime of violence'' definition       far beyond what the statute included prior to the Supreme       Court's decision in Dimaya, including offenses as minor as       simple assault and as vague as ``communication of threats.''        3. H.R. 6691 will expand the already overly punitive       immigration consequences of involvement in the criminal       justice system by further broadening the already sweeping       list of offenses that constitute an ``aggravated felony,'' in       a manner almost entirely duplicative and sometimes at odds       with other provisions in federal immigration law.        4. If H.R. 6691 became law, there would be serious       questions about its constitutionality.        This bill represents a cynical effort to deepen the       penalties attached to even minor criminal offenses, further       criminalizing immigrants and communities of color. The       Immigrant Justice Network, Immigrant Defense Project,       Immigrant Legal Resource Center, National Immigrant Justice       Center, and the National Immigration Project of the National       Lawyers Guild urge Members of Congress to vote NO on H.R.       6691.    1. H.R. 6691 expands the federal definition of ``crime of violence,''                          with vast ripple effects         H.R. 6691 purports to amend only one provision of U.S.       law--the definition of what constitutes a ``crime of       violence'' as defined at Section 16 of Title 18 of the United       States Code. Section 16, however, serves as the ``universal       definition'' of a ``crime of violence'' for the entirety of       the federal criminal code. The language is cross-referenced       in the definitions and sentencing provisions for  [[Page H7935]]       numerous federal offenses, including racketeering, money       laundering, firearms, and domestic violence offenses.       Additionally, the definition is incorporated into the       Immigration and Nationality Act as one of a list of 21       different types of offenses that constitute an ``aggravated       felony,'' which in turn constitutes a ground of deportability       and a bar to nearly every type of defense to deportation.        Expanding the ``crime of violence'' definition is anathema       to progressive criminal justice reform, criminalizing more       conduct and attaching greater penalties across numerous       provisions of the federal code, all while rendering more       immigrants subject to the double penalty of deportation.    2. H.R. 6691 broadens the ``crime of violence'' definition far beyond    what the statute included prior to the Supreme Court's decision in                                   Dimaya         H.R. 6691 is a solution in search of a problem. Section 16       is written in two sub-parts, (a) and (b). The text of the       statute already broadly defines ``crime of violence'' in sub-      section (a), including any offense ``that has as an element       the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force       against the person or property of another.'' We can assume       that H.R. 6691 was written in response to the Supreme Court's       April 2018 decision in Sessions v. Dimaya, in which the Court       struck down sub-section (b) as unconstitutional in the       immigration context. Section 16(b) includes any felony       offense that ``by its nature'' involves a substantial risk of       the use of such force; in Dimaya, the Court found its       application so vague as to create ``more unpredictability and       arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.'' In       short, the Court found the second half of the statute void       for vagueness, but left the first half intact.        The Dimaya decision remedied significant injustices that       had resulted from the inconsistent and often random       application of section 16(b). Immigration legal service       providers, serving as amid to the Dimaya Court, noted that       the statute's ``only predictable outcomes are continued       disagreements among the courts and continued harms to       immigrants.'' To demonstrate this harmful disparity, amici       described how the offense of residential trespass was       considered a crime of violence under section 16(b) in the       Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, but not in the Seventh       Circuit, which noted the offense could be committing simply       by walking into a neighbor's open door under ``the mistaken       belief that she is hosting an open house . . .''        Now comes H.R. 6691, which proposes to keep section 16(a)       intact while expanding the ``crime of violence'' definition       to encompass dozens of other offenses that are in some cases       given their own new definitions and in others defined via       reference to the existing criminal code. Many of these       offenses move section 16 far beyond its pre-Dimaya scope,       including offenses as minor as spitting on another person.       The bill stretches the imagination by calling generally       nonviolent offenses, such as simple assault, ``communication       of threats,'' and extortion, crimes of violence.      3. H.R. 6691 will expand the already overly punitive immigration  consequences of involvement in the criminal justice system, in a manner  almost entirely duplicative and sometimes at odd with other provisions                         of federal immigration law         The immigration penalties of involvement in the criminal       justice system are already breathtakingly harsh and       overbroad; undocumented immigrants and decades-long lawful       permanent residents alike can face deportation for offenses       as minor as shoplifting, using a false bus pass, or simple       drug possession. Immigration detention and deportation are       frequently imposed as a penalty even in cases where a       criminal court judge found community service or an       entirely suspended sentence sufficient punishment for the       offense committed.        The ``crime of violence'' definition at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 16       is incorporated as one of twenty-one types of offense that       constitute an ``aggravated felony'' as defined at section 101       of the Immigration and Nationality Act. An ``aggravated       felony'' is one of dozens of categories of offenses that       trigger deportation from or preclude entry to the United       States, layered on top of the provisions of federal       immigration law that authorize deportation for those       unlawfully present. The ``aggravated felony'' category is       different, however, because it triggers mandatory no-bond       detention in almost every case and categorically precludes       nearly all immigrants from presenting a defense to their       deportation.        By adding dozens of offenses to the existing ``crime of       violence'' definition, H.R. 6691 therefore grows the already       vast expanse of offenses that render lawfully present       immigrants in the United States subject to immigration       detention and enforcement.        The bill is largely duplicative of other grounds of       removability, in several cases putting forth new definitions       of offenses that are defined in other provisions of the       Immigration and Nationality Act, setting up a nearly       impossible-to-effectuate removal scheme. Many of the offenses       delineated in the bill constitute their own independent       aggravated felony grounds (including, for example, murder and       burglary), their own independent ground of removability       (including, for example, child abuse, stalking, and domestic       violence), or--in nearly every other case--already fall       within the wide-reaching ``crime involving moral turpitude''       grounds of deportability and inadmissibility, and those       excluded from those grounds are by nature largely minor       offenses.        This bill will further criminalize immigrant communities,       communities already living in fear of increasingly       militarized immigration enforcement operations. The bill's       expanded list of ``crime of violence'' offenses includes       relatively minor offenses including simple assault, vaguely       worded offenses such as ``communication of threats,'' and a       sweeping list of inchoate offenses including solicitation or       ``aiding and abetting'' any of the enumerated categories.        This bill will further marginalize historically       marginalized communities, triggering heightened immigration       penalties in already over-policed neighborhoods.     4. If this bill were to pass, it would raise serious constitutional                                  concerns         If this bill were to become law, there would be serious       questions about its constitutionality because it jeopardizes       the long established ``categorical approach'' in our legal       system.        What is the `categorical approach'? Over the years, the       Supreme Court has carefully crafted an efficient and       predictable legal framework to determine whether a non-      citizen's crime makes him or her deportable or inadmissible.       This framework is called the ``categorical approach,'' which       applies to determine deportability and inadmissibility for       criminal grounds. It sets a clear and uniform standard to       evaluate the immigration consequences of the crime of       conviction. The categorical approach helps to eliminate       subjectivity in adjudication by ensuring that convictions are       characterized based on their inherent nature and official       record, rather than on potentially disputed facts, and thus       ensures that two people convicted of the same crime will be       treated similarly under the law.        This bill makes a strong push to systematically switch from       the established framework of the ``categorical approach'' to       a ``conduct based'' definition. The conduct based definition       would effectively allow an immigration judge to go back and       ``re-try'' a conviction that was already decided in a court       of law. This bill, if passed, would raise the same Sixth       Amendment concerns that the Supreme Court identified in       Mathis v. United States: ``. . . allowing a sentencing judge       to go any further would raise serious Sixth Amendment       concerns. This Court has held that only a jury, and not a       judge, may find facts that increase a maximum penalty, except       for the simple fact of a prior conviction. See Apprendi v.       New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000). That means a judge       cannot go beyond identifying the crime of conviction to       explore the manner in which the defendant committed that       offense.''        Like the burglary provision analyzed in Mathis, the crime       of violence definition this bill amends is used as a       sentencing enhancement under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2). As a       result of switching to a conduct-based definition rather than       ``the simple fact of a prior conviction,'' the bill presents       the same Sixth Amendment concerns that troubled the Mathis       Court.        A yes vote on H.R. 6691 is a vote for mass incarceration,       for increased criminalization of communities of color, and       for even further militarization of immigration enforcement.       Members of Congress must vote no.     Mr. Speaker, I leave my colleagues with a simple  challenge. The simple challenge is: Read the Constitution.   Vagueness can be the death of us. This bill is that kind of death,  and I would hope that we would have the opportunity to do this as it  should be: constitutionally sound and in a bipartisan way to save  lives.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. We support victims of crime, especially  those who are victims of violent crime. But classifying particular  offenses as crimes of violence has tremendous consequences for the  individuals accused of committing them. This bill dangerously leads to  over-criminalization and we should not take lightly the task of  amending the definition of ``crime of violence.''   At Rules on Wednesday, we addressed over-criminalization and mass  incarceration. Rep. Torres aptly stated that we should not proceed with  haste, which will further exacerbate the over crowdedness in our  prisons. Rep. Bucks responded that we should build more prisons to  address that problem.   Even conservative groups that work with these very complicated and  important criminal justice reform issues, like the Koch Foundation and  Right on Crime, do not agree that building more prisons is the answer.   Right on Crime states, ``by reducing excessive sentence lengths and  holding non-violent offenders accountable through prison alternatives,  public safety can often be achieved.''   In a recent forum, the Koch Foundation stated, ``After four decades  of increasing punitiveness and sky-rocketing levels of imprisonment,  American incarceration rates have declined in many states over the past  five years. In fact, a bipartisan consensus has emerged in favor of  major criminal justice reforms that would reduce mass incarceration  much further.''   The original spark for this coalition of ``unlikely bedfellows'' has  come from a group of conservative leaders who emphasize a variety of  different factors, ranging from economic, to  [[Page H7936]]  freedom, to religious groups embracing redemption and second chances.   The Koch Foundation went on to say, ``Although the 2016 presidential  election temporarily halted this movement's momentum, the coalition has  reemerged recently and seems prepared to make progress in 2018.''   So I disagree with the notion that we should build more prisons and  not exercise due diligence to ensure that in responding to the Supreme  Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, that we  are doing so in a well-informed, heavily-engaged and thoughtful manner.   Due to the seriousness of our criminal justice system, we should  always use due care and give thorough considerations when amending the  criminal code.   For all these reasons, I oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
