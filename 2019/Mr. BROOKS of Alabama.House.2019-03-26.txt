 Mr. Speaker, I rise, once again, to share  stories of Americans who once were vibrant and alive but now are dead  because Washington's open borders policies fail to protect our own  people.   I yearn for the day when there are no more speeches like this to give  because we have secured our borders and there are no more illegal alien  killings to describe.   On average, roughly 2,000 illegal aliens are apprehended each year by  Federal agents for homicides committed on American soil. Another,  roughly, 120,000 illegal aliens are arrested each year for other  criminal activity, including 50,000 assaults and 15,000 sexual  assaults.   For emphasis, behind each statistic is a crime victim who would have  been spared if America simply secured our porous southern border.   In Marshall County, Alabama, an illegal alien was recently arrested  for first-degree rape of a 12-year-old girl. According to Marshall  County Sheriff Phil Sims, the illegal alien had at least 10 different  aliases, four different birth dates, and two prior deportations. In  2008, the illegal alien was charged with DUI in Louisiana and deported.  In 2009,  [[Page H2802]]  the illegal alien was deported yet again for illegal reentry. This  first-degree rape of a 12-year-old girl would have been prevented by  proper border security.   In Mobile, Alabama, Sonya Jones was recently killed by an illegal  alien charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a head- on collision. Sonya Jones was a teacher at Living Word Christian Center  Kingdom Academy. One of Sonya's colleagues said that she had a smile  that would light up the hallways.   The illegal alien who killed Sonya Jones is a prime example of how  dangerous asylum laws and catch-and-release policies are to Americans.  Sonya Jones' illegal alien killer entered America illegally and was  captured by law enforcement but then released when he lied to claim  asylum. As is so overwhelmingly often the case, Sonya Jones' illegal  alien killer failed to show up in court on the asylum claim and,  instead, disappeared, leaving at least one dead American in his wake.   Last week, in Washington State, Kittitas County Sheriff's Deputy Ryan  Thompson was shot and killed by yet another illegal alien who legally  entered America in Texas in 2014 on a temporary agricultural worker  visa but illegally overstayed his visa after it expired. Deputy Ryan  Thompson was married with three children and is the first law  enforcement officer to be murdered in Kittitas County since 1927.   In 2005, in Milton, Pennsylvania, beautiful 20-year-old Carly Snyder  loved animals and dreamed of being a veterinarian. Her dream ended when  an illegal alien forcibly entered Carly's apartment, punched her in the  face, knocked her to the floor, and stabbed her 37 times. Carly went  into shock and died at the scene.   Mr. Speaker, Washington should have more sympathy and concern for the  lives of Americans than illegal aliens. Unfortunately, Washington does  not and, instead, puts illegal aliens on pedestals, above the interests  of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, Americans have every right to expect Congress to defend  American rights, and the most basic right is the right to life, the  right to be protected from illegal alien killings that could so easily  be avoided.   Tragically, Congress turns a blind eye to the lives and innocence of  Americans stolen by illegal aliens. That is wrong.   President Trump is right to declare a national emergency to help save  the lives of at least 30,000 Americans who are alive today but will be  dead a year from now if we do not protect and secure America's southern  border. As such, I will not hesitate to proudly vote to sustain  President Trump's veto of socialist legislation that supports open- borders policies that aid and abet illegal aliens who kill Americans  and aid and abet evil drug cartels that market their poisonous, deadly  drugs that take American lives.    Mr. Speaker, Americans who die at the hands of illegal aliens had  dreams, too.                            ____________________
