 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3691) to require the TSA to develop a plan to ensure that  TSA material disseminated in major airports can be better understood by  more people accessing such airports, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3691         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Reaching Across       Nationalities, Societies, and Languages to Advance Traveler       Education Act'' or the ``TRANSLATE Act''.       SEC. 2. PLAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall submit to       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a plan to ensure that TSA       material disseminated in major airports can be better       understood by more people accessing such airports.        (b) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall       include the following:        (1) An identification of the most common languages other       than English that are the primary languages of individuals       that travel through or work in each major airport.        (2) A plan to improve--        (A) TSA materials to communicate information in languages       identified pursuant to paragraph (1); and        (B) the communication of TSA material to individuals with       vision or hearing impairments or other possible barriers to       understanding such material.        (c) Considerations.--In developing the plan required under       subsection (a), the Administrator of the TSA, acting through       the Office of Civil Rights and Liberties, Ombudsman and       Traveler Engagement of the TSA, shall take into consideration       data regarding the following:        (1) International enplanement.        (2) Local populations surrounding major airports.        (d) Implementation.--Not later than 180 days after the       submission of the plan required under subsection (a), the       Administrator of the TSA shall implement such plan.        (e) GAO Review.--Not later than one year after the       implementation pursuant to subsection (d) of the plan       required under subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a review       of such implementation.        (f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Airport.--The term ``airport'' has the meaning given       such term in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code.        (2) Major airports.--The term ``major airports'' means       Category X and Category I airports.        (3) TSA material.--The term ``TSA material'' means signs,       videos, audio messages, websites, press releases, social       media postings, and other communications published and       disseminated by the Administrator of the TSA in Category X       and Category I airports.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3691, the  TRANSLATE Act.   Throughout my travels, I get the opportunity to witness and meet  families and visitors from numerous countries, cultures, and  backgrounds traveling throughout our Nation's airports.   These families share many of the same experiences we all share when  traveling using an airplane. They want to board their flights on time  and land safely at their destination without undue delay or confusion.   Sadly, signs and other communications throughout our U.S. airports  are not meeting the needs of all travelers. Many non-English speakers,  international travelers, and people with vision or hearing impairments  experience challenges during their travels because the current signage  is not accessible to them.   According to the U.S. Census, over 65 million individuals living in  the U.S. over the age of five speak English not well or not at all.   No one should have to worry about missing a flight because they don't  speak English or have impaired vision or hearing.   This bill addresses this issue by requiring TSA to make signage,  video, audio, and other online content more accessible to travelers at  major airports who do not speak English as their primary language.   This bill will make TSA operations more effective and efficient by  helping to prevent miscommunication between TSA officers and travelers.   Furthermore, this bill helps ensure that we maintain a standard of  inclusivity at our airports for residents and visitors alike.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3691 will make traveling easier for millions of  airline passengers traveling throughout the United States whose primary  language is not English.   By creating signage that meets the needs of all travelers, this bill  will improve the travel experience for many.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3691, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3675) to require a review of Department of Homeland Security  trusted traveler programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3675         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trusted Traveler       Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       conduct a review of Department of Homeland Security trusted       traveler programs. Such review shall examine the following:        (1) The extent to which the Department of Homeland Security       tracks data and monitors trends related to trusted traveler       programs, including root causes for identity-matching errors       resulting in an individual's enrollment in a trusted traveler       program being reinstated.        (2) Whether the Department coordinates with the heads of       other relevant Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial       entities regarding redress procedures for disqualifying       offenses not covered by the Department's own redress       processes but which offenses impact an individual's       enrollment in a trusted traveler program.        (3) How the Department may improve individuals' access to       reconsideration procedures regarding a disqualifying offense       for enrollment in a trusted traveler program that requires       the involvement of any other Federal, State, local, Tribal,       or territorial entity.        (4) The extent to which travelers are informed about       reconsideration procedures regarding enrollment in a trusted       traveler program.       SEC. 3. ENROLLMENT REDRESS.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary       of Homeland Security shall, with respect to an individual       whose enrollment in a trusted traveler program was revoked in       error extend by an amount of time equal to the period of       revocation the period of active enrollment in such a program       upon re-enrollment in such a program by such an individual.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3675, the Trusted  Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2019.   Millions of people have applied for a variety of DHS Trusted Traveler  Programs such as TSA's PreCheck program and CBP's Global Entry, Nexus,  Sentri, and FAST programs.   Once approved, enrollment in these programs allows travelers to go  through expedited screening while allowing DHS officers to focus on  higher risk travelers.   While I commend DHS for taking steps to focus on high-risk travelers,  I am troubled by examples of travelers who meet all the security  requirements for enrollment but are unable to enroll.   Misidentification or misinformation impairs DHS' ability to  appropriately make determinations on eligibility and limits the  public's willingness to participate in these programs.   This bill seeks to strengthen the DHS Trusted Traveler Programs by  requiring the GAO to conduct a study of them. Specifically, the bill  requires GAO to evaluate the identity matching process as well as the  redress process for individuals who believe they have been wrongly  disqualified from these programs.   Such a review will help ensure that the Trusted Traveler Programs are  working more efficiently and that individuals seeking to participate  are subject to consistent processes that ensure fair treatment for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Mr. Katko for his  leadership on this measure.   I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to close after the  gentleman from Tennessee closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our citizens expect that DHS' Trusted Traveler Programs  are operated in a consistent manner and that DHS properly identifies  those individuals that are low-risk travelers.   This bill will provide insight into DHS' identity matching process  and ensure that individuals seeking to participate are subject to  consistent processes that ensure fair treatment.   We also want DHS to focus its time and resources on individuals who  are high risk. This bill will ensure that the programs that DHS uses to  vet individuals are executed effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for  introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill's passage, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3694) to require the Transportation Security Administration  to implement training for frontline Administration personnel regarding  the screening of pregnant women and families with young children at  passenger screening checkpoints, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3694         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Families Fly Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. TRAINING REQUIRED.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall develop       and implement training for frontline Administration personnel       regarding the screening of pregnant women and families with       young children at passenger screening checkpoints. Such       training shall include the following:        (1) Information relating to concerns of pregnant women       relating to the use of Advanced Imaging Technology and       appropriate opt-out procedures and alternative screening       procedures.        (2) Guidelines to assist pregnant women and families       traveling with young children effectively and efficiently       complete the screening process in a manner that is respectful       and improves the overall functioning of the screening       checkpoint.        (3) Communication and procedural guidelines for frontline       Administration personnel to assist with passenger divestiture       for pregnant women and families traveling with young children       to improve the effectiveness and overall passenger experience       at the screening checkpoint.        (b) Communications Strategy.--In conjunction with the       implementation of the training required under subsection (a),       the Administrator shall develop and implement a       communications strategy for pregnant women and families       traveling with young children to inform such women and       families of the procedures and guidelines described in such       subsection, including providing information to relevant       passengers through social media, the Administration's public       website, the Administration's customer service call center,       and partnerships with aviation stakeholders, including air       carriers and airport operators.        (c) Passenger Support Specialists.--In carrying out       subsections (a) and (b), the Administrator shall, to the       extent possible, make available passenger support       specialists, upon request, to pregnant women and families       traveling with young children to assist with screening       checkpoint information, concerns, and procedures.        (d) TSA Family Lanes Feasibility Assessment.--Not later       than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,       the Administrator shall conduct a feasibility assessment to       determine whether screening processes and the screening       experience may be improved for travelers by developing       optional, dedicated screening lanes for families traveling       with young children at airports where the checkpoint       configuration would allow and where the overall functioning       of the checkpoint would not be inhibited in terms of       passenger throughput or security effectiveness.        (e) Briefing to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after the       implementation of the training required under subsection (a),       the Administrator shall brief the appropriate congressional       committees on progress regarding the implementation of this       Act and improvements made to the screening process for       pregnant women and families traveling with young children.        (f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the       Transportation Security Administration.        (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.        (3) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee       on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3694, the Helping  Families Fly Act.   Traveling through the airport can be a stressful time for many of our  travelers. Pregnant women and families with young children sometimes  experience more difficulty when traveling, especially during the  screening process.   TSA's current screening procedures must be improved to ensure that  these families are supported and have an easier experience flying  through America's airports.   This bill will improve the screening process for pregnant women and  their families by requiring security personnel to undergo training  specific to the concerns and needs of these specific travelers.   Additionally, this legislation requires TSA to increase awareness of  security procedures and guidelines by utilizing various forms of  communication to keep families informed of the different options they  may have during the screening process. This includes providing  passengers, upon request, support specialists for women and families  and adequate opt-out options to allow passengers to undergo alternative  screening procedures.   In short, this bill helps to improve TSA operations and support the  millions of pregnant women and young families who travel throughout our  Nation's airports.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared  to close after the gentleman from Tennessee closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3694 will improve the traveling  experience for pregnant women and young families traveling throughout  our Nation's airports.   By improving the awareness and skills of our security personnel, and  providing more resources and support for our families, we will help  ensure that our Nation's airports provide a safe, fair, and efficient  traveling experience for all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for offering this  good legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3694, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3722) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  authorize a Joint Task Force to enhance integration of the Department  of Homeland Security's border security operations to detect, interdict,  disrupt, and prevent narcotics, such as fentanyl and other synthetic  opioids, from entering the United States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Joint Task Force to Combat       Opioid Trafficking Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF JOINT TASK FORCE TO COUNTER OPIOIDS.         Subsection (b) of section 708 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 348) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)(A), by adding at the end the following       new clause:        ``(iv) Enhancing the integration of the Department's border       security operations to detect, interdict, disrupt, and       prevent narcotics, such as fentanyl and other synthetic       opioids, from entering the United States.'';        (2) by redesignating paragraphs (9) through (13) as       paragraphs (11) through (15), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following new       paragraphs:        ``(9) Engagement with the private sector.--        ``(A) In general.--The Director of a Joint Task Force may       engage with representatives from a private sector       organization for the purpose of carrying out the mission of       such Joint Task Force, and any such engagement shall not be       subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.       App.).        ``(B) Assistance from private sector.--  [[Page H8023]]         ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1), the       Secretary, with the agreement of a private sector       organization, may arrange for the temporary assignment of an       employee of such organization to a Joint Task Force in       accordance with this paragraph.        ``(ii) Agreement.--The Secretary shall provide for a       written agreement between the Department, the private sector       organization concerned, and the employee concerned regarding       the terms and conditions of the assignment of such employee       under this paragraph.        ``(C) No financial liability.--Any agreement under this       paragraph shall require the private sector organization       concerned to be responsible for all costs associated with the       assignment of an employee under this paragraph.        ``(D) Duration.--An assignment under this paragraph may, at       any time and for any reason, be terminated by the Secretary       or the private sector organization concerned and shall be for       a total period of not more than two years.        ``(10) Collaboration with task forces outside dhs.--The       Secretary may enter into a memorandum of understanding by       which a Joint Task Force established under this section to       carry out any purpose specified in paragraph (2)(A) and any       other Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial, or       international entity or task force established for a similar       purpose may collaborate for the purpose of carrying out the       mission of such Joint Task Force.''.

(a) Notification.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall--        (1) make a determination regarding whether to establish a       Joint Task Force under section 708 of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 to carry out the purpose specified in clause (iv)       of subsection (b)(2)(A) of such section, as added by section       2 of this Act; and        (2) submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate written       notification of such determination, including, if such       determination is in the negative, information on the basis       for such negative determination.        (b) Reporting.--If the Secretary of Homeland Security       establishes a Joint Task Force under section 708 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 to carry out the purpose       specified in clause (iv) of subsection (b)(2)(A) of such       section, as added by section 2 of this Act, the Secretary       shall--        (1) beginning with the first report required under       subsection (b)(6)(F) of such section 708, include with       respect to such a Joint Task Force--        (A) a gap analysis of funding, personnel, technology, or       other resources needed in order to detect, interdict,       disrupt, and prevent narcotics, such as fentanyl and other       synthetic opioids, from entering the United States; and        (B) a description of collaboration pursuant to subsection       (b)(10) of such section (as added by section 2 of this Act)       between such a Joint Task Force and any other Federal, State,       local, Tribal, territorial, or international task force,       including the United States Postal Service and the United       States Postal Inspection Service; and        (2) in each review required under subsection (b)(11)(C) of       section 708 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as       redesignated by section 2 of this Act, an assessment of the       activities of such a Joint Task Force, including an       evaluation of whether such Joint Task Force has enhanced       integration of the Department's efforts, created any unique       capabilities, or otherwise enhanced operational       effectiveness, coordination, or information sharing to       detect, interdict, disrupt, and prevent narcotics, such as       fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, from entering the       United States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every day, in communities across this country, synthetic  opioids kill Americans in shocking numbers. H.R. 3722 will take a step  forward by addressing this epidemic, which is one of the most severe  ever facing our country.   The opioid crisis, having already claimed hundreds of thousands of  American lives over the past two decades, has evolved into a new and  even more dangerous phase.   The first periods of the crisis were characterized by the overuse of  prescription opioids and heroin. Devastating as these stages were, the  current phase is even more deadly still.   Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are coming into our country from  laboratories in China and Mexico and are wreaking havoc on communities  across the entire country. These extremely potent chemicals frequently  cross our borders through legal channels such as international mail  facilities, sometimes in small packages, and are difficult to detect or  interdict. The bill now before us aims to address part of this  challenge.   The Joint Task Force to Combat Opioid Trafficking Act, sponsored by  Representative  Jim Langevin, passed through the House on a voice vote  during the 115th Congress before stalling in the Senate. This Congress,  the bill, once again, passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security  with unanimous consent.   The core of this bill will require the Department of Homeland  Security to stand up a joint task force dedicated to preventing  synthetic opioids from reaching our borders. The joint task force model  allows DHS to ensure that the strengths and capabilities of its various  components are all leveraged to maximum effect.   Steps such as improved screening procedures, greater targeting of  suspicious senders, and better information-sharing processes can all  aid our law enforcement agencies in halting the ongoing flow of  synthetic opioids across our borders.   Unlike the existing authority governing DHS joint task forces, this  bill will allow DHS and the private sector the opportunity to  collaborate on this challenge. Private-sector partners also have  strengths and capabilities that can greatly enhance joint efforts to  prevent legitimate commercial activities from being exploited by bad  actors.   The crisis at hand requires innovative solutions. A greater focus on  increased collaboration between DHS, its components, and private-sector  partners all could go a long way in addressing a major driver of this  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our country faces a severe and ongoing crisis, with  newly developed synthetic opioids causing tremendous suffering to our  families, individuals, and entire communities throughout the country.  The collaboration between private companies and the government that  will be possible through this legislation will prove to be a crucial  component in the task of stopping the flow of fentanyl across our  borders.   H.R. 3722 is a bipartisan and targeted solution to address this most  urgent need. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3246) to require GAO review of certain TSA screening  protocols, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3246         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Traveling Parents Screening       Consistency Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       conduct a review of the Transportation Security       Administration's (TSA) implementation of the Bottles and       Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act (Public Law 114-293),       as well as the effectiveness of TSA in ensuring screening       protocol clarity and screening consistency relating to the       screening of formula,  [[Page H8025]]       breast milk, purified deionized water for infants, and juice.       Such review shall include the following:        (1) Consider whether TSA effectively manages consistency of       screening protocol applications for formula, breastmilk,       purified deionized water for infants, and juice, including       the extent to which Transportation Security officers engage       in screening beyond that which is prescribed through relevant       policies and training.        (2) Evaluate the need for TSA to update and revise       procedures for such screening.        (3) Assess whether TSA effectively tracks passenger       complaints related to such screening to monitor trends and       identify inconsistencies.        (4) Evaluate TSA's communications and information sharing       practices for passengers, air carriers, and airports relating       to screening protocols for such screening.        (5) Evaluate TSA's policies regarding the screening of       passengers with nursing products, including the extent to       which such passengers are more likely to receive secondary       screening.        (6) Make recommendations for improving TSA's overall       screening practices relating to such screening.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3246, the Traveling  Parents Screening Consistency Act.   The stress of traveling through our airport checkpoints is very  familiar to all of us. This experience can be especially burdensome on  parents traveling with children. Too often, these families aren't given  clear direction and guidance on how to ensure that they meet TSA  guidelines while bringing baby supplies and nursing products through  the screening process.   Parents across the country are often left confused and inconvenienced  as they encounter different interpretations of TSA's policies at  different airports. In some cases, parents have discarded expensive  baby formula and other items after being instructed that such items  cannot be brought through security when, in fact, they are allowed  under TSA policy.   TSA must do better for these families by creating commonsense  policies and clearly communicating with them to ensure parents are able  to properly care for their children while traveling.   H.R. 3246, provides more certainty and protections to parents  traveling with baby supplies, such as breast milk and formula. This  bill will help improve traveling experiences for families, while  enforcing security standards for everyone traveling throughout our  Nation's airports.   I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3246 aims to ensure that families  receive consistent information regarding the screening process for baby  supplies and nursing products. This bill will enable parents to  properly prepare the supplies necessary to care for their children when  traveling while ensuring passenger security through the screening  process.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Taylor for this fine piece of legislation, I  urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3526) to authorize certain counter terrorist networks  activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3526         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Counter Terrorist Network       Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTY TO COUNTER TERRORIST NETWORKS; DETAILS AND                     ASSIGNMENT.         Section 411 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       211) is amended--        (1) in subsection (g)(4)--        (A) in subparagraph (C)--  [[Page H8026]]         (i) in clause (vi), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (ii) by redesignating clause (vii) as clause (viii); and        (iii) by inserting after clause (vi) the following new       clause:        ``(vii) collaborate with appropriate agencies, including       Federal, State, local, Tribal, and international entities, to       enhance border security through operations such as operations       that seek to disrupt and dismantle networks, including       foreign terrorist organizations (as such term is described in       section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1189)), that pose terrorist or other threats; and'';        (2) by redesignating subsections (p) through (r) as       subsections (q) through (s), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (o) the following new       subsection:        ``(p) Assignment of Personnel.--The Commissioner may detail       or otherwise assign personnel of U.S. Customs and Border       Protection to other appropriate agencies, including to serve       overseas in support of global information sharing partnership       operations in furtherance of enhancing border security,       including by preventing entry into the United States by       individuals known or suspected of being associated with a       network, including a foreign terrorist organization (as such       term is described in section 219 of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)), that poses terrorist or       other threats.''.       SEC. 3. BRIEFINGS.         The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection       shall biannually brief the Committee on Homeland Security of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding       activities, during the prior six months, in furtherance of       clause (vii) of section 411(g)(4)(C) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211(g)(4)(C)), as added by section 2 of       this Act. Such briefings may be provided in a classified       setting if the Commissioner determines such is appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3526, the Counter  Terrorist Network Act. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, is  charged with the important mission of securing our Nation's borders and  ports of entries against a range of threats, including foreign  terrorist networks. In pursuit of this mission, it is vital that CBP  and the Department of Homeland Security collaborate with international  partners to effectively prevent foreign terrorists from carrying out  attacks on U.S. soil.   H.R. 3526 authorizes CBP's National Targeting Center, or NTC, to  collaborate with international partners to disrupt and dismantle  foreign terrorist networks. The NTC uses technology and analytical  tools to identify threats and share this information with domestic and  international partners.   This bill seeks to solidify CBP's collaboration with international  partners outside of our borders. The Counter Terrorist Network Act will  authorize CBP to assign NTC personnel abroad to perform critical  information-sharing operations in real time to ensure that individuals  who are known or suspected of being associated with terrorist networks  are prevented from entering the United States.   Even as Congress addresses the rise of domestic terrorism, we must  continue to be vigilant of the threats posed by foreign terrorist  organizations such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. H.R. 3526  underscores this by authorizing CBP to counter terrorist and criminal  networks from exploiting legitimate avenues to enter the United States.   Due to its border security mission, CBP is uniquely situated to  combat these threats that originate from terrorist and criminal  networks around the globe. This bill will allow Congress to work with  CBP to ensure our borders are secure in a proven and effective manner.   I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood) for introducing  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, 18 years after the most devastating terrorist attack on  our country, it is imperative that DHS continue its efforts to prevent  foreign terrorist organizations from carrying out attacks on our  homeland. By passing H.R. 3526 today, Congress can ensure that DHS  continues to address border or homeland security threats long before  they are present at our borders.   I would also note that last Congress, the House overwhelmingly passed  similar legislation in a bipartisan manner. It was approved by a vote  of 410-2. I would hope that my colleagues would again lend their  support and join me in passing this legislation today.   I want to thank Ms. Underwood for this most important and timely  piece of legislation to protect our homeland from terrorists.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3106, the  Domestic and International DATA Act. I am proud to join the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman, my colleague and friend,  in support of this most important legislation.   This bill improves our understanding of the Federal Government's  response to the threat of domestic terrorism at a time that extremist- related attacks in the United States are on the rise.   In May 2017, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI released  a joint intelligence bulletin that predicted that the number of white  supremacist movement attacks were likely to continue to present a  lethal threat in the future.   Tragically, that prediction has proven to be true. After the horrific  acts of domestic terrorism committed in Charlottesville and the Tree of  Life shooting in Pittsburgh, I urged my congressional colleagues to  take action to counter hate crimes and domestic terrorism.   Chairman Thompson's H.R. 3106 helps increase transparency and  research on domestic terrorism. By requiring the Homeland Security and  Justice Departments to publish an annual public report on terrorism,  this bill will provide information that will help policymakers develop  and execute evidence-based counterterrorism strategies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 3106.
