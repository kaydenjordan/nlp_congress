 Mr. Speaker, I was not present for votes on  9/27/17 because I was in Indiana with the President of the United  States on an official visit. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 538, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 539, and ``Yea''  on rollcall No. 540.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
