 Madam President, I rise today to honor the Michigan  veterans throughout history who have given their lives for our Nation.   During some of the toughest times for our country, Michiganders have  been there. We have been willing to put our lives on the line for the  cause of freedom. That certainly was the case during the Civil War.  More than 3 million Americans fought in the Civil War. Around 90,000 of  them were Michiganders, and more than 85,000 of them were volunteers.  It is said that President Lincoln exclaimed, ``Thank God for  Michigan!'' when 75,000 volunteers from our State arrived in  Washington, DC, in May of 1861.   The 24th Michigan Infantry fought at Gettysburg, where a monument  stands to this day commemorating their service in the ``Iron Brigade.''  And the 24th was selected to provide military escort during President  Lincoln's funeral procession. Few trials have so tested a nation--or a  President--as did the Civil War. As historian Jon Meacham explores in  his new book ``And There was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American  Struggle,'' President Lincoln and the Nation he led faced multiple  existential threats: the fracturing of our country, threats against our  democracy, and an institution that treated 4 million Americans not as  people, but as property.   The echoes of these challenges remain in our Nation to this day. And  in Lincoln, we see a path forward. We see that by keeping our moral  center as our North Star, a nation can, in the words of Lincoln, ``long  endure.'' We have long endured as a nation in part thanks to those  brave, selfless Michiganders who were willing to put their lives on the  line in order to preserve our Union. More than 13,400 of them never  made it home. They have been followed by so many others.   This Memorial Day, we honor all Michigan veterans throughout history  who gave their lives in service to our country. And we honor their  families. It is only because of their sacrifice that our democracy  lives on.                            ____________________
