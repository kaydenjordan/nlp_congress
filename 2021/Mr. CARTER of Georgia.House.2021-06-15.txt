 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor CDC's Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat for her outstanding  career in medicine and public health.   Dr. Schuchat joined the CDC in 1988 as an Epidemic Intelligence  Service officer. Since joining the agency, she has served as chief of  the Respiratory Diseases Branch, director of the National Center For  Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and as acting CDC director twice.   Her contributions have been recognized by an election to the National  Academy of Medicine, and she has received the United States Public  Health Service's Distinguished Service Medal and the Association of  State and Territorial Health Officials Lifetime Achievement Award,  among many other awards and recognitions.   Dr. Schuchat has dedicated her life to improving public health around  the world and has inspired many young women to go into medicine and  public health.   As a lifelong healthcare professional, I congratulate Dr. Schuchat on  her retirement and commend her for her hard work over the past 33  years.                            ____________________
