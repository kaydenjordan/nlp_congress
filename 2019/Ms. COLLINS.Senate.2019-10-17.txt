 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution  of disapproval sponsored by Senator Cardin that would block the  Administration's harmful Affordable Clean Energy Rule.   In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. Our  State, which is situated at the end of the Nation's air pollution  tailpipe, has made substantial progress in reducing harmful emissions  by increasing energy efficiency, adopting clean energy technologies,  and improving air quality and public health. While I am pleased by the  progress our country has already made in reducing air pollutants, the  administration's rule to repeal and rewrite the Clean Power Plan is a  step in the wrong direction.  [[Page S5868]]    Climate change is a significant risk that threatens Maine's working  forests, fishing, and agricultural industries, as well as tourism and  recreation and our coastal communities. I will continue to work in  Congress to support realistic, responsible solutions that help reduce  harmful emissions and protect our environment and the health of our  citizens.    Mr. President, in February of this year, Senator Udall  and I joined in introducing a resolution to terminate the national  emergency declaration. On March 14, 59 Members of this body joined  together in a strong bipartisan majority to pass the companion House  Resolution and send it to the President. Unfortunately, the President  chose to veto that resolution, and the House vote to override the veto  fell short.   Last month, a bipartisan majority again came together in the Senate  to pass a resolution introduced by Senator Udall, Senator Shaheen, and  myself to reverse the President's national emergency declaration.  Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the President has chosen to veto  this resolution again, and we will be voting shortly on whether to  override that veto.   Before we do so, I would like to take a few minutes to speak to the  fundamental issue raised by the emergency declaration: It directly  conflicts with the ``power of the purse'' vested in Congress by the  Framers of our Constitution.   The question presented by this veto of the resolution is not whether  you are for a border wall or against a border wall, nor is the question  whether you believe security at our southern border should be  strengthened or whether it is sufficient.   In fact, the question is, simply; Do we want the executive branch,  now or in the future, to hold the power of the purse, a power the  Founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?   Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that ``only  Congress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing  monies to be spent from the U.S. treasury.'' This view is central to  several ongoing cases challenging the President's national emergency  declaration.   I have consistently supported funding for the construction of  physical barriers and strengthening security on our southern border. I  will continue to support those efforts and believe that they are  important, but I cannot support the President unilaterally deciding to  take money that has been appropriated for one purpose and diverting  that money for another purpose.   The system of checks and balances established by the Founders gives  Congress the power to protect our authority on our own. That is what  this resolution does, and I urge my colleagues  [[Page S5875]]  to support it by voting to override the President's veto.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 54     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Cape Elizabeth  High School of Cape Elizabeth ME, on being named a 2019 National Blue  Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding high school  is one of only 362 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon  recognition this year from the U.S. Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors schools that  are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate  significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for  this national recognition are models of high educational standards and  accountability.   This award recognizes the hard work and determination of Cape  Elizabeth High School's students, faculty, and staff. This top- performing school has a strong commitment to professional development  that ensures that teachers and staff, as well as students, are life- long learners. This recognition continues a tradition of excellence  that builds upon Cape Elizabeth High School's previous Blue Ribbon  Award in 2004.

I congratulate the entire  community for this well-deserved recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, rising health care costs are a major  concern for millions of Americans--whether it's expensive health  insurance premiums, high out-of-pocket expenses, or soaring  prescription drug costs. In the individual market, where 11.5 million  Americans who do not have employer-sponsored insurance have to go to  buy their insurance--including the 78,000 individuals in Maine-- premiums continue to rise exponentially.   With this in mind, I am introducing the Premium Reduction Act of 2019  with my good friend and colleague, Senator Joe Manchin. Leading health  care experts at Oliver Wyman indicate that our legislation would lower  average health insurance premiums for consumers in the individual  market by as much as 30 percent. In addition, more than a million more  individuals would have health insurance that they now lack.   Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation show premiums for the  benchmark ``silver'' plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are  nearly 75 percent higher than they were when the ACA went ``live'' in  2014. While individuals who are eligible for the ACA's premium tax  credits are shielded from these increases, the price of these silver  plans is out of reach for many who are not eligible for these tax  credits. Even ``bronze plans''--the lowest cost individual market  policies available through the ACA exchanges--have become unaffordable  for those without subsidies. Bronze plan premiums have gone up so much  that they now exceed those charged for silver plans in 2014, despite  the fact that these bronze policies have far higher deductibles and  out-of-pocket expenses.   Individuals who make 400 percent or less of the federal poverty level  get a federal tax credit to help defray the monthly premium cost. But  individuals who make just one dollar over that level get no help at  all, and must pay the full premium on their own. These premiums are  simply unaffordable for middle-income families.   The difference in premiums is shocking for many families. For  example, in Aroostook County, Maine, a 60 year-old couple enrolled in a  silver plan will pay about $6,500 for coverage if they earn 400 percent  or less of the federal poverty level: in other words, as long as they  earn less than roughly $66,000. But if they earn just a dollar more,  they will lose their eligibility for a premium tax credit, and will  have to pay the entire premium themselves--an incredible $36,500!   One step Congress could take to help alleviate the rising cost of  premiums in the individual health insurance markets is to provide  States with additional flexibility and support to design State-based  stabilization programs that would help offset the costs of covering  consumers with high medical expenses. Once these costs are covered, the  premiums needed to provide insurance to the rest of the population can  be set at a much lower level. Thus far, seven states--Maine, Alaska,  Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Wisconsin--have  established such programs. According to the health care experts at  Avalere, the programs in these seven states have reduced premiums in  the individual market by 20 percent compared to what they otherwise  would have been, and saved the federal government nearly $1 billion in  funding in the first year, which was returned to the states in the form  of ``pass through'' funding.   Under the Premium Reduction Act, $5 billion would be available  annually over three years to support states that operate stabilization  programs under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act. In addition,  $500 million is provided to assist states with planning the design of  their own stabilization program, and there is a ``federal fallback''  for 2021 to give states time to apply for waivers under section 1332.  It is important to note that our proposal does not change in any way  the ACA's essential benefits requirements or its protections for  individuals with pre-existing conditions.   The bill provides three options for expedited review so that states  could quickly stand-up their own programs using the existing waiver  process under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act:   First, a state can demonstrate that their program is an ``invisible  high-risk pool'' in keeping with the design pioneered by Maine early in  this decade and used as a template by Alaska more recently;   Second, a state can show that its program fits within the parameters  of the ACA's transitional reinsurance program, which expired at the end  of 2016; or   Third, a state can submit what can be described as a ``copycat''  application based on another state's program that has already received  approval.   In lieu of these three expedited approval options, a state may seek  approval of a program of their own design. Regardless of the option  they select, all states operating qualifying stabilization programs  would be eligible to receive an allocation from the funding provided by  the bill. States may also add funds from other sources to the mix.   In addition, in 2021, states that do not wish to establish their own  stabilization program may instead receive funding through the ``federal  fallback'' that I described a few moments ago.   Finally, the bill would also extend the section 1332 ``feedback  effect'' to states that receive funding through the federal fallback  provision. This will ensure that the benefits of lower premiums are  felt in all states as quickly as possible, giving states ample time to  seek and obtain approval of their own programs under the waiver  process.   In a recent letter to me endorsing our bill, the National Association  of Insurance Commissioners stressed that ``[alction must be taken to  make coverage more affordable or we will see even higher uninsured  rates, more people move to less regulated plans, and sicker individual  market pools.'' The NAIC's letter goes on to note the success of  stabilization programs at the state level, stating that such programs  are ``a cost-effective way to significantly reduce individual market  premiums'' that can expand coverage and make it more affordable  unsubsidized individuals and families. The NAIC closed its letter with  a call to implement such programs nationwide.   Also, a consortium of health care providers, insurers, and  stakeholders--joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--circulated a  letter recently to Senate and House leadership urging them to adopt a  proposal like the one we are introducing as a ``commonsense solution to  significantly lower premiums.'' In their letter, they stressed that  premium reduction programs can ``help cover the costs of people with  significant health care needs and improve the affordability of health  care coverage,'' especially for those who are not eligible for  subsidies.  [[Page S5900]]    Mr. President, I ask that these letters be entered into the Record  immediately after my remarks.   Efforts at further reform of America's health care system have been  the source of frustration and division in this chamber. At the same  time, many members of both parties are committed to reducing health  care costs and expanding access to quality, affordable coverage. The  programs adopted by seven pioneering states have a proven track-record  in reducing premiums for consumers and would make policies in the  individual market more affordable. The bill Senator Manchin and I are  introducing today would help extend and fund these successful models to  every state that chooses to participate, helping to reduce premiums for  the 11.5 million Americans who get their insurance in the individual  market nationwide. I urge my colleagues to support our bill.                                                       May 28, 2019.        Dear Leaders McConnell and Schumer, Speaker Pelosi and       Leader McCarthy: As providers of health care and coverage to       hundreds of millions of Americans, we write to you to urge       prompt action to lower health insurance premiums. The       individual market is a critical source of coverage for       millions of Americans, helping them to access care.       Unfortunately, however, individual market premiums are often       unaffordable for many middle class families who do not       receive any financial assistance. With health insurers       finalizing their premium rates for 2020, the time is now for       Congress to establish a premium reduction/reinsurance program       to help cover the costs of people with significant health       care needs and improve the affordability of health care       coverage.        A reinsurance program is a commonsense solution to       significantly lower premiums, which would greatly improve       access to coverage and care. Independent analyses, including       ones by Oliver Wyman and Avalere Health, show that a premium       reduction/reinsurance program could reduce premiums by up to       20% while preserving the comprehensiveness of coverage,       primarily helping those who are not subsidy eligible.        We understand that there are numerous efforts in Congress       underway to establish a premium reduction/reinsurance       program, and we are happy to work with all parties towards a       final bill that will improve the individual market for 2020       and beyond.        We urge you to deliver on the promise to reduce premiums       for millions of deserving Americans and their families so       they can access the care they need. We look forward to       working with you in support of this promise.            Sincerely,      America's Health Insurance Plans.      American Academy of Family Physicians.

Hon. Susan Collins,      Senator, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the members of the       National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) we       write to express our support for your continued efforts to       help improve the individual health insurance markets in our       states through the funding of state stabilization programs.        While many states have seen more stable premium rates and       carrier participation over the past two years, the fact       remains that in all states premiums continue to be       significant for those who do not receive federal subsidies.       This has resulted in shrinking individual markets and less       stable risk pools. Action must be taken to make coverage more       affordable or we will see even higher uninsured rates, more       people move to less-regulated plans, and sicker individual       market pools.        This is why commissioners from across the political       spectrum have contacted their congressional delegations,       testified before House and Senate committees, and urged       federal policymakers to take immediate action to stabilize       the individual health insurance market. In particular, we       support your proposal to provide federal funding for state       stabilization programs, as well as for grants to help states       develop innovative solutions through Section 1332 waivers. We       also support the creation of a federal program to assist       consumers in states unable to implement their own program       quickly.        State reinsurance programs and invisible high-risk pools       have already proven their effectiveness. According to a       recent Avalere study, the seven states that have already       implemented a program through a Section 1332 waiver using       state funds have reduced premium by almost 20%. Additional       federal funding, as outlined in your bill, would provide even       more benefit to consumers, and extend the benefits to all       states.        Creating a federal market stabilization program is a cost-      effective way to significantly reduce individual market       premiums, thus making coverage more affordable to       unsubsidized individuals and families and growing the       individual market pool. We have seen it work in the handful       of states that have implemented such programs; it is time to       implement it nationwide.            Sincerely,      Eric A. Cioppa,        NAIC President, Superintendent, Maine Bureau of Insurance.      Raymond G. Farmer,        NAIC President-Elect, Director, South Carolina Department       of Insurance.
