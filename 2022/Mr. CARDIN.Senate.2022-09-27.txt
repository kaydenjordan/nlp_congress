 Mr. President, I wish to commend the adoption of the  resolution of ratification with respect to Treaty Document No. 117-1,  amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Adopting the Kigali Amendment, as  it is better known, will formalize the U.S. commitment to phase down  the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, under the global climate  treaty. These industrial chemicals commonly found in air conditioners  and refrigerators, insulating foams, and pharmaceutical inhalers are  potent greenhouse gases. This historic achievement is the latest in a  series by a Congress that will be remembered for its unprecedented  action to combat climate change and future-proof our economy.   Fittingly, last week was Climate Week NYC, an event that has taken  place every year in New York City since 2009. The summit takes place  alongside the UN General Assembly and brings together international  leaders from business, government, and civil society to showcase global  climate action.   A working paper on HFCs produced for the New Climate Economy by  Nathan Borgford-Parnell, Maxime Beaugrand, Stephen O. Anderson, and  Durwood Zaelke of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable  Development, highlights HFC phasedown as one of the greatest  opportunities to mitigate climate change quickly.   Specifically, reducing HFC use in line with the Kigali Amendment to  Montreal Protocol could avoid 0.5 degree Celsius--0.9 degree  Fahrenheit--of warming by 2100. That will go a long way toward limiting  warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius under the Paris Agreement and avoiding  the worst impacts of climate change. U.S. adoption of the resolution,  which has been ratified by 137 countries, contributes to delivering on  that commitment and cements the consensus on climate ambition as a  complement to thriving economies.   I would like to reflect on how we arrived at this moment. Under the  Montreal Protocol, participating countries  [[Page S5048]]  agreed to replace ozone-depleting products, such as  chlorofluorocarbons--CFCs--found in refrigerants, aerosols, and  solvents to help address the hole in the ozone layer. As a result,  there has been a 97-percent reduction in the global consumption of  controlled ozone-depleting substances, with minimal economic  disruption.   Hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--make up the majority of the ozone-friendly  products being used today to replace CFCs. HFCs can now be found in  nearly every home in the United States, namely in our air conditioners  and refrigerators. Although HFCs were developed as an ozone-layer- preserving alternative to historical refrigerants, they are now known  to be highly potent greenhouse gases--hundreds or thousands of times  more so than carbon dioxide. This discovery challenged policymakers and  manufacturers to keep innovating.   On October 15, 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda, more than 170 countries  negotiated an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to include a global  phasedown of HFCs. The goal of the Kigali Amendment is to achieve an 80  percent or greater reduction in global HFC consumption and production  by 2047.   Five years and three Presidential administrations later, on November  16, 2021, President Biden transmitted the Kigali Amendment to the U.S.  Senate, which was referred to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, where I am proud to serve. The Foreign Relations Committee  voted the Kigali Amendment out of committee by voice vote earlier this  year.   Today, U.S. businesses stand to benefit tremendously from the global  phase-down in hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--and, thereby, the ratification  of Kigali. This includes chemicals manufacturers such as Honeywell,  air-conditioning and refrigeration companies, and major retail  companies like Walmart. Honeywell, headquartered in North Carolina, has  a safety product manufacturing presence in Silver Spring, MD. I applaud  the U.S. businesses at the forefront of innovation and development of  commercially viable alternatives to HFCs that have already invested  billions of dollars in developing alternatives to HFCs, including in  anticipation of U.S. ratification of Kigali. This investment in  research and development and new capacity, mainly in the U.S., will  advance our ability to produce next-generation refrigerants, insulation  materials, aerosols, and solvents here at home, insulating our economy  from supply chain disruptions.   In fact, the United States is already implementing domestic  authorities to phase down the use of HFCs in a manner entirely  consistent with Kigali, under the American Manufacturing and  Innovation--AIM--Act that I am proud to have supported as a member of  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. During the  challenging early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee gathered  information from stakeholders on legislation introduced by Senators  Kennedy and Chairman Carper to establish a domestic phasedown of  hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--consistent with the Kigali Amendment to the  Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. We heard  from an extraordinary range of industry and environmental stakeholder  groups supporting this legislation, particularly those most directly  affected.   It was through this process that I learned that a Maryland academic  institution had contributed to the consensus around the economic  benefits of ratification. INFORUM, or Inter-industry Forecasting at the  University of Maryland, produced an analysis cited by the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and many of the  firms and industry associations that support the AIM bill. The  University of Maryland study found that the phasedown of HFCs will  create 33,000 new U.S. manufacturing jobs. When the indirect and  induced effects were added to estimate the total impact, the number of  jobs gained rose to 150,000.   On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was  enacted, which included the American Innovation and Manufacturing-- AIM--Act. The legislative language was nearly identical to the  bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Kennedy and Carper, which  had broad bipartisan backing in the Senate, with 16 Republican  cosponsors. EPA has already started implementing the AIM Act, with the  first regulations issued in October 2021.   Even before the Federal action taken in the last 2 years, States were  acting in their interests to reduce HFCs. In November 2020, the  Maryland Department of the Environment--MDE--finalized regulations to  phase out the use of HFCs and reduce methane emissions to help meet the  State's aggressive climate and environmental goals for reducing  greenhouse gases.   This sub-national action was designed to help Maryland meet its  requirements under the State's emissions reduction target, which was  subsequently made even more ambitious when the Climate Solutions Now  Act become State law. The act set a new target of net zero by 2045,  while continuing to have a net positive effect on the economy and job  creation. Maryland participates in the U.S. Climate Alliance and is a  member of the multi-State Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative--RGGI.   Maryland is also a leader for green building in the U.S., having been  included in the Top 10 States for LEED list every year since 2011. The  U.S. Green Buildings Council community has long shown leadership on  refrigerants, with key studies issued in the early 2000s probing the  balance between ozone layer and global warming.   In fact, since 2010, 63 percent of LEED-certified projects have  achieved the enhanced refrigerant management credit, which is intended  reduce ozone depletion and support early compliance with the Montreal  Protocol while minimizing direct contributions to climate change.  Embracing energy efficiency, including through the use of modern  refrigerants, across these properties has a tangible impact in their  home communities.   The Federal Government given its real estate footprint needs to lead  by example. Fortunately, there is major new Federal funding included in  the Inflation Reduction Act for the General Services Administration-- GSA--to do just that, including funding to improve the environmental  performance of Federal buildings and implement emerging and sustainable  technologies.   The next generation of coolant technologies is extremely energy  efficient. This means the transition to HFC alternatives will generate  billions of dollars in energy savings for American businesses and  consumers over the next decade. In total, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency--EPA--has estimated that the economic benefits from  implementing the AIM Act alone will be more than $270 billion. Clearly,  phasing down HFCs in favor of environmentally safer alternatives and  more energy-efficient cooling technologies benefits the climate and the  economy.   Nearly 1 year ago, I returned from my trip to Glasgow, Scotland, for  COP26, the 2021 United Nations--UN--Climate Change Conference, where  the need for concerted action at every level--State and local,  national, and international, and nongovernmental--was undeniable.   I was privileged to have 18 Senate colleagues join me to bolster  President Biden's agenda and the U.S. leadership role on the world  stage. The Glasgow Climate Pact established a clear consensus that all  nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic  rise in global temperatures. Thursday's Senate action by a comfortable  margin of 69-27 is a signal to the world that together we can protect  our economic interests and improve quality of life. While our work to  combat the climate crisis is hardly complete, we can build on the  momentum generated by this hopeful, strategic victory.   I will conclude by applauding my colleagues for their actions in  support of adoption of the Kigali Amendment, and for our years' long  efforts along the path to this historic moment.                            ____________________
