 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues and everyone  who spoke before me for recognizing the great achievements of a great  man.   Mike Long was somebody who I was proud to represent as a State  assembly member and then in Congress. He is somebody who truly believed  in faith, freedom, the American Dream, and family.   As was mentioned, he had an amazing, beautiful family, who I am also  very proud to serve, as I represent many of them. They are so dedicated  to our community of Brooklyn, to our city of New York, to our State,  and to our Nation. All the children contribute in one way or another to  the community that we are so proud to call home.   Mike served and led by example for his family. He was not just a  marine who served our country, willing to die for our country. He was  also a member of the City Council of New York. He was a small business  owner. He was also the chairman of the Conservative Party, which made  such an impression and was so influential in our city and State  politics for decades and still continues to be because of the  leadership of Mike Long.   When I first ran for the assembly, I was so proud to have the banner  of the Conservative Party and to have the support of somebody like Mike  Long, who had so much integrity and was so passionate about what we  believed in: that our country needs to be preserved, that we must  preserve our freedoms and our liberties, that we must make sure we  respect the taxpayer, that we make it easier for small businesses, and  that we support individual freedoms and liberties.   In fact, it was the Conservative Party that was the margin of victory  in my very first race, and so I owe a lot of my success to Michael Long  and his initial support of me.   So, I thank Mike Long for all he has done for our community, for the  delegation, for our city, and for our country. He will be missed.   I give my sincere condolences to his wife, Eileen, their nine  children, their 25 grandchildren, and their four great-grandchildren.  That just shows you how truly dedicated he was to his family. It is  just a beautiful family. God bless them.                                time  1845
