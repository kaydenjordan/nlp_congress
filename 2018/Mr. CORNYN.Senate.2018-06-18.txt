 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in a few minutes--maybe in about an hour  and a half--we will be voting on the National Defense Authorization  Act, which Congress has passed faithfully for 57 consecutive years.  That indicates the sense of importance we all have toward funding and  providing the authorities and equipment and training that are necessary  for our military to do the job we have asked it to do.   I particularly commend Senators Inhofe and Reed for their leadership  in guiding us through the passage of this bill.   There are 1.8 million people in the world who are on Active Duty in  the U.S. military--1.8 million people. The United States has 737  military installations, and the Department of Defense is  [[Page S3964]]  the world's largest employer. Supporting all of these people in these  facilities is no easy task, and the Defense authorization bill is one  very significant way in which we do exactly that. It is how we make  sure that all of the men and women in uniform are paid, that our  alliances are strengthened, and that military facilities are properly  modernized and maintained.   The bill we are voting on will support an appropriation of up to $716  billion for those tasks. I might add that that is a huge number, but  this is the Federal Government's No. 1 responsibility. In my opinion,  everything else the Federal Government does comes after providing for  the common defense because nobody else--no local government, no State  government, no private sector--could possibly provide for the common  defense.   America's leadership role in the world remains essential because we  know that while there are other countries that will work with us--for  example, our NATO allies--they require and the world really demands  American leadership, and that is what provides for the safety and  security and the peace all across the planet.   In Texas, there are roughly 200,000 men and women who wear the  uniform of the U.S. military in places like Fort Hood, Joint Base San  Antonio, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and Dyess Air Force Base in  Abilene. Those are the people I think of each year as we take up the  Defense authorization bill. We rely on them to provide our security,  and they rely on us to deliver what they need in order to be  successful.   One thing this year's bill will do is to give our troops a 2.6- percent pay raise, which will be the largest in 10 years. It doesn't  sound like a lot, but I am sure they will appreciate it nonetheless.   Given the state of today's world, maintaining our military readiness  has never been more important or more difficult. The array of security  threats that face the United States is more complex and diverse than it  has been at any time since World War II. Our military leaders say that  the strategic environment has not been this competitive since the Cold  War. Our adversaries are investing in their capabilities and, in some  areas, are surpassing us. Simply put, America no longer enjoys the  comparative advantage it once had over our competitors and adversaries.   As I said earlier, the Defense authorization bill is important for  reasons that hit much closer to home. I am thinking about Texas  military families and military facilities. This year's Defense  authorization bill will authorize $158 million for military  construction projects in Texas, including a new basic military training  dormitory at Joint Base San Antonio and a new warehouse at the Red  River Army Depot in East Texas.   It will prioritize access to high-quality education for military  children, establish a Federal grant program for infrastructure near  military communities, as well as to protect our airports and airfields  from radar interference, which builds on previous efforts at Sheppard  Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.   One additional part of the Defense authorization bill I will  highlight promotes justice for victims of sexual assault on military  bases. This stems from a piece of legislation that I cosponsored with  the Senator from Maine, Mr. King, which has been included in the final  bill that we are voting on, called the Children of Military Protection  Act. It is based on actual case studies at Fort Hood and Fort Bliss  that were brought to my attention by military lawyers.   Finally, the Defense authorization bill will invest in a medical  program at Fort Bliss, cyber institutes at places like Texas A&M, and  our workhorse legacy fighter aircraft, like the F-16s at Joint Base  Fort Worth.   Texas priorities are far from the only ones addressed in the NDAA,  but they are important, and I am glad we are taking care of  servicemembers in my State and keeping our commitment to them. So let's  get the NDAA across the finish line this evening.                           Family Separation Policy    Madam President, the other issue I want to talk about is the ongoing  situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is the border from my State  to Mexico--1,200 miles of common border.   Just like under the Obama administration in 2014, we have seen a  surge of unaccompanied children and families coming across our southern  border during the spring and summer months. Overwhelmingly, these  families and these children are coming from Central America--in other  words, from countries that are not adjacent to or contiguous to the  United States. Some have presented themselves lawfully at ports of  entry, but others have tried to enter illegally.   For example, if you are attempting to claim asylum, you can show up  at one of our bridges or ports of entry and claim asylum without  breaking the law. Yet, if you enter the country between the ports of  entry--through the wild, wild west, I will call it, of the Texas  frontier and border region--you will be entering the country illegally.  You can then claim asylum, but you will still have entered the country  illegally, so your asylum claim will have to be considered in that  context.   The Trump administration has made the decision to enforce all of our  laws by prosecuting adults in criminal court when they are apprehended  after having crossed our borders illegally. I support that approach--a  zero tolerance approach--for adults who violate our immigration laws.  This law has been on the books for many decades but has not always been  adequately enforced.   Because of numerous Federal court decisions, settlements, and  statutes, an adult can be separated from a child as part of the legal  process as it plays out. That way, children are placed in separate,  safer settings. I doubt many of us would want a child to go to a jail  cell in which somebody is being held for having illegally entered the  country. That is why children are put in separate, safer settings. They  aren't left unattended to fend for themselves amongst potentially  violent criminals who are being detained in regular ICE or Bureau of  Prison facilities.   Those legal decisions, settlements, and statutes are important to  acknowledge because, as the New York Times stated this week, ``There is  no [express] Trump administration policy stating that illegal border  crossers must be separated from their children.'' So the New York  Times--hardly a big Trump cheerleader--has said, ``There is no  [express] Trump administration policy stating that illegal border  crossers must be separated from their children.'' In other words, this  is as a result of other consent decrees and laws which are within the  power of Congress to change. In fact, I think every Member of this  Chamber will agree that we should never be placing children in prison  cells or jails with hardened criminals when their parents are being  prosecuted. By the same token, I don't want family members to be  separated from one another as a result of DHS and administration  officials enforcing the laws they are sworn to uphold. We have to keep  family members together and prevent unnecessary hardship, stress, and  outrage.    The good news is, we have it within our power to find a better way  because parents who are awaiting court proceedings shouldn't have to do  so separated from their children and children shouldn't be taken from  their parents and left frightened and confused about where they are and  what is transpiring around them.   In 2014, I introduced a bipartisan bill called the HUMANE Act with my  colleague Representative Henry Cuellar of Laredo, TX. I plan to soon  reintroduce an updated version of that legislation. It will include  provisions that mitigate the problem of family separation while  improving the immigration court process for unaccompanied children and  families apprehended at the border.   To the greatest extent possible, families presenting at ports of  entry or apprehended crossing the border illegally will be kept  together while waiting for their court hearings, which will be  expedited. Additionally, this legislation will help eliminate the  incentive for unaccompanied minors and family units with children to  come to the U.S. illegally by expediting their court hearings. We found  that catch and release is merely an inducement for further illegal  immigration. By detaining these families together to make sure they  appear before an immigration judge and receive any immigration benefits  they are entitled to under Federal law, this will serve as a further  deterrent for others who do not qualify  [[Page S3965]]  for those immigration benefits. These minors should be afforded all  required due process and have access to representation in court when  making their claims. Through this expedited immigration court process,  we would help ensure that children and family units with claims for  immigration relief in the United States are able to receive their day  in court rather than waiting in a multiyear backlog.   This legislation is not a solution for all of our problems at the  border--far be it--but it would make real improvements to deter illegal  immigration while ensuring the humane treatment of children and family  members who entered the country in violation of our laws. I ask  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a hard look at this bill  and work together to find a reasonable solution for this component of  the crisis at our border.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman), the Senator from Louisiana (Mr.  Cassidy), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).
