 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize  Thompson Shoes of Manchester, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Thompson Shoes in Manchester was founded by Gary and Keith Thompson  in 1958 as the first of nine shoe stores owned by the Thompson  brothers. Keith ran the Manchester location until 1990 when the  location was purchased by Tracy Bessey. The current owners, husband and  wife duo Todd and Shelly Schrader, purchased the Manchester Thompson  Shoes location from Tracy Bessey on January 1, 2011. Under the  Schrader's ownership, Shelly serves as president, with Todd serving as  vice president. The store offers a variety of athletic shoes, dress  shoes, and boots. In addition to shoes, they also carry socks and offer  shoe sizing services to customers at the store. The Shraders have also  built a special bond with Keith Thompson and Tracy Bessey over the  years. Both former owners have paid regular visits to the store's  events since 2011.   Small businesses are often successful because of the hard work and  dedication of their team. Dianne  [[Page S5710]]  Oberbroeckling has spent 38 years at the Thompson Shoes Manchester  location, working for all three owners and serving three decades of  customers. Gary and Keith Thompson passed away in 1993 and 2023  respectively, leaving behind a legacy of community service, hard work,  and dedication to customer service.   Thompson Shoes in Manchester is actively involved in both the  Manchester and Delaware County communities and has been recognized for  its hard work. They are involved in the Maquoketa Valley, West  Delaware, and Edgewood-Colesburg school districts by supporting both  students and athletics programs. Since 2018, they have hosted the Move  for Mimosas races. The races are free of charge and allow participants  to try out new shoes from various vendors while enjoying a mimosa. They  also sponsor the Hero Hustle, an annual triathlon and duathlon  supporting the police, fire, and ambulance departments of Delaware  County. In 2022, they won the Manchester Chamber of Commerce's Business  of the Year award for their continued dedication to the community.  Thompson Shoes in Manchester celebrated its 65th business anniversary  in 2023.   Thompson Shoes' commitment to providing quality shoes at a great  price in Manchester, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate Shelly and  Todd Schrader, and the entire team at Thompson Shoes for their  continued dedication to Iowans. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
