 I rise today in support of the nomination of Robin  Hutcheson to be Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration.   As the Presiding Officer knows, her experience as Deputy  Administrator and, currently, as Acting Administrator will serve her  well. I am proud to say that she used to call Minnesota home, where she  served as Director of Public Works for the City of Minneapolis for many  years.   Ms. Hutcheson brings much experience with her to this job. She has  served in three roles at the U.S. Department of Transportation: Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Safety Policy, FMCSA Deputy Administrator, and  currently, as Acting Administrator. She has a strong track record on  safety.   As the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Safety Policy for U.S. DOT, she  was instrumental in developing the National Roadway Safety Strategy and  the new Safe Streets and Roads for All program.   She also has local experience managing transportation systems in  three States across the country: Minnesota, as we discussed, Utah, and  Montana. In her role as Director of Public Works for the City of  Minneapolis, she oversaw a 1,100-person team across nine divisions,  including all transportation functions.   During a time when our supply chains are being tested to their  limits, I believe that her public and private experience, as well as  her experience at both the local and Federal level, will bring a unique  perspective to the role and improve the safety of our transportation  networks.   I will address her unanimous consent proposal in a minute.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am now going to turn to the next  item on my agenda before we all adjourn, and that is a speech in  support of the DISCLOSE Act and the need to take action to get secret  money out of our elections.   I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this  legislation and testimony at the Committee on Rules and Administration  hearing I held on it this summer.   Senator Whitehouse has championed this bill since 2012, and I have  been proud to support it alongside him in every Congress.   I also want to thank Leader Schumer for holding a vote to advance  this bill today. While the vote was ultimately unsuccessful, it is  important that the people of this country understand that Senate  Democrats--and only Senate Democrats, it appears--remain committed to  addressing secret money in our election.   This vote could not have come at a more important time, as we are  seeing an unprecedented flood of money into our elections. Over $14  billion was spent during the 2020 election, the most expensive in our  country's history.   As we approach the general election in November with 48 days left,  this is already--and we still have 48 days left--the most expensive  midterm election ever. One estimate expects that nearly $10 billion  will be spent just on political advertising this election cycle, more  than double the $4 billion in the 2018 midterm elections.   As spending on elections increases, the sources of the spending are  less accountable than ever before. One investigation found that more  than $1 billion was spent on the 2020 elections by groups that do not  disclose their donors at all.   I want people to think about this. One billion was spent on the 2020  election, one billion--not million--$1 billion, by groups that do not  disclose their donors at all. No one likes that; I don't care if you  are Democrat, Republican, or Independent, you at least want to know  what money is being spent and who is paying for these negative ads that  you see all over TV.   As spending on election increases, the sources of that spending are  less accountable than ever before. Americans know there is way too much  [[Page S4964]]  money in our elections, and for our democracy to work, we need to know  where the money is coming from. It is that simple.   But since the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United opened up  the flood of outside money, overturned so much of the bipartisan work  that had been done by our former colleague Senator McCain--who we miss  dearly--as well as Senator Feingold, our neighbor in Wisconsin, but  since that time and the overturning of those requirements of the  McCain-Feingold campaign restrictions, there have been no significant  improvements made to disclosure laws or regulations.   Unlimited, anonymous spending in our elections doesn't encourage free  speech; it drowns out the voices of you. It drowns out the voices of  the American people who want to participate and be treated like  everyone else. They have one vote just like a billionaire has a vote.  Yet, what do we see? The billionaire gets to have undue influence, and  we don't even know who he is because it is shrouded in secrecy because  there is no requirement that the name be disclosed.    This unrelenting secret spending will continue unless we take action  to address it. That is why we need to pass the DISCLOSE Act.   The DISCLOSE Act would address this tidal wave of secret money by  requiring outside groups that spend in our elections to disclose their  large donors--those that contribute more than $10,000.   How could anyone be opposed to this? We are not talking about a lot  of paperwork. We are talking about people who give more than $10,000.  Looking around the Gallery, looking at the pages, I just find it hard  to believe there are people right here that are going to give over  $10,000 and then hide behind some kind of curtain of nondisclosure.  That is what is happening. We just want to know who they are.   Importantly, the bill also makes it harder for wealthy special  interests to hide their contributions to cloak the identity of donors,  and it cracks down on the use of shell companies to conceal the  donations of foreign nationals.   Let me repeat that. Who could be against trying to figure out whether  shell companies are hiding the donations of foreign nationals, of  people who don't even live in America who are trying to influence our  elections?   I held a hearing on the bill in the Committee on Rules and  Administration on the DISCLOSE Act this summer, where we heard about  the effects that secret money is having on our democracy and why we  need to pass this legislation.   Senator Whitehouse testified at the hearing, and he spoke powerfully  about the impact that secret money is having on our government,  affecting all aspects of our lives, from the makeup of our courts to  people's healthcare decisions to addressing climate change.   We also heard from Montana's Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff  Mangan, who told us how his State's version of the DISCLOSE Act passed  in 2015 with bipartisan support. Let me repeat that. In Montana, red  and blue worked together and got this passed. I couldn't agree more  that transparency in our democracy should not be a partisan issue, and  regardless of political party, we should know who is spending on our  elections.   The American people know what is at stake. So it is no surprise that  campaign finance disclosure laws have overwhelming support. One recent  poll found that in swing States, 91 percent of likely voters-- Republicans and Democrats--those are States that go red or blue, may be  considered purple--91 percent of likely voters--Republicans and  Democrats--support full transparency of campaign contributions and  spending in our elections.   Another poll from 2019 found that across America, 83 percent of  likely voters support public disclosures of contributions. Those are  people regardless of their political stripes. There is also a long  history of bipartisan support for reducing the influence of money in  our democracy.   In fact, the very first limits on corporate campaign contributions  came in 1907, the Tillman Act, the landmark Federal Election Campaign  Act then passed in 1972, and as I noted, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform  Act in 2002 was also bipartisan, supported by Senators John McCain and  Russ Feingold. They joined together to champion, to pass this really  important bill. Guess what. All three of those bills I just mentioned,  the one in 1907, the one in 1972, the one in 2002, they were all signed  into law by Republican Presidents. This has always been a bipartisan  issue in our country.   Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, never one to hide his  opinions, was also a staunch supporter of campaign finance disclosure.  In a 2010 case, Doe v. Reed, he wrote:         For my part, I do not look forward to a society which,       thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns anonymously . . .       hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the       accountability of criticism.    These are his words:         This does not resemble the Home of the Brave.    You can't get much more conservative than former Justice Scalia. This  is a bipartisan issue. We ask our colleagues to change their minds.  Ensuring the transparency of our elections has been and should continue  to be a bipartisan value.   These issues are at the very heart of our democracy, and this  commonsense bill would protect the right of voters to make informed  choices and know who has been trying to influence our elections.   As we move forward, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  these measures in the future as well as the measures in the Freedom to  Vote Act, which the DISCLOSE Act was part of that I led in the Senate  that would give us baseline--baseline--rules of the road for the voters  of this country to be able to make sure they can cast their votes  regardless of whether they live in Minnesota or Texas.   With that, I would like to turn to a few other matters that will help  to close the Senate that I will receive in a few minutes. I have one. I  will get started. Here we go. This is very exciting, happening in real  time for all those watching. See, we are all prepared.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to celebrate the  Senate's ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocols  to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, also known as HFCs. Not  only did this critical amendment receive resounding bipartisan support,  it also marked our Nation's participation in the most significant  climate treaty in 30 years.   Across the country, there have been alarming examples of extreme  weather. Parts of California are blanketed in black smoke from  wildfires, many Kentuckians are still without homes as a result of  flooding in July, and Hurricane Fiona left millions of Puerto Ricans  without power. And around the world, we have seen a devastating drought  in East Africa, Greenland's ice sheet's largest September melt event on  record, and flooding in Pakistan that left a third of the country  underwater. It is clear that climate change isn't something that's  happening 100 years in the future, it's happening now.   That is why our ratification of the Kigali Amendment is so critical.  HFCs are particularly potent greenhouse gasses, disproportionately  responsible for rising temperatures that are linked to catastrophic  weather events. By joining the effort to reduce global HFC consumption  and production by 80 percent by 2047, we can help prevent 0.5 degrees C  of warming by the end of this century.   In addition to helping the planet, phasing out the use of HFCs in  common consumer products like refrigerators and air-conditioners will  deliver clear benefits to the American people in the form of lower  energy bills. It also creates huge opportunities for U.S. businesses  that have developed green alternatives to HFCs to reach global markets.  This is one of the many situations where what is good for our planet is  also good for consumers and businesses.   The ratification of the Kigali Amendment builds on the progress our  country made with the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, which  included provisions to tackle the climate crisis. Because of this law,  we are on track to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030. It  was a huge step, but we still have more work to do to become a  [[Page S4965]]  completely carbon neutral economy by 2050.   To keep paving the way to our clean energy future, I introduced  several pieces of legislation to accelerate our energy transition,  including the HEATR Act, to drive manufacturing of heat pumps and the  Energy Efficiency for Affordable Housing Act to make it easier for  people living in affordable housing to invest in more efficient  systems.   With the ratification of the Kigali Amendment, we are asserting our  global leadership in the fight to combat climate change. Working on the  national and international level, we can mitigate the worst impacts of  climate change while generating benefits for the American people and  opportunities for American businesses.                            ____________________     First of all, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar No. 1041 and 1150; that the Senate vote on the  nominations, en bloc, without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that  the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, I will note that the two Senators  from Minnesota are now controlling the Chamber.   But we have also, during our time in the Chamber alone, confirmed  someone who used to live in our State, and she would be Robin Meredith  Cohn Hutcheson, to be the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier  Safety Administration, in addition to the U.S. attorney for the State  of Tennessee.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7846, which was  received from the House.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time.    Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  bill.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, the next matter before the Senate is  a bill that Senator Grassley and I have long led, the Kevin and  Avonte's Law reauthorization.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of S. 4885 and the Senate proceed  to its immediate consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, now resolutions en bloc.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the en bloc  consideration of the following Senate resolutions, introduced earlier  today: S. Res. 793, S. Res. 794, and S. Res. 795.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 796, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn under the  provisions of S. Res. 796 until 11 a.m. on Friday, September 23, to  convene for a pro forma session, with no business conducted; further,  that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, it stand adjourned until 3  p.m. on Tuesday, September 27, and that following the prayer and  pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings  be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the  motion to proceed to Calendar No. 389, H.R. 6833; further, that the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed at  5:30 p.m.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Sullivan of  Alaska.
