 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out in support of  international press freedom and to highlight, in particular, two  egregious cases of government assaults on the rights of journalists.   This Saturday, a court in Egypt will decide whether to execute an  award-winning photojournalist for doing his job. While in Myanmar,  formerly known as Burma, the Nobel Prize-winning former political  prisoner, Aung San Suu Kyi, has overseen the imprisonment and  sentencing of two Reuters reporters who were attempting to shed light  on the atrocities committed by the Burmese military against the  Rohingya minority.   In Egypt, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, who is known professionally as Shawkan,  was taken into custody along with two other journalists while  photographing the violent dispersal of a protest in Rabaa Square on  August 14, 2013. The other journalists were foreign nationals and were  released within hours, while Shawkan, an Egyptian, has been abused and  beaten, denied his freedom, due process, and adequate medical treatment  ever since--simply for doing his job.   In 2016, the U.N. Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary  Detention issued a report on his case, calling his detention  ``arbitrary'' and recommending that he be released immediately.   Shawkan received the 2018 UNESCO Freedom Prize and has been  recognized by press freedom organizations worldwide for his outstanding  contributions to the profession in the face of danger.   In July, I sent a letter to President Sisi of Egypt urging him to  support the immediate release of Shawkan or, at the very least, to  support an individual trial instead of the mass trial that serves as a  basis of his detention so that evidence specific to his case can be  heard and considered. The Egyptian Government has not responded to this  letter, and they are planning to sentence Shawkan as early as this  weekend.   Unfortunately, Egypt is not alone in its harassment and imprisonment  of members of the press. Just this week a Burmese court sentenced Wa  Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, reporters working for Reuters, to 7 years in  prison following their arrest while reporting on the mass killing of 10  Rohingya Muslim men in the village of Inn Din, Rakhine State, last  September.   This decision is a significant step backward in Burma's transition to  democracy and reflects poorly on the Aung San Suu Kyi government's  commitment to those same democratic ideals for which he was punished  not so long ago.   The freedom to express oneself is a fundamental right enshrined in  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The freedom of the press and  the public's right to information are paramount to the success of a  democracy. The censorship and degradation of the press is among the  most effective tools for oppression and control.   Thomas Jefferson captured this sentiment when he said, and I  paraphrase, if forced to choose, he would prefer newspapers without a  government rather than a government without newspapers.   Today, authoritarian rule has targeted members of the press in order  to stifle dissent and maintain power. According to Freedom House, only  13 percent of the world's population enjoys a free press. Global press  freedom has declined to its lowest point since 2013 amid unprecedented  threats to journalists in major democracies and attempts by  authoritarian states to control the media, even beyond their borders.   We are witnessing a new era in press suppression as even politicians  in democracies attempt to shape news coverage by undermining  traditional media outlets, exerting influence over public broadcasters,  and favoring friendly private outlets.   Unfortunately, the current President of the United States has led the  charge against the press with nearly daily tirades against the media,  branding them as the enemy of the state and rejecting the news media's  role in holding public servants accountable. Just  [[Page H7879]]  yesterday, President Trump suggested he would like to change libel laws  in order to prevent negative news stories about himself, a tactic more  suited to Russian or Iranian leadership than the world's greatest  democracy.   And let there be no doubt that leaders around the world take note of  the President's attacks on the press. They know that the Trump  administration has no interest in lecturing them about their human  rights abuses and no leg to stand on if it did.   So the Egypts and Burmas of the world will continue to ignore  national norms while the Trump administration looks the other way or  worse. That is why, as Members of Congress, it is absolutely imperative  that we remind the world that, no matter what the President says, we  have not forgotten our values, those universal values that apply to  every man, woman, and child. We must remain vigilant and defend against  even the smallest attacks on the free and independent press, because  the loss of this freedom creeps slowly like a cancer on our democracy.   I urge the Governments of Egypt and Burma to do the right thing and  end their attacks on the media and release Shawkan, Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe  Oo, and all other political prisoners. I will continue to use my voice  to advocate for them and the hundreds of other journalists around the  world whose freedoms are at risk because of their work and because of  what they do every day, and I hope my friends on both sides of the  aisle will join me in this effort.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, they say a picture is worth a thousand  words. This is a the moment when Judge Brett Kavanaugh refused to shake  the hand of Fred Guttenberg, a man whose 14-year old daughter was  murdered during a school shooting at Parkland, Florida earlier this  year.   Instead of shaking his hand, Judge Kavanaugh buttoned up his jacket,  turned and walked away. That moment said all I need to know about Judge  Kavanaugh. It is clear he doesn't possess the empathy necessary to  serve on the highest court in the land.   Yesterday, Judge Kavanaugh said he wants both parties in his cases  believing he gave them a fair shake. And yet, when facing a man who  lost his daughter in one of the most horrific school shootings in our  country's history, he wouldn't even shake his hand.   As a judge, Brett Kavanaugh said he believes a ban on the sale of  semiautomatic assault weapons is unconstitutional. That is his record.   On the Supreme Court, he will allow the unrestricted sale of weapons  like the one used to kill Mr. Guttenberg's daughter. But as a person,  his actions toward Mr. Guttenberg on Tuesday speak louder than any  legal opinion he could write.   The Senate must reject his nomination.                            ____________________
