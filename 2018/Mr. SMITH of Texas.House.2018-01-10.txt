 Mr. Speaker, Congress should include an E-Verify  employment eligibility verification program in any immigration reform  package. E-Verify is the most effective deterrent to illegal  immigration because it shuts off the jobs magnet and saves jobs for  hardworking Americans. It is no surprise that E-Verify receives the  most public support--82 percent--of any proposed immigration reform.   The E-Verify legislation, the Legal Workforce Act, approved by the  Judiciary Committee, has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  and immigration enforcement groups. It provides employers with an  efficient and workable system to verify their employees' work status,  and the requirement for employers to verify their workers only applies  to new employees, not existing workers.   Members should hesitate to support any immigration reform package  that does not include requiring employers to use E-Verify. Congress  should put the interests of American workers first.                            ____________________
