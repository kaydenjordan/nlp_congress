 Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, the Senate announced a  bipartisan framework to help individuals and small businesses through  the Chinese coronavirus crisis, then politics entered the fray. In the  5 days that have followed, coronavirus has cost hundreds of Americans  their lives, over 40,000 infections have occurred, and millions of jobs  have been lost.   But, thank goodness, cooler, more pragmatic heads have now prevailed.   I want to thank our President for his leadership, for halting travel  from China, and I want to thank the President for reaching out early to  private enterprise to solve the testing challenges. These are the  decisions that actually saved lives.   And, finally, I want to thank the President for his constant message  of hope and determination, for believing in us, that we will develop  cures and vaccines, that we can and will rebuild this great economy.   As a physician, I want to remind Americans to follow the President's  15-day guidelines. Let's flatten the curve. Let's not let up. Let's  ignore petty political games and beat this virus. As one Nation under  God, this exceptional Nation will prevail.
