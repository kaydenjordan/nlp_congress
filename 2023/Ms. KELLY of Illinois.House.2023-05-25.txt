 Madam Speaker, it is an unfortunate reality  that hypocrisy has become a guiding principle of the leadership of this  body.   Three times we raised the debt limit under the previous President.  Those three times the American people never once had to worry that we  would not pay our bills or that their retirement was in danger.   This is a manufactured crisis by House Republicans. It is an act of  calculated cruelty that would put millions out of work and force  families across the country to wonder where their next meal will come  from.   In my district, an estimated 95,600 households with Social Security  checks are at risk.   My constituents are not alone. Madam Speaker, think of the people  back home who elected you to represent their interests faithfully. It  is in no one's interest to manufacture an economic crisis.   We can fix this crisis right now. All we need are five brave  Republicans, five Republicans who care about veterans, five Republicans  who care about Social Security, five Republicans who care about  Medicare, and five Republicans who care about our future.    It is time to do our job.                            ____________________
