 Mr. Chairman, our energy security is under attack. This  administration has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, selling off  40 percent of the reserve in just the last 2 years.   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now at its lowest level in 40  years, posing a threat to our country in the event of a real emergency.  Yet, this administration has failed to implement even a simple plan to  replace the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is what this bill does.   With the Strategic Production Response Act, Republicans are stepping  up to the plate to ensure any nonemergency release is accompanied by a  plan to increase the percentage of Federal lands and water leased for  oil and gas exploration.   This is responsible. This is common sense. This bill is a critical  step in unleashing our domestic energy production, increasing our  emergency supply, and delivering on our promise to protect our Nation's  energy security.
