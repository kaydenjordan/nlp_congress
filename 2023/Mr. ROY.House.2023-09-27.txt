 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment  because it is extremely important. The reason there isn't a mandate at  the Department of Defense right now is because we demanded that it end.  That is the truth. We forced it through on that ridiculous omnibus  spending bill last December.   Here is the reality. We have a doctor here in the building right now  speaking to a group of members from Johns Hopkins University talking  about the extent to which the current iteration of the COVID vaccine  has been tested on 10 lab rats. It hasn't gone through any human trials  that are necessary.   When my father had polio and the vaccine came after, it was a decade  of testing and trials. We have stuck this vaccine out because of panic.  We have undermined the health and well-being of our soldiers, airmen,  and marines. We should stop it. We should prohibit it in the future,  and we should make backpay available to our former members of the  military that were kicked out.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendment that I have offered increases  funding for the inspector general by $20 million for an Office of the  Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance, if authorized, to  enhance the oversight and accountability measures for funds  appropriated for Ukraine, increasing the inspector general by $20  million.   Over the last year and half, Congress has appropriated approximately  $113 billion in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   I am one of these individuals that believes that we did have  agreements with Ukraine, and we have got to recognize those from the  mid-1990s when we asked them to denuclearize and work with our partners  in Eastern Europe.   I also don't believe that we ought to be just providing an endless  supply of funds to Ukraine with no clear mission, with no clear  accountability of the dollars, and without clear accountability of  whether NATO and our European allies are upholding their end of the  bargain.   This is a step to try to rectify at least one part of that: by making  sure there is a fully empowered inspector general, to make sure that  the information that we have is complete, and that we have a full  understanding of every dollar that has already been appropriated and  might be appropriated in the future, and to make sure that we are  tracking it to the level that is necessary.   There have been a number of different issues that we have identified  in the past. For example, if you look at other conflicts like  Afghanistan, the lead for the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  found at least $19 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Afghanistan  was lost to waste, fraud, and abuse from 2002 to 2020.   It is critically important that we track this and follow it and  understand it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments, and I  think we have a general agreement on what we are trying to accomplish.   I would note that in the NDAA we passed an authorization for this,  and this would be the appropriation necessary to carry it out. That was  the desire of our efforts to try to put a birds-eye view on this across  agencies to ensure that dollars are being spent the way they are  supposed to.   Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas  (Mr. Womack).    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).  [[Page H4621]]         Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendment I am offering reduces the salary  of Cyrus Salazar, the director of the Department of Defense's Office  for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to $1. You might ask why we would  do that.   It is a power that we have in the House of Representatives under the  Holman rule to try to restrain the executive branch, both in terms of  expense, dollars and how they are being used, and in terms of what they  are being used for.   The American people are frankly getting a little tired of a  Department of Defense that is being taken far too often off mission, I  hear it all the time. I hear it from veterans. I hear it from Active- Duty servicemembers. I hear it from recruits. With recruiting numbers  at low levels, with morale at questionable levels, we need to re- instill in our military a crystal clear focus on mission first.   Importantly, when we are--to use the gentlewoman's term, which I take  to heart--pinching pennies and trying to find dollars, we need to stop  racking up $33 trillion in debt when we can't even figure out how to  fund the salaries of our rank-and-file men and women in uniform at the  level that we might need to when we are dealing with issues of  increasing health costs, when we are dealing with issues of having a  fully armed military with the latest and greatest technology to defeat  China.   It would seem questionable that, for example, we would have positions  like the following: The Air Force is looking for a supervisory  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion accessibility officer in Arlington,  Virginia, that will pay between $155,700 to $183,500 per year.   Another one, the Air Force is looking for a Diversity, Equity, and  Inclusion manager to work at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, that  pays between $94,199 to $122,459 per year. There is another position in  Alaska. There is another position in Alabama. I could go down the list,  and this is the top of that pyramid.   What we are trying to say is we shouldn't do this. We need to stop  this. We need to stop diverting the mission of the military, which is a  laudable goal of ensuring you got a workforce that is representative of  the population of this country. You don't need an entire bureaucracy  within the Pentagon to do it that is then perpetuating a lot of  divisive policies.   For example, West Point Academy slides told cadets that ``whiteness''  is ``a location of structural advantage, of race privilege,'' is ``a  standpoint or place from which White people look at themselves and the  rest of society,'' and ``refers to a set of cultural practices that are  usually unmarked and unnamed.''   There is another, Kelisa Wing, former chief diversity officer at  DOD's schools. ``I'm so exhausted at these White folx in these PD  [professional development] sessions. This lady actually had the  CAUdacity to say that Black people can be racist too.''   This is not the kind of thing that should be going on at the United  States military and the Pentagon. This is one step of many that we need  to take to return the military to its core mission and end this social  engineering wrapped in a uniform, rather than doing the job of  defending this great country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, the United States military is one of the few  institutions in America where the skills of the men or women on either  side of you could mean the difference between life and death.   At the end of the day, it embodies I think Dr. King's notion of  judging men and women on the content of their character, not the color  of their skin. Yet, the Biden administration is infatuated with  divvying us up by race, with divvying us up by our immutable  characteristics.   The fact is, with all due respect--and I appreciate the gentlewoman's  remarks and the tone in which they were offered--corporate America is  slashing DEI officers amid a backlash of diversity programs across the  country.   There is a story right here about the numbers of how many offices  have been slashed over the last year, in part because they don't add  much value to the bottom line in which the economy is hurting and  people are suffering; and also in part because they are getting a  backlash from having so much focus on divvying us up by race and all  these characteristics--it is not actually good.   We are seeing this in countless corporations across the country.  There is story after story, if you just Google it and see what is going  on out there. I think the Department of Defense should be in line with  where we are seeing our society recoil at this divvying us up by race.  This is one way to accomplish that objective.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment that is being put forward here  would say that none of the funds made available by this Act may be used  to carry out the observance of Pride Month authorized by the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness for the Cultural  Observances and Awareness Events list.   First of all, that whole title should give you a little bit of pause.  At the end of the day, in line with the amendment that I just offered,  the goal here should be to ensure that our military is focused on the  mission and building cohesion to accomplish the mission.                                time  1400    Now we have got the Department of Defense focusing on, for example,  the Air Force releasing a memo entitled Department of the Air Force  Observance of LGBTQ Pride Month which empowered installation commanders  to plan and conduct appropriate activities in honor of Pride Month,  which they then did. That then resulted in, for example, the Department  of the Navy issuing a memo declaring June's month theme, ``Peace, Love,  Revolution.'' There was a flyer advertising Robins Air Force Base 2023  Pride Month events, which included information for servicemembers and  their families to attend the Pride Night game night and unity and  diversity color run. Because some of the colleagues voiced opposition,  Nellis Air Force Base approved and then canceled a scheduled drag show  to celebrate Pride Month.   What on Earth are we doing? I represent Fort Sam Houston in San  Antonio. I represent countless veterans attached to or who have served  at Joint Base San Antonio or otherwise in central Texas. My  constituents come to me, and they just shake their heads, and say: What  are we doing? What happened?   We need to beat China. We need to be able to be in a position to  carry out multiple-front wars around the globe, if necessary. We need  to have the finest fighting force in the world with the best technology  and the best training.   Again, it is one thing to respect someone's private life and  differences, but to carry out your objective in the office without  having the Department of Defense promoting events dividing us up by our  various characteristics. That is the reality.   On social media, the marines tweeted a Pride Month image with  rainbow-tipped bullets on a marine helmet featuring the words: Proud to  serve. I am sure the Chinese military is quaking in its boots with the  rainbow-tipped bullets being tweeted around the world.   The Air Force tweeted an image with the silhouette of an airman  saluting in front of a Pride flag. The Navy changed their logo on  social media to ships and aircraft in front of a rainbow flag.   Again, that is the flag right there: Red, white, and blue. That is  the flag--no other flag--when we are talking about what the United  States military should be standing in front of and should be  projecting.   I have very few constituents who disagree with this sentiment that we  should be focused on having a military that is designed to, when called  upon, blow stuff up and kill people in defense of this country, as  needed, and to be the best fighting force to accomplish that objective  in the world. They need to be trained and to have a clear mission. And,  oh by the way, side note, while I am sitting here on the floor talking  about the Department of Defense appropriations, the military should not  be engaged in endless conflict without congressional engagement in  terms of authorization of the use of military force, which, by the way,  we were supposed to be addressing by the end of this month. I will save  that for a different speech.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will be brief in the interest of moving things  along. The only thing I would note is, with respect to the difference,  for example, of talking about Christmas trees and celebrating the birth  of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and putting up a Pride flag, I  would say those things are different.    I would also note that there have been problems at the Department of  Defense with people expressing their faith. In fact, there are  Christians who are being limited in their ability to have Christian  displays in their offices, and we had to have groups like First Liberty  go litigate it in court in order to defend their right to be able to  display said Christian symbols and statements in their office cubicle.   This is what is going on at the Department of Defense, and people  don't understand it.   I think this is a commonsense effort to refocus our military on the  mission to which it should be focused. Acknowledging that we are a  diverse community is great, but the Department of Defense can  acknowledge that diversity and bring people together to carry out the  mission without perpetuating essentially social engineering at the  Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment that I am offering here would  prohibit funds from being available under this act for the Marine Corps  University Krulak Center's Reynolds Scholars program.   Now, I was unaware of this, relatively blissfully, I don't know, a  couple months ago, but then the Marine Corps University's Reynolds  Scholars Program at the Krulak Center is a year-long program for  students who wish to explore ``gender and security issues.'' That may  not have jumped up onto my radar screen, but I became aware because the  official Krulak Center Twitter account publicly criticized the user for  calling this program ``woke'' and calling this individual a stain on  the legacy of marines.   Well, it seems inappropriate for a federally funded center, so it  caught my attention. Then it became clear to me when I had a syllabus  presented to me about what was being presented. Here are a few examples  of the program themes listed in the official syllabus: ``Gendering  War.'' ``What is gender and how is it different from biological sex?''  ``How are war narratives constructed through gender discourse?'' ``How  can we imagine nonviolent masculinities and the role they might play in  conflict?''   We are pretty darn violent.   ``How might the United States Marine Corps strategic narrative be  problematic for women, peace and security?''   Again, this is just something that my constituents, and I think a  large block of the American electorate--dare I say a very sizable  majority--would say, what are you doing?   I mean, again, let's assume we were swimming in money. Let's just  assume that we had money coming out of our ears, that we had a $33  trillion surplus that we had banked up that we were just saving for a  rainy day to spend $33 trillion. I don't know how you do that, by the  way. Let's just assume that was the case. Let's assume we had a $2  trillion surplus this year instead of a $2 trillion deficit. Let's  assume further that our recruiting numbers were excellent. Let's assume  further that we had really strong morale. Let's assume further that our  healthcare costs in the military were manageable or that our healthcare  costs anywhere in this country at all were manageable in the post- Obamacare world in which prices have skyrocketed and insurance  companies have made gazillions of dollars. Again, that is another  speech for another day.   In that imaginary world where that were the state of things, would  this still be a good idea to spend even $1 or $10 or $100,000 or $5  million or whatever the amount is that might be here, would it be a  good idea to spend that money for this: ``How are war narratives  constructed through gendered discourse?'' ``How can we imagine  nonviolent masculinities and the role they might play in conflict?''   Again, the American people just want us to focus on making this  government do its core constitutional duty, do it within its fiscal  responsibilities; do it in terms of providing a mission to defend this  country; secure our borders, provide for the general welfare in the  sense that you are allowing the American people to do what they do best  if the government gets out of the way. Stop bleeding money, stop  racking up debt, defend the United States, stop social engineering, and  just do your damn job as Congress. I think that ought to be a pretty  simple goal and a bipartisan goal.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with the gentlewoman that words hurt. The  question is, how those words are deployed and what they do for the  mission of our United States military. When I see taxpayer dollars  going to fund a syllabus which was not something in public view, which  then became in public view after an online kind of disagreement with  things like, What is gender and how is it different from biological  sex? And all of the things that we are focusing on, and we have talked  about it in other contexts with funding transgender surgeries and  funding other manners of the social engineering currently going on that  I believe is ripping apart the fabric of our country, the strength of  our military, and the cohesion of the finest fighting force in the  world. I believe it is important for us to try to maintain that.   I am enormously proud of the women whom I have nominated for  academies. I met with women and men just 2 weeks ago with my staff in a  retreat where we went to the United States Naval Academy. I am  enormously proud of their service, proud of everybody who has worn the  uniform and been honorably discharged for their service, but we need to  stand up for a military that is focused on its mission.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment before us would prohibit any of the  funds in the Defense appropriations bill from being used to carry out  President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   Our military should be, as I have stated in these other amendments,  focused on deterring and, if necessary, defeating our adversaries.  President Biden wants to continue to sacrifice the strength of our  defense in deference to the climate cult.   In 2021, Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby refused to say  China was a bigger national security threat to the United States than  climate change. He called them ``equally important'' and said it  doesn't do anybody good to make a relative assessment of national  security issues.   Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said ``climate change is an  existential threat to our Nation's security.''   Secretary of State John Kerry literally travels to China to discuss  climate change, not China's increased aggression against Taiwan, not  its expansion in the Pacific, not the oppression of its people.   Biden's executive orders have served as the catalyst for massive  reforms in the Department of Defense that compromise and undermine  national security to advance a climate fetish.  [[Page H4625]]    The Department of Defense's Climate Adaptation Plan includes radical  proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the expense of our  warfighting capabilities. According to the plan, the Department of  Defense has identified climate change as a critical national security  issue. It contains mandates on ``environmental justice'' because why  miss an opportunity to push such an ideology.   The Department of Defense says it will transition to 100 percent  carbon-free electricity, meaning America's war machine will literally  depend on the wind and the Sun unless they are going to be moving, I  guess, nuclear power, which my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have not been all too quick to help us move.   Meanwhile, China has 1100 coal-fired plants and is building close to  2 a week. We have been building zero. We have been constraining the  development of natural gas-fired electricity, and we have only recently  finally had one nuclear plant get launched I think for the first time  since the mid-1970s.   The DOD has mandated that all nontactical vehicles be EVs by 2035. It  is fair to say the tactical vehicles we need to win wars are not far  behind. That means our defense will become wholly dependent on Chinese  batteries and other critical minerals. I always wonder why my  colleagues are not too bothered by the fact that 80 percent of these  batteries are using cobalt, and they are being mined heavily by slave  labor, often child labor.   There doesn't seem to be any concern about what that means by  continuing to perpetuate a mandate to send us down that road when it  won't dent CO2 production. It is living in a fantasy land.  If you eliminated the internal combustion engine in the United States  tomorrow you might dent all of worldwide CO2 production by  about 1 percent, 1\1/2\ percent. Meanwhile, China and India are pumping  it out in mass volumes. Yet we are going to inject this directly into  the veins of our national security.   That is why I offered this amendment and believe that it is  critically important, so that we can again have our military focused on  a core mission of defending this country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I note that recently China's military sent 103  warplanes toward Taiwan in a 24-hour period in what the island's  Defense Ministry called a recent new high. Forty of these planes  crossed the symbolic median line between mainland China and Taiwan.   There is a lot going on in the world. We are going to have debates  about Ukraine. I am hopeful we will have a debate about Ukraine rather  than just tacking on a continuing resolution and jamming it through to  the American people, but that is a debate for another day.   The question here is whether or not we are going to have, in the  gentlewoman's words, a strong military, a resilient military, and a  strong economy on the back of that or wrapped around that when, in  fact, what we are doing through the Inflation Reduction Act is spending  almost a trillion dollars, according to The Wall Street Journal, in  massive subsidies, 90 percent to billion-dollar corporations, heavily  to the most elite, rich, frankly, usually White liberals in this  country, driving around their EV-powered cars. We are subsidizing the  crud out of that while we are decimating the natural gas strength of  this country, which puts us in a much stronger position from a national  security perspective vis-a-vis Russia, vis-a-vis China, rather than  empowering China by saying, sure, let us please buy all of your solar  panels and all of your batteries so that we can transfer our military  to something that isn't even remotely ready to be transferred to.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for my colleague on the  other side of the aisle from Texas. On this matter we disagree.   The Secretary of Homeland Security has entirely abdicated his  responsibility to follow the laws of the United States. He has done so  purposely, he has done so with complete disregard to his constitutional  obligation to run the Department of Homeland Security, which by  definition means he is supposed to secure the homeland--having released  some 2 million people into the United States.   He has come before the House Judiciary Committee, and literally said,  yes, we have operational control of the border, while staring directly  at a statute defining operational control of the border under the  Secure Fence Act. He later went back to the committee and said, no, no,  no, that is not the definition I was talking about. He knew full well  what he was doing.   He is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people  that he is somehow following the laws. That he is somehow following  asylum laws and parole laws when he is using parole--which is supposed  on a case-by-case basis--to literally dump hundreds of thousands of  people into the United States.   Americans are dying. Kids are dying from fentanyl poisoning. The very  migrants that my colleagues say this is supposed to be helpful for are  dying in the Rio Grande or dying on south Texas ranches or getting sold  into the sex trafficking trade, or dying, or getting abused in stash  houses.    This is a blatant disregard of his duty. He should be removed from  office. We sure as hell shouldn't be funding his salary. The Holman  rule exists for us to exercise our Article I authority over an abusive  Article II executive.   It is time for Congress to reassert its authority, to reclaim  control, to use the power of the purse to stop the abusive authority by  this Secretary to endanger the American people, to endanger migrants,  and to undermine our Homeland Security.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendment I put forward prohibits funding  in this act to President Biden's executive orders that put needless  limits on immigration enforcement, scale back sound asylum policies,  and establish its own set of immigration directives that Congress has  not passed.   The executive orders that President Biden put in place as soon as he  got into the White House have had an enormous negative impact on the  ability of Border Patrol and ICE to carry out their job--in particular,  ICE.   The results are pretty clear. Deportations of criminal aliens  plummeted by 62 percent between fiscal year 2020 under President Trump  and fiscal year 2021 under President Biden. It went from 150,000,  103,000, all the way to 38,000 under Biden.   The fact of the matter is this is not shocking. When you issue  executive orders that place restrictions on the ability of ICE to do  its job, shockingly, it can't do its job.   Congress, Article I in the Constitution, has not only the power but  the duty to tell Article II in the Constitution: Hey, you don't get to  use the funds that we are appropriating to not do your job.   This amendment would simply say to the President of the United States  and the Secretary that we have this crazy idea that maybe, just maybe,  the President should follow the law instead of issuing executive orders  to undermine the ability of law enforcement personnel to do their job,  leaving the American people exposed to dangers, fentanyl pouring into  our communities, and criminal aliens being able to carry out crimes on  the streets of the country.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my friend from Texas, and I will  certainly review the amendment. I am not going to withdraw it.   I want to review the amendment and see if the reference is somehow  incorrect, but the intent of the amendment--and it is now, I am being  told, a leg counsel drafting error on the number, so it is probably the  number that my friend is referring to.   The purpose of it is very clear, which is to turn away the executive  orders of the President of the United States that have been undermining  our security.   The gentleman, I think, properly referenced the number. I think on  that one, given that there is a drafting error, and I have three other  amendments that accomplish the same thing, I am actually going to  withdraw the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time and withdraw the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendment that we have in front of us  prohibits funding from the act to be used to terminate the Migrant  Protection Protocols. This is one of the most important things that we  need to address.   H.R. 2, which this body, led by Republicans, passed in the spring,  addresses the need to return to use of Migrant Protection Protocols to  put in place the return to Mexico and remain in Mexico policies of the  previous administration, which, when combined with the use of title 42  authority, were effective in eliminating the flow coming across our  border.   When the current administration completely abandoned on day one the  use of Migrant Protection Protocols, the reality is we have seen the  resulting chaos at our border.   It is hard for anybody who is objectively looking at the state of our  border to find any defense for the current  [[Page H4710]]  policies of the administration allowing the abject failure to occur.   This amendment would assert our Article I authority to say to the  President that the President must not use funds to terminate the  Migrant Protection Protocols--that is, we should not be funding the  failure of this administration to do its job.   Very simply put, as we put forward in H.R. 2, the choices before us  should be to detain, to put in expedited removal, or to put in a  migrant protection protocol-type system, remaining in Mexico.  Otherwise, you have what we have, which is an utter disregard for the  border using parole authority wrongly--instead of on a case-by-case  basis, mass releases under parole.   We have the use of asylum, not for persecution but rather as a  blanket release into the United States, to the point of 2 million  releases over the last 2\1/2\ years under this administration.                                time  0030    This is a very simple policy that we can adopt as a Congress to  restrain the abuse of this administration.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, the termination of this program resulted in a  decrease by 64 percent for illegal alien apprehensions between ports of  entries or found inadmissible at ports of entry.   Border encounters with Central American families--the main driver of  the crisis for the better part of the first 2 years, comprised the  majority of the MPP-amenable aliens--dropped by 80 percent.   A report found MPP to be ``an indispensable tool in addressing the  ongoing crisis at the southern border and restoring integrity to the  immigration system.''   The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we are not continuing  to fund the ending of the kinds of programs that could be successful-- that is the point. We are putting restrictions on the extent to which  the administration can ignore the tools that it should be using.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendment before us is pretty simple. It  prohibits funding from this Act to carry out the Department of Homeland  Security's memo titled ``Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or Near  Protected Areas.''   The Biden administration issued a memo prohibiting ICE from arresting  illegal migrants in most public places. If you look at a map, there are  literally circles drawn that pretty much cover an entire geographic  region. Effectively, they are making it impossible for ICE to do its  job.   It is purposeful, and this amendment is pretty simple: Don't use  money to do this stupid thing.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment prohibits--as I have done in a  number of our other appropriations bills, successfully so far. This  amendment prohibits any of the funding in the Homeland Security  appropriations bill from being used to carry out President Biden's  executive orders on climate change.   These executive orders are pursuing a climate fetish to the detriment  of our ability to have national security and energy security. It is  driving up the prices of energy and making us more  [[Page H4711]]  dependent on China and foreign sources of energy. It is making lives  more difficult for the American people.   Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security, has literally  said, the climate crisis is the most prominent threat we face.  Meanwhile, we have had 6 million migrant encounters, 2 million releases  in our country, and 70-some-thousand Americans die from fentanyl  poisoning. There are little girls and migrants getting abused in the  sex trafficking trade and getting distributed through the United  States. That is what the Secretary focuses on. It is absurd. This is  pretty simple: Stop doing that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the brevity of my colleague, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
