 Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the John  Lewis Voting Rights Act.   Today across the Nation, States are eliminating same-day voter  registration, reducing voting times, and limiting the availability of  polling places. These changes essentially make it harder for our  friends and neighbors to vote.   This bill is a simple bill. It ensures that all legally cast ballots  are counted. It ensures that the voices of Americans are louder than  those of special interests.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the John Lewis Voting Rights  Act.
