 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past week and a half, Speaker  [[Page S5231]]  Pelosi and I have been engaged in serious discussions and negotiations  with the White House over another round of emergency relief for the  American people. Our motivation is simple: Americans are crying out for  relief.   Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to climb. The snowball  of economic impacts continue to roll downhill. This morning, we learned  that another 1.2 million Americans filed for unemployment--far more  than at any time during the great recession that began in 2008.   Our two parties don't agree on many things. That is no secret. The  Trump administration has bungled this crisis from the very beginning  and even now is careening from one self-inflicted crisis to the next.  Democrats believe that Congress has a moral obligation to step into the  breach to help Americans put food on the table and keep a roof over  their heads, to save our economy from a deeper recession and longer  recovery, and to fight this disease with all the resources and  wherewithal a great nation can bring to bear.   After the Senate Republican majority failed in spectacular fashion to  put together a bill even its own Members could support, Democrats have  engaged in arduous negotiations with the White House trying to impress  upon them the gravity of the situation. We have made some progress this  week but not enough. The biggest reason is that Trump and his aides and  his party in Congress are not truly awake to what is happening in this  country.   The Trump administration and Senate Republicans have badly mauled the  body politic, the American economy, and American healthcare. We  Democrats believe the patient needs a major operation, while  Republicans want to apply a bandaid. And we will not let them just pass  the bandaid, go home, and still leave America bleeding. That is the  difference right now on so many issues.   Our Republican counterparts refuse to acknowledge that Americans who  have lost their jobs through no fault of their own might need some  assistance with rent. The Republican leader warns of an epidemic of  lawsuits that hasn't materialized. What will materialize soon is an  epidemic of evictions unless we extend the moratorium and pass rental  assistance. Between 19 and 23 million households--one in five rental  households--will be at risk of eviction by the end of September unless  we do something, unless our Republican colleagues wake up.   Our Republican counterparts refuse to acknowledge that State, local,  and Tribal governments, which the Trump administration abandoned in the  early days of this crisis, might need Federal support to prevent  teachers, firefighters, busdrivers from being laid off and public  services from being slashed at the worst possible time. Leader  McConnell just states that States should go bankrupt. That is not  acceptable.   Our Republican counterparts refuse to acknowledge that running an  election in the middle of a pandemic is going to be difficult; that  State election systems are going to need more resources; and our post  office must be well-staffed and prepared to manage an election that  will see more voting by mail than any before.   Yesterday, the Republican leader scoffed at the idea of extended  enhanced unemployment benefits because it would mean that some  Americans without work would be paid more than our essential workers.  Conveniently, the Republican leader did not mention that Democrats have  proposed for months that we give our essential workers additional  hazard pay and that he and his party continue to block it.   If our friends on the other side are finally worried about how little  many of our essential workers are making as we are, I would hope they  will put their money where their mouth is and support our proposal to  give them hazard pay.   When it comes to elections and education, food assistance for hungry  children, and, mind-bogglingly, when it comes to healthcare, testing,  tracing, and Medicaid, our Republican friends continue to pinch pennies  during a national emergency.   Again, this is the reason our negotiations with the White House have  been so difficult. The President and his aides and his party in  Congress are not even awake to the crisis in our country. President  Trump doesn't have a plan, doesn't engage in negotiations, and still  manages to undercut the negotiations at every turn.   There is no leadership from the White House at a time of great  crisis. Historians will look back and say this is one of the greatest  crises America has felt, and the White House is nowhere to be found. It  has never happened before.   Way back in March, after we passed the CARES Act, the Senate  Republican majority made a dangerous gamble. Leader McConnell said he  was putting the Senate on ``pause'' to see what would happen. Senate  Republicans swallowed the President's ridiculous fantasy that the  disease would just disappear. Hoping they wouldn't have to do anything,  the Republican majority put the Senate on ice for 4 long months--4  months. Only yesterday, Leader McConnell admitted that his delay  ``allowed us to learn the coronavirus didn't mysteriously disappear.''   Look, at this late stage, after months of Republican delay, as the  country got worse and worse, after Republicans in the Senate failed to  generate a proposal that even their own caucus or President could  support, Democrats are now in the room--we are the ones in the room  trying to negotiate a bill that will meet the country's needs.   While some of my friends on the other side of the aisle are just  looking for an outcome, any outcome, so they can vote on something and  go home, we are not going to agree to an inadequate bill that doesn't  address the challenges in our country.   We are not going to give up. We are going to keep fighting until we  achieve the caliber of legislation the American people, during this  time of great crisis, need and deserve. We are going to keep working  until we get it done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4496         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bryce Raynor Act of 2020''.  [[Page S5285]]            SEC. 2.
