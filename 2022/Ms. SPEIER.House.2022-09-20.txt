 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material during this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to hold this Special  Order on a very important issue. It is an issue about abortion access  in the military. I thank my colleagues for joining me and elevating  their voices on the experience of our troops who are terrified that  they will be stationed in a State where they cannot control their  bodies.   The Supreme Court decision in Dobbs overturned 50 years of precedent  recognizing the constitutional right to abortion. The Court stated that  their opinion merely returned the issue of abortion rights to the  States, and that women can vote for whom they wish to represent their  values.   But servicemembers don't have that right. They don't get to choose  where they live. This leaves 230,000 servicewomen who could be ordered  to a State that forces them to stay pregnant, even under circumstances  where they have been raped, because that is what some of the States in  this grand Union have decided is the law of the land in their State.   Let me tell you that this is going to have profound impacts on the  issues that really are of great concern to us who oversee the military  right now. Recruitment is down. Retention is a problem, and readiness  is a problem. That is only going to be exacerbated by having a  situation where these servicewomen who become pregnant are going to  have to travel long distances to get an abortion.   Access to abortion has long been a struggle for women in the  military, especially those overseas and our junior  [[Page H8004]]  enlisted with lower incomes. The Dobbs decision has just made matters  worse.   This map right here shows all the States in red that have basically  prohibited abortions, for all intents and purposes.   Now, one in four women will have an abortion some time during their  reproductive years. We now look at the fact that women in the military  have a 22 percent higher incidence of unintended pregnancies than women  who are in the civilian world.   So now let's look at this. There are actually 128 military  installations in these red States. Of those 128 installations that will  prohibit abortion, 80,000 servicewomen are on bases in those States.  The vast majority of those women are of childbearing age.   Now, the Rand study that was recently commissioned estimated that  there are 4,000 servicewomen every year that are getting abortions.  Now, of those 4,000 women who will get abortions, 40 percent of them  are in States that have severely restricted or no access to abortion.   Now, look at this. You have a situation, where you are in Louisiana  or Mississippi, look how far you are going to have to travel, how many  States you are going to have to travel through to get to a blue State  where you could access an abortion.   Privates in the military make about $2,000 a month. Most of the  abortions will happen to young servicemembers. A typical cost, not  including travel, to get the medication abortion is $568. To have a  first-trimester, procedural abortion it is $625. And a second-trimester  abortion is $775.   For a servicemember who must travel for an abortion, for example,  from the State of Texas to Kansas, let's say, with a two-night stay in  a hotel, the expected cost is $1,100 or more. That is almost half of  the monthly salary for a typical junior enlisted servicemember.   In July, we had the very first hearing ever in the House Armed  Services Committee on abortion access. Two courageous Active-Duty women  who have served in the military, each for over 20 years. So, they have  excelled, they are officers in the military, or noncommissioned  officers in the military, and they have been so good that they have  been retained in the military and promoted.   Let me tell you their stories. Theresa spoke of how her abortion as a  junior enlisted servicemember enabled her 20-year career in the Air  Force. She used her entire paycheck to cover the cost of the abortion,  and her next paycheck to reimburse her friend for the gas money for  driving her to the facility.   Another servicemember, whose name is Sharon, spoke of getting an  abortion because she wasn't ready to have another child.   Let's remember that 59 percent of the women who get abortions in this  country are already mothers. I was one of them.   She and her partner were going to drive to Georgia, but then they  learned it had a mandatory waiting-period law. So then they ended up  traveling all the way to New York City; and she credits that abortion  for her 24 years of Active Duty in the military.   Now, I have more to say, but I am going to yield now to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), my great colleague, who is  one of the co-chairs of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her powerful  comments.   On top of everything else, we passed one law which was the Hyde  amendment, that said you can't use Federal funds for medical abortions,  so Medicaid was not made available for that purpose. But many States  have decided to cover it anyway.   But that wasn't enough for the Congresses some years ago. They  decided that we would ban any abortion at a military treatment facility  except for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.   So that means a servicemember can't go to the military treatment  facility on their base, get the abortion, and pay for it themselves. We  make them jump through hoop after hoop after hoop. And then, we ask  ourselves, why do we have a recruitment problem? I think it is pretty  obvious.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan), my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, and on  the Military Personnel Subcommittee, and a former servicemember, to  comment on this issue as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her service  then and for her service now. Her comments about young servicewomen  just out of high school or college, who find themselves pregnant and  seek an abortion, reminds me of a story that I heard at a base here in  the United States of a young, single mother, servicewoman, who was  struggling to take care of her young daughter in part because the  childcare--she was lucky enough to have childcare at that particular  base. Many of our bases are impacted with long waiting lists. But she  actually had a slot. But the childcare center didn't open until 6  o'clock, and she had to be at physical training and exercises at 5:30,  so she was always juggling that situation.   Imagine if you are not even prepared to have a child and you are  forced to give birth to that child and have to cope with all of those  additional issues as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Jacobs), another colleague on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, a  fellow Californian, and a great member of our freshman class.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  outstanding comments and for her great leadership that she has already  demonstrated.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Moulton), a great American leader who has served his country a number  of ways, in a number of situations, certainly in the military and now  as a Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those  outstanding comments. He is another Member who has shown incredible  leadership on the House Committee on Armed Services.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), my  good friend and colleague on the House Committee on Armed Services, who  again has shown leadership in the military and service in Congress as  well, and the author of the recently minted bill to provide greater  protections for servicewomen.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for really powerful  remarks. This issue doesn't have to be that hard, but because of  legislation that has been passed previously, it has made it incredibly  difficult.   I am going to share with you now the stories of healthcare  professionals who have provided care to these military servicewomen.  You have heard from my colleagues about some of the servicemembers'  stories. I am now going to tell you about two abortion providers, one  who is Active Duty and the other one who is a civilian provider but who  spends the majority of her career close to military installations and  provides services to our servicewomen.   The Active-Duty provider, Dr. Lamme, had to tell a young woman that  her child would not live more than a few minutes following birth due to  fetal abnormalities, yet there was nothing she could do but hope that  the young woman could afford the care she wanted and deserved off base.  She could not even provide her abortion counseling. She had to kind of  hint about it.   This particular patient had to hold a fundraiser. Now, think about  this. This is a servicewoman who has sworn to put her life on the line  for her country. She is in a foreign destination, and she is holding a  fundraiser to raise the funds to fly back to the United States to get  her abortion.   Just imagine having to ask your friends and family for that money  because the military you have dedicated your life to has failed you.  She should have been able to get that abortion at a military treatment  facility. Until we can lift the Hyde amendment--yes, make her pay for  it, but don't make her have to develop a GoFundMe page to get the  resources to fly to a destination that actually covers abortions.   Another provider, the civilian provider, Dr. Moayedi, shared her  experience of literally watching her patient count quarters--quarters-- to pay for her abortion. Her patient opted to go without sedation to  terminate a pregnancy because she couldn't afford any more out-of- pocket costs.   There is nothing humane, nothing respectful, about treating  servicewomen like this.   If it is the intention of the military to force women out of the  military, to create an all-male force, then maybe this is the way to  go. Maybe this is what they had in mind.   But, we do know that we need women in the force. We know that there  is a small percentage of men and women who are eligible to serve in the  military because of their abilities or lack thereof. It is a small  percentage to begin with, and a smaller percentage yet who choose to  serve.    Twenty percent of the military now is made up of female  servicemembers. We only see that number growing in order to have a  ready service to be able to go to war when necessary. But now we are  doing things that are discouraging women to even contemplate becoming a  member of the service.   Under current law, the DOD is prohibited from providing or paying for  abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother's  life. These exceptions are so very narrow and interpreted so narrowly  that the DOD has confirmed to me that the number of abortions that have  been done at military treatment facilities in a year is between 11 and  21.   Now, the RAND study purports that there are probably 4,000 women in  service in this country in the various services that get an abortion  every year. Only 11 to 21 of them are done at military treatment  facilities. That means 3,980 women in the service have to pay for and  also go elsewhere to seek that service. They have to pay out of pocket  not only for the care they need but also for other expenses, including  lodging, gas, airfare, and childcare.   The Dobbs decision will no doubt exacerbate these challenges, forcing  servicemembers to travel greater distances and shoulder greater  financial burdens--that is, if they are granted leave in the first  place.   Imagine you are assaulted. You want to go get an abortion. You are in  the State of Texas, and you have to go to your commander and seek  leave. By the way, if you seek leave and you were raped and have, I  guess, a police report, they might let you have that leave without  having you being docked for it.   But if you are not one of those women who has been raped or the  victim of incest, but did, in fact, get pregnant and want to terminate,  you have to go to your commander in Texas. Right now, you have to  divulge the service you are asking for, and you are going to get docked  in leave, as well.   It is inhumane to force women to remain pregnant against their will.  It is just fundamental to freedom to be able to have control over your  own body. It is arrogant to think that we know better than a woman and  her doctor about what is best for her body. It is wrong to create  government-mandated pregnancies, and it is wrong for the military to  require its servicewomen to jump through so many hoops and spend so  much money out of pocket because we have some antiquated law on the  books that says you can't get an abortion at an MTF, a military  treatment facility.   Access to abortion care is essential to women's health and central to  their economic and social well-being. The ability to access abortion  should not depend on how much money you have, where you live, or where  you are stationed.   That is why I, along with my colleagues, have introduced the MARCH  for Servicemembers Act, to enable DOD to provide abortion care once and  for all.   At the very least, servicewomen should be able to access abortion  care within MTFs and pay out of pocket just like they can for other  procedures. The military does not cover IVF, but they will perform IVF  at a military facility, and you will just pay for the residual cost.   I am proud to co-lead the Access to Reproductive Care for  Servicemembers Act that the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), my good  friend, just referenced. It would require DOD to pay any travel  expenses associated with an abortion and ensure servicemembers are able  to take leave for their care.   There is a part of me that says we have 128 bases and installations  in these red States, in these States that ban abortion. Maybe we should  just move these bases. Now, that is highly unlikely because we have  invested so much, but it just begs the question about what we are  really all about if we are going to treat these servicewomen so poorly.   My office has been inundated with outreach from former and current  servicemembers who are anxious and despondent about being stationed in  what they are referring to as ``forced pregnancy States.''   One Army psychiatrist said to me, ``Even I and some of my female  physician peers in the military, with the relative privilege of being  officers and physicians, fear someday receiving orders to a State which  has banned abortion. Because of the increased maternal mortality in  areas without safe and legal abortion, I would not feel safe attempting  to become pregnant in such a State.''   Let me repeat that. This is a medical professional in the military  who says: ``I would not feel safe attempting to become pregnant in such  a State.''                                time  1645    Again, at a time when the military is struggling with recruitment and  retention, these bans make things worse.   We must act now to provide the right resources at the right time and  the right place so that servicemembers and their families who have no  choice about where they live continue to have access to the full  reproductive care they need, want, and deserve.   These men and women who serve are our greatest patriots. Are we  really going to treat them as second-class citizens? These members of  the military defend our freedoms, and we are going to defend them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
