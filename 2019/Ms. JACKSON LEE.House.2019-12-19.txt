 Mr. Speaker, we have much to be thankful for in this  great and grand Nation.   We are thankful for our Constitution that allows us to define what is  right and wrong.   I am thankful for all of the Americans who will be with their  families, all of those who are documented and undocumented individuals  in this country who have come for relief and refuge.   I am thankful for the Members of Congress who uphold this  Constitution.   And I am also thankful for the opportunity to salute Bryan Stevenson,  who has just turned his book, ``Just Mercy,'' into a movie.   I look forward to working to reform the juvenile justice system, to  adding my bills banning the box, banning solitary confinement, and  alternative sentencing for our children.   Our children should be receiving restorative justice; and like Bryan  Stevenson, I believe there is a future if we invest in the future of  our young people.   So I intend to introduce, when we come back from this time in our  districts, an omnibus, large juvenile justice reform bill that takes  into consideration our teachers, our law enforcement, our social  workers, our young people, our faith community, and Bryan Stevenson's  advanced and innovative concept that delivers just mercy.   Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy Kwanza to everyone in the  United States of America for this wonderful holiday season.                            ____________________
