 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the special day  that today is. It is the National Day of Civility,  #nationaldayofcivility.   I wanted to recognize this day because last year, as a freshman  Member,  [[Page H6164]]  even before we were sworn in, my freshman colleagues and I were stuck  in Williamsburg in a snowstorm. When we were stuck together, we decided  to come up with a new course for our class and a new initiative called  the Commitment to Civility--thanks to my colleagues,  Mike Johnson  especially, for this brainchild.   From that day forward, we all agreed, and all of us except, I think,  I believe three Members on the Democratic side, signed this with the  hope of us finding a different course, finding some more civility and  some more work across the aisle.   To this day, I have tried to live up to that commitment. Every bill  that I have introduced that is originally sponsored, I have done with  the bipartisan support of my Democratic colleagues. We have endeavored  to work together on a number of initiatives, whether it is soliciting  advice from other committees or the President or any kind of letter to  the agencies that we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say thank you to all my colleagues who  signed this and who continue to live up to our commitment to civility.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in encouraging that H.  Res. 400, Creating a National Day of Civility, be recognized.                            ____________________
