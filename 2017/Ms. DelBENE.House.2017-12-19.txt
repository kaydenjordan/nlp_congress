 Mr. Speaker, in this tax bill, Republicans have gifted  the wealthiest corporations and individuals with massive new tax cuts  and loopholes to take advantage of. But when I go home to my district,  there isn't a mother working two jobs to put food on the table or a  farmer struggling through a bad year or a senior trying to pay for a  prescription who has ever told me that tax reform means corporate cuts  on the backs of them and their families.                                time  1315    They know Republicans always promise that the benefits will trickle  down to working people, but they never do and they never will. What is  worse, Republicans have made it clear that cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid are next.   This bill takes care of corporate special interests, the wealthy, and  the well connected, while putting middle class Americans' finances and  healthcare on the chopping block.   We need tax reform that helps middle class families. This bill does  the exact opposite. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
