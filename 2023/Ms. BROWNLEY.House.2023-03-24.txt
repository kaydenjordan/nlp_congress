 Mr. Speaker, the number one cause of death for children  in America is gun violence. Yet, instead of making our schools safer  and creating environments for children to thrive, House Republicans are  focusing their attention on harmful political rhetoric.   Today's passage of H.R. 5 politicizes classrooms and facilitates the  censorship of American stories, American experiences, and factual  American history.   To unreasonably limit the scope of our children's knowledge and to  dilute their critical thinking abilities is an immense disservice to  America's children and to our country's future.   Instead of solving real problems, House Republicans are simply trying  to distract the American people with divisive political stunts and  empty culture wars.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with  House Democrats to pass legislation that will actually help America's  children, not exploit them to further divide Americans for political  gain.                            ____________________
