Mark       Lippert        June 26, 2018--FMC/Envision: Former Members meet with       Middle School Students visiting D.C. on the House Floor     Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thanks again to all of you  for joining us this wonderful morning.   As I prepared for today's report, it has brought back many happy  memories, as I am sure it does for you, too. I served in Congress 24  years.   One image I keep honing in on is the image you currently have as you  are looking at me: the quote by Daniel Webster inscribed directly  behind the Speaker's chair: ``Let us develop the resources of our land,  call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its  greatest interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation,  may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''   For all of us, service in this remarkable building was the pinnacle  of our  [[Page H5659]]  professional lives, and I know that for each and every one of us, there  is a memory of something ``worthy to be remembered.'' Whether it was a  groundbreaking piece of legislation or simply a constituent and how we  changed their life by helping them, by serving in Congress, we were  given the opportunity to serve our country and its citizens.   I am very proud that, through the former Members of Congress, we can  continue, in a small but yet larger measure, the public service that  brought us to Congress in the first place. It is, therefore, a great  honor in my capacity as president to report on the former Members of  Congress' activities for 2017 and 2018.   We are a very small group of nonprofits that have a congressional  charter, and as such, we are required to report to Congress every year  on our past activities. I will give a broad review of our past work and  will submit for the Record a more detailed written report.   Our association was founded in 1970 and chartered by Congress 13  years later, in 1983. We are completely bipartisan and see our mission  as informing about Congress and bridging the political divide. That  mission has translated into programs that bring former Members together  with student audiences across this country, focussing on civics and  public service. We also further our mission by creating programs and  study missions involving current Members of Congress on a bipartisan  basis.   This work over the years has been extended to now also include  congressional staff, both from the D.C. offices as well as the district  directors across the Nation. We are successful because Republicans and  Democrats, whether former Members or current Members, come together in  a bipartisan way with a willingness to work together for the common  good.   We are proud to have been chartered by Congress, and we are equally  proud that absolutely no taxpayer dollar is earmarked or expended to  make our programs possible. Everything FMC does is financed through  grants and sponsorship, our membership dues, and, of course, our annual  fundraising gala, the Statesmanship Awards Dinner.   Our colleague Martin Frost, sitting behind me in the Speaker's chair,  led our fundraising efforts for the most recent gala dinner at the  Mellon Auditorium, and I am extremely pleased to report that, thanks to  Martin's leadership and the incredible efforts of a great many former  Members, we had our most successful fundraising dinner by far last  March. We surpassed our previous year's record by $200,000.   So, thank you, Martin, for being the captain of our fundraising  effort.   My colleagues, thanks to his success as well as our 4-year  fundraising efforts, I can report to Congress and the FMC membership  that our finances are very sound, our projects are fully funded, and  our most recent annual audit by our outside accountant confirmed we are  running FMC in a fiscally sound, responsible, and transparent manner.   And let me stress again that no taxpayer dollars are earmarked for  our work, and everything that we do is self-funded.   Let me stress, also, that none of our programs involve any kind of  honorarium or fee paid to former Members for their participation. We  are successful because former Representatives and Senators come  together, across party lines, for the good of our organization, and  they do so in a pro bono basis. They believe in our mission, and they  continue to have the public servant's heart.   Former Members of Congress, in 2017, donated to FMC over 7,000 hours  of energy, wisdom, mentoring, and expertise without receiving any  compensation for it. Their only remuneration is the knowledge that they  are giving back, that serving in Congress was a unique privilege, and  that it comes with the mandate to encourage and empower the next  generation.   So on behalf of FMC, I want to thank all of our colleagues who have  contributed their time and expertise to make FMC such a great success.  Thank you very much.   We are extremely proud of our nearly 50-year history creating lasting  and impactful programs that teach about Congress and representative  government at home and abroad.   Let me now give you a brief overview of 2017 and also a vision of  2018 and beyond.   In 2017 and 2018, FMC staff has conceived, organized, advertised, and  implemented an astonishing 85 events to move our mission forward. These  ranged from meeting with middle school students right here in the House  Chamber to talk to them about the many responsibilities of Members of  Congress, to week-long study missions where current Member delegations,  split evenly between the parties, traveled to countries including  Germany, Japan, and Korea, to study issues on trade and security.   Our programming has included hundreds of current Members, former  Members, senior congressional staff, and district directors. They work  with us because they know we are completely bipartisan, 100 percent  nonadvocacy, and we seek to tell the positive story of our  extraordinary representative democracy. Allow me to share with you some  highlights of our work.   You will hear more details about our congressional study groups in a  second, but for 2017, we are proudest of the creation of our newest  study group: the Congressional Study Group on Korea. It shows how  timely and right-from-the-headlines our work is.   The Korea program was conceived in 2017 and supported by a number of  Capitol Hill events to gauge its relevancy. Then, in February of this  year, we felt the time was right to officially launch this newest study  group. We have already sent to Korea a codel under the study group's  umbrella.   The Korea program now joins our other longstanding international  projects: the Congressional Study Group on Germany, the Congressional  Study Group on Japan, and the Congressional Study Group on Europe.   In addition to numerous Capitol Hill events, over the past 12 months,  we have sent seven congressional delegations overseas, some for current  Members, others for chiefs of staff, and a number for just the district  directors--and, of course, all bipartisan.   The purpose of these trips is to educate our participants on specific  issues affecting U.S. international relations, mostly trade and  security questions. An important side effect is the possibility of  building across-the-aisle relationships to create a network of peers  that transcends party labels and partisanship. All of these trips, of  course, go through the rigorous process of the ethics review, and we  ensure 100 percent compliance with all regulations governing travel by  Members or staff.   These international projects are just one component of our work to  create bipartisan relationships and to strengthen our representative  democracy. Domestically, the main focus of our work is connecting  citizens with their government, highlighting the responsibilities of  citizenship, and dispelling many of the myths that are out there when  it comes to the United States Congress.   First and foremost, we are incredibly proud of our Congress to Campus  Program. Now, for over 30 years, we have sent a bipartisan team of  former Members to meet with university students across this country.  These are not simple meet-and-greet events where the Members drop in  for a quick speech with some questions and answers. Instead, these  visits are a 3-day commitment by our former Members team so that the  university can make the best possible use of FMC as a resource. We now  average about 30 visits during the academic year, which is incredible,  given that as recently as 15 years ago, we averaged only 5.   As I have said during previous meetings, the Congress to Campus  Program was near extinct until our colleague David Skaggs gave it some  much, much-needed leadership.   We work hand in glove with each university so that each visit is  tailored specifically to the school's needs and curriculum. Our  colleagues walk into different classroom settings throughout the day,  sometimes engaging in discussions about U.S. foreign policy, at other  times focussing on questions such as money in politics.   The outcome of each Congress to Campus visit is twofold: one, to  showcase a partisan, yet respectful debate on the issues of day; and to  encourage the next generation a respect for public service that may  translate into future work on Capitol Hill.  [[Page H5660]]    We have reached thousands upon thousands of students through our own  polling, and our own polling can demonstrate that we are making a  positive difference when it comes to attitudes about Congress and our  elected officials. You will hear more about this and our other civic  education activities and initiatives when I yield to our colleague  George Nethercutt in just a short while.   Our work to reconnect citizens with their government takes many  different forms. For example, we have a longstanding partnership with  the National Archives, bringing former Members of Congress and other  issue experts together with the public for a conversation about issues  that affect all of us.    For example, just last week, we hosted a conversation about citizen  engagement, where a panel included Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton  speaking about her engagement in the civil rights movement, as well as  Sarah Lerner and Rain Valladares from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School in Parkland, Florida. Former Members Jane Harman and Tim Petri  were joined by Congressman Ted Deutch to give their insights how  grassroots movements affect those serving all of us in Congress.   What I have described so far is just a small part of the work we have  done on our membership's behalf. And while programs such as Congress to  Campus or the Congressional Study Group on Germany are longstanding  undertakings that we have offered to the public for decades, they,  along with our other existing projects, all were infused with a new  energy, a new vision and enthusiasm, thanks to the extensive strategic  planning process I briefed you on last year.   Let me thank Mark Sobol, a highly respected expert in the field of  strategic planning and organization management, who donated to us  completely free of charge his tremendous expertise to help us achieve  the next level in professionalism and impact. He helped us craft an  extremely thoughtful and visionary strategic plan, which the FMC board  approved a little over a year ago. Since then, the effect of this  incredibly important exercise can be felt in all aspects of our  organization today.   We, our board of directors, and the exceptional FMC staff have made  great strides in implementing this plan, for example, when it comes to  branding FMC as a unique authority on Congress, unparalleled in our  experience and expertise. We now have a much more focused media  strategy. We have unified our current Member programming with our  former Member programming under one logo and one recognizable brand and  are much better at pushing out our message of bipartisanship using  social media, for example.   I am also more than pleased to report to you that a brand new website  showcasing our new logo and new look will go live on July Fourth. This  has been a major focus of mine during my 2 years as FMC's president,  and I am simply gratified and thrilled that through a lot of hard work  it is coming to fruition with the new website, which will reflect much  more accurately the vibrant and impactful organization that we have  become.   I am very excited about the future of this organization, obviously.  My 2 years as president have been incredibly rewarding, and I look  forward to supporting my good friend Martin Frost as his term of  presidency begins.   Our bylaws add the immediate past president to the executive  committee, so that there is a continuity from one president to the  next. So it will be great fun to transition into that role, plus it  will free up my calendar a little bit. As Martin will soon discover,  being FMC President is akin to a second full-time job.   As I look at FMC's future, some very exciting initiatives stand out.  We have begun finding ways to take FMC out of the D.C. bubble in an  effort to serve a larger constituency and also to have more impact with  parts of the country that may feel disconnected from this  representative government.   In the future, we will increase this effort by working much more  closely with former Members all over the country. This will involve  regional meetings such as the ones we hosted last year in Boston and  Chicago, and this year in Orlando and New York.   In addition, we include in these regional activities the greater  congressional family, which means that when we gather former Members in  one part of the country, we will strive to include the district  directors of the local Representatives or Senators, as well as local  NGO's focused on our government, and local civic organizations.   We expand our regional footprint by translating Congress to Campus to  other audiences, including high school and middle school kids, as well  as corporate headquarters or international organizations.   For 2018 and beyond, we will build up our newest domestic program,  the American Democracy in Civics Initiative. We are deeply concerned  about the state of civic education in this country, and we strongly  believe that FMC needs to take a leadership role in bringing civic  education to the next generation of America's leaders.   This initiative will serve as the umbrella under which existing  programs, such as Congress to Campus or our National Archives panels,  will be joined by new projects, for example, The Legacy Program, which  will interview retiring Members of Congress to create an oral history  of all those who have served in the House and the Senate.   Just adding up the years of experience of these current Members who  have announced their retirement or have lost their primaries leading up  to the 2018 midterms, we are faced with over 1,000 years of combined  institutional knowledge walking out the door. FMC sees it as a major  responsibility to future generations that this knowledge is recorded  and properly archived.   We will also increase our use of modern technology to better  communicate our message and to find ways to engage the next generation  that clearly has a very different understanding of where they get their  information and how they communicate with each other. To do so, we will  initiate a podcast series in 2019 where former Members can speak on a  specific issue of the day, but also share some of their very unique  insights when it comes to just simply serving in Congress.   In addition, through webcasting, we will reach out to the vast  audience of college students we have engaged via our Congress to Campus  Program so that a visit by our bipartisan team has continued effect.   So as you can see, my colleagues, the future for FMC is incredibly  bright. We are energized, and we are having tremendous success for  three reasons. One I have already mentioned, which is the outstanding  work our board and staff has done with Mark Sobol to solidify our  mission, spell out our achievable goals, and strategize on how to best  move FMC forward.   The second reason is our amazing group of partners. These are the  corporations that donate to us, especially via the Statesmanship Awards  Dinner, because they believe in our purpose and recognize the positive  impact we are having. These partners also include outstanding grant- giving entities: the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, the German Marshall  Fund, the Hewlett Foundation's Madison Initiative, the Democracy Fund,  the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission, the Korea Foundation, and the  Korea Society, just to name a few. They believe in our capabilities and  are giving us the opportunity to grow and long-lasting programming.  Obviously, we appreciate their support very much.   The third and most important reason is you, my fellow Members,  Members of Congress, former Members, who donated to us your time, your  expertise, your wisdom, and your leadership, and as I mentioned  earlier, over 7,000 hours of combined former Members' time donated pro  bono by our membership. I thank all of you for that.   I have to warn you, our demand on your time and good will is only  increasing. As we all know, there are many challenges our Nation faces,  and FMC can play a pivotal role in bringing folks together for these  challenges. This Nation's strength has always been found in its ability  to unite and move the country forward for the greater good.   FMC, like no other organization, can build a bridge between Democrats  and Republicans, build bridges between those being represented and  those doing the representing, and build bridges between one generation  of public servants and the next. To do so will require more and more of  your commitment to our work, and I am sure  [[Page H5661]]  former Members of Congress will rise to the challenge.   In addition, in anticipation of your support, I thank you from the  bottom of my heart as I pass the mantle to our new president, Martin  Frost.   Before getting to the business of electing our new officers and board  Members, I do want to recognize two of my colleagues to give you just a  little bit more detail about our domestic and international programs.   I first invite George Nethercutt of Washington to focus on FMC's  civic education work. He will be followed by Charles Boustany of  Louisiana to speak about our international programs.    Mr. Speaker, I just commend you for this. What you are  indicating is this place is working, and I think the problem is out  there in America, at least through mainstream media.   It does appear to be working, and I think it is because of your  leadership. And so we welcome you as a former Member, eventually, to be  part of our process, which our mission is to create civility and, at  the same time, to show how important it is that Congress work together.   So we thank you very much for all you have done, and we look forward  to working with you when you leave Congress.    Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for your time.   Mr. Stearns.    I want to thank George and Charles for their report and  for their outstanding leadership for these very important former  Members of the Congress programs, and we appreciate very much what you  do.   Normally, at this juncture in our report, I highlight each of the  former Members' staff members, briefly describe their areas of  responsibility and perhaps add a personal note, but since I worked so  closely with each of them over the past couple of years, I cannot do  that this year simply because our team has grown so much larger. There  is just not enough time anymore to do that.   In our written report, which will be submitted into the Record, you  will find their names and the tremendous contribution each and every  one of them has made. However, I do want to highlight two names.   First, our CEO, Pete Weichlein, as you may know, he has been with the  former Members of Congress in various positions since 1999, which means  in just a couple of months, he will celebrate his 20-year anniversary  with us.   When he became CEO in 2003, the staff consisted of him and an unpaid  intern--incredible. There was enough money in the bank for a couple of  Capitol Hill programs and 3 or 4 months of rent and payroll. An active  year with FMC consisted of five Congress to Campus visits plus some  lunches focusing on Germany.   We now have a team of 12 professionals conducting over almost 90  events over the past year involving huge constituencies, and we enjoy a  huge amount of financial security that could see us through some rainy  days if need be. He has turned this organization around, and we are  very, very lucky to have Pete.   The other staff member I want to a salute is our chief operating  officer, Sabine Schleidt. She joined FMC over 7 years ago and has been  the driving force behind so much of our tremendous growth and success,  particularly with the Statesmanship dinner. Originally, her focus was  on the congressional study groups, where she translated the success of  the Germany model to new study groups, for example, the Korea program  you have heard about several times. She is a tremendous fundraiser. She  has mentored our staff of young professionals. And in her new role as  chief operating officer, she will take a much more active part in  implementing FMC's vision and mission beyond the international work.  FMC is in very good hands, and thanks to her and Pete for their  outstanding work. So Sabine, thank you.   My colleagues, at this point, let me also recognize two guests from  overseas who have joined our annual meeting. As you well know, one of  the closest relationships FMC enjoys is with our sister organization in  Brussels, the Association of Former Members of the European Parliament.  They have sent their newly elected vice president, Jan Willem Bertens,  to join us, and we are so honored by his presence.   Jan, welcome.   In addition, all the way from Nepal and the former Members  Association of that country is Alok Dahal. While he, himself, is not a  former parliamentarian, his father is, and therefore, we are thrilled  to have him here in D.C. with us representing his country and his  country's former Members group.   Thank you both for joining us today.   Every year at our annual meeting, we ask the membership to elect new  officers and board members. I, therefore, will now read to you the  names of the candidates for board members and officers. They are  running unopposed; and I therefore will ask for a simple ``yea'' or  ``nay'' as I present to you the list of candidates as a slate.    For the Association's Board of Directors Class of 2018, the  candidates are:  [[Page H5665]]    Mary Bono of California   Charles Boustany of Louisiana   Tom Davis of Virginia   Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania   Vic Fazio of California   Martin Frost of Texas   Bart Gordon of Tennessee   David Skaggs of Colorado   Cliff Stearns of Florida   and Albert Wynn of Maryland.   All in favor of electing these 10 former Members to our board of  directors, please say ``yea.''   Any opposed?    Next, we will elect our Executive Committee. I  automatically join the Executive Committee in my capacity as past  president.   The secretary and treasurer are each elected to a 1-year term, with  eligibility for another 1-year term.   The candidates for our executive committee are:   Ann Marie Buerkle of New York for treasurer.   L.F. Payne of Virginia for secretary.   All in favor of electing these two former Members to FMC's Executive  Committee, please say ``yea.''   Any opposed?    The president and vice president each serve a 2-year  term and are term-limited to a single term. The candidates are:   For vice president, Charles Boustany of Louisiana.   For president, Martin Frost of Texas.   All in favor of electing these two former Members to our Executive  Committee as president and vice president, please say ``yea.''   Any opposition?    Mr. Frost and Mr. Boustany have been elected president  and vice president of FMC.   Congratulations to you both.   Martin, at the risk of having the Speaker's chair be vacant for a  minute, I would like for you to join us here at the rostrum to make  some brief comments.    Thank you.    Martin, I thank you, and congratulations again. I look  forward very much to working with you and have great respect for you.   It is now my duty to inform the Congress of those former and current  Members who have passed away since our last report. As you know, FMC  has commenced a beautiful new tradition, which is to recognize, via a  separate memorial service in Statuary Hall, all those of our colleagues  who have passed away in the previous 12 months. It is a wonderful and  fitting tribute, and I hope you will join all of us on September 5 as  we do it again this year.   We also want to pay tribute to those Members by making sure their  names are read here in the House Chamber and they are included in  today's Congressional Record. I, therefore, will now read their names  and ask all of you, including the visitors in the gallery if there are  any, to rise as I read their names. At the end of the list, we will pay  our respects to their memory with a moment of silence.   Please stand.   We honor these Members for their service to our country. They are:   John Anderson of Illinois   John Hall Buchanan, Jr., of Tennessee   Jim Bunning of Kentucky   Pete Domenici of New Mexico   Jon D. Fox of Pennsylvania   William F. Goodling of Pennsylvania   Orval H. Hansen of Idaho   Maurice Hinchey of New York   Marjorie Holt of Maryland   William H. Hudnut III of Indiana   Joe Knollenberg of Michigan   Tom Luken of Ohio   Marc L. Marks of Pennsylvania   Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania   Louise Slaughter of New York   Al Swift of Washington   John V. Tunney of California   Larry Winn of Kansas   We will now have a moment of silence.   Thank you, all of you. That concludes the 48th Report to Congress by  the Former Members of Congress. On behalf of FMC, I wish to thank the  Speaker and minority leader for giving us, simply, this opportunity to  return to this very special place and report on FMC's activities.   I also wish to share with you how incredibly honored I have been to  serve as president of this outstanding organization. I hope I was able  to repay the trust of our membership, and I cannot thank you enough for  having given me this great opportunity. I look forward to staying  actively involved, and I wish our new president and our new executive  committee the best of luck moving forward.    Please.    Thank you very much. They will now be part of the  Record.
