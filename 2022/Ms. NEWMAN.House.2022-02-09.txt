 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there is a humanitarian  crisis in Syria right now. For the past 2 years, there have been tens  of thousands of Syrians in the Rukban settlement suffering from not  only starvation but a lack of medical care.   The last remaining UNICEF clinic in this encampment closed in March  2020, right at the onset of the global pandemic. Since then, thousands  in the camp have tested positive but have nowhere to quarantine. They  don't have access to vaccines. They don't have access to medical care.  They do not have access to clean water.   With Russia and the Assad regimes preventing aid from reaching the  camp, I am calling on the U.S. to implore immediate action to intervene  and help.   We have a fundamental obligation to save thousands of Syrian lives.                            ____________________
