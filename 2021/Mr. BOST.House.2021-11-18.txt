 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better plan is a big, bloated joke. The  problem is it is not funny.   At a time when inflation is skyrocketing, House Democrats are  doubling down on their socialist wish list.   Is your family struggling financially after endless COVID shutdowns?   Don't worry. The Democrats have a plan. They are going to be giving  $80 billion to the IRS to double the number of agents who can track  your spending habits.   Worried about whether you can afford to put gas in your car or heat  your home this year?   Well, House Democrats have a plan for that too: huge tax hikes on  natural gas, kneecapping American-made energy products to pour billions  into the Green New Deal.   Are you concerned about the security on our borders and keeping  communities safe?   House Democrats are providing amnesty for 8 million illegal  immigrants.   And we still don't know what the cost of this bill is going to be.  There is no report here yet.   Mr. Speaker, we should not be voting on this monstrosity, and I urge  my colleagues to oppose it.
