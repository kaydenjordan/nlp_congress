 Mr. Speaker, as mayor of Long Beach,  California, for the last 8 years, I know how vital our ports are to  both our local and national economies. There are also enormous  environmental concerns that disproportionately impact working-class  communities that live around our ports.   The global shipping industry emits 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas  emissions every single year, and pollution from port ships has led to  some of the highest cancer and asthma rates in the country. In fact,  ships pollute more than cargo trucks coming in and out of our ports.   While I am proud of the work that California has done to reduce  emissions at our ports, it is time for additional Federal support and  intervention.   That is why I proudly introduced the Clean Shipping Act. This is  transformational climate legislation that for the first time gives the  EPA the authority to regulate carbon emissions from our shipping  industry and accelerates our transition to zero emission fuels by 2040.   The legislation is coauthored by Senator Padilla in the Senate and is  a path forward to cleaner air. Let's get this climate legislation done.                            ____________________
