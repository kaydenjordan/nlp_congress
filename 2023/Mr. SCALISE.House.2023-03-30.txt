 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves) for yielding, for his leadership on introducing this amendment,  which I support, and especially introducing this bill.   Mr. Chairman, we all ought to be focused on helping low-income  families who are struggling. Families all across America are struggling  under the weight of high inflation, all the spending that has come out  of Washington under President Biden, but especially led and driven by  this anti-American energy policy that we have seen from President Biden  that has dramatically increased costs on American families.   How are people getting hit by all of President Biden's anti-American  energy policies?   You can see it right here. Gas prices, every time you go to the pump,  people are paying 50 percent more. That takes money out of families'  paychecks every single week when they go to fill up their vehicle.   You look at the utility bills people are paying. They are paying 40  percent more, 25 percent more on their utility bills in some areas of  the country, making it harder for them to heat their homes during a  cold winter. As we approach summer, people want to turn on their air  conditioner. They are going to be paying a lot more. That takes money  out of their pocket.   Oh, by the way, when you look at what President Biden passed last  year, he passed a $6 billion tax increase on natural gas, which is one  of the drivers of higher electricity bills.   The good news is, Mr. Chairman, Republicans have answered the pleas  that so many families have been raising by bringing H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act, to the floor.   This is a bill focused on helping those families who have been  struggling, who have been saying for the last 2 years: Is anybody in  Washington looking out for the families who are living paycheck to  paycheck, who cannot make ends meet, who are sick and tired of runaway  inflation and higher costs?   The answer is yes. House Republicans are here with an answer to this  problem.   I think it is important to understand how we got here. It wasn't by  accident. President Biden as a candidate said he was going to go and  try to destroy the energy industry, stop drilling in America.   Day one, the day President Biden took office, he started taking  immediate action to attack American energy. He canceled the Keystone  pipeline. He started putting his bureaucrats in place to put red tape  in the way of American production of oil and natural gas.   Now, you may think that is because the President is against pipelines  and the President is against oil and natural gas. He is not. In fact,  while President Biden was canceling the Keystone pipeline from Canada  to the United States, he green-lighted a pipeline from Russia to  Germany. He bailed out Putin while he was sticking it to families in  America, and they paid a higher price for it here at home.   Then, at the same time, he was making it harder to produce energy in  America: Getting agencies to stop issuing permits and canceling lease  sales. It wasn't because he was against oil and gas. No.   During the time that he was making it harder to get oil and gas in  America, he was calling Vladimir Putin--again there is that name-- calling Russia, asking them to produce more oil for America. Putin said  no.   Then he got on Air Force One and begged the Saudis to produce more  oil. The Saudis said no, because the Saudis want a high price for  gasoline.   Who pays for that? Hardworking families.   All these climate justice warriors who fly all around the world on  their private jets, they take jet fuel. The last time I checked, there  are no solar panels on the wings of Air Force One.   Again, the President is not against oil. He is just against American  oil.   Why don't we ask this question? If the President is not against oil,  he is just against American oil, where are we getting our energy from?   Where are we getting our critical minerals from?   They talk about electric vehicles as if everybody is driving electric  cars. One day, maybe that is where the world goes. Technology still  needs to advance a lot to get to that point. Today, maybe 5-10 percent  of the cars on the road are electric.   If you are going to advance it, like, California says they are going  to ban fossil fuel cars in California. Of course, ironically, days  after the Governor said he was going to ban fossil fuel cars, he told  people they cannot plug their electric car into the socket because they  are about to have power outages because the grid can't handle it.   Again, where does the energy come from?   You don't plug that electric car into a tree. You have got to  actually use baseload energy.   Where does the battery come from, by the way, that you are charging?   We know right now the batteries are coming from China.   President Biden has made it very clear, he wants to make it harder to  produce in America, but he is not against the production. He is going  to countries like Russia, China, and Venezuela.    Look at the list. Are these the people we want to become dependent  on?   The question is no longer do we or do we not get oil. It is where we  get it from.   Now, what Republicans have said and what H.R. 1 gets us back to is  why don't we get our energy from America?   It is a pretty straightforward answer.   President Biden said no to America. But, again, he was begging  Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. He is trying to ease sanctions on  Venezuela right now to get more of their oil.   If it is all about carbon emissions and saving the planet, why don't  we use the facts?   Let's talk science for a moment.   Where is the cleanest place to make things in the world?   Who has the highest standards?   I know some on the left wake up every day, and they just want to  trash America. We have the best standards in  [[Page H1672]]  the world. If you want to make oil anywhere in the world--and, again,  they are not against oil; they just don't want it made in America.   However, look at the countries they are begging to make more oil,  countries that emit more carbon to make the same oil. Then they put  that oil on a tanker and send it to the United States. Think of the  lunacy of that policy.   We would love to make it here and put it in a pipeline, which is the  safest way to transport it. They don't even want you to be able to  build the pipelines. We eased that in the bill so we can actually build  real infrastructure in America.   If you are worried about carbon emissions, there is good news for  you: the Lower Energy Costs Act solves that problem because by making  it in America, you make it in the best place in the world.   We also address critical minerals.   You want to make computer chips? You want to make electric car  batteries?   They are going to be made somewhere in the world.   Where are they going to be made?   Right now, under President Biden's policies, it is almost impossible  to get permits to mine for those minerals in America.   They are getting made. The problem is, they are getting made in  countries like China. Go look at the environmental standards of China.  I know the President's Energy Secretary said, just a few days ago, that  we can learn something from China on clean energy.   I am not sure if she has been traveling around America. I know she is  traveling around to other countries.   How could you possibly say we could learn from China?   No one does it cleaner than America. Many would argue no one does it  dirtier than China.                                time  1030    Why would you want to be making our country more dependent on China?  In our bill, we actually say we can make those things in America again.  We have them here.   Look at the plaque right above the Speaker's rostrum. ``Let us  develop the resources of our land. . . . `'   Well, Mr. Speaker, we actually do fulfill that promise in this bill  by letting us develop the resources in our land, not in China.   They can go make stuff in China. We shouldn't be addicted to those  products because President Biden shut off our ability to make things in  America.   These policies make nothing but common sense. The good thing about it  is you don't just get the advantages of lower carbon emissions globally  by passing this bill.   For families across America who are sick and tired of the lunacy and  hypocrisy of the left's policies, it lowers costs for families.   There is only one free market country in the world that has abundant  resources. That is America. If you look at the other countries that we  have become dependent on, they want a higher price. They are part of  cartels like OPEC.   We can make OPEC irrelevant if we make more energy in America. We  have got the resources.   You can go to Port Fourchon in south Louisiana, my district, and see  areas where we can produce hundreds of thousands of barrels a day that  are being closed off, where it is almost impossible for them to get  permits. They can't even move pipelines.   Go to Pennsylvania where they can produce oil and natural gas, but  they can't even get it to their neighbors in New York and the New  England States because they are abusing Federal laws in all of these  different agencies to stop the building of the infrastructure for  pipelines.   Their argument is that they don't want oil and natural gas. Well,  they are getting the oil and natural gas. They are just getting it from  other countries, from tankers coming into the New England States  instead of pipelines made in America.   None of this makes any sense. There is an answer. The answer is let's  stand up for those families who are sick and tired of paying more when  they know we have the ability here to do it ourselves. We can become  energy independent again.   It is a national security issue, but it is a bread and butter,  kitchen table issue for those families who are struggling.   Stop being dependent on foreign countries like President Biden has  made us. Let's get back to the sound principles that have been proven  to work, again, in the cleanest place to make things in the world--the  United States of America.   Let's stand up for those families who are sick and tired of paying  too much. Let's actually get good policy put into law that fights for  those families who have been left behind for far too long.   Let's pass the Lower Energy Costs Act. Let's get this country back on  track, and let's lower prices for those families who are struggling.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this amendment.
