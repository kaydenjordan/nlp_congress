 Thank you, Mr. President.   I have been recognized to close the debate on this motion. In a few  moments, we will be voting on the motion to proceed to this resolution.  I will be voting no and urge my colleagues to do so.   This debate is about a free and open internet, and it is also about a  thriving and innovative internet. We can have both. For decades, we  have had both, and we can continue to do so if we are smart about this.   Does every Senator in this Chamber believe in a free and open  internet? Yes.   Does every Member of this body want to prevent blocking and the  throttling of the internet? The answer is a resounding yes.   Does any Member of the Senate advocate, as my friend from  Massachusetts just suggested, that a company or two gets to set the  rules for the entire internet? Absolutely not.   Do all Senators and all Congressmen want the internet to be a source  of innovation and job creation and prosperity as it has been for a  quarter century? I hope so.   I hope we all want this information superhighway, this technology  superhighway to continue its success. I hope we all want the internet  to continue being that phenomenal platform for market competition,  health advancements, investment, technological progress, efficiency,  and safety. I hope we all want this.   If we all want this great engine to keep going, it is important to  ask how all this happened in the first place. How did we get here? How  did we arrive at this point in our Nation's history, with a dynamic  internet economy that is truly the envy of the world?   The answer lies in the creativity and ingenuity of the American  spirit. This has allowed the internet to thrive under the light-touch  regulatory framework that has governed the internet for most of its  history.   Let's revisit a little of that history. It was in 1996. I was a  freshman Member of the House of Representatives at this time under a  Democratic President, under a Democratic administration. Our country  was at a crossroads on how to govern this new thing called the  worldwide web, the internet. No one could have imagined the success of  the internet we have today, but policymakers had the foresight not to  regulate these new emerging information services like the services of a  bygone era.   Instead, in 1996, during the Clinton administration, a very  deliberative, thoughtful decision was made not to impose title II  rules--the same rules from the 1930s that were modeled for the Bell  monopolies, that were modeled for a time during the Great Depression.  That was the pivotal decision that allowed this great internet economy  to thrive and to be the success it is today.   Now let's fast-forward to recently, to 2015. That was the year the  FCC made an ill-advised decision to change all that. Despite explosive  growth, new applications, services, and consumer choice that the  internet was delivering to Americans, the FCC imposed these title II  rules, and that is what we are debating today. Almost immediately we  saw a chilling effect on investment and innovation. U.S. companies were  right to be uncertain about the archaic title II regulations and how  they would apply to modern technology.   Fortunately, this misguided action was reversed last year. The FCC  lifted the 2015 regulations and restored the light-touch regulatory  framework that has benefited consumers for almost two decades and has  resulted in this great success. Today, some in Congress are trying to  give the government more control again, applying utility-style  regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it. We should  reject these efforts.    Let me say this: Many of my colleagues correctly, on both sides of  the aisle, have been calling for bipartisan legislation to enshrine the  net neutrality principles into law--legislation which I support,  legislation which Members of the minority party have supported. If this  resolution passes today, it will amount to merely a statement, nothing  more.  [[Page S2698]]    Senator Thune will give Senators an opportunity to pass bipartisan  legislation today. I hope we will do that. I hope, once this statement  is made, we will move on to enshrining net neutrality principles into a  law that protects consumers and promotes innovation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
