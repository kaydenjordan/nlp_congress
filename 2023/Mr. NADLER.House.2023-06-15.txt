 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the so-called Separation of Powers Restoration Act  would completely upend the administrative process by eliminating  judicial deference to agencies and by requiring Federal courts to  review all agency rulemakings and interpretations of statutes on a de  novo basis.   More than 30 years ago, the Supreme Court held in Chevron USA v.  Natural Resources Defense Council, that courts must give ``considerable  weight'' to an agency's construction of a statute it administers. This  makes sense, because while Congress sets broad policies, we delegate  authority to executive agencies because we do not have the expertise to  craft technical regulations ourselves, and we rely on these agencies to  carry out the policies we enact.    Under the Chevron doctrine, courts respect the careful process  undertaken by the dedicated professionals at our Federal agencies, many  of whom who have decades of experience and vast technical expertise.   Courts give deference to an agency's interpretation of its statutory  authority if the interpretation is determined to be reasonable. The  Chevron doctrine has been the ruling precedent for judicial review of  agency decisions for decades. But this legislation would do away with  this longstanding precedent--a move that would throw uncertainty into  the entire rulemaking process.   It would also empower judges to completely override the determination  of agency experts, substituting their own judgment regardless of their  comparative lack of technical knowledge and understanding of the  underlying subject matter for the carefully crafted and scientifically  based decisions made by agencies.   It is the height of hypocrisy for the party that rails against what  it calls judicial activism to support legislation that is the very  embodiment of the judicial activism.   This legislation would also make the Federal rulemaking process even  more time consuming and costly than it already is, forcing agencies to  adopt even more detailed factual records and explanations in order to  withstand judicial scrutiny, which would further delay the finalization  of critical lifesaving regulations.   These are regulations that protect the quality of the air we breathe,  the water we drink, the food we consume, and the safety of the products  we use. But this legislation is just the latest step in the  Republican's decades-long assault on the regulatory process, trying to  add hurdle after hurdle on the  [[Page H2940]]  ability to issue regulations that protect public health and safety,  regulations whose benefits consistently outweigh their cost, often by  many multiples.   Slowing down the rulemaking process for these vital health and safety  protections would put the lives of Americans at greater risk. By  eliminating judicial deference to agencies, this bill would empower the  courts to make public policy from the bench, ignoring the careful  consideration and technical expertise of executive agencies.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two letters: The first from  the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which includes more than 160  diverse labor, consumer, public health, food safety, financial reform,  faith, environmental, and scientific integrity groups; and another  letter from the Earthjustice organization.                                                       Coalition for                                             Sensible Safeguards,                                                       June 5, 2023.        Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards       (CSS), which includes more than 160 diverse labor, consumer,       public health, food safety, financial reform, faith,       environmental, and scientific integrity groups representing       millions of Americans, strongly opposes the Separation of       Powers Restoration Act, H.R. 288.        Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen our       country's regulatory system by identifying gaps and       instituting new safeguards for the public. Unfortunately,       this legislation does the opposite by placing even more       obstacles before agencies as they work to provide new public       health, safety, and financial security protections for the       public.        The legislation will make our system of regulatory       safeguards weaker by enabling judicial policymaking at the       expense of agency expertise and congressional authority,       thereby resulting in unpredictable outcomes and regulatory       uncertainty for all stakeholders. If passed, H.R. 288 would       prevent many critical updates to public protections,       especially those that ensure clean air and water, safe food       and consumer products, safe workplaces, and a stable,       prosperous economy.        This problematic legislation attempts to reverse a       fundamental and well-settled legal principle that has long       effectively guided our regulatory system and provided a vital       check on judicial overreach. It strives to abolish judicial       deference to agencies' statutory interpretations in       rulemaking by requiring a court to decide all relevant       questions of law de nova, including all questions concerning       the interpretation of constitutional, statutory, and       regulatory provisions of final agency actions. Such deference       was established as bedrock administrative law by the Supreme       Court in the 1984 case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense       Council and came to be referred to as Chevron deference.       Chevron deference has been upheld by hundreds of federal       courts since and has been endorsed by both conservative and       liberal Supreme Court justices and federal court judges.        In practice, abolishing Chevron deference will make the       current problems in our country's regulatory process much       worse in several ways. H.R. 288 will lead to even more       regulatory burdens and delays, particularly for those       ``economically significant'' or ``major'' new rules that       provide the greatest benefits to the public's health, safety,       and financial security.        There is substantial academic literature and expert       consensus that intrusive judicial scrutiny of agency       rulemaking is one of the main drivers of regulatory       paralysis. Thus, increasing litigation risk for agency rules,       which is exactly what this bill would accomplish by spawning       hundreds of new lawsuits per year, will mean many more missed       congressional deadlines and a regulatory process that fails       to efficiently and effectively protect the public as Congress       requires. This further ``chilling'' of rulemaking will       certainly benefit special interests who will further pressure       regulators to carve out loopholes, weaken safety standards,       or otherwise obstruct new rulemakings with the greatly       enhanced threat of a lawsuit waiting in the wings.        Of even greater concern, eliminating judicial deference to       agency rulemaking would empower reviewing courts to       substitute their policy preferences for those of the agency.       One of the primary policy rationales for Chevron deference is       that agencies have considerable and superior expertise in the       regulatory sectors they oversee as compared to generalist       judges with far less expertise. Thus, H.R. 288 aims to make       it easier for the courts to overturn an agency's highly       technical, resource-intensive, and science-based rulemaking       without the expertise needed to make such determinations.        Further, abolishing Chevron review would actually undermine       congressional authority, an irony given the name of the bill.       De novo review of the scope and nature of congressional       grants of authority to agencies invites courts to create law,       ignore congressional intent, or both. In particular, it       defeats a deliberate choice by Congress to confer on agencies       the authority to resolve complex policy questions based on       their expertise and the public input they receive during the       rulemaking process.        Perhaps the most telling critique of attempts to replace       Chevron deference with de novo review comes from former       Justice Antonin Scalia, a vocal supporter of Chevron       deference during his career and an indication of just how       broad the support is for maintaining such deference. Writing       for the majority in City of Arlington v. F.C.C., Justice       Scalia argued that requiring that ``every agency rule must be       subjected to a de novo judicial determination'' without any       standards to guide this review would result in an ``open-      ended hunt for congressional intent,'' rendering ``the       binding effect of agency rules unpredictable and destroy the       whole stabilizing purpose of Chevron. The excessive agency       power that the dissent fears would be replaced by chaos.''       [City of Arlington, Tex. v. F.C.C., 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1874       (2013).]        H.R. 288 aims to achieve an unprecedented and dangerous       move away from traditional judicial deference towards a       system of enhanced powers for Big Business lobbyists and       weakened protections for consumers and working families. We       strongly urge opposition to the Separation of Powers       Restoration Act, H.R. 288.            Sincerely,      Coalition for Sensible Safeguards.                                   ____                                                     Earthjustice,                                                       June 6, 2023.      Re Opposition to H.R. 288, the so-called ``Separation of           Powers Restoration Act of 2023''.         Dear Representative: On behalf of Earthjustice, I       respectfully urge you to oppose ``H.R. 288, Separation of       Power Restoration Act of 2023'' on the floor this week for       vote. Chevron deference is a longstanding and well-founded       framework for judicial review that acknowledges a regulatory       process grounded in extensive administrative records, and       long processes of public input and expert evaluations. The       framework is carried out by officials appointed and confirmed       by elected officials working under an elected president.        H.R. 288 in an effort to check the executive branch of       power instead creates an unchecked judiciary branch and an       unbalanced division of power. The judiciary would be given       the power to nullify agencies reasonable regulations based on       preference of a particular outcome or interpretation of a       regulation. Agency decisions are currently based on extensive       expert evaluations of complex natures. Without the reliance       on the administrative record and process, judges' decisions       will be based on limited information gleaned from the small       sampling of litigants before them.        The Separation of Powers Restoration Act interferes in the       stabilized standards used for judicial review of agency       interpretation of administrative law. The act essentially       transfers implementation power delegated to the executive       branch to judges. Congress has the power to set forth strong       laws that set forth boundaries around agency implementation.       Agencies are prevented from making interpretations that are       void of the required connection to the intent and statutory       purpose.        Courts continuously set aside arbitrary and capricious or       an abuse of discretion for a wide variety or reasons       including the absence of a reasonable relationship to       statutory purposes or requirements. Agencies must defend       their actions and offer explanations that provide clear links       to the statutory purposes based on unflawed reasoning. The       fundamental nature of arbitrary and capricious threshold is       created to protect the individual's rights by ensuring that       no ones liberty is constrained without plausible       justification. Government officials are thus only able to       operate within the confines of the law.        H.R. 288 is likely to create a system in which agencies act       to protect their interpretations by drafting unclear       regulations. The regulations will have vague language with       fewer details to prevent de novo reviews. Furthermore       geographic differences in regulatory uncertainly will       increase. The Chevron test creates a stabilized system in       which federal statutes are all given the same       interpretational deference in circuit courts where judges are       in conflict on regulatory interpretation.        This bill is another anti-regulatory attempt to attack       federal regulation by harming the legal infrastructure. Most       erroneously, H.R. 288 would put the general public in harm's       way, resulting in impaired safeguards for civil rights,       consumer rights, health, the environment, safety, financial       markets, and all concerns of federal regulatory statutes.        Accordingly, I urge you to vote no on H.R. 288.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                               Brielle L. Green,                                         Senior Legislative Counsel,                                                      Earthjustice.     Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  dangerously flawed legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation would allow judges to undermine and second-guess the  carefully crafted and scientifically based regulations issued by our  expert administrative agencies. It would upset decades of Supreme Court  precedent just to further the extreme antiregulatory agenda of the  Republican majority, which puts the health and safety of all Americans  at risk.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, as agency heads have stated time and time  again, guidance documents, general statements of policy, and other  agency guidance do not have the force and effect of law, and the  agencies do not take enforcement actions based on supervisory guidance.   This amendment would unnecessarily require judicial review, de novo  or otherwise, of guidance documents that have not been interpreted by  courts to be given the force of law.   Before I discuss how guidance documents and rules differ, let's take  a minute to consider the pure breadth of materials this amendment would  cover: interagency statements, bulletins, policy statements, questions  and answers, frequently asked questions, statements of policy, and  advisories.   Rules and guidance from agencies are not only given different weight  in court, but they also are developed through entirely different  processes. Rules are made under the Administrative Procedures Act and,  thus, follow a structured process for soliciting public comments, the  review of those comments, and the release of any final rule. Agency  guidance documents, by contrast, are not made under the APA process.  Guidance documents are not subject to public review and comment. When  you consider the range of materials that falls under the category  ``guidance,'' this, naturally, makes sense.                                time  0945    A frequently asked questions page on an agency website cannot and  should not be placed in the same category as rules that undergo months  and years of review and development. Not only is it wrong as a matter  of law to conflate these two classes of documents, but it would also  signal to the judiciary that Congress sees them on equal footing; that  is, rules and guidance on equal footing, which would muddy the judicial  review of agency action.   I imagine the amendment sponsor did not intend for her amendment to  accidentally expand what kinds of instruction from agencies should be  given the force of law by expanding the Separation of Powers  Restoration Act in this fashion, but in any case, that is what this  amendment would do.   If agency guidance were treated the same as a rule, as wrong as that  might be, agencies would be chilled and warned against providing much- needed information to the individuals and businesses who seek more  feedback on an agency's point of view. They would be very hesitant to  answer questions on question lines.   Finally, as I noted in response to a similar amendment to the REINS  Act yesterday, by requiring agency guidance documents to receive the  same review as rules, this amendment would create confusion among  businesses subject to oversight from our executive branch agencies as  to how much weight they should give agency guidance.   Expanding this bill to also require any guidance the agency gives to  businesses about how the rules will be enforced is a drastic expansion  of the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and would ensure that  agencies provide less guidance for businesses, thus creating more  uncertainty for businesses.   This amendment is an overstep that would further stifle the work of  our agencies. I, therefore, oppose this amendment and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, judging from what the gentlewoman just  said, the gentlewoman does not understand the process at all.   Courts do not enforce guidance, so we are not prohibiting them here  from doing what they do not do to start with. Courts do not enforce  guidance. Guidance simply tells people how the courts will enforce the  rules promulgated by the agencies.   So to say that you can't have guidance is to say that people must act  in ignorance and bet their businesses on what the agency will do  without knowing it because the agency can't tell them. That is absurd.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman is accurate as to what  SOPRA would do, and for all the reasons I stated before, it is a  terrible bill, as terrible as REINS is. I am not going to repeat those  arguments.   As to this amendment, I don't have to have practiced law recently. I  know how to read a bill. There are lawyers on my staff who know how to  read a bill and we know, as I said before, that courts don't enforce  guidance. There is no such thing.   Guidance issued by agencies tells the courts how to interpret the  rules promulgated by those agencies. That is a simple fact. It is not  debatable.   Similarly, to have an amendment that says there shall be no guidance  is to have an amendment that says businesses should operate in the dark  and bet their businesses on what an agency might do. That is ridiculous  and harmful to business, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment as I urge them to oppose the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
