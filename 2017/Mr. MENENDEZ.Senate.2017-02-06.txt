Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today as a product of New Jersey  public schools, the son of Cuban refugees whose parents decided to  leave everything behind because they did not like the dictatorship from  the right and did not like what they saw in the Sierra Maestra, as the  Castros were seeking to overthrow that government from the right, and  who fled their own country in order to seek a better life in the United  States.   They were the lucky ones. They saw the handwriting on the wall, and  they got out before the true brutality of the Castro regime took hold  in Cuba. When they arrived here, they had nothing more than the promise  of a brighter future and, if not for them, then for their children.   In so many ways, it is the quintessential immigrant story; indeed,  the quintessential American story. My mother worked as a seamstress in  the factories of New Jersey. My father was an itinerant carpenter. We  didn't have a lot of money--just enough to live in a small apartment in  a tenement in Union City and put food on the table. But that was  plenty. It was plenty because my parents knew that living in America  gave their children access to a free public education, and they always  taught us that an education was the key toward a better life.   Growing up, I was a quiet kid. I was very studious. I got good  grades, but I struggled with public speaking. I know some of my  colleagues wouldn't believe that today, but it is true.   Unfortunately for me, one of the final requirements before I  graduated high school was a public speech class. Again, I did all the  work, but I refused to actually stand up in front of the class and  speak. I thought I could get away with it, but my teacher, Gail Harper,  had other ideas.   She kept me after class. After my classmates left, she forced me to  recite short stories and poetry and speeches I had written that were  part of the classwork. Eventually she told me that I was going to be  the narrator in a school production, which meant that I was going to be  speaking on stage in front of the entire student body. I was  [[Page S715]]  petrified--petrified. And I was inclined to refuse.   I am not sure if there would have been a more terrifying thought to  me in the world than having to get up in front of my entire student  body, but Ms. Harper told me that she knew that I could succeed. If I  refused, however, she would have no choice but to fail me. And if you  knew my late mother, that was not an option.   So I swallowed my fear, and when I got out there, I found that Ms.  Harper's work paid off. Not only did I realize that I could overcome  all of that fear and anxiety, but it had instilled in me a hunger to  keep working, to get better at speaking in front of people, a skill  that I honestly owe my life's work to.   For me, Ms. Harper was so much more than a teacher; she was a mentor  and one of the unsung heroes of our public education system. And I am  privileged to have had an opportunity to tell her that during her  lifetime.   Now, thanks to my parents' commitment and incredible public  schoolteachers like Ms. Harper, this product of New Jersey public  schools went on to get a law degree from Rutgers University, a State  institution, and was able to rise from a tenement in Union City to 1 of  100 Senators in a country of over 300 million people.   I got my start in politics fighting for public schools in my  hometown. When I was in high school, I was told that because of my  grades and my activities, I could be in the senior honors program but  that I had to cough up $200 for the books. My parents were poor. We  lived in a tenement. I didn't have $200 for the books. And I couldn't  understand, for the life of me, if I had the ability and the grades but  not the money, that I would be barred from being in the honors program.  So I raised such a ruckus that they gave me the books, told me to be  quiet, and they put me in the honors program. But I had friends who had  the same circumstances; they had the ability and the grades, but they  didn't have the money. Unlike me, they didn't say anything, and they  didn't get in. So I didn't think that was right.   I petitioned to change the school board from being appointed by the  mayor at the time to being elected by the public. Ultimately, I won the  fight to change that school board and became the youngest school board  member at that time in history when I was 20 years old.   So I understand the promise of public education. I understand the  challenges that come with it. I understand the need for parental  engagement and the extraordinary impact that good teachers can have on  our children's lives.   I understand that our schools need access to adequate resources in  order to allow every student to reach their full potential. And I  understand that we have a long way to go to ensure that we truly do  guarantee every child in America equal access to a high quality public  education regardless of where they live, regardless of the happenstance  of where they were born, regardless of their station in life.   Most importantly, I understand that our public education system has  formed the foundation upon which the American dream has been built for  generations. It is the great socializing factor of our Nation, and  there is no substitute for it. At its core, it is an all-taker system.  It does not care whether you are wealthy or poor, whether your family  predates European settlement, came on the Mayflower, or is first- generation American. It does not care whether you are White or Black or  Hispanic or Asian or Christian or Jewish or Muslim. It does not care  whether you struggle with learning disabilities or autism or Down  syndrome.   Our public education system welcomes you with open arms and adheres  to the fundamental principles that all are welcome, all are equal, and  all deserve a chance to learn and earn a better life for themselves and  their families.   While we work to improve public education and renew our commitment to  our children, we need a partner in the Federal Department of Education  that also understands these challenges and shares our values.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that Betsy DeVos is that candidate.   While I do not question her intentions, her limited experience and  advocacy for policies that fundamentally undermine public education  make her unqualified to be the Secretary of Education.   Mrs. DeVos has never participated in the public education system that  she would be tasked with overseeing either as a student or a parent or  a teacher or an administrator. I don't see that fact in and of itself  alone as disqualifying but, coupled with the policies that she has  advocated for in her home State of Michigan--pushing for more charter  schools while simultaneously working against accountability for them,  even as they profit off the backs of children while showing little  improvement in student outcomes; advocating for voucher schemes that  put public funding into private schools even for families that do not  need the additional assistance, while depriving public schools of vital  funding that they depend upon to provide a quality education to every  student--it becomes clear that Mrs. DeVos does not understand that  fundamental commitment to American children.   My concerns about Mrs. DeVos were compounded by the answers she gave  in her confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee. Guns have no  place in our schools--at least in my view--except in the hands of  trained law enforcement personnel tasked with keeping our children  safe, yet when asked if she would do away with gun-free school zones,  if told to do so by the President, Mrs. DeVos, after trying to avoid  the question with a nonanswer about grizzly bears attacking schools,  said she would ``support the President.''   I do not believe that it is the role of a Cabinet Secretary to simply  and blindly support the President, regardless of how misguided or  dangerous an idea might be, nor do I believe that it is reasonable or  responsible to make it easier to bring guns in and around schools,  where they endanger our children. We must do a better job of securing  universal background checks and treating mental health issues, but more  guns is not the answer.   Mrs. DeVos also said in her testimony that she believed that  compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act should  be left up to the States. IDEA, as the act is known, guarantees a  ``free, appropriate public education'' that is individualized to meet  the needs of every student with disabilities.   When Congress first passed IDEA in 1975--though it was called then  the Education for All Handicapped Children Act--it came with a promise  that the Federal Government would cover 40 percent of the cost to  educate those with special needs. Unfortunately, we have not met that  obligation, providing less than half of that funding in recent history.   IDEA is Federal--not State--law. It is Federal law that needs  increased funding and attention from the Federal Government. And when  this was pointed out to Mrs. DeVos, she said simply that she ``may have  been confused.''   Our children with disabilities deserve a real Federal partner that  understands the challenges they face and is committed to getting them  the resources they deserve, not a Secretary of Education who is  confused about the Federal role in education.   These are only a few examples of how Mrs. DeVos has shown herself to  be unprepared and unqualified for the very serious position to which  she has been nominated.   If confirmed, Mrs. DeVos would take over a multibillion-dollar  Federal student aid and student loan program that helps American  families afford the skyrocketing cost of higher education.   I, myself, was a recipient of Pell grants and other Federal student  aid and would not have been able to afford the cost of a college degree  without them. Yet not only does Mrs. DeVos have no experience with  student loans or managing such a program, she has very little, if any,  engagement with any policy issues pertaining to higher education.   At a time when trillions of dollars of student debt are acting as a  barrier to obtaining a higher education, hindering a generation of  graduates from entering the middle class, and acting as a drag on our  economy, we deserve a nominee who understands these issues.   As we continue to struggle with the best ways to measure student  progress and achievement, we deserve a Secretary of Education who  understands basic concepts like the difference between proficiency and  growth.   So let me just say, my own experiences have given me an incredible  faith  [[Page S716]]  in the power of public education systems, while Mrs. DeVos has worked  only to undermine them. I believe that the Federal Government can be a  strong partner in ensuring a free, quality public education for all  students, especially those with disabilities, while Mrs. DeVos seems to  think that the Federal Government should not be involved in these  endeavors.   I believe that guns must remain out of our schools, but Mrs. DeVos  seemed to indicate that they could have a place there. Most  importantly, I believe that our students, parents, teachers, and  educators should be able to trust the person tasked with overseeing  them. And the 50,000 New Jerseyans who have reached out to me to oppose  her nomination have clearly shown that she has not earned that trust.   Here is one example of a constituent who reached out to my office.         Dear Senator,        My name is Beth More and I live in your great State of New       Jersey in Fanwood in Union County. I am writing today to       express my deep opposition to the appointment of Betsy DeVos       as Secretary of Education. As a mother of two boys in our       public school system, and one with special needs, I am deeply       concerned and troubled by Mrs. DeVos's lack of public school       experience. In fact, the thought of her steering money and       funding away from public schools is not only a threat to my       children, but a threat to the 50 million other children       currently receiving a public education. She lacks       understanding in even the most basic issues that affect our       schools, and that, my Senator, is scary. I urge you to       strongly oppose this and tell your other colleagues in the       Senate the same.    So I implore my colleagues to put politics aside, to examine Mrs.  DeVos's qualifications closely, and to be open to the input that you  all are receiving from your own constituents, like Beth More.   I hope that if you are open in your mind in that regard, you will  oppose Betsy DeVos's nomination to be Secretary of Education, as I  will.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
