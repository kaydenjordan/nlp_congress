 I don't think so. Mr. Neal has spelled out, and you have,  the atrocious approach here. So I think we can sum it up. The process  has been terrible. The product is worse. That is what happens when you  have a very terrible process, you get a frightfully bad product.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to ask you to yield just at this  moment. The gentleman talked about a tax cut for the middle class. The  problem with this terrible process is there isn't time enough to  challenge those who say something that is false. I just want to read  again what the Speaker said relating to your point.   He said this: ``The focus is on middle class tax relief. The focus is  on directing that tax relief to the people in the middle and the people  who are trying to get there.''   This bill is the opposite. As we discussed with our ranking member at  the markup, and we challenged it, the Joint Tax said to us: Well, I  think--and we will show this to you--that there are going to be  millions of people in the middle class who, in subsequent years, will  have their taxes increased, not decreased. Millions.   When we asked about the passthrough--picking up on the gentleman's  point about the middle class--he pointed to tables which showed that  the vast majority of the moneys that are going to go through  passthroughs, that are going to get some tax help, the vast majority  are for very wealthy people. While we don't have the final figures, it  is likely that 85 to 90 percent is going to go to the very wealthy.   I think so much of what they have said is so untrue. They say that  necessity is the mother of invention. In this case, necessity, their  political necessity, has been the mother of deception.
