 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I was honored  to be at Mount Aloysius College to participate in its Martin Luther  King Jr. Day prayer service.   Located in Cresson, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District, Mount Aloysius College planned events throughout this week to  honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The activities  include community service projects, diversity talks, art exhibits, and  more.   Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to join the students, faculty, and  staff on Monday during a truly moving prayer service in Cosgrave Lobby.  The service featured several readers who shared Dr. King's powerful  words, and everyone in attendance sang hymns.   Yesterday, the college hosted a multicultural food day. Today, at  3:30 p.m., a special guest speaker from Carlow University will be  featured at Alumni Hall. Friday concludes Martin Luther King Week at  Mount Aloysius College with an exhibit in the Cosgrave Lobby and a  poetry night for all the regional college students at a location in  Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to be able to meet so many wonderful Mount  Aloysius students, and I thank them for hosting me.                            ____________________
