The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about this  legislation.   At the outset, I thank my colleague from Georgia and the Senator from  Utah for their work on the affordable housing tax credit. The Senator  from Utah said: Let's work together. I stand ready to work with him on  affordable housing in the future, and, hopefully, with the Senator from  Georgia, we can make progress on what is a crisis in America.   I come to speak in opposition to the legislation before us today, the  tax reconciliation bill.   One of the requirements of the legislation that I most ardently  oppose is including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas  development.   Basically, this bill pays for the tax cuts for corporations and  millionaires by raising taxes on the middle class, undermining  healthcare, and requiring oil drilling in one of our Nation's most  iconic national wildlife refuges.   Everyone should understand that a vote for this reconciliation bill  is a vote that will go to the biological heart of the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge and require drilling. I believe that opening up the  Arctic Refuge to oil drilling is being done as a supposed revenue  raiser to offset the soaring costs of this tax bill for corporations  and the wealthy, but the process that it went through is a sham.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that drilling for oil in  the Arctic Refuge will raise less than $1 billion over 10 years. This  doesn't even meet the $1 billion reconciliation instruction, and it  certainly doesn't represent a serious offset to the huge deficits in  the bill. To put this in perspective, less than seven one-hundredths of  1 percent of the $1.5 trillion increase in the national debt will be  from this policy in this legislation.   Drilling in the Arctic really has nothing to do with serious  budgetary policy, but it has everything to do with evading regular  order to pass something that could never pass in the regular order of  the legislative process.   In addition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this  bill would sell 7 million barrels of oil from our Nation's Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. A portion of that sale is simply to meet the  reconciliation instructions--that is to say, to make this bill work.  Yet the sale of oil from our petroleum reserve would also provide a  $300 million windfall to four States--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,  and Alabama. So this bill is selling off oil in order to pay for oil  drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I do not believe that  that makes sense.   Under this sham process, the bill will turn one of our Nation's  wildest and most pristine areas into an oil field. The Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge is the largest refuge in our Nation and is one of the  crown jewels for us in the United States for wildlife refuges. I  believe it is a U.S. Serengeti.   We received a letter from Jane Goodall, who basically said:         Around the globe so many indigenous people have been harmed       in the name of ``progress''--let us not add one more tragedy       to the list. We have other sources of energy.    I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter we received from the  Jane Goodall Institute be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     The Jane Goodall Institute,                                      Vienna, VA, November 14, 2017.        Dear United States Senator: It seems that each day brings       ever more dire news about what we humans are doing to harm       our planet, the animals that share it with us and, by doing       so, harming ourselves also. You have an important opportunity       to make a difference both now, and for future generations, by       voting to oppose oil development in one of the world's most       spectacular wilderness areas--the Arctic National Wildlife       Refuge.        This Refuge is a truly wonderful place--nearly 20 million       acres of pristine and ecologically significant habitat. There       is compelling scientific evidence as to why it is truly       important to protect this place. For one thing, it provides       key breeding habitat for the millions-upon-millions of birds       that migrate there from six of our planet's seven continents.       It is also a calving ground for the 200,000-strong Porcupine       caribou herd. And it is one of the most important denning       habitats on earth for polar bears. Moreover it plays a       significant role in helping to protect us from the onslaught       of climate change.  [[Page S8095]]         But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is more than that.       Its very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual       connection to nature, a necessary element of the human       psyche. The Gwich'in people understand this and call the area       ``The Sacred Place Where Life Begins''.        If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil       beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the       Gwich'in people for they depend upon the caribou herds to       sustain their traditional way of life. Around the globe so       many indigenous people have been harmed in the name of       `progress'--let us not add one more tragedy to the list. We       have other sources of energy.        And so I beg you: Please use your voice and your vote as a       U.S. Senator to protect the Gwich'in people and the American       treasure that is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.        America has helped lead the world in the conservation of       wildlife and your voice has been so meaningful in this       regard, your example so powerful. Please take this       opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to the natural       world and to future generations and stand with me to protect       the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.        Please vote against oil development in the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge.            Sincerely,                                         Jane Goodall, DBE, PhD,                                Founder--the Jane Goodall Institute,                                           & UN Messenger of Peace.     Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  which manages the refuge, describes it as ``the only conservation  system unit that protects, in an undisturbed condition, a complete  spectrum of the Arctic ecosystems in North America.'' It is home to an  incredible diversity of wildlife--47 different species of mammals,  including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep, moose, musk  ox, and caribou. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge also provides  important habitat for over 40 species of fish and more than 200 species  of migratory birds.   So why would we want to destroy this refuge?   It was first established by the Eisenhower administration. Congress  later protected this amazing Arctic area and its ecosystem in order to  protect the wildlife and protect the habitat because of its incredible  diversity. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is really known as the  ``last great wilderness'' in our country, one of the great, last wild  places, but this legislation turns that on its head.   It would make oil and gas development one of the statutory purposes  of the Wildlife Refuge, and under this legislation, this Refuge would  become the only Refuge where oil and gas development is required by  law. It opens up the entire 1.5 million-acre coastal plain for oil and  gas exploration and requires the leasing of at least 800,000 acres. It  requires the leasing of areas with the highest oil and gas potential,  no matter the consequences for the wildlife or the environment.   The bill requires that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be managed  as a petroleum reserve, which is unprecedented, and it undercuts  managing the Refuge for wildlife.   The bill includes no clear requirements to comply with environmental  laws or to protect wildlife. Its sponsors, however, say that they are  not preempting environmental laws and that, in fact, laws like the  National Environmental Policy Act will ``fully apply.'' Yet this bill  undercuts those assurances of compliance with environmental laws by  adding oil development as a purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge. Adding oil development as a purpose is contrary to the purpose  of a wildlife refuge.   The purpose of a wildlife refuge is to protect wildlife and to make  sure that the managers of wildlife do so in a sound fashion.   At every other wildlife refuge in the country, development within the  refuge is only permitted to the extent that it is compatible with  protecting wildlife. This bill tries to waive one of the most important  management protections that applies to every other national wildlife  refuge--that development must be compatible with protecting wildlife.  They have to do this because they know that oil and gas development in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not compatible. It is just the  opposite.   It is important to note also that this bill does not provide any  energy security. There is no prohibition in the bill against exporting  oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and in all likelihood,  much of the oil will be exported.   In addition to opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to  development, the bill also requires the sale of 7 million barrels of  oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to give $300 million, as I  mentioned earlier, to several States--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,  and Alabama.   So at the same time as we are being told that we must ruin a national  wildlife refuge because we need the oil, we are selling oil out of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It does not make sense for America. It  just doesn't add up.   The impact of oil and gas exploration in the wildlife area and the  danger to our wildlife cannot be overstated. The Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain and nearby waters are designated as  critical habitat for polar bears, which are listed as a threatened  species under the Endangered Species Act. Female polar bears head to  the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain so that they can create snow dens,  where they give birth to their young. The Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge has a higher concentration of polar bear denning habitat than  any other area on Alaska's North Slope.   The refuge is also the summer calving grounds for the porcupine  caribou herd. This herd's range extends into Canada, and we actually  have a treaty between both of our countries to protect this herd. The  almost 200,000-member herd has an annual migration of hundreds of  miles--and in some cases, thousands of miles--wintering in the south of  the Refuge.   I think that this herd of caribou is so important because scientists  say that it has an entirely different kind of migration pattern than  other caribou in Alaska, that it has been adept at dealing with the  adaptation that comes along with climate change.   Why not, instead of ruining their habitat, study and understand this  migration that has been studied since the 1950s? It has been part of  our national investment in understanding wildlife. It has been  supported by both Democratic and Republican administrations, to  understand the science and background of this caribou herd. These  caribou are an important food source for many Alaska Natives but in  particular the Gwich'in people who live south of the Refuge. Wildlife  biologists argue that the risk to the caribou herd and to those who  rely on them could be quite significant.    So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?   The last few years have been a difficult budget situation in Alaska.  Relying on oil for 90 percent of the budget, I agree with many others,  is unsustainable. Every dollar the price of oil per barrel drops,  reduces the State budget by $30 million, or close to 1 percentage point  per dollar. The general revenue fund in Alaska dropped over 80 percent  after 2012, and that situation caused Alaska's $4 billion deficit  projection last year. Difficult choices had to be made about taxes,  savings, spending, and what the State government should do. Thankfully,  their economy hasn't collapsed, but in the last big oil-driven  recession in the 1980s, Alaska's banks failed, housing prices  collapsed, and 15 percent of the population left.   Why am I bringing this up? Because the good news is today's Alaska  economy is more diverse than it was 30 years ago. I know this because I  talk to my colleagues and because we are interacting in a lot of ways  in the Pacific Northwest.   Alaska is well known for its tourism. Two million visitors to Alaska  spend $1,000 per person in the State, supporting a $7.3 billion outdoor  industry. My colleagues here may not realize what my colleagues from  Alaska and Washington know, and that is that the State of Alaska and  Washington have a lot of interdependence. A recent study found that  113,000 jobs in Puget Sound are tied to Alaska's economy, and this  number has doubled in the last 30 years.   What are those jobs? One-quarter of those are in the seafood  industry. Almost 1,000 commercial-vessel owning fishermen who work in  Alaska's fisheries are part of the trade between us. The Alaska trade  accounts for one in five containerized shipments through the Port of  Seattle and the Port of Tacoma. Another 14,000 jobs are tied to  passenger transportation to Alaska, including 430,000 cruise ship  passengers who come through Puget Sound every year. That is just one  way of saying the Washington-Alaska economies are tied  [[Page S8096]]  together, and as a hub for Arctic commerce, I have worked with my  colleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan on issues such as new  Coast Guard Arctic icebreakers that are so needed for the future. I  have supported more funding for demonstration programs for renewable  energy and microgrids in an effort to help the local economy. I feel  the same way about rural broadband across the Nation, and we want to  make sure we are deploying and helping with everything we can to bring  more connectivity to Alaska, but I really question how opening the  Arctic Wildlife Refuge is a solution to these problems.   Even under CBO's aggressive view, if leasing occurs in the Refuge, it  will be many years before Alaskans see any significant revenue. So my  colleagues should be aware that doubling down on oil by sacrificing one  of the great wildlife refuges will not, in my opinion, help close  Alaska's budget deficit, and it will not help them diversify for the  future.   This Arctic Wildlife Refuge is too special, too important. It is one  of the crown jewels of our National Wildlife Refuge system. We should  be preserving it. We should not be destroying it. We should not be  turning it into an oilfield.   I am reminded that many people over many decades have fought for this  great area of our country, to maintain its environmental stewardship,  starting with Olaus Murie, who went there and did great explorations  and convinced many people here in this Washington that it was something  so special and worth preserving.   After decades of his scientific exploration in Alaska, Olaus  testified in 1959 in support of creating the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. He  said: ``We long for something more, something that has a mental, a  spiritual impact on us. This idealism, more than anything else, will  set us apart as a nation striving for something worthwhile in the  universe.''   So what is setting us apart today? Some very short-term gains. In 100  years, when this economic tax bill will long be forgotten, the question  will be whether something important in the universe still exists in the  Arctic wildlife area. We didn't create the Arctic Coastal Plain, but I  can state this: We cannot recreate it. What we are doing today is  taking a step toward destroying it.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this reconciliation bill. Do not  sacrifice the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil development. Don't take one  of the great, wild, pristine places on this planet and turn it into an  oilfield. We can do better as a nation. I know we can do better as a  region, and we can do better with a better Arctic strategy for our  Nation's future.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Madam President, I wish to call attention to several  urgent and bipartisan health programs that Congress must renew without  further delay.   The Republican majority has spent much of this year trying to pass  partisan healthcare and tax legislation. As a result, they have  neglected to extend numerous uncontroversial healthcare programs,  threatening these programs' very existence and causing needless chaos  and uncertainty.   It is past time that the Republican-controlled Congress extend these  programs to provide healthcare access and certainty to millions of  Americans.   First, I would like to address the Children's Health Insurance  Program, CHIP. CHIP is a bipartisan healthcare success story. Enacted  20 years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senate Finance Committee  Chairman Orrin Hatch and the late Senator Ted Kennedy, CHIP brings  affordable health coverage to children in families who are not eligible  for Medicaid but struggle to afford private insurance.   Washington's successful CHIP program, Apple Health for Kids, covers  about 60,000 children. Through CHIP, parents get peace of mind, and  States and the Federal Government pitch in to share the cost.   CHIP means affordable healthcare for 9 million children. On average,  a family of four pays $158 per year in premiums and deductibles for  each CHIP-enrolled child. The same family would likely pay more than  $1,000 in annual out-of-pocket costs on a commercial insurance plan,  even after counting available financial help. That is a difference of  more than $800 per year for millions of families across the country and  represents real affordability.   Because of CHIP, children have a medical home. In fact, more than 90  percent of Washington children with CHIP coverage visited a primary  care  [[Page S8146]]  provider at least once in 2014, the most recent year in which data were  available. CHIP also provides kids with benefits that are often more  comprehensive than those offered in the commercial insurance market,  including immunizations, periodic screenings, hearing exams, and dental  care. We know that prevention and early detection are key to reducing  the burden of disease and health costs. CHIP emphasizes these early  interventions during the critical early years of a child's life,  helping kids grow up to be healthy, productive, and successful adults.   Yet, despite CHIP's near-universal popularity and lack of partisan  controversy, this Congress has allowed CHIP to go unfunded since  October 1, 2017. This long and unprecedented lapse threatens CHIP's  very survival. Already, it has thrown States, including Washington,  into crippling uncertainty and administrative disruption. Some States  have been forced to send letters to CHIP families informing them that  their coverage will end. Moreover, if Congress fails to extend CHIP, my  State will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars to make  up for Congress's failure to act.   Next, I would like to highlight the urgent need to reauthorize  funding to community health centers.   Community health centers are a bedrock of the healthcare safety net  and are the preferred medical home for tens of millions of working  Americans. Washington's 26 community health centers serve 1 million  people in every corner of my State, from Spokane to Seattle, Omak to  Port Angeles.   Community health centers are a lean and efficient healthcare delivery  model, focusing on primary care, prevention, case management and social  services for their patients. They are also good for the economy,  supporting more than 9,000 jobs and $1 billion in annual economic  output in my State alone.   The Community Health Center Fund, which comprises the majority of  these health centers' Federal funds, expired on October 1, 2017. As a  result, community health centers in my State are at risk of having to  turn off the lights and turn away patients. Already, the expiration of  the Community Health Center Fund has threatened these centers' ability  to retain and hire nurses and doctors and make financial arrangements  for the coming year.   The Community Health Center Fund was enacted in 2010 so that millions  of newly covered Americans would have a medical home. The fund is doing  just that. Moreover, the Community Health Center Fund was extended with  strong bipartisan support in 2015, when an overwhelming majority of the  House and Senate, myself included, supported its extension as part of  the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act, MACRA. It is past time for  Congress to extend this program without delay.   In addition, Federal funds have been allowed to expire for a number  of additional but equally important health programs. All enjoy a  history of strong bipartisan support. These programs include the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, the  Special Diabetes Program, the Teaching Health Center Program, and  certain Medicare provisions.   The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting--MIECHV-- Program is an evidence-based grant that is helping States and Tribes  improve early childhood and maternal health. MIECHV-funded home  visiting programs, which are voluntary, have benefited 1,650 Washington  families in 15 counties and have reduced in half the likelihood of  child abuse and neglect. MIECHV is a prime example of evidence-driven  policymaking that is improving the health and well-being of vulnerable  mothers and children. It is also strongly bipartisan. Unfortunately,  MIECHV's Federal funding expired on October 1, 2017.   The Special Diabetes Program and the Special Diabetes Program for  Indians are modest investments with a proven track record of combatting  diabetes. As a senior member of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I recognize  that diabetes is a leading cause of death and a major driver of  healthcare costs. In particular, the Special Diabetes Program for  Indians supports 27 community-driven grant programs in Washington's  Tribal communities, helping Tribal members prevent, diagnose, and  manage this condition through lifestyle changes, counseling, and  treatment.   The Teaching Health Center Program is also a small investment with a  big return. Teaching Health Center funds are currently being used to  train 722 primary care medical residents in 27 States and the District  of Columbia. Data show that many physicians eventually practice close  to where they train, and the Teaching Health Center Program is training  physicians where they are needed most. In Spokane, Toppenish, Tacoma,  Yakima, and Auburn, Teaching Health Centers are training a new  generation of safety-net physicians to serve those most in need. While  the Teaching Health Center Program has received a short-term extension,  its funding will expire on January 1, 2018, if Congress does not act.   Lastly, several temporary Medicare provisions have expired and must  be renewed. These provisions help rural Medicare patients get hospital,  ambulance, and home health services where they live. Additional  Medicare ``extenders'' prevent essential services like physical therapy  from being arbitrarily capped for Medicare patients. Extending these  provisions is important to preserving healthcare access in rural  Washington State and empowering our healthcare delivery system to  continue to improve and innovate.   The programs I have highlighted and many more are vital to my  constituents, my State's economy, and our healthcare delivery system.  They are also strongly bipartisan. I call on my Republican colleagues  to work with us in a good-faith negotiation to extend these programs  immediately.                            ____________________
