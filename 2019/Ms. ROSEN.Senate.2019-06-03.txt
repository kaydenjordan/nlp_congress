 Mr. President, today it is with tremendous pride  that I recognize a great Nevadan, State Senator David Parks.   Senator Parks arrived in Nevada to serve as an airman in the U.S. Air  Force. He served our country with honor from 1967-1971 and was  stationed at Nevada's own Nellis Air Force Base. After receiving his  master of business administration from the University of Nevada, Las  Vegas, he used his business expertise to work on behalf of the southern  Nevada community he loved dearly. Among his various public service  positions, Parks served as chairman of the Paradise Town Advisory  Board, the director of the Office of Budget and Management for the city  of Las Vegas, and the assistant director of the Regional Transportation  Commission of southern Nevada.   David Parks first brought his extensive experience in local  government to the Nevada Legislature when he was elected to the Nevada  Assembly in 1997. He served the assembly with honor and integrity as  the assistant majority whip and then later as the assistant majority  floor leader. In 2008, Parks' community elected him to the Nevada State  Senate, representing Whitney and parts of Paradise, Henderson, and  Sunrise Manor. He was subsequently reelected in 2012 and again in 2016.   In his 22 years of legislative experience and life of public service,  Senator Parks has remained a steadfast champion for the LGBTQ community  by ensuring equal rights and protections for LGBTQ individuals  throughout the State and serving for many years on the Governor's  Statewide AIDS Advisory Task Force. Nevada's progressive leadership on  many issues that affect LGBTQ Nevadans is a direct result of the  senator's advocacy and persistence. During his tenure in the  legislature, he has been the State's leader on pursuing LGBTQ equality,  leading efforts to institute civil unions in Nevada, ban discrimination  based on gender identity or expression, and address bullying and cyber- bullying in Nevada's schools, among many other critical reforms.   We honor David Parks today as he concludes his final legislative  session in the Nevada State Senate and leaves behind a legacy of  progressive change and a deep commitment to public service.                            ____________________
