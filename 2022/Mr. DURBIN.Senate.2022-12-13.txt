 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Dana Douglas to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.   Born and raised in New Orleans, Judge Douglas' passion for the law  and public service was inspired by her family's background in law  enforcement. In particular, her mother, Ms. Ida Woodfork, served in the  Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office for 30 years, and her uncle, Mr. Warren  Woodfork, Sr., was the first Black superintendent of the New Orleans  Police Department.   Judge Douglas earned her B.A. in social work and Black world studies  at Miami University and received her J.D. from Loyola University School  of Law. From there, she clerked for Judge Ivan L.R. Lemelle on the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.   Judge Douglas then spent 18 years litigating, trying four cases to  verdict or judgment and handling several administrative matters before  State agencies. Although she worked in private practice, she also  served the community for 9 years as a commissioner and then vice  president of the New Orleans Civil Service Commission, a quasi-judicial  body regulating the city's civil service.   Since 2019, Judge Douglas has served as a magistrate judge for the  Eastern District of Louisiana. In that time, she has authored 111  reports and recommendations, all of which have been adopted in whole or  in part by the district court.   Judge Douglas enjoys the strong support of Senators Kennedy and  Cassidy, and the American Bar Association unanimously rated her as  ``qualified'' to serve on the Fifth Circuit.   If confirmed, Judge Douglas will be the first woman of color to serve  on the Fifth Circuit.   Judge Douglas' experience, qualifications, and temperament will be  assets on the Fifth Circuit, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting her nomination.                          Vote on Douglas Nomination     I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are  necessarily absent.
