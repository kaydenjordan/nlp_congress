 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the remarkable  career and legacy of Justice Shirley Abrahamson as she retires from the  Wisconsin Supreme Court. Justice Abrahamson has a long and  distinguished career upholding the law on Wisconsin's highest court.  Her unparalleled commitment to justice has promoted a fair and  impartial judicial system while greatly contributing to the promotion  of equal rights in Wisconsin.   Justice Abraham's exceptional career had modest beginnings in New  York City. Her parents were Polish immigrants who started a grocery  store in Manhattan. Her passion for the law started at the tender age  of 6, when she decided she wanted to become a lawyer. She was a  dedicated student, earning honors in high school and college.   Justice Abrahamson graduated magna cum laude with bachelor's degree  from New York University in 1953. She earned a law degree with high  distinction from Indiana University in 1956 and a doctor of law in  American legal history from the University of Wisconsin Law School in  1962. Before her appointment to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice  Abrahamson practiced law in the private sector for 14 years and was a  distinguished professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School.   In 1976, Shirley Abrahamson broke the glass ceiling in Wisconsin's  judicial system by becoming the first female justice on the Wisconsin  Supreme Court. She again made history in 1996 when she became the first  woman to serve as chief justice. After winning four elections and  serving a total of 42 years, Justice Abrahamson is now the longest  serving supreme court justice in State history.   Though her career is punctuated by countless achievements and  distinctions, Justice Abrahamson's path to success was anything but  easy. Despite a multitude of academic distinctions and an unprecedented  affinity for the law, Justice Abrahamson was met with a demoralizing  wave of sexism when she entered the legal profession in the 1950s. The  dean of the Indiana University Law School traditionally placed the top  student from each graduating class at the largest law firm in  Indianapolis; yet after graduating first in her class from the  university in 1956, the dean told Justice Abrahamson he could  [[Page S3100]]  not place her at the firm because they just were not going to hire a  woman. Rather than feeling disheartened, Justice Abrahamson informed  the dean that she didn't want to go to Indianapolis, so the slight was  fine with her.   This type of discrimination was not an anomaly. Justice Abrahamson  was denied jobs, clients, and even social club memberships on the basis  of her gender. Undaunted by this prejudice, Justice Abrahamson took a  stand against gender inequality and refused to back down from those who  stood in the way of a woman's path to success in the legal field. Her  greatest legacy is the trail she blazed for countless young women, who  can see themselves in a courtroom or on a judicial bench because of the  barriers she fearlessly broke through. She will go down in history as  one of Wisconsin's most influential and powerful women, and she used  every bit of that influence and power in the pursuit of justice for all  Wisconsinites.   Justice Abrahamson is a true American hero. From her incomparable  tenure on the Wisconsin Supreme Court to her efforts as a pioneer for  gender equality, Justice Abrahamson has lived a life devoted to service  and justice for all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the exceptional  career and legacy of Madison, WI's longest serving Mayor, Paul Soglin.  Mayor Soglin spent his many years in office as driving force behind  Madison's extraordinary economic success and high quality of life.   Paul Soglin was raised in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago,  where he excelled academically at Highland Park High School. He  graduated with honors from University of Wisconsin--Madison in 1966 and  from the UW-Madison Law School in 1972.   Soglin gained national notoriety on campus as an activist for social  and political change. He frequently protested American military  involvement in the Vietnam war and demonstrated against Dow Chemical  Company for its role in manufacturing napalm and Agent Orange for use  in Vietnam. Beaten by police during the protests, Soglin became a  respected voice on campus. During this trying time in our Nation's  past, Soglin demonstrated his enduring commitment to peace and civil  rights.   Soglin won election to the Madison City Council in 1968, representing  the city's student wards. Four years later, he accomplished one of the  biggest upsets in Madison history by defeating two-term incumbent  William Dyke, becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history. During  his first term as mayor, he established Madison's Civic Center to  showcase the city's growing arts scene. He made tremendous improvements  to the city's public transit system and transformed State Street into  an iconic pedestrian mall, one of Madison's defining landmarks.   After leaving public office to teach at Harvard in 1979, Soglin  returned to Madison to practice law and was twice reelected to lead  Wisconsin's capital city. In all, he served as Madison's 51st, 54th,  and 57th mayor. During his second stint as mayor, Soglin accomplished  one of his crowning achievements, breaking through a 70-year debate to  build the Monona Terrace Convention Center that Frank Lloyd Wright  designed for Madison's Lake Monona's shoreline. He is also credited  with invigorating Madison's economy and rebuilding its declining  downtown.   Through his more than two decades of investment in infrastructure,  the arts, and recreation, Paul Soglin has helped build a welcoming and  flourishing city that appears often on lists of the Nation's most  livable cities. Throughout this growth, he has also fought to ensure  that Madison's resources and assets are available to all city  residents, regardless of their economic standing.   In addition to Paul Soglin's remarkable public service, I feel  fortunate to know him as a lifelong family friend. From my earliest  memories of Paul teaching me how to throw a Frisbee to his generous  moving reflections at my mother's memorial service, Paul Soglin has  provided me with encouragement and inspiration.   As he begins his next chapter after 22 years of service, he leaves  with the knowledge that he has left an indelible mark on the city he  loves and that his legacy will endure.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 102nd  anniversary of Emmanuel Baptist Church in Beloit, WI. Emmanuel Baptist  Church was established on April 15, 1917, and has been a pillar of the  community for the last 102 years.   The church was founded during the peak of the Great Northward  Migration, when more than 6 million African Americans migrated from the  rural South to the industrial cities of the North and Midwest. Many  northern manufacturing plants sought African-American migrants from the  South to help replace white workers fighting in World War I. Beloit  became a favored destination for many migrants thanks in part to a  young African-American named John McCord from Pontotoc, MS, who helped  the Fairbanks Morse manufacturing company in Beloit recruit Black labor  from the southern town.   African Americans were eager to escape the Jim Crow laws of the South  and seek an improved quality of life for their families. As they  settled in an unfamiliar part of the country, they sought solace in  their faith and established the Second Emmanuel Baptist Church, now  Emmanuel Baptist Church. The church held its first service at Kent Hall  on State Street on April 15, 1917, for a small group of African  Americans, all of whom worked at Fairbanks Morse. As their families  grew and the Great Migration continued, the once small church quickly  grew to a congregation of 100 by 1920. On June 3, 1927, formal  incorporation papers were filed with the Rock County Registrar.   The first church at the current location was built in 1924 for  $5,500. The edifice of the present church was built in 1960 after the  first building was destroyed by fire in 1958. Today, Emmanuel Baptist  church proudly offers worship and educational programs for its members  and provides community outreach programs through its Family Life  Center. Two of its most successful endeavors, a food pantry and a free  hot lunch program, began under the leadership of the late Rev. Dr.  Floyd Prude, Jr., who served as senior pastor for 36 years, the longest  in the church's history.   Now, 102 years after its founding, Emmanuel Baptist Church provides a  spiritual refuge for its 350 members under the steady hand of Minister  Rodney Hayes. It stands as a beacon of hope that has withstood the  devastating impacts of racism and persecution. Under the devoted  guidance of its spiritual leaders, may it continue to be a shining  asset to the community for the next 102 years.                            ____________________
