 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sheriff  Deputy Ryan Phillip Hendrix, 34, of Hendersonville who passed away on  Thursday, September 10, 2020, while in the line of duty. He was born  December 9, 1985, in Asheville, North Carolina to his parents Donald L.  and Heidi J. Hendrix. Ryan was a devoted Christian and attended Grace  Blue Ridge Church with Pastor Chas Morris.   Shortly after graduating from Hendersonville Christian School in  2004, Ryan enlisted with the U.S. Marine Corps and graduated as a lance  corporal marine in 2005. He was in the Marine Reserves for 5 years and  volunteered to serve a tour of duty in Iraq in 2006. Ryan began his  career with the Henderson County Sheriff's Office as a detention  officer in June 2012. In May 2015, he completed basic law enforcement  training and became a patrol deputy and later a field training officer.  [[Page S5703]]  He was an active member of the Henderson County Sheriff's Office SWAT  team and was assigned as a patrol detective to Charlie Squad.   Ryan excelled in sports, especially baseball and soccer, and enjoyed  fishing, hunting, biking, kayaking, and camping. Ryan's children,  Elloree and Merritt, were the love of his life and always his greatest  priority. He spent all of his free time with them and continually  involved them in outdoor activities. He enjoyed teaching them how to  raise animals and spending time with their extended family of  grandparents, aunts and uncles, and many cousins.   Ryan had a keen instinct and could see things most couldn't. He was  swift to action and was very intuitive while possessing a magnanimous  heart. He would choose not to fight with a fool, but rather help them  to find a better way. Ryan loved to bring humor to every situation, and  even during the roughest times, you would always see a smile on his  face.   Ryan tragically lost his life during the early morning hours of  September 10, 2020, while in the line of duty. As the world slept, Ryan  responded to assist a family in need of help when they became innocent  victims of a violent encounter.   We all know the tragic outcome, but Ryan refused to let the story end  there. While his death will leave a giant void in the hearts of those  who love him, he continues to exemplify a servant's heart even in  passing. Ryan was also an organ donor and will continue helping  strangers for a lifetime, even after making the ultimate sacrifice. He  was doing the job he was born to do and died doing the job he loved.   As the U.S. Senator from North Carolina, I am forever grateful for  Ryan's service to our State and Nation. He gave his life protecting his  fellow citizens, and we will never forget the sacrifice he made.                            ____________________
