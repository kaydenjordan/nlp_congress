 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  CHIPS and Science Act.  [[Page H7381]]    Semiconductor chips help power nearly every sector of our economy,  and I have witnessed firsthand how the global chip shortage has led to  idle plants and layoffs and continues to hurt the auto industry, union  workers, and our Nation's competitiveness by the hour.   The reality is that we need to make more chips, and we need to make  them in America. We are at an inflection point where we can and must  cement U.S. leadership and keep America at the forefront of innovation  and technology.   The CHIPS and Science Act will support long-term investment in  domestic semiconductor manufacturing, including $2 billion for mature- node semiconductor chips that are critical for the automotive industry,  advance research and development, and create good-paying American jobs.  These provisions will assist in revitalizing our States' economies that  have been constrained by supply chain vulnerabilities, reducing  production and driving up prices.   This isn't just a manufacturing jobs issue, but it is also of vital  importance to our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1400
