 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would say to my friend from Virginia,  we both serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and of course we  have both been intimately involved in the investigation on Russia's  activities up to and including the 2016 election.   I would like to point out the hypocrisy of our colleagues across the  aisle who refused to take up any legislation whatsoever, such as S. 1,  which is on the floor and which would take extraordinarily positive  measures to protect our most important allies in the Middle East,  including Israel and Jordan. They filibustered that bill and said: We  are not going to take up any legislation until the government is back  open--100 percent of it.   For the past 2 weeks, the minority leader has paralyzed the work of  the Senate, saying they would block the Senate from considering any  legislation unrelated to government funding. A number of our colleagues  have said--for example, the junior Senator from Virginia said: ``The  Senate should vote on nothing else until we vote to reopen the  government. Period.'' Senator Merkley said: ``The Senate's schedule  cannot be business as usual if we shut down a quarter of the government  and just leave it shut down.'' Senator Booker said that Senate  Democrats should block consideration of all unrelated bills.   All this comes as a result of the fact that the impetus is on the  Democrats to come forward and negotiate a resolution of the shutdown in  good faith. But to this point, the Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, and the  minority leader, Senator Schumer, have simply refused to negotiate with  the President.   I was with the President down in Texas, down along the border, on  Thursday. He is willing to negotiate. We know we had broad bipartisan  support for the Secure Fence Act, for example, in 2006, authorizing up  to 800 miles of fencing on the southern border. The Democratic leader  voted for that, and so did Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Later, in  2014, all Democrats voted for $40 billion in border security, including  barriers, fencing, and tactical infrastructure along the border. Now  they are saying, as the Speaker has said, that somehow this is  ``immoral.'' Well, this is hypocrisy at its worst.                          Nomination of William Barr    Madam President, on another matter, today the Senate Judiciary  Committee is holding a hearing on the nomination of William Barr to be  Attorney General of the United States. Mr. Barr is uniquely qualified  for this position in large part because he held the job before. As a  matter of fact, 27 years ago, he was nominated by George Herbert Walker  Bush to be Attorney General of the United States. He was confirmed by a  unanimous voice vote in the Senate. It received little fanfare at the  time because it wasn't particularly controversial--nothing like the  contentious, partisan confirmation battles we have seen the last 2  years. There wasn't an attempt--at least so far, and I am keeping my  fingers crossed--to assassinate Mr. Barr's character or try to decipher  the notes in his high school yearbook like we saw in the Kavanaugh  confirmation hearing. Instead, so far, and to the committee's credit,  we have focused on his qualifications.   He is clearly smart, articulate, and able. He has a clear  understanding of what the role of the Attorney General is and, more  importantly, what it is not. An Attorney General should not be a  politician. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General has the very  difficult job of trying to balance his responsibilities as the chief  law enforcement officer in the country enforcing the rule of law along  with the fact that he is a political appointee of the President's. To  me, that is one of the most difficult positions in the Cabinet to hold.  But Mr. Barr has done it before, and I think he can do it again. He, of  course, has great institutional knowledge about the Department of  Justice.   In addition to Attorney General, he held the job of Assistant  Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel and Deputy Attorney  General before he was promoted to the top job   Back in 1992, when Mr. Barr was confirmed, then-chairman of the  Senate Judiciary, Joe Biden--President Obama's Vice President--said he  would be a fine Attorney General.   This morning, I heard Mr. Barr discuss the qualities that undoubtedly  led Senators on both sides of the aisle to support his confirmation. He  spoke of the importance of acting with professionalism and integrity.  As a matter of fact, he said that at 68 years old, he basically had  decided to semi-retire, only to answer the call by the President to  return to public service. He said: I am completely independent. I will  make the hard decisions. I will make the right decisions. I will help  restore the reputation of the Department of Justice and the FBI to an  apolitical, a nonpolitical department, which is exactly what we need.   He wants to make sure that the character and reputation of the  Department of Justice is enhanced and restored and then maintained, and  then it could withstand even the most trying political times, including  those in which we presently live.   He spoke of serving with independence, providing no promises or  assurances to anyone or anything, other than to faithfully execute and  administer the laws of the United States of America.   It is clear to me that he maintains the same views he held 27 years  ago. I share his view that the Department of Justice should function  outside of the highly politicalized times we live in. The fair and  impartial administration of justice is the highest obligation and duty  of this position.   I believe Mr. Barr is an outstanding nominee and, once confirmed,  will be an outstanding Attorney General. I look forward to voting yes  on his nomination.                              Government Funding    Madam President, on the matter of the government shutdown--the 25  percent of the government that is presently not funded--last week, I  traveled with the President, along with my colleague Senator Cruz, to  the Rio Grande Valley, to McAllen, TX.   After the President held his roundtable, where he saw heroin,  methamphetamine, and weapons, and heard about the human trafficking,  including sex slavery involving children and girls and women, after  that presentation--after the President left, Senator Cruz and I sat  down with a number of our constituents--county judges, mayors, law  enforcement officers, as well as the folks from Border Patrol and  Customs and Border Protection. They understand the border better than  anybody because they live there. They are deeply concerned about the  posturing in Washington and how the political arguments seem to  overcome logic and listening to the experts when it comes to border  security. I was glad for them to confirm once again what they  previously told me: that we need to strengthen those border communities  [[Page S194]]  and keep our country safe, while keeping legitimate trade and commerce  flowing across the border.   During our discussion, Scott Luck, Deputy Chief of the Border Patrol,  talked about the positive impact of physical barriers and what positive  impact they have at targeted locations along the southern border. He  said:         The physical barrier has worked every place I have been. I       have been in places where they did not have it; they put it       in and it worked.    He mentioned Douglas, AZ, as one of those. He said:         There were more people coming into the country there than       any other place in the country. I was there. It stopped. It       stopped in California. It stopped in Yuma. It stopped in El       Paso. It will stop wherever we put it.    Despite what our colleagues across the aisle are saying, physical  barriers at the border can be effective when coupled with technology  and personnel. It doesn't do you much good to have a physical barrier  that somebody can go over or around or through and you don't have a  Border Patrol agent there to detain them.   Actually, the physical border is the last place you are going to stop  people trying to illegally enter into the United States, together with  the narcotics and the human trafficking, but it is important to have  those tools available to the Border Patrol, and that is what Deputy  Chief Luck was stressing. He made the comments and observation that  physical barriers alone are not the solution for the entire border--a  holistic border security approach also requires technology and  personnel.   When we were discussing the need for building physical barriers in  strategic locations, my friend, Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino,  said something to Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd that I  think encapsulates the whole debate. He was talking to the Border  Patrol and CBP and said:         If you tell us where you need it, I think we are all on       board. If the politicians tell us where we need it, I think       that is where we have our concern.    In other words, what Judge Trevino was saying was, let's listen to  the experts, the people who know how to use the right combination of  technology, tactical infrastructure, and personnel at each given place  along the border because it makes no sense to try to treat this like a  one-size-fits-all. Anybody who has ever been to the border between the  United States and Mexico knows that the geography and topography vary  tremendously from place to place.   Let's not try to dictate from Washington, DC, where every dollar goes  and in so doing try to micromanage the Border Patrol and Customs and  Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security. Let's leave  that to the experts--the men and women who work to protect and secure  our border every day.   What we continue to hear and what I continue to advocate is for a  layered approach--barriers where they are appropriate, technology, and  personnel. That is exactly what we have been talking about. That is  what we voted for in 2006 with the Secure Fence Act. The Democrats  supported that, along with Republicans. That is what law enforcement  officers tell us they need to operate optimally. Unfortunately, it is  what Democrats are now refusing to negotiate and provide.   When looking at the border, it is not just physical security we need  to be concerned about; we need to be concerned about our economic  security as well.   During our discussions last week with local stakeholders, we also  focused on the importance of facilitating legitimate trade and travel  at our ports of entry. I was shocked by this figure, but the Customs  and Border Protection Officer there, Mr. Higgerson, mentioned that the  trade from Texas ports alone is valued at $300 billion per year. For  the State of Texas and border communities in particular, these ports  fuel our economy, and we need to provide additional funding to ensure  efficient movement across the border.   One thing we all agree on is that most of the high-end drugs--the  heroin, the methamphetamine, and the fentanyl--come through the ports  of entry. So let's modernize those. Let's provide the technology that  is needed in order to stop the flow of that poison into the United  States. Legitimate trade and commerce is the lifeblood not only of our  border region in my State, it is also the lifeblood of our Nation's  economy. There are 5 million Americans whose jobs depend on binational  trade with Mexico alone.   Along with a number of my colleagues from Texas, we are sending a  bipartisan letter to President Trump that thanks him for his continued  work to secure our southern border. His advocacy for that layered  approach, as well as for port of entry improvements, is vital to my  State. In that letter, we also address recent rumors to the effect that  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' funds might be used for border  security purposes, and I have urged the President not to take that  route. While I will continue to advocate for additional border  security, I believe those funds were intended to support disaster  relief and should be used for that purpose. We need both border  security and to lend a helping hand to those who are still recovering  from natural disasters. We don't have to rob from Peter to pay Paul. We  need to do both.   I am grateful for the support that has been shown from the President  to the people of Texas both in the days following Hurricane Harvey's  landfall and in the nearly year and a half since, and I hope he will  continue to work with all of my Texas colleagues and me as we rebuild  our communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey and as we work together to  secure our border.    I yield.    Madam President, if I could respond to my friend, the  Senator from Delaware, he speaks correctly--accurately--about some of  the symptoms and, I think, some of the cures that we need to put in  place to deal with this extraordinarily complex problem. We would love  to continue to work with him on coming up with something. We may not  want to call it ``Plan Mexico'' but ``Plan Americas'' because what we  really have to deal with is a regional challenge.  [[Page S195]]    He is exactly right in that most of the illegal immigration now is  coming from Central America. Gaps in our immigration and human  trafficking laws encourage unaccompanied children and family units to  come up to the border because they can, essentially, get placed in the  United States while they wait for their asylum claims to be determined  by a court, and there is a backlog of 700,000 or 800,000 asylum claims.  In other words, the criminal organizations that move people for money  into the United States have cracked the code and have figured out how  to be successful in placing people in the United States.   Unfortunately, it also helps to enrich those organizations that move  the poison from south of the border into the United States. They  contributed to the deaths of some 70,000 Americans last year alone. I  am thinking particularly about the fentanyl, along with the heroin,  going from China to Mexico and up across the border. Of that consumed  in the United States, 90 percent of it comes from Mexico. I agree that  it is the demand here in the United States that enriches the cartels,  but they are, more or less, commodity agnostic. In other words, they  will do anything that makes them money, these criminal organizations.   We need to have people sit down and work together, and I pledge to  work with my colleague to try to do that. Yet we can't get a solution  as long as the Speaker of the House calls physical infrastructure or  barriers immoral. This is kind of a nonstarter to a conversation that  we need to have to try to negotiate our way out of this shutdown.   I welcome working with my friend.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
