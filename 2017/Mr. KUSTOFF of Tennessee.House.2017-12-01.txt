 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2017, legislation of  which I am proud to be an original cosponsor.   In west Tennessee, where I am from, and in other rural areas across  the country, there is no doubt that manufactured housing is a critical  and affordable option for many families. In fact, more than 8\1/2\  million families--that is roughly 22 million Americans--have chosen  this option because of the affordability and the value. Where I am  from, one out of ten west Tennesseans has chosen manufactured housing  as the best option to make their home.    For this reason, our legislation is essential to protecting consumer  choices and financing options for those seeking to buy a manufactured  home, while also leaving in place important consumer protections.   In fact, close to 60 percent of new manufactured homes sell for less  than $70,000, and are usually available at lower monthly payments than  what it  [[Page H9583]]  costs to rent. Manufactured homes are offered as a fixed rate, fixed  term option.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, which will allow many Americans seeking the American Dream  of owning a home to continue to have access to affordable manufactured  housing.
