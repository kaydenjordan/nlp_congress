 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Active Shooter  Alert Act of 2022.   This legislation recognizes the need to protect the public during  active shooter situations while our country experiences an  unconscionable epidemic of mass shootings.   This legislation would establish a voluntary public safety alert  system for use by law enforcement to notify individuals of active  shooter situations occurring within their communities. It would also  appoint an Active Shooter Alert Coordinator at the Department of  Justice who would direct Federal training, technical support, and best  practices efforts across the country.   Additionally, this legislation would establish an Advisory Panel to  coordinate with FEMA, the Department of Transportation, and the FCC.  The panel would develop guidance on how alerts should be sent, how they  should be designed, and what language should be used.  [[Page S5056]]    Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities. The tragedies in  Highland Park, Memphis, and Uvalde are reminders that we have to  address the pressing issues surrounding mass shootings.   The House has already passed this bill with strong bipartisan support  from 43 Republicans who recognized that political affiliation should  never jeopardize our obligation to protect Americans from harm.   Public safety is paramount, and our country's law enforcement  officers, first responders, and healthcare providers deserve every tool  available as they carry out their work.   This bill is an important step to strengthen our public safety  infrastructure, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to  pass the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022 as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Active Shooter  Alert Act of 2022.
