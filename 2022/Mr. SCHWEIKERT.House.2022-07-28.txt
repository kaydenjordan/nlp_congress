 Madam Speaker, I have got to tell you, being on the  Ways and Means Committee and never actually engaging in some of your  Rules debate, you guys are really polite with each other.   But here's a simple question: What are the two times in life you  think you know everything?   When you turn 13 years old and the day after you get elected to  Congress.   I am going to argue the arrogance of this place right now doing a  piece of legislation like this. Why is this bill, the underlying bill,  the underlying rule here so dangerous? And why this resolution actually  fits this.   Basically, the underlying bill is industrial policy. Let's face it,  some of the scoring is saying this is $400 billion, and it is the  politicization functionally of a category of incredibly important  industry, grants that you saw the President a couple days ago talk  about--now you are going to have to come in front of me.   Do you understand how dangerous that is for an economy? That  arrogance of the political class thinking you understand what the next  disruption is. The controlling of intellect, the controlling of taking  risk.   If you actually gave a darn about American competitiveness, of where  chips--and who knows, quantum, and all the other possibilities of data  management, data movement, of processing--are going, you would fix the  Tax Code, you would fix the regulatory code.   If you care about China, deal with the made-in-America tax, the fact  that they refund the VAT; and when we export, they put the VAT back on,  and it makes us not competitive.   You also now have to deal with the reality, when The Economist is  writing articles that we are heading toward a glut of chips. Look, I am  from Arizona. On the side of my district, I have a $16 billion  investment from Taiwan Semiconductor. Down the street I have Intel, I  think they are spending $18 billion. It is coming.   But the brain trust around here is we are going to do industrial  policy. We are going to control the money. It will be great for fund- raising. And the concept, once again, is we have politicized  everything. Think of now the debate we have had the last couple days,  is two quarters of negative GDP, well, that is not a recession. Okay,  technically it might not be because the definition of recession now is  a committee that is politicized.   Could we at least have some benchmarks here in Congress, here in  Washington that we know what the rules are? I don't mean your type of  rules. I mean the rules for society, the rules for tax policy, the  rules for how we allocate capital, because you are offering right now  functionally $400 billion of subsidies, controls, management, and  industrial policy, government.   Why don't you just nationalize the chip industry because you are  pretty much heading that direction.   This is a simple amendment. In some ways, it is actually very  symbolic of we can't even agree anymore on what a recession is.   Okay, fine. Let's just make it a rule instead of making it a  committee of individuals that get to express their opinion and their  feelings.   I would love to actually offer something more complex. Maybe we  should go back to the old misery index debates of how many people can't  afford living anymore. You do realize the inflation from just the last  12 months, my constituents--I represent the highest inflation in the  Nation--get to work about 6 weeks without compensation. The purchasing  power of their lives has crashed so much, they now work a month-and-a- half for free.                                time  1130    These are the brilliant policies this place has brought. It is time  we actually start to set some benchmarks on what the rules are.   Simple amendment. Just saying, hey, we will call it a recession when  we have two consecutive quarters, and we can stop the politicization of  everything here in Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 4270, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Reed of New York, for the  purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.
