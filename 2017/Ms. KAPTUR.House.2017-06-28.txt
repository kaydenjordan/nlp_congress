 Mr. Speaker, today, Vice President Pence is expected to  visit northeast Ohio for an appearance at a manufacturing firm. He will  discuss the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and subsequently  rip away healthcare for millions upon millions of Americans, as well as  quadruple its cost to millions and millions more elderly.   Ohioans should know that the bill the GOP is trying to ramrod through  Congress would threaten nearly 1 million Ohioans who gained coverage  over the last few years through the Affordable Care Act. Further,  seniors would see their insurance premiums rise by four to five times  as much, with nothing being done to lower their cost of medicine.   Why is this administration making things worse for Ohio?   We need to maintain Medicaid for the treatment of those Americans who  are sick, suffering, in nursing homes, those who are mentally ill, and  those who are suffering from terminal illness. The Pence-Trump doctrine  will hurt them all.   I hope the Vice President won't mislead our people about how many  Ohioans will lose coverage.   In fact, is the Vice President aware healthcare jobs help drive our  economy in Ohio. The TrumpCare bill, which is really a tax break for  millionaires, will cause an Ohio job loss of over 80,000 healthcare  workers over the next 5 years.   I urge the Vice President to meet with officials at Cleveland Clinic,  MetroHealth, or the Sisters of Charity and hear what they have to say  about the GOP's anti-life bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as NAFTA renegotiation approaches, I rise to  call attention to the mammoth U.S. trade deficit with our NAFTA nation  partners.   Our current deficit with NAFTA nations is $74 billion. This red on  the chart translates into tens of thousands of lost U.S. jobs, all  while wages are depressed for North America's struggling workers. Since  NAFTA's passage, there hasn't been a single year of trade balance for  this country. That translates into lost jobs.   Thus far, President Trump has failed to correct these trade deficits.  In fact, the trade deficit this year has ballooned to more than $22  billion from the same period in 2016.   Balanced trade accounts in 5 years should be first on our agenda. My  bill, the Balancing Trade Act, H.R. 2766, requires the administration  to address trade deficits of more than $10 billion with any nation.   As negotiations near, let's focus on key principles such as  vigorously enforcing a first world rule of law; including labor  provisions that allow workers across this continent to improve their  standard of living and outlaw labor trafficking; enact environmental  standards for human health and forge an agricultural labor agreement  that helps displaced farmers; reform the unaccountable tribunals called  Investor-State Dispute Settlements so that they work for people, not  just big corporations; address currency manipulation; and, finally,  stamp out the illegal drug trade that is plaguing this continent.   The wealth NAFTA created has not been shared by all, but only a very  few, and often only the very rich. Our foundational principle for NAFTA  reform must be free and fair trade among free people with a rule of  law.
