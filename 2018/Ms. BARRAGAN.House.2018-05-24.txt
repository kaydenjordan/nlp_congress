 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mr. Clifford  Johnson, Sr., who will be 100 years old on June 7.   Mr. Johnson, a Cherokee Indian Freedman, was born in Lenapah,  Oklahoma, on June 7, 1918. He fought bravely during World War II,  serving as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army. He began a lifelong  career with the United States Postal Service in 1946.   Mr. Johnson is a loving father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.  Mr. Johnson is a patron of Macedonia Baptist Church in Watts,  California, and attributes his longevity to being close to God and  treating other people the way he would want to be treated.   I want to wish Mr. Clifford Johnson, Sr., a very happy birthday and  thank him for his service to our country.                            ____________________
