 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  her incredible leadership on this and so many other issues on the House  Committee on Armed Services. She has truly built a legacy which will be  hard to repeat.   Signing up for the military is a sacrifice. In return, our  servicemembers should never have to worry about their own healthcare  being criminalized by the very country they have volunteered to defend.   But for an estimated 5,000 to 7,400 Active-Duty servicemembers and  DOD civilians who find themselves in need of an abortion each year,  this is exactly what could happen.   Thousands serve in States they did not choose. Many of these places  now deem abortion a criminal act.   So what happens next?   Many of my colleagues would just simply suggest: Take leave and  travel to a State that provides abortions.   Are we going to force servicemembers to disclose a sexual assault to  justify leave? What about those who aren't authorized to travel due to  training status? What about women with complications who need emergency  services?   Forty percent of Active-Duty servicewomen in the U.S. could now be  faced with significant challenges accessing critical healthcare in the  wake of the Dobbs decision--40 percent.   Let me be clear, there will be an operational impact on military  recruitment and retention.   The Department of Defense must defend all of its servicemembers. We  entrust these brave young Americans with the toughest life-and-death  decisions. We ought to trust them to make their own healthcare  decisions, too. This is not only a human right, but it is a matter of  national security.
