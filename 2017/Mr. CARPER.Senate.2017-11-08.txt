 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  William Wehrum to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and  Radiation.  [[Page S7098]]    President George W. Bush nominated Mr. Wehrum for the very same job  in 2005. He was not confirmed then but was able to serve in that role  on an acting basis--something he could not lawfully do today. At the  time, I voted against Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I feared he would  impede efforts to clean our air and protect the health of Americans.  Sadly, my fears have been proved well-founded. Twenty times, the courts  found that clean air regulations that Mr. Wehrum helped craft did not  follow the law or protect public health.   Since leaving EPA in 2007, Mr. Wehrum has spent his time suing the  Agency.   Mr. Wehrum was elusive in answering our questions. When asked which  clean air regulations he supports, he could not name a single one--not  one.   Mr. Wehrum's extreme views are not good for public health and, quite  frankly, the legal uncertainty that stems from his judgment would not  be good for American businesses. That is why I call on all of my  colleagues to join me in opposition to this nomination.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks  not be counted against my postcloture time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks  not be counted against my postcloture time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, while Senators Alexander and Rounds are on  the floor--Senator King has just left--I find it ironic that the four  of us who are gathered here are former Governors and are interested in  getting things done and are interested in working across the aisle. We  want to be able to achieve better results for less money. I applaud  Senators Alexander and Murray for their efforts in trying to ensure  that we begin to do that.   I think my friend from South Dakota gives much credit to President  Obama in his attacking what was originally bipartisan legislation that  had been introduced here in 1993 by Senator Orrin Hatch, with 22  Republican cosponsors, and that later became RomneyCare.   The idea behind their proposal was that there ought to be exchanges  in every State and that the people could join if they did not have  healthcare coverage; No. 2, that there would be a sliding scale tax  credit to help buy down the cost of coverage for people who got their  care in the exchanges; No. 3, that there would be an individual mandate  that said you don't have to get coverage but that, if you don't, you  have to pay a fine; No. 4, that there would be an employer mandate that  said employers of a certain size would have to cover their people; No.  5, that insurance companies could not refuse to cover people with  preexisting conditions.   Barack Obama had nothing to do with that. We continue to hear folks  deride the idea of the exchanges and the five points I just mentioned  as ObamaCare. He had nothing to do with it. When we marked up the  Affordable Care Act, we took, really, those ideas from the 1993  legislation here, with 23 Republican cosponsors--RomneyCare--and  proposed and implemented it, I think, in 2006. It worked. When we were  marking up the Affordable Care Act, we were actually looking for  something that worked in order to give coverage to people in a cost- effective way.   In 1993, the Republicans used, I think, what was originally a  Heritage idea--Romney in 2006. They had a good idea, and it used market  forces. What we have never done since the Affordable Care Act went into  place is actually enable a good Republican idea to work. I think what  Senator Alexander has put together with Senator Murray can help move us  closer to that step.   Some other things that I think we ought to do include a reinsurance  plan along the lines that Senator Kaine and I have introduced, and  that, I think, has a fair amount of support in a lot of corners. If we  are not going to have an individual mandate--and I think we ought to,  but if we are going to take it away--the other thing is to make sure  that we put in its place the exchanges having young, healthy people so  you have a group of folks in each State in the exchanges who are  insurable without the insurance companies losing their shirts.   I think one of the great things about what Senator Alexander and  Senator Murray are trying to do here is to take the small step of  ensuring that the cost-sharing reductions really help lower income  people with their copays and help them with their deductible costs. If  we can do that, along with the 1332 waiver, which I support, this can  be a confidence builder. Maybe we can do some other things like the  reinsurance ideas we have and others have. If there is a better idea  than the individual mandate, by golly, let's do that, but we need  healthy, young people in the exchanges.   My hope is, we can find common ground and make it on a little broader  range of ideas to bring us good healthcare coverage at an affordable  price and then turn--kind of pivot--to the Affordable Care Act itself.  As for the stuff in the Affordable Care Act that ought to be changed or  dropped, let's do that. As for the portions of it that ought to be  preserved, let's do that as well.   Again, I commend my friends for coming up with this very good step.  My hope is that we can get a vote for it.   I met with a lot of insurance company folks earlier today. We do not  agree on everything, but one of the things I heard from them is, if we  were to do what Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have called for  with respect to cost-sharing reductions and if we were to do some kind  of reinsurance plan along the lines of what Tim Kaine and I have  suggested--but not necessarily that--and if we were to do something to  make it clear that the individual mandate or some other mechanism were  going to be in place and stay in place so we could get young people  into the exchanges, if we were to do those three things, they told us,  we could bring down premiums anywhere from 30 to 35 percent in the  exchanges.   Who benefits the most? As it turns out, it is not just the people who  are getting their coverage in the exchanges. Who else benefits the most  is Uncle Sam because, if we reduce premiums by 30 to 35 percent, Uncle  Sam, which pays all of these tax credits to help buy down the cost of  coverage in the exchanges, reaps a big benefit as well, and that helps  to bring down the size of the deficit, which is good.   I was just inspired by your words, of both of you, and wanted to say  that and to applaud your efforts. It is a pleasure and an honor to work  with you, and I look forward to doing more of that.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.    Mr. President, my hope is that during President Trump's  visit to Japan, he asked the leader of Japan why it is that when Japan  only spends 8 percent of its GDP on healthcare, it gets better results  than we do, and it covers everyone. Yet, when we spend 18 percent, we  don't cover everybody, and we don't get better results. That is a good  question, and I hope the President and Prime Minister Abe got into  that. Yet that is something I need to turn away from now.   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Bill Wehrum  to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.   We have seen this movie before, but like many sequels, this one may  actually be worse than the original. My opposition to this nominee  should not come as a surprise to my colleagues or to Mr. Wehrum  because, in 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him for the exact  same position, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at the  EPA. I opposed his nomination at that time, as did many of my  colleagues, and he was not confirmed.   Prior to his nomination in 2005, Mr. Wehrum was an industry lawyer  and later a political employee at the EPA. He served as chief counsel  to Jeff Holmstead, then the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and  Radiation, from 2001 through 2005. While serving at the EPA during this  time, Mr. Wehrum had a concerning track record of suppressing  scientific information and the work of the EPA's career staff,  deferring to industry on issues of public health, and not responding to  my colleagues and to me when we were then serving on the Environment  and Public Works Committee.   President Bush eventually nominated Mr. Wehrum to fill Jeff  Holmstead's seat and to serve in an acting capacity as Assistant  Administrator for Air and Radiation at the EPA, something Mr. Wehrum  would not be able to lawfully do today.   Behind me, to my left, is an excerpt from an editorial from April  2006. The New York Times published an editorial opposing Mr. Wehrum's  nomination that mirrored my concerns at the time:         [The Holmstead era at EPA] will be remembered chiefly for       its efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act (particularly with       respect to rules governing mercury emissions and older power       plants), to manipulate science and to elevate corporate       interests above those of the public. Mr. Wehrum, who served       as Mr. Holmstead's deputy and doctrinal hit man, could make       things worse.    That is a direct quote from this editorial. This is the New York  Times editorial from 2006 opposing Mr. Wehrum's nomination for the very  same position he seeks today.   During the Environment and Public Works Committee's consideration of  Mr. Wehrum's nomination in 2005, I voted against him because I feared  he would continue to fail to clean our air and protect public health.  Despite the fact that Mr. Wehrum was not confirmed due to his inability  to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture on his nomination, he was  able to serve as Acting Assistant Administrator for EPA's air office  for 2 years.   Since leaving the EPA, Mr. Wehrum has returned to industry and served  as an industry lawyer in litigation against the EPA.   Since returning to the private sector, Mr. Wehrum has reflected on  his time spent at EPA. In doing so, he didn't point to the good work he  did at the Agency to advance its public health mission or the lasting  protections he put in place that made a difference in the lives of  ordinary citizens; instead, he noted that his tenure at EPA was really  good for business, saying:         I'm a much better lawyer now than when I first joined the       agency. To really get to know how the agency works and how it       ticks, I think that is very valuable. I have expanded my       capabilities which will hopefully allow me to be effective in       generating business and clients.    In generating business and clients. Sadly, my fears of 2005 were  well-founded, and only one thing has changed--the Senate rule with  respect to the number of votes we need to consider and confirm a  nominee. If Mr. Wehrum is confirmed this week, it will be because he is  the beneficiary of the Senate's elimination of the requirement with  respect to needing 60 votes to consider nominees. It will not be  because he is better suited for this important job.   I will walk through some telling numbers for my colleagues this  evening. The first number is 31. That is the number of times Mr. Wehrum  has represented industry against the EPA in Federal court since 2009.   Let me be clear on this. After serving in an unconfirmed capacity at  the EPA because he was too far outside the mainstream to be confirmed  by this body, Mr. Wehrum then left the Agency and has spent the years  since suing that very same Agency and attempting to weaken  environmental and public health protections on behalf of his industry  clients. Many of these lawsuits are still ongoing and, in the majority  of the pending lawsuits, Mr. Wehrum has represented the interests of  Big Oil.   Look at another poster. The number 27. What does 27 refer to? It  refers to the number of times public health groups prevailed in court  when challenging Bush-era clean air regulations that Mr. Wehrum helped  to craft because they did not follow the law or sufficiently protect  public health. Failing to follow the Clean Air Act meant delays in  public health protections and uncertainty for businesses across  America.   I don't doubt that Mr. Wehrum is a fine lawyer--so why were so many  of the rules he helped to write found to be unlawful? The confirmation  process is essentially a job interview. It is not a job interview with  EPA, in a sense, and it is not really a job interview with us, but it  is a job interview with the American people. In this case, Mr. Wehrum  is essentially applying for the job he already had at EPA, and you  would think that would be easy, but Mr. Wehrum's resume shows that a  great deal of the work he did in his last job as Acting Assistant  Administrator for Air and Radiation was not up to par. In this job,  subpar work impacts millions of Americans, especially children and the  most vulnerable among us.   The next number is 10. Ten is the number of additional years that  children were exposed to toxic air emissions from powerplants because  of delays Mr. Wehrum helped put into place while at the EPA.   The next number is eight. The number eight refers to the number of  days before Mr. Wehrum's latest confirmation hearing when he was in a  courtroom arguing against rules that would protect 2.3 million miners,  construction workers, and bricklayers. According to Mr. Wehrum,  ``People are designed to deal with dust. . . . People are in dusty  environments all the time and it doesn't kill them.''   The next number is two, which is the number of times the DC Circuit  Court cited ``Alice In Wonderland'' in its decisions to reject EPA  rules that Mr. Wehrum helped craft because, in the court's view, the  regulations were based on fantasy rather than following ``the rule of  law.''   The next number is one. One is the number of times that language from  a law firm that represented industry--and also happened to be Mr.  Wehrum's former employer--made it verbatim into a clean air regulation  that Mr. Wehrum stated he was ``extensively involved'' in preparing.   Think about that.   Zero. Zero is the number of times Mr. Wehrum advocated in court for  stronger clean air regulations since leaving the EPA. It is an  especially troubling number for those of us living in downwind States  like Delaware. We live at the end of America's tailpipe, along with our  neighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and folks  all the way up to Maine. Zero is also the number of times Mr. Wehrum  expressed a desire to protect public health when I met with him prior  to his confirmation hearing.   Mr. Wehrum sits before us again today nominated for the very same  position he was nominated for 12 years ago. After reviewing Mr.  Wehrum's record, talking to him in person, and listening and reading  his answers during the hearing process, my position has not changed  since 2005, primarily because his views do not appear to have changed.   Like other EPA nominees, Mr. Wehrum was evasive on many of the  questions asked of him, even convincingly forgetting a case that he  worked on against the renewable fuel standard in National Chicken  Council, et al v.  [[Page S7103]]  EPA. However, what was clear in the answer that he did give, and in his  conversation with me, is that public health simply is not Mr. Wehrum's  main concern.   In fact, when asked what Clean Air Act regulation he does support, he  answered as follows:         I represent clients in private practice. It is my legal       ethical duty to zealously represent their interests.    Well, in this job interview with the American people to be Assistant  Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, the American people  are his clients, and the fact that he cannot--or has refused to name--a  single regulation that helps to ensure that they and their families  have clean air to breathe is almost disqualifying in and of itself.  Whether it is carbon, mercury, silica, or other toxic air pollution,  Mr. Wehrum continues to show that he sides with polluters over science  and doctors every time.   Mr. Wehrum's extreme views will not be good for public health, and  quite frankly the legal uncertainty that has resulted from his past  work will not be good for American businesses. Businesses need  certainty and predictability, and they don't get it with the kind of  work he has done.   Let me close by reminding our colleagues that next week we celebrate  the 27th anniversary of the signing of the Clean Air Act Amendments of  1990. Twenty-seven years ago, we weren't debating how to weaken or  delay our clean air laws. Instead, we passed bipartisan legislation  that would improve and strengthen our clean air laws based on the very  best science. In the process, we strengthened our economy too. Back  then, 89 Senators, including some who still serve in this Chamber,  voted to approve the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As a Congressman  over at the other body at that time, I voted along with them. A  Republican President, George Herbert Walker Bush, signed the bill into  law 27 years ago today. It was commonsense legislation, it was  bipartisan, and we are all better for it.   When the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 passed Congress, I was a  Congressman in the House, and I voted in favor of that bill. I was  proud of helping to pass that monumental law because I believed then,  and I still believe today, that we can protect our environment and grow  our economy at the same time--and we have the job numbers to prove it.   We have had some delays in implementation, but, by and large, the law  has been a huge success and has benefited just about every American.  For every dollar we spend in installing new pollution controls in  cleaning up our air, we have seen $30 returned in reduced healthcare  costs, better workplace productivity, and saved lives. We have a return  of $30 for every dollar we spend installing new pollution control.   The bottom line is, fewer people are getting sick and missing work  because of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.   When it comes to the rhetoric surrounding air regulations, there is a  lot of fake news that people like to peddle, but as the saying goes:  Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinions but not to his or her  own facts.   Here are the facts. Our economy did not take a slide because of clean  air protection. Quite the opposite is true. The Obama administration  implemented the Clean Air Act based on the best science to date. Now  our air is cleaner. We have seen 8 years of economic growth.   I will say that again. We have seen 8 years of economic growth, the  longest stretch in our history. Energy prices at the pump and the meter  are lower than when President Obama took office--lower, not higher. The  beauty of our clean air laws is that they are not static. Our clean air  protections keep up with the latest oversight science and the latest  technology.   As we learn more about what makes us sick, about what is impacting  our environment, and about what can be done to clean it up, the EPA has  the authority, under the Clean Air Act, to make adjustments to make it  better, to ensure that it protects more people, not fewer. That has  been the trajectory to date. As technology and science develop, so do  our clean air regulations.   That is also the story of our country. Through innovative and  creative solutions, we strive for progress in order to have a better  life here at home and to lead the world in tackling the environmental  challenges of our time. Mr. Wehrum's policies have been tried and have  been proven not only unsuccessful but even dangerous. We don't need to  continue to move backward. We need to move forward.   Mr. President, I will leave you and our colleagues with this. I am  sorry to say that Mr. Wehrum has worked deliberately to halt that  progress, to delay that progress and to roll back clean air laws that  have been protecting America and Americans for decades. Unlike many of  the nominees who have come before us this year, unfortunately, we don't  have to speculate about how Mr. Wehrum would do in this position. We  have already seen it. We have already seen it, and the results were not  good for the rest of us.   As his clients at this time, we deserve better representation. Today  Americans deserve leaders at EPA who will be impartial and will look  out for the interests of all Americans, not just Big Oil and the kind  of clients who can afford Mr. Wehrum's legal bills.   We have seen this movie before, and there is no need for a sequel. I  regret having to say that, but I do believe Mr. Wehrum is not the right  fit for this position today, any more than he was a dozen years ago.   I encourage my colleagues to vote no on his nomination to serve as  EPA's Assistant Administrator for air.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
