 Mr. President, as the first U.S. Senator to call for  the nomination and confirmation to fill Justice Ginsburg's seat before  the November 3 election, I am proud to support Judge Amy Coney Barrett  as President Trump's nominee for Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court, but I am not the only one who is proud. Two weeks ago I joined  Concerned Women for America in Marietta, GA, to kick off their  nationwide bus tour in support of Judge Barrett's confirmation. Dozens  attended, including men and women from every walk of life--families,  business owners, policymakers, faith leaders, and students.   Judge Barrett has inspired millions of us across our country. She has  reached the pinnacle of her profession, while upholding her Christian  faith and values. She is a wife and a mother of seven children. She  will become the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court with school- aged children.   Now the majority of Americans in the most recent Gallup poll agree we  should vote to confirm her.   As I have traveled around the Peach State, the enthusiasm and  admiration I hear from Georgians is very clear. President Trump  established a group of highly qualified candidates for the bench. He  was transparent and well prepared for the moment. It is clear that he  could not have made a better nomination.   Judge Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character, with  the judicial philosophy of originalism, and, as a textualist, she  understands and respects the Court's role to interpret the law as  written. As such, I believe Judge Barrett will uphold the Constitution  in protecting our God-given rights, including the right to life, the  Second Amendment, free speech, and religious liberty.   The need for judges who will uphold the intent of the Framers is  especially clear when the left is showing their disregard for our  Constitution. Democrats are attempting to change article I and trying  to federalize the election system through the creation of a national  universal ballot system, and Nancy Pelosi has attempted to politicize  and weaponize the 25th Amendment in another desperate move to form a  committee to remove an elected President.   That is why I introduced a resolution condemning the Speaker for her  political gains in the middle of an election while refusing to support  relief for hard-working families impacted by this pandemic.   Now, Big Tech is aggressively limiting the First Amendment right to  free speech and free press. Created before the existence of the very  companies that are silencing conservatives, the 1996 Communications  Decency Act's section 230 provision no longer suits our country's  needs. Last week, Justice Clarence Thomas called on Congress to update  these laws to ``make them more appropriate for an Internet-driven  society.''   In the Senate I am leading the charge to modernize the law to suit  the reality of the digital marketplace of ideas by introducing the  Stopping Big Tech's Censorship Act in June to give all Americans a  process to bring claims against companies when they remove or limit  constitutionally protected free speech.   Today I introduced a bill to eliminate ambiguous language in section  230 and to codify the more concrete terms recommended by the Department  of Justice.   In Congress we must act to hold Big Tech accountable, but we also  must have strong judges in our courts who will uphold the  Constitutional rights of all Americans. That is why it is concerning  that Democrats are fighting so hard to oppose an eminently qualified  nominee. As retaliation, they have threatened to pack the Court if we  follow clear precedent in filling this seat, attempting to constrain  our well designed system of checks and balances.   Unable to criticize Judge Barrett's sterling credentials, Democrats  have resorted to scare tactics, claiming she will take away healthcare  coverage or advance her own policy views. At her confirmation hearing,  Judge Barrett put those leftwing talking points to rest, saying: ``It  is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal  convictions, whether they derive from faith or anywhere else, on the  law.''   These accusations make clear that there is little Democrats fear more  than strong, conservative women. I know firsthand what it is like to  step into public service and then be attacked by the left and the fake  news. There is a playbook for trying to stop conservative women and  their place in public service.   Nonetheless, Judge Barrett has been the definition of grace under  pressure. At her confirmation hearing, Senator Graham asked why she  decided to put her family in the spotlight and accept the President's  request to serve. She said, abridged:         We knew that our lives would be combed over for any       negative detail. . . . our faith would be caricatured. . . .       the benefit . . . is that I'm committed to the rule of law .       . . and dispensing equal justice for all.    Judge Barrett's commitment to the rule of law and equal justice are  clear from her writings, decisions, and testimony. In fact, on the  Seventh Circuit, 95 percent of her adjudicated cases were unanimously  decided.   I am so grateful that Judge Barrett has accepted the call to serve  our country. President Trump could not have chosen a more qualified,  impressive jurist than Judge Barrett, and I will be honored to vote to  confirm her as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.    Sure.    Thank you for the question.   There have been 29 such cases. When, in fact, the executive branch  and the Senate are controlled by the same party, the nomination  proceeds, and that is the case that we are now in, and we will proceed  with the vote and the nomination.    The President is the President for 4 years--for a full  4-year term--and we will carry out our Constitutional duty.    No, that is not correct.    Mr. President, I will yield the floor to my colleague  from Wyoming.    No, I really don't.
