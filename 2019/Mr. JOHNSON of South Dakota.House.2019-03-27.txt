 Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a large  working-class family in central South Dakota. I suppose there were some  years when we were more poor than we were working class. But I want to  make it clear, my parents worked hard every single day. So did I, and  so did my brother and my sisters.   Even with that hard work, there were times when we needed help from  government to get by. I am who I am today because of the experiences of  both welfare and hard work.   Government assistance can help meet people's basic needs. We all know  that. But on its own, welfare alone means surviving just barely on the  edges. Welfare can meet short-term basic needs, but education and  work--yes, education and work--they deliver long-term hope and dignity  and purpose and opportunity.   That brings me, today, to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, SNAP. Many of us call it food stamps. I know this program well  from a number of personal and professional experiences.   Most of you probably know that, under Federal law, able-bodied  nonseniors--people between the ages of 18 and 50--who don't have  children at home are required to work or train or volunteer or go to  school for 20 hours a week to receive their benefits.   To most Americans, these work requirements are common sense, just as  they were when they were passed, in 1986, into law in a bipartisan  manner. They are common sense because work isn't punishment. Work is  opportunity.   Unfortunately, over the years, some States have used gimmicks and  loopholes to trigger waivers. Those waivers water down the work  requirements that we have been talking about. These, I am sure, well- intentioned but misguided efforts, mean that one-third of our country  lives in an area with no work requirements.   Today, despite a record-high 7 million job openings, we have 2.7  million SNAP recipients who can work but who aren't. There is a better  way, I am happy to say, and I want to tell you about it.   A few years ago, because of State waivers, too many Arkansans were  not experiencing the kind of dignity and opportunity that comes from  work, so Arkansas changed course. They put their work requirements back  into place, and the results were breathtaking. They were impressive.   People who left the program because they didn't work or didn't train  or didn't volunteer ended up better off than they were on welfare.  Necessity pushed them into a job path that brought them more resources  than welfare alone could ever provide.   With all of those people moving off the welfare rolls and into the  workplace, they were earning money, and the State saw its revenues go  up.   That kind of success can, and is, happening elsewhere. When Maine  reimplemented work requirements, incomes of former enrollees more than  doubled and caseloads declined by 90 percent.   These results show all of us how important it is for us to close  these loopholes. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue should be commended for  his efforts to do just that through a proposed rule, making sure that  food stamp recipients are encouraged and rewarded for their work.  [[Page H2834]]    I want to make very clear, these actions are not about taking aid  away from areas that are struggling with high unemployment. There are  clear exceptions for those areas. Instead, this is about prompting more  States and more citizens to experience the successes that have been  experienced by Maine and by Arkansas.   We all know that every one of us does better, every single one of us  does better, when we are pushed, when we are moved past our comfort  level. Growth requires effort. That is true in athletics; that is true  in academics; that is true in raising children; and that is true in all  other areas of life as well. Denying millions of able-bodied SNAP  recipients that push, that growth, also denies them a chance at a  better future.   In States where work requirements have been reinstituted, a clearer  path out of poverty has reemerged. We have to do that elsewhere. We  have to do that everywhere.   I close today, Mr. Speaker, by saying that work has dignity; work is  opportunity; and work is an American value.                            ____________________
