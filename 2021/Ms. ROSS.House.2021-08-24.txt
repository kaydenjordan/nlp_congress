 Madam Speaker, the rule before us provides for  consideration of three landmark pieces of legislation. First and  foremost, we are here to assume our duty to protect our American  democracy. Just this year alone, 18 States have enacted 30 voter  suppression laws. In response, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act  would reinvigorate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, restore  geographic preclearance requirements eliminated in the Shelby decision,  and take other steps to block discriminatory voting measures before  they are implemented.   The history of the fight for voting rights in America is long and  painful. But at crucial forks on that difficult path, Members of this  body from both parties have set politics aside and done the right  thing.    We are meeting here today at another pivotal juncture in the struggle  for voting rights, and it is up to us to meet the urgency of the  moment, live up to our constitutional responsibilities, and pass this  critical legislation.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of our $3.5 trillion Build Back  Better budget resolution. By taking real action on climate change,  expanding the child tax credit, and supporting universal pre-K and free  community college, this budget represents an investment in all of our  people, especially our children and grandchildren. For the sake of our  constituents and our country, let's approve this vital funding.   Madam Speaker, lastly, the rule before us provides for future  consideration of the Senate's bipartisan infrastructure package. From  expanding broadband to rebuilding roads, bridges, airports, rail, and  water systems, this historic bill will help bring America's aging  infrastructure into the 21st century and create jobs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and this  legislation.
