 Mr. Speaker, last week, the enchanted State of  New Mexico, the United States, and families seeking justice everywhere  lost a statesman, a former Ambassador, Governor, and Congressman.  Governor Bill Richardson is survived by our former first lady of  incredible grace, Mrs. Barbara Richardson.   In 1983, Governor Richardson began his public service career as the  first Representative of the newly formed Third Congressional District  of Nuevo Mexico.   My first visit to Congress was as a young attorney representing the  Navajo Nation to Governor Richardson's office. I stand on the shoulders  and am grateful for his sage advice on how to serve this beautiful  district.   As chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he opposed cruel  immigration policies and brought attention to Latino policy priorities  everywhere. As Governor, he recognized the importance of education and  economic diversity as he raised teachers' salaries and increased film  production.   May we honor Bill Richardson as a tenacious champion for New  Mexicans, a skillful diplomat, and a committed public servant.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burgess so much for the  customary 30 minutes to discuss this bill, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose today's rule. There are 8 legislative  days left to fund the government, and under Republican leadership, what  have we done? We passed 1, just 1, of the 12 appropriations bills  necessary--1 of 12.   We were supposed to take up the rule for the Defense appropriations  bill yesterday, but last evening, in a rushed meeting, we changed the  rule to limit it to this single bill.    The only thing we have to show for an entire week in session is a  bill that attacks States' rights and California's ability to decide for  its own what regulations it wants under the Clean Air Act, as it is  allowed to do under existing law and has been allowed to do for  decades.   Do you know what? When Democrats were in the majority in the previous  Congress, we didn't hear what we are hearing from Republicans. We did  not hear Democrats saying we are going to shut it down. No. Democrats  have always looked for solutions. We have not been calling to shut it  down. We have always worked to work it out.   Over and over again, not just this week but over the summer, we have  heard extreme MAGA Republicans voice their goal of a forced government  shutdown. We need to remember that the times that we have faced a  shutdown and suffered through a shutdown have been when Republican  Speakers were in charge.   Remember 1995-1996, 2013, 2018? We needed to have Speaker Pelosi take  charge so we could open our government back up. In the Rules Committee,  we heard Republicans say: Let's shut it down.   Let's make clear that the ``it'' that is sometimes referred to is  something that is not beneficial. That ``it'' are the people who make  sure our food is safe. The ``it'' they want to shut down is the program  that makes sure that our women, infants and children, seniors, and  veterans have enough food on their table. The ``it'' are the people who  serve and protect our country and our services. The ``it'' are the  people who maintain our beautiful national parks and allow us to see  America's wonders.   Americans don't want us to head to a goal of: We are shutting it  down.   Why don't we work it out? As Ranking Member McGovern noted yesterday,  the last time our government shut down, it was the longest in history  due to inaction by then-President Trump and Republican majorities in  the House and Senate. It cost Americans $11 billion, $3 billion  permanently, and caused sizable suffering for our constituents.                                time  1245    We are talking about people having to take out loans all through our  country. I have been visited over and over again. The auto dealers came  to my chambers yesterday and talked about the repercussions that a  shutdown has on their business.   People are going to have a hard time paying their mortgage, putting  food on the table. But it doesn't have to be this way. The White House  Democrats and Republicans negotiated a bipartisan agreement in the  Fiscal Responsibility Act in June that set up the pathway to how we  were going to fund the government with cuts, making sure that we kept  the government funding level.   Now, a mere 3 months later they are backing out on their commitment.  Extreme Republicans are blowing up our commitment to the American  people. My rural district will suffer. It will suffer tremendously, as  will all rural districts across this country. We need to remember rural  America is the backbone of this country, and they are sacrificing it.   A shutdown could delay veterans and Social Security payments. With 8  legislative days to avoid a government shutdown, we have a bill totally  unrelated to funding the government.   H.R. 1435, Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, is an attack  on efforts to reduce pollution and climate change.   I have noticed that the Republicans have a habit of naming their  bills to do the opposite of what the bill actually does. This  legislation will remove the choice that Californians have exercised as  they elect their own government and as they choose to look to how do  they want to make sure they exercise their right to adopt clean air  standards.   For decades, the Clean Air Act has reduced harmful air pollutants  leading to fewer instances of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular  problems, and other health issues. That is in part due to the law's  flexibility. It allows flexibility to allow choice for California and  other States to adopt strict standards.   H.R. 1435 threatens our efforts to lessen air pollution and reduce  greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. It also disrupts the  U.S. vehicle market and could harm our global competitiveness and the  electric vehicle market.   I will say it again, however: At a time when we have a duty to fund  the government, the Republican majority is instead picking on States'  rights, picking on States that want to clean up their air and fight  climate change.   I urge my colleagues to change course and oppose this rule. Mr.  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I noted, the existing rule  allows choice in each State. What works for California may or may not  work for New Mexico or other States like New York, but that is why the  Clean Air Act built in flexibility. We should allow California and  those States that choose to follow their lead to continue to adopt  stricter vehicle standards that work for them.   I also want to make a point that car makers make business plans  several years in the future. For Congress to come in and change the  setting of what is happening--because right now 75 percent of vehicles  sold with low emissions are being manufactured here in America--is  creating culture wars that also hurt our industry workers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record the  September 13, 2023, letter from the United Auto Workers titled: ``UAW  Urges to Vote NO on the So-Called Preserving Choice in the Vehicle  Purchases Act.''    I remind us all that we should be funding the  government this week, not attacking individual States or workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Pelosi), our inspiring Speaker Emerita.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I truly appreciated the Speaker Emerita is leading us to think about  the why and to think about the children, to think about the children  and their health. We must remember that Democrats are not against  consumer choices, but what we are for is consumer safety.   Should we allow consumers to choose leaded gas once again? No.  Because we know what it does to our children's lungs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a July  25, 2023, letter from the American Lung Association opposing H.R. 1435.    Mr. Speaker, 100 million Americans live in  counties with unhealthy air pollution. Our children, our elders, low- income communities, and communities of color are most at risk. The good  news is, we are addressing it. The good news is, with the Chips and  Science Act, we are starting to do research that will lead to even  bigger and better advances in how we bring down those emissions.   With the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction  Act, we are building out the electric charging stations that we need so  you can get across Minnesota, New Mexico, and everywhere in between if  you choose to have an electric vehicle. That is going to be your  choice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Stansbury), an amazing sister who believes in fighting for the  clean air of our beautiful State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentlewoman from New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think we need to constantly talk about what we are not  doing here today. We are not talking about the appropriations bills  that we need to fund our government. Maybe it is because the other side  doesn't really want us to know, does not want the American public to  know all of the awful things that are in those appropriations bills.   The 2024 funding bills that the Republicans wrote are so extreme,  their own conference is having a hard time swallowing the devastation  the drastic cuts will do in America. These bills are a direct attack on  rural America, on families, our servicemembers, on our climate goals,  and the list goes on.   What are some of the terrible provisions that we have reviewed in the  Rules Committee that we are not talking about on the floor today?   One, inching toward a national abortion ban. In the Defense  appropriations bill, they included a ban for servicemembers, women, and  their families from taking paid leave or traveling to obtain an  abortion or related healthcare services related to a woman's  reproductive health.   If a woman is raped and wants an abortion and lives in a State where  there are no exceptions, that servicewoman, who joined to serve our  country, has no choice, if she lives in 1 of 14 States in this country.   They told our servicewomen that if they choose to serve our country,  they will be deprived of the care they need. In the same bill, they cut  $714 million for the Department of Defense climate change programs.   I need to tell you, we read into the Record the fact that it has been  told that the Nation who has the advantage of addressing climate change  and building resilience will have a military strategic advantage. Once  again, they are taking away our military strategic advantage not just  with that but refusing, the Republicans, to go ahead and allow our  nomination for flag officers to serve. Over and over again in this  bill, they are weakening our ability to serve and defend our country.   In the Agriculture appropriations bill, they returned funding to 2007  levels. Imagine what that kind of cut does to our rural communities,  from slashing cuts for rural electric co-ops, like I have throughout my  district, to making sure that our children go hungry. A mother cannot  feed herself or her baby if she is cut back to 2007 levels, but that is  what Republicans are prioritizing.   We are not really talking about these bills because we are not  talking about funding the government, are we?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Neguse), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, who I am sure  will address some of these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question,  I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a  resolution which clearly states that it is the people's House's duty to  keep our promise to American workers and seniors to protect and  preserve Social Security and Medicare and fight against any cuts to  these vital programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous materials,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. McClellan) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Porter).    Mr. Speaker, following up on the gentlewoman  from California's comments and on the importance of looking at this  industry and how it is growing, I ask unanimous consent to include in  the Record a January 12, 2023, article.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to  recognize that there are health benefits from the Clean Air Act, but  there are also benefits to our manufacturing sector, as well.   H.R. 1435 completely ignores the benefits of EV production. They are  completely going to be undermining the importance of manufacturing in  the United States, what we need in the United States. Why would we want  the industry to move to other countries when we can make it here in  America?   Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the reason why so many of us have  stood up today in opposition to this rule and have stood up in  opposition to this rule for what it does not do. It does not address  the looming crisis that the extreme Republicans and, apparently, the  entire Republican Conference--because they are all moving toward that.  My colleagues on the other side could meet and work with us, but no.  Once again, they want to shut it down.   It is our duty to govern. Under Republican leadership, we have not  seen any governing happening. We have not passed the appropriations  bills that America needs to keep our government open.   Would that be acceptable in any other arena? It would not be  acceptable in my State of New Mexico to allow a party to actually just  shut down our government. That would be reprehensible. It should be  reprehensible here, as well.   The Republicans cannot escape that this is their playbook. They do it  over and over again. When they hold the gavel in this House, they shut  down the government.   For what? For extreme demands that we have already discussed, demands  that attack women and their ability to make choices about their own  reproductive healthcare in consultation with their own faith, with  their own family and those they love, and not with their Congressperson  but with their doctors.   For what? Because they don't want to, and they are protecting their  millionaire friends and the big corporations. They do not want to make  sure that they pay their fair share of taxes, so they prefer to shut  down the government, a government that serves the American people in so  many different ways.   Our Democratic voices that are coming to this Chamber, that are  coming to the people's House from districts as diverse and beautiful as  mine, know that we must bring their voices to this table, to this  House, and say to keep it open and keep offering the services that  protect us, that keep us safe, that make sure that our education is  broad and has help where it is needed, that our Native American  communities that we serve continue to receive the healthcare and law  enforcement that we need, that we make sure that our Department of  Justice is doing its job--because it is--and that we do all that work  so our railroads are safe and our food is safe.   We must do all that work to make sure our government is kept open.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose today's rule, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus and the many friends who hold him dear, we rise today  to honor a beloved lifetime public servant, Governor Bill Richardson.   I first want to acknowledge his wife, Barbara Richardson, a woman of  incredible grace who is leading a State, a Nation, and a world in  mourning the Governor today in Santa Fe, New Mexico.   I thank Chairwoman Nanette Barragan for her leadership in organizing  this moment of silence for our colleague, who like you, also served as  chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.   I say Governor and chair, but Bill had many other titles during his  illustrious career: U.S. Congressman, House Deputy Majority Whip, U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, U.S. Secretary of Energy, candidate  for President, hostage negotiator, and professor.   We are all humbled by his achievements, and most importantly, by the  people he helped along the way.   Guided by an unflinching sense of duty, service, and justice, Bill  opened the door for countless people throughout his career. He opened  the door of opportunity for Americans seeking a better future. He  unlocked the jail cells of political prisoners imprisoned by the most  dangerous dictators. He never hesitated to seek dialogue with those he  knew had the power to release the powerless, and he opened the doors of  service, inspiring Latino leaders working tirelessly to improve their  communities.   I am honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with my Hispanic Caucus  ``hermanos y hermanas,'' ``brothers and sisters,'' and all of the  colleagues who have joined us today. We are sharing with each other in  these last 2 weeks and hearing from so many of our colleagues moving  and also fun stories of those who now serve in the people's House,  either as Members or as staff who have come up to me and told me the  stories of how they are in America today and serving in this House  because of Governor Richardson.   Bill, we do not merely stand in this well of the people's House, as  you did for over 14 years; we stand on your shoulders. We stand because  giants like you blazed the trail for countless Latinos to serve their  country in our Nation's highest offices.   From 12 members, when you served as chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, to 42 members today, including Representative  Velazquez who served with you, the CHC traces our lineage back to you  and others who ``caminando hicieron el camino,'' ``walking we make the  road,'' who built the trail with each bold step you took forward.   Whether it is a minimum-wage worker who earned a bit more because of  your work, a hostage who saw the sun again, or a young leader inspired  to serve, you created hope in many of the most overlooked places and  overlooked people.   Please join all of us as we bow our heads in a moment of silence  honoring the legacy of former Congressman, Governor, Ambassador, and  Secretary, Bill Richardson.   Governor, ``que descansa en paz,'' ``may you rest in peace,'' and God  bless you.                            ____________________
