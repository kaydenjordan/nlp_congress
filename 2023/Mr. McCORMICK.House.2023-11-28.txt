 Mr. Speaker, how often do we have a chance to do the  right thing, defeat Communism, grow the economy, create jobs, reduce  the deficit, and secure the southern border all at the same time?   It would be all good for America. It would be all good no matter what  party you are from and no matter what part of the country you are from.  This is a rare thing indeed.   I suggest we support the Make Putin Pay Act. I suggest we combine it  with securing the southern border. How many opportunities are we going  to have to do the right thing and use the right assets to do the  mission?   We can right now use over $100 billion in frozen assets from Russia  to pay for the military support required to defeat an invading  Communist country into Europe.   We can secure 70 percent of Europe's grain stores so it is not sold  to a foreign national government that is unfriendly, but to sustain a  bigger, stronger, more friendly Europe. Meanwhile, that money is going  to be spent back in the United States to support our defense industry,  to create jobs, and through taxes, created by those jobs, to reduce the  deficit, all while defeating our biggest adversary in the European  theater.   If we can combine that with H.R. 2 and secure our southern border,  even better. Let's just get this straight: We win for the economy; we  win for reducing debt; we win for defeating Communism; and we win by  securing our southern border. This is what we are working with right  now with the Senate.   How many opportunities do we have to combine a Senate and a House  resolution to actually do these things? We win, win, win, and win some  more.   Mr. Speaker, I highly suggest that my comrades here in the House  support the Make Putin Pay Act. It will use over $100 billion in frozen  assets from Russia to support our economy, pay down debt, and secure  our southern border.                            ____________________
