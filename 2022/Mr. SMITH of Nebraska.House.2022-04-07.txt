 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6968.   I think it has been well-laid out here that we could have done this  some weeks ago on March 9 when the bill originally passed. It is  regrettable that Speaker Pelosi chose to try to add some controversial  provisions that actually slowed it down.   It is high time that we come together in an action like this.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to say that as the lead Republican on the Ways  and Means Trade Subcommittee, I support this, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity  that we can work together. I appreciate the comments of the chairman  and our ranking member.   It is only appropriate that we move to use the key trade tools at our  disposal to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for these atrocities that  he has committed against Ukraine because we know it is being felt  around the world, in addition to what the people of Ukraine are  feeling.   I am glad that we can act in this manner. I wish we would have done  it sooner, but I am glad we can act today.
