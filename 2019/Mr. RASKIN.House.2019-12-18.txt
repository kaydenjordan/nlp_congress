 Mr. Speaker, American elections belong to the American  people, not the American President and not foreign powers.   No President may cheat the people by working with foreign governments  to steal from us a free and fair election. And no President who  attempts it may cover up that cheating by systematically obstructing  Congress in our work.   Article II of the Constitution does not authorize a President to do  whatever he wants. The reason we have a Constitution is to keep  government officials from doing whatever they want.   If we the people lose the certainty of free and fair elections to  Presidential corruption and foreign manipulation, then we lose our  democracy itself, the most precious inheritance we have received from  prior generations who pledged their sacred honor and gave everything  they had to defend it.   The struggle for democracy is the meaning of America. That is why we  remain the last best hope of a world  [[Page H12138]]  ravaged by authoritarianism, violence, and corruption.   We must act now to protect our elections and safeguard constitutional  democracy for the enormous and unprecedented challenges that still lie  ahead of us.
