 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to October being  Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Domestic violence is a terrible  reality for far too many women, men, and children. By the time I finish  this speech, roughly 20 people will fall victim to abuse at the hands  of an intimate partner.   This is Ashley Hall, a mother of two young girls from my district.  She was a dance instructor, a teacher's aide, and she had a heart for  those who struggled. Ashley was also a victim of domestic violence. She  lost her life at the hands of her husband, a tragedy that will impact  her daughters for the rest of their lives.   This month let the stories like Ashley's be shared as a way to help  others. Take time to reach out to those you think may be in need. Get  involved by supporting local shelters and speak out against this tragic  issue. Resources are available for those in need. The National Domestic  Violence Hotline can be reached at 1-800-799-7233.                            ____________________
