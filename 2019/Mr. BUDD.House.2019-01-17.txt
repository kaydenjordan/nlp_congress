 Madam Speaker, I rise today because this month marks 46  years since Roe v. Wade was decided.   Since that decision, there have been over 60 million abortions. I am  not sure there is any other way to describe this statistic other than  the word ``horrifying.''   With that being said, I also rise today to recognize the thousands of  people who travel to Washington every year to fight for the unborn.   Madam Speaker, the pro-life movement in America is growing. Why?  Because it is a movement about love and about promoting a culture of  life.   By promoting a culture of life, these folks are advocating for more  than just saving the unborn babies. Although that is extremely  important, Madam Speaker, this is a fight for the dignity of life that  says we need to view people as assets to our society and not as  liabilities.   When we view people as assets, it means we are giving those who are  trapped in a cycle of poverty a real shot to make it in this life; and  when we view people as assets, it means we are seeing those with  disabilities as contributors--and nothing less.   I want to close by thanking all the people, especially those from  North Carolina, who give a voice to the voiceless. They are an  inspiration to me and to many others around the country.                            ____________________
