 Madam President, today and these past several weeks  have been deeply painful for many in this country. Today it is a  painful day for millions of women all across the country who are  rightly worried about losing their basic civil rights. It is a painful  day for the brave and courageous survivors who have had to relive their  trauma and, in some cases, have found the courage to tell their story  for the very first time.   It is also a painful day for men who hope to see this Senate stand on  the right side of history.   Today, in just a few hours, the U.S. Senate is going to turn its back  on righteousness. It is going to turn its back on fairness and reason,  and, make no mistake, it is going to turn its back on women.  [[Page S6657]]    What we have seen over the last few weeks is an exercise of power:  Who has it and who doesn't. Rather than a search for the truth, we have  seen those in power ram through a nominee who is unfit to serve on the  Supreme Court. Ultimately, this is about the power structure of  America, but it is changing, and it is changing fast.   I want to say something right here from the Senate floor to every  woman in America who is listening: I hear you. Many of my colleagues in  the Senate hear you. We hear your stories. We hear your voices, and we  will be certain they will not go unheard.   I have heard from constituents all across my State. I have been  talking to people for the last several months, and I have been talking  to people specifically about this nominee for the past several weeks. I  have heard from friends who have been sexually assaulted. I have heard  from friends whose daughters have been sexually assaulted. I have heard  from people who are outraged about what is happening in this country  right now--outraged at a process that doesn't seek the truth and  doesn't seem to be fair.   Unfortunately, it is a moment when survivors are having to relive the  worst moments of their lives in real time by just watching the news.   So I am going to read a little bit of information that was submitted  to the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27 by Jessica Davidson  from End Rape on Campus. She writes a very heartfelt letter about her  own trauma, about her own experience with sexual violence, and about  the representation she provides from her organization.   She writes:         We envision a world in which each individual has an       educational experience free from violence, and until then,       that all survivors are believed, trusted, and supported. Each       year, we assist nearly 1,000 survivors and their families       directly, conduct educational campaigns, support student       activists, and to advocate for policy reform efforts that       reach millions of individuals.    She asked:         How many more viral online moments must be created before       an incredible harm and trauma we have experienced is enough       to be taken seriously when a survivor comes forward? And why       is the burden always shifted to those who have experienced       the harm?    She says an American is sexually assaulted every 98 seconds. Just  imagine how many lives are being destroyed.   She says more than an estimated 17,700,000 women and 2,780,000 men  have experienced an attempted or completed rape since 1998; 3 million  college students will be sexually assaulted this fall alone; 18,900  military servicemembers bravely serving our country experienced sexual  assault in 2014; and one in every four voters in the United States is a  survivor--more than half of all voters in the United States know a  survivor. Survivors make up a significant portion of each U.S.  Senator's constituencies, and survivors everywhere deserve to know that  if they come forward, they will be taken seriously.   I received thousands of calls, hundreds of letters, and I have read  some of those letters this morning. They are so disturbing and so  upsetting. I can't imagine what that must be like to deal with in this  moment that we are in when you have Members of the Senate who either  don't believe credible survivors or, if they do believe them, they  don't care.   For every survivor out there who feels she is not being heard, not  being listened to, not being believed, I want you to know there are  those of us here who do believe you, who have heard you, and who will  fight for you. Your voices are being heard, and they do matter. Your  willingness to protest, to stand tall, to speak out, and to speak  clearly over these last few weeks has been extraordinary. It has been  powerful. It has been meaningful. It has made a difference.   So do not fear that what you have done was a waste of time. Do not  fear that speaking out doesn't matter because it does. The energy and  inspiration you have created is going to drive this movement forward.   I also want to talk a little bit about why Brett Kavanaugh should not  be serving on the Supreme Court, why he doesn't deserve this seat, and  I want to talk a lot about his record and what we know about Brett  Kavanaugh as an individual.   Over these last few weeks, we have learned a lot about this nominee,  even before we found out that more than one woman had accused Judge  Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her. His judicial record was already  clear, and many of us made our decisions to oppose Judge Kavanaugh  based on that record--that judicial record and statements alone. That  was the first reason I opposed him--because I have no doubt he will  undermine women's rights on the Supreme Court.   I will say more about his judicial record in a moment, but what we  all saw and heard over the last few weeks isn't something that you can  actually discern from a judicial record. More than one woman has come  forward with sworn statements under penalty of perjury, saying Brett  Kavanaugh committed acts of sexual misconduct against them. One of  them, Dr. Blasey Ford, even bravely testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee. She was under oath, and she relived one of the  worst moments of her life on national television. She was credible. I  believed her.   When my colleagues asked her what she remembered most clearly, her  strongest memory was the laughter. She said that ``indelible in the  hippocampus is the laughter--the laugh, the uproarious laughter between  the two, and their having fun at my expense.''   She said: ``They were laughing with each other.'' She said: ``I was,  you know, underneath one of them while the two laughed, two friend--two  friends having a really good time with one another.''   She was direct, and she did not evade any questions. She did not duck  or dodge like someone who was trying to hide the truth.   When my colleagues asked her with what degree of certainty did she  believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her, she said: ``One hundred  percent.''   When I was watching her testimony sitting there in the room, there  were many moments when her testimony brought me to tears. I thought the  way she opened was particularly moving. She said:         I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I       am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you       what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high       school. I agonized daily with this decision throughout August       and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me       to reach out confidentially to the Washington Post,       Representative Eshoo's office and Senator Feinstein's office       was always there, but my fears of the consequences of       speaking out started to increase.        During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh's       confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as       a champion of women's rights and empowerment. I believed that       if I came forward my voice would be drowned out by a chorus       of powerful supporters.        By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned       myself to remaining quiet and letting the committee and the       Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh       had done to me. At the same time, my greatest fears have been       realized and the reality has been far worse than I expected.        Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks       have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my       trauma in front of the entire world and have seen my life       picked apart by people on television, in the media, or in       this body who have never met or spoken with me. I have been       accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those       who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent       person and I am no one's pawn.        My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts       about how Mr. Kavanaugh's actions have damaged my life so       that you can take that into serious consideration as you make       your decisions about how to proceed. It is not my       responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to       sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the       truth.    That is a woman of extraordinary humility and extraordinary courage.   I want to compare Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony to Judge Kavanaugh's  testimony right after her. We all saw it. Some of my colleagues have  suggested that because multiple women were making very credible  accusations against Judge Kavanaugh that he had a right to be angry,  that he was right to come out strong and fight back, like a politician  would. Really? Is that how a judge is supposed to act? Not according to  Judge Kavanaugh.   I want to quote from a law review article he wrote 2 years ago about  how a good judge is supposed to act:         To be a good judge and a good umpire, it is critical that       you have the proper demeanor. We must walk in the shoes of       other judges, the lawyers, and the parties.        It is important to understand then to keep our emotions in       check, and be calm against  [[Page S6658]]       the storm. To put it in the vernacular: to be a good umpire       and be a good judge, don't be a jerk.    Judge Kavanaugh would have been well served to listen to his own  advice.   I was shocked by his tirade against my colleagues and my party. I was  disturbed by its vindictiveness, his animosity. I want to quote from  his testimony to remind you of exactly what he said at his hearings.  Every time I see these words, I am in disbelief that a sitting Federal  judge--a nominee for the Supreme Court--said them to the Judiciary  Committee in prepared testimony under oath.   He said:         This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and       orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up       anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.        Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial       record.        Revenge on behalf of the Clintons. And millions of dollars       in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.    Supreme Court Justices are supposed to be thinking about the law and  only the law, not elections, not political parties, but now we know  exactly what Judge Kavanaugh is thinking about. He is thinking about  politics. He is thinking about leftwing conspiracies. He is thinking  about the 2016 election and Trump and the Clintons.   Those aren't my words; those are his words, his testimony. He said  them directly to the committee under oath while the entire Nation was  watching. He showed us his true colors. He showed us what he does when  he is under pressure. He showed us how he really feels about our  politics and our political parties, even though he said he always stays  far away from politics because judges aren't supposed to go there.   He showed us what he really thinks, deep down, when his back is  against a wall. Think about that. A sitting Federal judge, a nominee to  the Supreme Court, shouting--shouted about Democrats trying to take him  down.   It makes me wonder, even if you love every judicial decision this  judge has ever written, how can any of my colleagues argue, after  hearing that tirade, that this judge is unbiased? It makes me wonder  how any of my colleagues can ignore that fact. It makes me wonder, to  my colleagues who are so desperate to confirm Brett Kavanaugh at all  costs, what decisions by this judge are you so eager to see? What do  you already know about how the supposedly fairminded judge is going to  rule that you would risk the Court's reputation by putting such a  blatant partisan on the bench?   A retired Supreme Court Justice, John Paul Stevens, who was appointed  by a Republican, even came so far as to change his mind and oppose  Judge Kavanaugh. Why? Because Judge Kavanaugh is now clearly biased. He  said:         He has demonstrated a potential bias involving potential       litigants before the court that he would not be able to       perform its full responsibilities.        And I think there is merit in that criticism and that the       Senators should really pay attention to it.        For the good of the court, it's not healthy to get a new       justice that can only do a part-time job.    I agree with that. When the next big gerrymandering case comes before  the Supreme Court, we already know how Judge Kavanaugh feels about  Democrats because we heard directly from him at the hearing, so we  can't expect him to rule fairly in that case.   What if a forced arbitration case related to sexual harassment comes  before the Court? We all heard Judge Kavanaugh say under oath that  credible allegations of sexual assault are nothing but a leftwing  conspiracy, so we can't expect him to rule fairly on that one either.   There are real consequences to the bias and partisanship and anger  Judge Kavanaugh showed at his hearing. I am incredibly disappointed by  this, and I hope my colleagues think about this one last time before  they cast their votes today.   I would like to talk a little bit about his record as a judge. Whose  side does he take? Whom does he believe?   In one case, in a dissent, Judge Kavanaugh said employers should not  have to give their workers insurance that covers birth control if they  don't want to. In other words, he thinks a boss's religion is more  important than a worker's religion. Does that sound fair to you, Madam  President?   In another case, he had to decide whether a pregnant teenage  immigrant girl should be allowed to have an abortion. He made her wait  for 9 weeks before he said no, and then he was overruled by his  judicial colleagues. He said he didn't think what he did to the girl  was an undue burden. Does that sound fair to you?   Let's not forget that President Trump said he wanted the new Supreme  Court Justice to overturn Roe v. Wade, that he wanted to nominate  someone who would automatically vote to overturn it. He chose Brett  Kavanaugh to get the job done.   If this Chamber confirms Judge Kavanaugh, I have no doubt that the  Supreme Court will take away women's reproductive rights. I have no  doubt that the Supreme Court will tell women they aren't allowed to  make their own decisions with their own doctors about their own health.   I want to speak about another part of his record. Judge Kavanaugh  wrote in an opinion that if the President doesn't like a law, then the  President could ignore the law and ignore the courts. This is what he  said. As you listen to this, let me know if you think this is  judicially sound judgment. He wrote: ``Under the Constitution, the  president may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private  individuals when the president deems the statute unconstitutional, even  if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.''   Anyone with the most basic understanding of how our constitutional  system of government works knows that this is not what our Founding  Fathers designed. Anyone who has been paying attention to President  Trump's attacks on our institutions and his repeated attempts to  undermine the Mueller investigation should be alarmed by that statement  alone. It makes me think President Trump's choice for this nominee was  because he wanted to be protected from the Mueller investigation.   I am also deeply concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's record on money in  politics.   It should come as no surprise that Judge Kavanaugh is on the side of  big money interests that pollute our political system. Kavanaugh was  handpicked by White House Counsel Don McGahn, a former FEC Commissioner  who was notorious for his hostility toward campaign finance laws.  Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh fulfills President Trump's promise to nominate  individuals in the mold of Justice Scalia, a steadfast opponent of  campaign finance regulations.   Like McGahn and Justice Scalia, Kavanaugh has made his opposition to  campaign finance laws clear during his time on the DC Circuit.   In 2011, Kavanaugh authored an opinion that would allow foreign  nationals to spend unlimited funds on issue ads in U.S. elections. Let  me say that again. Kavanaugh authored an opinion that would allow  foreign nationals to spend unlimited funds on issue ads in U.S.  elections. That is the Bluman v. FEC decision.   Kavanaugh presided over a lawsuit brought by foreign persons living  in the United States who wanted to make campaign contributions to  candidates in U.S. Federal elections. Although Kavanaugh upheld  provisions of Federal election law banning foreign persons from  contributing directly to a candidate or party, Kavanaugh found that  federal election law ``does not restrain foreign nationals from  speaking out about issues or spending money to advocate their views  about issues.''   Under his reading of Federal election law in Bluman, Kavanaugh would  only take issue with a small fraction of the election meddling  perpetrated by the Russian operatives indicted by Special Counsel  Mueller.   At his confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh was given the  opportunity to directly address the possibility that his decision in  Bluman opened the door for ``Vladimir Putin . . . to buy issue ads in  American elections.'' Judge Kavanaugh's response to Senator Whitehouse  was misleading, indicating that the Supreme Court affirmed the case  unanimously, which, while true as to foreign contributions to  candidates, was not true on the point of issue ads.   Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh's response to a question for the record from  Senator Coons also revealed his misleading response to Senator  Whitehouse's question. He wrote: ``The challengers in Bluman did not  seek to make contributions to organizations that make  [[Page S6659]]  expenditures on issue ads. The opinion made clear that the court's  `holding does not address' whether `Congress might bar' foreign  nationals living temporarily in the United States `from issue advocacy  and speaking out on issues of public policy.' '' The Supreme Court  unanimously affirmed the decision.   Judge Kavanaugh seeks to have it both ways. He brags about his  opinion being unanimously upheld by the Court, but when he is  confronted with the real-world consequences of his decision, he hides  behind the pleadings.   According to Special Counsel Mueller's indictment, the issue ads run  by Russian operatives seeking to meddle in the 2016 election include  the messages ``JOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016''--I don't even  want to read the others; they are so horrible. ``Donald wants to defeat  terrorism . . . Hillary wants to sponsor it.'' Yet Judge Kavanaugh's  Bluman decision would permit foreign actors to run advertisements like  the ones above without consequence. In fact, legal briefs filed by  lawyers for the Russian operatives indicted by Special Counsel Mueller  cite Kavanaugh's Bluman opinion for the proposition that ``[f]oreign  nationals are not barred from issue advocacy . . . such as what is  described in the indictment.''   Judge Kavanaugh opposes limitations on big money in politics. During  his confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh was confronted by Senator  Klobuchar with an email he wrote in March 2002 wherein he suggested  that contribution limits could be unconstitutional: ``And I have heard  very few people say that the limits on contributions to candidates are  unconstitutional, although I for one tend to think those limits have  some constitutional problems.'' When Senator Klobuchar pressed Judge  Kavanaugh on whether he believed that ``contribution limits have  constitutional problems,'' Judge Kavanaugh evaded the question and  issued a nonresponsive answer.   In a 2016 American Enterprise Institute speech, Kavanaugh said that  political spending ``absolutely'' deserves First Amendment protection  because ``to make your voice heard [in politics] . . . you need to  raise money to be able to communicate to others in any kind of  effective way.''    In 2009, in EMILY's List v. FEC, Kavanaugh heard a challenge to  multiple FEC regulations restricting the use of ``hard-money'' by  nonprofit organizations in Federal elections. These particular  regulations were passed in striking down these regulations. Kavanaugh  held that nonprofit organizations are ``constitutionally entitled to  raise and spend unlimited money in support of candidates for elected  office'' because it is ``implausible that contributions to independent  expenditure political committees are corrupting.''   These are really concerning statements about unlimited money and  spending in politics from foreign nationals on issue ads and from  moneyed interests. I do not believe that money is speech, and I do not  believe that corporations should have the same free speech rights as  individuals, but Judge Kavanaugh does, and I find that to be deeply  troubling.   Judge Kavanaugh also has a very disturbing record when it comes to  rolling back the civil rights of millions of Americans.   In his time as a judge, Brett Kavanaugh has consistently sided  against Americans who are trying to exercise their civil rights. From  voting rights, to employment discrimination, to the rights of those  with disabilities, Kavanaugh has taken positions that perpetuate  inequality. Judge Kavanaugh's record leaves little doubt--if confirmed  to the Supreme Court, he will continue to roll back the hard-won rights  of millions of Americans.   As a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh was involved in Rice v.  Cayetano, which challenged Hawaii's right to limit participation in an  election for the State's Office of Hawaiian Affairs to Native  Hawaiians. In a brief he cowrote with Robert Bork and Roger Clegg--the  latter of whom heads the anti-affirmative-action Center for Equal  Opportunity--Kavanaugh argued that restricting participation to Native  Hawaiians was unconstitutional. According to Kavanaugh, it did not  matter that Hawaii's ``voting qualification in elections for the Office  of Hawaiian Affairs [was] designed to remedy past discrimination in  voting against `Hawaiians' in Hawaii.'' Discussing that decision in a  1999 interview, Kavanaugh said that the ``case is one more step along  the way in what I see as an inevitable conclusion within the next 10 or  20 years when the court will say we are all one race in the eyes of  government.''   Kavanaugh's adoption of Justice Scalia's approach from Adarand  Constructors v. Pena that ``in the eyes of government, we are [all]  just one race'' indicates a belief that the government should be  ``color blind.'' Under this theory, affirmative action and minority  contracting requirements would be constitutionally prohibited.   Those are just some of the issues that I care about and that New  Yorkers care about. I am very troubled about this nominee for so many  reasons--for his record, for his beliefs, for his judicial temperament,  for how he treated women Senators during that hearing.   When we vote on this nomination later today, when we decide whether  Judge Kavanaugh deserves to have the privilege to serve on the Supreme  Court, there is just one fundamental question that I believe should be  on all of our minds when we make this decision: Do we as a country  value women? Does the Supreme Court value women? Does the Senate value  women? Does the President? Most of all, does Brett Kavanaugh value  women?   Millions of Americans--millions of women--are watching us today. They  are waiting to see whether, when a woman comes forward and says she is  a survivor of sexual assault, this Chamber--do the individuals here  take her seriously? Do we listen to her, or do we disregard her and  disbelieve her and patronize her?   The last 2 weeks have been so incredibly painful for women who have  experienced sexual trauma, for survivors all across this country. When  they are watching some of the most powerful people in this country  disregard Dr. Blasey Ford--they distrust her, they disbelieve her, and  they devalue her--it is painful for all of them. It is painful because  they are tired of seeing the same old outcome every single time. They  are tired of the same old scenario where the men are believed and the  women are not. They can't believe their eyes when they see two women  being treated with so little respect and with less of a process than  even Anita Hill received.   One of the worst parts of this process has been that we have been  through it before. Almost three decades ago, Anita Hill sat right where  Dr. Blasey Ford sat. She went through the same kind of cross- examination. She was disbelieved. She was patronized. She was  disrespected. We said we would never put another woman through that. We  said we had learned lessons from that fiasco. We said it would never  happen again, but it did. And I really believe that the process over  the last few weeks was shameful. We should have learned from our  mistakes, and we should be doing much better.   But I can tell you, America's women are watching. They are watching  what our leaders decide to do. They are watching who is listening and  who is not. And they have made a decision that I could have never  imagined or predicted. So many women in this country--and men--have  made the decision since President Trump was elected that they are going  to be heard. They are going to march. They are showing up at townhalls.  They are showing up outside of Federal offices. They are coming to  Washington. They are knocking on Senate doors. They are speaking out.  They are protesting. They are carrying signs. They are speaking their  truth, and they are speaking truth to power in a way they perhaps never  imagined they would do.   They are running for office. Over 200 women are running for Congress  alone as nominees of their party this year--more than ever in the  history of America. They are working hard to right the wrongs that they  see happening in this country.   They know that what makes this country great--what has always made  this country great--is that we have cared about one another, that we  are a country that believes in the golden rule, and that we are a  country that believes you should care about the least among us.  [[Page S6660]]    Every generation has tried to make this country a more perfect union.  Whether it is fighting to end slavery through abolition; whether it is  fighting for basic voting rights for all Americans through the  suffragist movement; whether it is the civil rights movement saying  that equality is necessary in this country and people must be protected  by the law; whether it is the LGBT equality movement to ensure that we  can marry the people we love; whether it is people's desire today to  ensure healthcare as a right and not a privilege, this is what our  country is about.   I deeply feel that the process over these last few months has turned  our backs on that basic desire to bring our country to a more perfect  union, to a place where we value one another.   Do we value women? Unfortunately, for too many in this Chamber, the  answer is no.   I hope the American people are listening. I hope they are watching. I  hope they will fight for what they believe in, their values, and what  this country stands for.   I yield the floor.
