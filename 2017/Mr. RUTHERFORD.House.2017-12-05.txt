 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3731) to provide overtime pay for employees of the United  States Secret Service, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3731         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Service Recruitment       and Retention Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF OVERTIME PAY EXCEPTION THROUGH 2018 FOR                     PROTECTIVE SERVICES.         (a) In General.--The Overtime Pay for Protective Services       Act of 2016 (5 U.S.C. 5547 note) is amended--        (1) in the section heading for section 2, by striking       ``2016'' and inserting ``2016 through 2018''; and        (2) by striking ``during 2016'' each place it appears and       inserting ``during 2016 through 2018''.

SEC. 4. RESCISSIONS.         (a) Rescission of Unobligated Balances in the Department of       Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.--Of the unobligated balances       available under the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture       Fund, $10,000,000 is hereby permanently rescinded.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3731, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3731, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3731, the Secret  Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by my distinguished  colleague, Mr. Katko, and negotiated between the House Judiciary  Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It  would make small, but significant, changes to the Federal law to ensure  that the men and women of the United States Secret Service are fairly  compensated for performing their duties.   This bill is necessary because, under current law, many Secret  Service agents have hit the lawful cap that restricts overtime pay in  some circumstances. This means that the brave men and women standing  post, for example, at 2 a.m. in the morning are doing so for free. This  is, without question, an untenable situation.   H.R. 3731 makes two important changes to the law to address this  problem.   First, it raises the overtime cap to ensure that these agents are  paid.   Second, it includes a reporting requirement, directing the Government  Accountability Office to study the  [[Page H9634]]  Service's implementation of the recommendations of the Protective  Mission Panel, or PMP. This change is intended to help address the  recruitment and retention issues at the Secret Service.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will ensure that the Secret Service is  able to recruit and retain an elite group of dedicated law enforcement  officers. This is an issue that rises above party affiliation, or  ideology. The protection of the President, the First Family, and others  is something that, obviously, we all should want as American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, thank my good friend, Mr. Katko,  who is the original sponsor; and I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of this legislation. We serve on the Homeland Security Committee and  have oversight over the Secret Service, as does the aspects of this  legislation, as relates to Judiciary has oversight as well. So ensuring  that our men and women, who put their lives on the line daily, are  protected is an important initiative. As I said earlier, I am proud to  be an original cosponsor, along with my colleague from New York (Mr.  Katko).   The Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017 is intended  to provide overtime pay for employees of the United States Secret  Service. Currently, the premium pay for protective services, under the  Overtime Pay for Protective Services Act of 2016, has severe earning  limitations, or otherwise caps, which many of these men and women have  reached.   Due to earnings limitations put in place through 5 U.S.C. 5547, many  Secret Service employees are not receiving timely or full payment for  the hours they work. The requirements of protective operations directly  contrast with the intent of an annual pay cap, as the protective  mission requires continued, uninterrupted coverage for our protectees,  beyond the control of the Secret Service. I think that is an important  point.   And I want my colleagues to know that I wholly support that our  protectees are protected wherever they go. But I would be remiss if I  did not express my concern on the number of trips that the Secret  Service today has had to make on outings for entertainment, Mar-a-Lago,  which I think is over 100 times, and the enormous amount of money and  burden that is being placed on the Federal Government.   This does not mean that I do not want these individuals to be  compensated. And might I stop for a moment to thank the Secret Service,  who I have known and have seen working over the years that I have  served in the United States Congress in many different ways. Let me  personally thank them for their service and for their professional  service, dedicated service, and longstanding service and commitment to  sacrificing their life for their protectee.   I would say that this problem often requires individuals to work over  the amount of premium pay, for which they are able to be legally paid,  due to the annual cap. We have seen the extent to which Secret Service  members are stretched in this administration alone. Providing  protection for the President, his family members, and other high  officials requires depth within the agency to ensure protectees are  covered as well as their respective posts when pulled away. As I made  the point, these various family members and President go in many ways  off of the path of their government service related to the people of  the United States.   It is my hope that we are able to eventually work collaboratively on  a more permanent fix to this problem since the Secret Service cannot  administratively control protective overtime, which is dependent on the  schedules of the protectees. Raising the pay cap will aid the Secret  Service in reducing attrition rates and retaining personnel, which is  what this bill purports to do. I truly want to make sure that happens.   Exit interview data indicates the pay cap issue is the number one  concern among employees leaving the Secret Service. We must ensure that  we are employing the best available candidates when dealing with the  protection of America's highest diplomats. Therefore, pay should not be  a deterrence in the recruitment and/or retention of Secret Service  agents, and it is crucial that we retain them.    Departing employees said raising the pay cap would have had an effect  on their decision to leave, and they would have stayed. They are  leaving the Secret Service for other positions in the Federal  Government with equal pay and less travel.   The U.S. Secret Service is currently protecting a historic number of  protectees--about 25 percent more protectees--than during the Obama  administration. In comparison to the previous five Presidential  administrations--Bush 41 to Obama--for the first 6 months in office,  Trump administration Secret Service protectees had more travel stops  and travel days than any other President.   As such, the operational tempo for protective activities have  remained higher than normal. Protective overtime hours for special  agents are about 15 to 20 percent higher when compared to CY 2015, the  last non-Presidential campaign year.   For CY 2017, as of 9-30-17, the Secret Service anticipates  approximately 1,200 personnel will exceed the statutory pay cap.   The costs related to protective overtime in excess of the pay cap for  CY 2017 is estimated at $10.5 million. The same costs are projected for  2018, if the protective tempo remains unchanged.   I, therefore, support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same. Any way that we can help protect the protectees, and keep these  well-experienced, committed, dedicated agents, willing to sacrifice  their lives, from leaving, so that we can also recruit, is a vital step  forward. I hope not only is this bill passed by the House, but I also  hope passed quickly by the Senate to be able to be signed by the  President of the United States.   Ensuring that our men and women, who put their lives on the line  daily, are protected is an important initiative. I am proud to be an  original co-sponsor along with my colleague Mr. Katko from New York.   ``The Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017'' is  intended to provide overtime pay for employees of the United States  Secret Service.

I therefore, support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect our United  States Secret Service personnel and ensure an effective process for  recruitment and retention of these agents.   These agents play a vital role in our democratic system both here at  home and abroad. Their keen attention to details and adequate response  to dangerous situations around the world cannot be measured in dollar  signs.   Beyond protecting the President, Vice-President, their families and  other identified individuals, the Secret Service plays a vital role in  representing the United States interest around the world through  criminal investigation activities that span the gamut from anti- counterfeiting operations to now encompassing financial crimes,  identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and computer-based  attacks on the nation's financial, banking, and telecommunications  infrastructure, among other areas.   For all these reasons, I therefore, support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Katko), my good friend, and sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), who is a member of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the United States Secret Service is one  of the Federal Government's premier law enforcement agencies.   The agency's critical mission is to protect the President, his  family, and other senior government officials. Agency personnel may  also provide protection at high-profile events. It has a zero-fail  mission; therefore, it is vital that the Secret Service is fully  staffed with nothing but the best.   Unfortunately, the agency has faced tremendous staffing problems. The  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a bipartisan  report in 2015, finding the Secret Service has faced challenges related  to hiring and retaining personnel.  [[Page H9636]]                                     time  1245    The report states that the staffing crisis threatens to jeopardize  its critical mission. Staffing issues have persisted, although the  agency has implemented a series of reforms to help get its hiring and  attrition problems under control.   The consequence of these hiring and attrition problems is that the  agency does not have enough personnel to fulfill its zero fail  protective mission. This means existing personnel are working excessive  overtime.   With all the overtime, many Secret Service personnel have reached the  cap on premium pay set in law. As a result, agents are not paid for  overtime hours if doing so would result in compensation above the cap  during any biweekly pay period. These max-outs, as they are known,  contribute to the agency's low morale and unsurprisingly cause the rate  of attrition to spike.   Congress first lifted the pay cap for the Secret Service in 2016 to  help the agency handle the demands of staffing the Presidential  campaign. However, nearly 1,300 employees are at risk of exceeding the  pay cap in 2017.   Due to the extraordinary staffing problems facing the agency, this  bill extends the pay cap waiver provided last year until the end of  2018. Employees will receive compensation up to the basic pay currently  given to members of the Executive Schedule, Level II.   Every Secret Service employee who has exceeded the cap or who is at  risk of doing so because of excessive overtime will receive additional  compensation under this bill.   I want to be clear. This bill is narrowly targeted to fix a problem  currently facing the agency and does so in a timely manner.   The Secret Service cannot continue to rely on expensive overtime, and  Congress fully expects the agency to get its hiring attrition problems  under control. To this end, the bill also requires a report by the  Government Accountability Office focused on the Secret Service's  implementation of recommendations found in the 2014 Protective Mission  Panel report.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the recommendations, which  include reforming the recruiting and hiring process, hiring additional  personnel, and implementing a zero tolerance disciplinary system, are  instructive and will help the Secret Service develop a world class  human resource system.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank the House Judiciary  Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, along with the Oversight  and Government Reform Committee on putting forth this important  legislation and bringing it to the floor in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the extra time and I urge all Members to  support this bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the chairman and ranking member of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other Members to speak on this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me acknowledge Mr. Cummings for his leadership on this  legislation. I believe the combination of Members who are sponsoring  this legislation and the work of the Oversight and Government Reform,  Homeland Security, and Judiciary Committees clearly speak to almost the  crisis of the issue and what we are dealing with.   As we come to a close, Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that my colleagues  will vote for this legislation in resounding numbers and I hope that  the Senate will hotline this legislation so that it can immediately get  to the desk of the President.   I would also ask that we recognize that we must do everything we can  to protect our United States Secret Service personnel and ensure an  effective process for recruitment and retention of these agents.   I am glad there is an element in this legislation that will allow for  a review of all of these issues and that the Congress will have a role  in assessing how we can work with the Secret Service agency to improve  its performance, its retention, and certainly to say to those  hardworking agents that we appreciate them, by way of compensation.   These agents play a vital role in our democratic system both here at  home and abroad. Their keen attention to details and adequate response  to dangerous situations around the world cannot be measured in dollar  signs.   Beyond protecting the President, Vice President, their families, and  other identified individuals, the Secret Service plays a vital role in  representing the United States' interests around the world through  criminal investigation activities that span the gamut from  anticounterfeiting operations to now encompassing financial crimes;  identity theft, which has exponentially grown in the United States;  counterfeiting; computer fraud; and computer-based attacks on the  Nation's financial, banking, and telecommunications infrastructure,  among other areas.   Congress is standing up to make its voice known and to make  appropriate changes.   I think it is appropriate for the administration in this instance,  the Commander in Chief, to stand up as well and review the extensive  travel and the burdens that are being placed on the Secret Service  agents and their families. They are not complaining, but I think it  behooves any good leader to look at what can be improved and what can  be corrected in order to ensure the astuteness, the excellence, and the  safety and security of the protectees and those agents who are out  there on the line sacrificing or willing to sacrifice their life.   For all of these reasons, I therefore support this bill. Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to vote for this legislation, H.R. 3731, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H9637]]    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for helping  to bring this bill to the floor today. I congratulate my good friend  from New York, Mr. Katko, on this legislation. It is going to be very  important to our men and women of the Secret Service who put their  lives on the line every day in dedication to their service.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R.  3731, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3317) to amend title 18, United States Code, to increase the  penalty for female genital mutilation, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3317         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Abusive Female       Exploitation Act of 2017'' or the ``SAFE Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INCREASED PENALTY FOR FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.         Section 116 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       striking ``5 years'' each place it appears and inserting ``15       years''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that States should have in       place laws that require health care professionals, teachers,       and other school employees to report to local law enforcement       agencies any instance of suspected female genital mutilation.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3317, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3317, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3317, the  Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation Act, or the SAFE Act.   This legislation increases the criminal penalty for female genitalia  mutilation of a minor from a maximum of 5 years to a maximum of 15  years. It also encourages States to adopt laws to require certain  professionals who work with children to report suspected mutilation  cases.   Female genitalia mutilation, or FGM, is internationally recognized as  a human rights violation for girls and women. It is an extreme form of  abuse against women and girls, often causing serious and permanent  health complications, including shock and death.   Across at least 30 countries, more than 200 million girls and women  alive today have been subjected to FGM and more than 3 million girls  are estimated to be at risk every year of being subjected to this  procedure even though it is outlawed in 42 countries.   Congress first passed legislation making this horrific practice  illegal in 1996. The Federal Prohibition of Female Genitalia Mutilation  Act made it illegal to perform FGM on girls younger than 18 years of  age in the United States.   In 2013, Congress passed another law, the Transport for Female  Genital Mutilation Act, which amended the 1996 legislation and made it  a crime to knowingly transport a girl out of the United States for the  purpose of FGM, yet the practice still continues. According to some  estimates, the number of girls who have undergone FGM has tripled over  the past 2 decades.   In 2017, after 20 years on the books, the first charges were filed  under the FGM statute against a doctor in Michigan who performed this  disfiguring assault on two 7-year-olds.   By increasing the criminal exposure for this crime, we send a message  that our country will not tolerate the mutilation of our young girls  and women and we will do what we can to prevent that.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Trott from the great State of  Michigan for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Florida for managing  this bill along with the previous initiative, and let me thank Mrs.  Maloney and Mr. Trott for their leadership on this very important  legislation.   Protecting girls and young women from abuse and exploitation is vital  to the health of our communities. The Stopping Abusive Female  Exploitation Act is intended to amend 18 U.S.C. Section 116 by raising  the penalty such that the maximum penalty for the crime of genital  mutilation is 15 years.                                time  1300    Given the abhorrent nature of this practice, States should have in  place laws that require healthcare professionals, school employees, and  other professionals who work with children to report any suspected  practice of female genital mutilation to the appropriate law  enforcement entity.   This legislation is important as a means for Congress to  appropriately punish those who commit this crime. Female genital  manipulation, cutting, is internationally recognized as a violation of  human rights of girls and women. It is currently a crime in 26 States,  including Michigan and Texas. It is also a Federal crime.   Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated, cut, every hour.  An estimated 100 million girls and 140 million women worldwide are  living with the consequences of FGM. Despite the fact that FGM has been  banned in the United States since 1996, people continue to engage in  this abusive practice.   Recently, Michigan was faced with the first Federal prosecution under  this statute, whereby a Michigan doctor was charged with performing  female genital mutilation on two girls that crossed State lines.  Because this intolerable practice has no medical benefits, it has no  place in our society, and those who commit these horrendous crimes  should be held accountable for their actions. I, therefore, ask support  for this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H9638]]    Protecting girls and young women from abuse and exploitation is vital  to the health of our communities.   ``The Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation Act of 2017'' is intended  to amend 18 U.S.C. Sec.  116 by increasing the maximum penalty for the  crime of female genital mutilation (FGM) from five years to fifteen.   Given the abhorrent nature of this practice, States should have in  place laws that require health care professionals, school employees and  other professionals that work with children, to report any suspected  practice of female genital mutilation, to the appropriate law  enforcement entity.   I support this legislation as a means for Congress to appropriately  punish those that commit this crime.   Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is internationally  recognized as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It is  currently a crime in 26 states, including Michigan and Texas. It is  also a federal crime.   Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated/cut every hour.  An estimated 100 million girls and 140 million women worldwide are  living with the consequences of FGM.   Despite the fact that FGM has been banned in the United States since  1996, people continue to engage in this abusive practice.   Recently, Michigan was faced with the first federal prosecution under  this statute, whereby, a Michigan doctor was charged with performing  female genital mutilation on two girls that crossed state-lines.   Because this intolerable practice has no medical benefits, it has no  place in our society and those who commit these horrendous crimes  should be held accountable for their actions.   I therefore, support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect victims,  particularly, the most vulnerable people in our society, our children.   This bill will certainly do that. Beyond serving as a deterrence for  many in our society that continue to engage in the practice of female  genital mutilation, this legislation will also provide a more  appropriate punishment for violation of the FGM statute, under 18  U.S.C. Sec.  116.   For all these reasons, I therefore, support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the  House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Again, let me thank the gentleman from Florida for managing and  joining me in the managing of this legislation, and, again, I thank the  cosponsors.   Let me also express my appreciation to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Trott) for his service to this Congress and, as well, for his  excellent bill that is on the floor.   I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), as  well, for her leadership on this legislation.   I think it is important to note that these are dastardly acts against  women and girls; and as I indicated, across the world, we are talking  about 140 million women and 100 million girls who have been subjected  to living with the consequences of the FGM. It was banned in the United  States since 1996, but we know this act still goes on. So we must do  everything we can to protect victims, particularly the most vulnerable  people in our society: our children.   This is not a mandatory minimum. This is upwards of 15 years. This is  a deserving penalty for a horrific crime. This bill will certainly do  that to try to protect these children here in the United States.   Beyond serving as a deterrent for many in our society who continue to  engage in the practice of female genital mutilation, this legislation  will also provide appropriate punishment for violation of the FGM  statute under 18 U.S.C. 116.   For all these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would first like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for helping to  manage these two very important bills on the floor today.   I, too, want to congratulate Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Trott on H.R. 3317,  to ban this horrible procedure of FGM and really help to protect the  women and girls of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
