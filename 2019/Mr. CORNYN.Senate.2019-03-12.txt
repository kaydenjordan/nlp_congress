 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will continue to  fill vacancies across the Federal bench.   This afternoon, we will vote to confirm Paul Matey to be U.S. Circuit  Court Judge for the Third Circuit, and then we will move to the  nomination of Neomi Rao for a seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals-- the seat that was vacated by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.   Throughout her career, Ms. Rao has served in all three branches of  government. She clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme  Court and Judge Harvie Wilkinson on the Fourth Circuit Court of  Appeals. She also worked here in the Senate on the Judiciary Committee  for then-Chairman Orrin Hatch.   She has worked as Associate Counsel and Special Assistant to  President George W. Bush and in her current position as Administrator  for the Office of Administration and Regulatory Affairs--one of the  most important and least understood Federal Agencies.   In addition to her outstanding career in public service, Ms. Rao was  also an associate professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George  Mason University and is a leading scholar in the field of  administrative law.   Knowing her impressive background, it was no surprise to see that the  American Bar Association, once hailed by the minority leader as the  ``gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged,'' rated her as  ``well qualified.''   When considering this particular seat, it is hard to imagine anyone  better prepared. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has sometimes been  referred to as the ``second highest court in the land'' and is unique  because its caseload is disproportionately weighted toward  administrative law and litigation involving the Federal Government.   Despite her outstanding qualifications, our Democratic colleagues  have attempted to tank Ms. Rao's nomination over decades-old writings.  That sounds pretty familiar, although, as I recall, Justice Kavanaugh  was excoriated for things in his high school yearbook. At least we have  moved on to college when it comes to Ms. Rao.   During her confirmation hearing last month, critics reverted back to  that Kavanaugh playbook and began criticizing her for things she wrote  in college rather than asking her productive questions about maybe what  she has learned since that time or how her views may have changed or  how she has functioned as head of the OIRA or how her office has  reduced regulatory costs by more than $23 billion. Instead, critics  chose to focus on her decades-old writings in college.   Over the years, Ms. Rao has done what we have all done: She has grown  and learned from her experiences. She has repeatedly said that she no  longer holds the views that she wrote about back in college.   I believe we should judge a nominee not by views they expressed in  high school or college but what they have done since that time as  mature adults and professionals. So just add me to the long list of  people who believe Neomi Rao should be confirmed for the DC Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Two dozen former Supreme Court clerks who worked alongside Rao sent a  letter to the Judiciary Committee, touting her qualifications. They  said:         Many of us have worked in government, at both the federal       and state levels, some for Democrats and some for       Republicans. . . . While our professional and personal paths       may have diverged, one of things we have always shared is       admiration for Neomi. We are confident she will serve our       country well on the DC Circuit.    We have seen similar letters from her classmates at both Yale and the  University of Chicago Law School, as well as a group of more than 50 of  her former law students.   Her former students wrote:         Our views span the political spectrum; we have differing       positions on the role and work of the Federal judiciary; and       we have gone on to work in law firms, government, public       interest organizations, and judges' chambers. Yet despite her       differences, we all agree that Professor Rao would make an       outstanding addition to the bench. We have no doubt that, if       confirmed, she would be a brilliant and fair arbiter of the       cases that came before her.    I agree.   I supported Ms. Rao's nomination in the Senate Judiciary Committee,  and I will once again look forward to supporting her nomination when  the full Senate votes on her nomination this week.
