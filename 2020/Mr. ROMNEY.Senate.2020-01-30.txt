 I have a question to send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Romney is for both parties, and I believe  the House manager will go first:         Do you have any evidence that anyone was directed by       President Trump to tell the Ukrainians that security       assistance was being held upon the condition of an       investigation into the Bidens?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, the evidence that is currently in the  record--there are two people who had direct conversations with the  President about the conditioning of aid on the performance of the  investigations. The first was Gordon Sondland, who on September 7 had a  conversation with the President that thereafter he relayed to Tim  Morrison as well as Ambassador Taylor. And in the conversation that  Ambassador Sondland described at the time, he said the President on the  one hand said no quid pro quo but then went on to say that Zelensky has  to announce these investigations and he should want to.   So the President made the direct link to Ambassador Sondland.  Ambassador Sondland then made a direct link--or had already made the  direct link to Andriy Yermak. But the conversation with--the President  had a conversation with Zelensky himself and conveyed what he had been  informed by the President, that Zelensky was going to have to conduct  these investigations. And that is when Zelensky made the commitment to  go on CNN.   So Ambassador Sondland has acknowledged the tie between the two. So  did Mick Mulvaney. And I think that video is now etched in our minds  for all of history. Trying to walk that back as he may, he was quite  adamant when he was asked about that, and the reporter even followed up  when he said that part of the reason why they held up the aid was the  desire for this investigation into 2016. And the reporter said: Well,  what you are saying is a quid pro quo. You don't get the money unless  you do the investigation of the Democrats. And the Chief of Staff's  answer was: ``We do that all the time; get over it.''   So you have it from the President's own Chief of Staff. You have it  from one of the three amigos, the President's point people. And bear in  mind, Ambassador Sondland--of course, not a Never Trumper; a million- dollar donor to the Trump inaugural; someone the President deputized to  have a significant part of the Ukraine portfolio; someone who, given he  is an EU Ambassador, if this was about burden-sharing, would have said  this was about burden-sharing, but he didn't, of course. He said it was  about the investigations.   The third direct witness would be John Bolton if we are allowed to  bring him before you.   But there already are witnesses and evidence in the record of people  who spoke directly to the President about this and to which the  conditionality was made clear.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for your  question.   I believe the question was, is there any evidence that anyone told-- that President Trump had anyone tell the Ukrainians directly that the  aid was linked? I believe that was the question, and the answer in the  House record is no. I described this on Saturday when I walked through  it at length, and so I refer back to that presentation.   Ambassador Sondland and Senator Johnson. Ambassador Sondland  indicated in approximately the September 9 timeframe--as we all heard  his statement, he asked the President. The President said: ``I want  nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.''   And you heard a lot from the House managers about, go out to the  microphones or make this--do the right thing. But I believe the  statement was, he needs to do the right thing. He needs to do what he  campaigned on.   Even early, Senator Johnson--again, because Ambassador Sondland told  Senator Johnson that there was a linkage. So Senator Johnson asked the  President directly, and we know the answer to that. The President said:  Was there any connection--when Senator Johnson asked if there was any  connection between security assistance and investigations, the  President answered: ``No way. I would never do  [[Page S738]]  that. Who told you that?'' And the answer was Sondland. And Ambassador  Sondland had come to that presumption prior to speaking to the  President. And we saw the montage from Ambassador Sondland about  presumptions and assumptions and guessing and speculating and belief.  So we also remember the montage in which Ambassador Sondland was asked:  Did anyone on the planet tell you that the aid was linked to the  investigations? And his answer was no.   So in the House record before us, there is no evidence that the  President told anyone to tell the Ukrainians that the aid was linked.  And, in fact, the article from the Daily Beast yesterday--   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Counsel.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Thank you, Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Oregon.
