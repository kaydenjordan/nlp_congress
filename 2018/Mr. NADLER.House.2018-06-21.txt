 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 4760.   This legislation is nothing more than a wish-list of the far right  anti-immigrant fringe. It would do nothing to solve the real problems  plaguing our immigration system, while causing untold suffering for  millions of people.   The world has watched President Trump create a family separation  crisis out of thin air. I personally met with fathers whose children  had been ripped from their arms, who have no idea when, or if, they  will ever see their children again.   One father I spoke to was promised he would be kept with his young  child, only to have officers enter his room in the middle of the night  and forcibly take away his young daughter.   We have all seen the anguished faces of the parents separated from  their children, and listened to the desperate cries of sobbing children  screaming for their parents. This is government-sponsored child abuse.   This bill does absolutely nothing to solve the crisis. The President,  after falsely claiming that he had no choice but to enact this cruel  and brutal policy, now says he will end it, proving that he and his  administration were lying all along. But it is not clear that  yesterday's executive order immediately ends family separation. It also  puts our country on a dangerous path to prolonged detention for parents  and children.   The Keeping Families Together Act, which I introduced this week,  along with virtually every Democratic Member, would actually prevent  children from being separated from their parents, except in  extraordinary circumstances.   We could vote on that legislation today. But instead, we have this  bill before us now. This bill turns all undocumented immigrants into  criminals. It takes particular aim at families, children, workers,  businesses, public safety, and our fundamental values as a nation, all  at once. It is almost impressive how many bad ideas have been crammed  into one comprehensive package.   For example, it eliminates most visa categories that promote family  reunification, as well as the diversity visa program, which provides  residents of many countries the only method of immigrating to the  United States. It removes critical protections for unaccompanied  children, and it does away with other important safeguards for children  traveling with their parents.   It would decimate the agriculture community by requiring employers to  use the E-Verify employment verification system without fixing the  underlying immigration system. And it would undercut American workers  by importing guestworkers at drastically depressed wages.   It would also undermine our asylum system, breaking with our proud  tradition of being a beacon of hope and freedom for the oppressed.   In exchange for all these harsh, anti-immigrant provisions, it offers  the most minimal protections to Dreamers, creating a renewable  temporary status with no path to citizenship, leaving them in perpetual  limbo, and unable to become full members of society in the only country  they have ever known.   This is an act of extortion we cannot abide. This bill fails to  repair our broken immigration system and, indeed, in many ways, makes  it even worse, and all without substantially helping the Dreamers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the  Immigration Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining, please?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, this afternoon, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce sent an alert to Members of Congress that says the cuts to  legal immigration in this bill are bad news for States.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).  [[Page H5428]]                                     time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking member of the Immigration  and Border Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a harsh anti-immigrant package that fails  to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and that fails to end  family separation, while slashing legal immigration, crippling our  agriculture industry, criminalizing undocumented immigrants,  undermining public safety, and removing critical protection for  families and children, all in one monstrous bill.   Mr. Speaker, there is no justification for anyone voting for this  bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 6136. Far from being the  moderate and compromise bill that has been advertised, this bill is  extreme and unreasonable. This bill eliminates the diversity visa  program and cuts off even children and brothers and sisters from  reunifying with their families.   The bill even revokes the approval of over 3 million family members  who have been waiting for years to reunify with their U.S. citizen  brothers, sisters, and parents.   While it claims to end President Trump's cruel family separation  policy, nothing in the bill actually prohibits family separation or  limits criminal prosecutions. And the bill requires the long-term  detention of families and children while actually removing requirements  that detention facilities be safe, sanitary, and appropriate for  children.   It eliminates important asylum protections and would protect many  bona fide asylum seekers from even applying for protection in the first  place.   In addition, this legislation spends $23.4 billion to fund Donald  Trump's offensive and unnecessary border wall.   Finally and most importantly, this bill fails to provide a certain  path to citizenship for the Dreamers.   Donald Trump created havoc when he made the decision to strip legal  status from young Americans who were brought to the U.S. as young  children and who know only this country as their own. The Republican  leadership repeatedly announced that they intended to protect the  Dreamers. Now we see their supposed solution, and it is a half measure  at best that leaves far too many Dreamers behind.   The bill's stringent eligibility requirements would likely cut off  millions of Dreamers from eligibility to the bill's legalization  program. To those who would be eligible, the bill establishes a long  and difficult road to permanent residence, never mind to citizenship.  Because of the limited number of visas made available, it would force  applicants to wait for up to 23 years for permanent residence.   Most appalling, if even $1 of border wall funding is ever transferred  or rescinded by a future Congress, the long and difficult path to  permanent residence would be canceled entirely. This would effectively  hold the Dreamers hostage to every future appropriations battle.   Now, we know the Republicans refer to this bill as a compromise, but  it is not a compromise when you excluded the Democrats from  negotiations.   There is, in fact, a compromise bipartisan bill, the Hurd-Aguilar  bill, that actually provides a meaningful path to citizenship for  Dreamers and doesn't bog the bill down in different considerations  about the wall or about diversity visas or about family legislation.  [[Page H5483]]  Those are separate issues and should be debated separately if you want  to redeem your promise to the Dreamers.   This bill is hypocritical, because it doesn't redeem the promise to  the Dreamers and bogs it down in other issues, which we know will  probably result in the bill never going anywhere.   Do not be fooled by this legislation. It is not moderate, it is not a  compromise, it does not solve the Dreamer issue. It reflects the  Republican majority's decision to keep a real Dreamer bill, the Hurd- Aguilar bill, off the floor.   It is yet one more extreme measure by the Republican majority that  fails to solve the real issues plaguing our immigration system and  betrays the promise to the Dreamers.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the  Immigration Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, the President of the United States and the Speaker of  the House promised to solve the problem of the Dreamers and to give  them a path to citizenship. This bill does not do that except for 23  years, and it makes them hostage to other things such as the gentleman  from Georgia talked about.   We do not agree, many of us, that we should go away from family-based  unification. We do not agree on the four pillars. The President agrees  with that. Some of the Republicans agree with that. We ought to debate  that separately and have a bill that takes care of the Dreamers, as the  President and the Speaker promised, instead of holding them hostage to  all these other things that we don't agree to and that shouldn't be  held hostage. We should have a clean DACA bill like Hurd-Aguilar.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Will the House vote on this measure tonight?    Mr. Speaker, will the House vote tomorrow?    Mr. Speaker, can the Chair advise when the House will  vote on the measure?    Mr. Speaker, under the rule, the minority, the Democrats,  are entitled the offer one final amendment in the form of a motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, when will we have that opportunity?    Mr. Speaker, we normally have that opportunity during  debate.   Mr. Speaker, will we have that opportunity in debate tonight?    Mr. Speaker, I understand that.   Mr. Speaker, will we have the opportunity, as part of that debate, to  offer the amendment in the form of a motion to recommit, as is our  right during debate?    Mr. Speaker, I take it that we will be able to offer that  motion to recommit before we finish debate tonight.    Mr. Speaker, you didn't answer my question, sir.   Mr. Speaker, we are, of course, entertaining debate on the bill now.  The motion to recommit is part of that debate, and my question is: Will  we be permitted to offer that motion to recommit before we finish  debate tonight?    Mr. Speaker, there may be.   Mr. Speaker, if the Chair can't answer, perhaps the chairman of the  committee can answer that question about the motion to recommit.   Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Speaker, can the chairman perhaps comment on when the  House will vote on this bill?    Mr. Speaker, for what purpose are we debating this bill  tonight if we cannot guarantee when or if we will vote?   Let me rephrase the question.   Mr. Speaker, can the Chair guarantee that we will, in fact, vote on  this bill at some point?    Mr. Speaker, I am asking the Acting Speaker right now. I  think the mace is up, so Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, we are entertaining debate on the bill,  obviously, but can the Chair guarantee that we will, in fact, vote on  this bill at some point? Otherwise, why are we wasting time?    Mr. Speaker, can the Chair guarantee that we will have  the opportunity, as guaranteed under the rules, to offer our motion to  recommit, whether or not we ever vote on this bill?    Mr. Speaker, the Chair will not guarantee that the rule  will be adhered to and give us the opportunity to offer that motion?    Mr. Speaker, the Chair is being very forthcoming.   Mr. Speaker, I do assume that we will have the opportunity to offer  our motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I further assume that at some point we will vote on this  bill, otherwise, everything the majority has said about why it is being  offered would be a little less than honest.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this supposed compromise bill is a sham. It fails to  cover all Dreamers or to provide them with a certain path to  citizenship. It fails to end the Trump family separation policy. It  revokes critical protections for detained children and families. It  eliminates important asylum protections. It makes communities less  safe, and it slashes legal family immigration.   At every step of the way, this bill attacks family unity. It attacks  immigrant communities, it attacks common decency, and it evades  fulfilling the pledge of the Speaker and the President that we will  solve the problem and allow a path to citizenship for the Dreamers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report by the Cato Institute  titled: ``House GOP Bill Cuts Legal Immigration by 1.4 Million Over 20  Years.''                   [From CATO at Liberty, June 21, 2018]     House GOP Bill Cuts Legal Immigration by 1.4 Million Over 20 Years                    (By David Bier and Stuart Anderson)         The House is scheduled to vote tomorrow on a bill--the       Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, the supposed GOP       compromise bill. The authors claim in their bill summary that       ``the overall number of visas issued will not change,'' yet       that is simply incorrect. In fact, the proposal would reduce       legal immigration at least 1.4 million over 20 years.        The bill would reduce the number of legal immigrants in       five ways: 1) eliminating the diversity visa lottery, 2)       ending sponsorship of married adult children of U.S.       citizens, 3) ending sponsorship of siblings of U.S. citizens,       4) restricting asylum claims, and 5) indirectly by       restricting overall immigration, which will lead to fewer       sponsorships of spouses, minor children, and parents of       naturalized citizens years later. The bill partially offsets       these effects by increasing employer-sponsored immigration       and by granting permanent residency to some Dreamers in the       United States, but the net effect is still strongly negative.        Table 1 breaks down the cuts to legal immigration by       category over the 20-year period from 2020 to 2039. The net       effect is a reduction in legal immigration of 1.4 million       including Dreamers or 2.1 million not counting Dreamers       toward the total. This is a cut of 7 percent or 10 percent in       the number of legal immigrants that would have been allowed       to enter under current law.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
