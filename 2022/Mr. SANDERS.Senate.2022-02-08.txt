 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included authority in section 4009 to  allow the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to adjust budget  aggregates and committee allocations after the enactment of bipartisan  infrastructure legislation. Similarly, the reserve fund in section 3003  allows the chairman to revise these levels as well as make adjustments  to the pay-as-you-go ledger for legislation that would not increase the  deficit over the period of 2022 to 2031.   H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was enacted on  November 15, 2021, meets the conditions of being bipartisan  infrastructure legislation. As a result, I am revising the budget  spending aggregates and the allocation to the Committee on  Appropriations by $3,230 million in outlays resulting from the increase  in contract authority included in that bill.   Furthermore, the combined budgetary impact of the direct spending and  revenue provisions in that bill reduce the deficit over 10 years. The  Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3684 will decrease  nonemergency mandatory outlays by $3.7 billion in 2022 and by almost  $90 billion over the period 2022 through 2031. Revenues will increase  by more than $8 billion in 2022 and more than $50 billion over the  period 2022 through 2031. As such, I am revising the spending and  revenue aggregates and the allocation to the Committee on Environment  and Public Works by the relevant amounts. I am also revising the Senate  pay-as-you-go scorecard. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  also increased discretionary spending; that spending is designated as  an emergency and is therefore excluded from enforceable budgetary  spending levels and committee allocations.   Finally, section 4004 of the budget resolution allows the chairman to  adjust budgetary levels for legislation containing disaster relief  funding. I am increasing the outlay allocation to the Committee on  Appropriations by $89 million as a result of passage of H.R. 5305, the  Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act,  which was enacted on September 30, 2021.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE SENATE  [Revisions Pursuant to Section 3003 of S. Con.
