 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cawthorn for his  leadership on behalf of working families, small business--of which he  is one--for getting this economy going again. I thank him for allowing  me to be part of this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, when President Biden promised to focus on climate  change, I didn't realize he meant changing the climate of the U.S.  economy by cooling off the jobs recovery. The President inherited a  strong recovery, life-saving vaccines, a reopening economy, and  trillions of dollars in COVID stimulus.   Yet, in his first 5 months of this year, America is nearly 550,000  fewer jobs than in the last 5 months of 2020 under President Trump-- 550,000 fewer jobs. Inflation is running twice as high as wage growth.  In fact, for Americans, their pocketbook, their paycheck has actually  declined in buying power since President Biden took office.   America's jobs recovery ought to be surging, but instead, April/May  reports were just disastrous. Main Street businesses, Congressman  Cawthorn, as you said, they are struggling to find workers.   Labor force participation is back in the 1970s. Inflation has hit a  13-year high, and a lot of Americans are fearful about the impact of  rising prices and slow growth economy when the sugar high from all this  COVID stimulus goes away, which is exactly what President Biden's  budget admits will do.   This President is sabotaging America's jobs recovery, with crippling  tax increases and antibusiness policies that hurt working families and  Main Street businesses and drive U.S. jobs overseas.   Treasury Secretary Yellen, the other day, conceded that just as you  heard tonight, these lavish Federal employment bonuses really are  hurting Main Street and hurting hiring. Thankfully, half of American  States, including one blue State, have opted out of these benefits to  help reconnect workers and help our economy survive.   A recent analysis of the Ways and Means' staff shows that Congress  has  [[Page H3126]]  already approved, for an average family of four, where both parents are  out of work, we have already approved over $109,000 in stimulus checks,  unemployment checks, and child checks.   We were incredibly generous during COVID to help people get back on  their feet, defeat this virus, and move back. But the time for  emergency spending is over; the time for endless government checks is  over. We cannot become the Olive Garden of never-ending government  checks. It won't help people rebuild their lives. It won't help us  rebuild the economy.   Unfortunately, because of these Federal bonuses on unemployment, we  are seeing a record 9.3 million unfilled jobs. It is hurting Main  Street businesses; they are struggling. And frankly, it will hurt  families who are not going to be able to reconnect again when all these  checks run out. And our job creators shouldn't have to compete with the  Federal Government.   Instead of helping America get back to work, the Biden administration  is pushing crippling tax hikes that will cost us millions of new jobs.  I am proud to have led, on behalf of President Trump in a Republican  Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced tax cuts across the  board, or reduced taxes across the board, redesigned our Tax Code so  American businesses could compete and win anywhere in the world.   It made America the most competitive economy on the planet, lifted  millions of Americans out of poverty, and stopped U.S. businesses from  moving overseas. But now, we face a big risk. President Biden's  insistence on repealing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will cost 6 million  U.S. jobs. For that family of four, middle class, making maybe $73,000  a year, it will rob their family budget of over $20,000 over time.   The attack on American energy will cut jobs by 1.5 million U.S. jobs  and repealing stepped-up basis on family farms will cost us another 1  million jobs over 12 years.   Congressman Cawthorn's efforts to lead commonsense proposals, stop  these crippling tax increases, and get the economy back on task is  exactly what our country needs today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for letting me join him.                                time  1800
