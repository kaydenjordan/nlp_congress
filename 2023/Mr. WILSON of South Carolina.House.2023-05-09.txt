 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful as chairman  of the U.S. Helsinki Commission to have led a bipartisan congressional  delegation to Germany, Poland, and Ukraine with Representatives   Steve  Cohen and Victoria Spartz.   In Berlin, we met with Justice State Secretary Dr. Angelika Schlunck,  National Security Advisor Jens Ploetner, Ministry of Foreign Affairs  State Secretary Andreas Michaelis, and Ministry of Defense Director  Jasper Wieck.   After visiting Nuremberg, Lieutenant General Andrew Rohling welcomed  the delegation to the 7th Army Grafenwoehr Training Area and the 10th  Mountain Division trainers.   At Bucha, Ukraine, survivors of the war criminal Putin's mass murder  shared stories with us, and Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk joined us.  Additionally, we were joined by U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink, U.S.  Ambassador Mike Carpenter, and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov to  thank America for the support given to efforts in Ukraine prior to  meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who emphasized his  gratitude for the American commitment for democracy.   We concluded in Warsaw with U.S. Ambassador Mark Brzezinski and  Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Arkadiusz Mularczyk.   Friends of democracy are inspired by the courageous Ukrainians  supported by our valued allies of Germany and Poland.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we appreciate your service  for the citizens of Missouri.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Israel is a shining beacon of democracy in the Middle  East. As she celebrates her 75th anniversary, I appreciate being joined  by my colleagues to mark this important milestone of affirming our  support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.   As chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on  the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, I am grateful to mark  the historic 75th anniversary of Israel with a strong commitment to the  partnership of our two countries.   Since its creation, the United States has supported the Jewish state  with bipartisan support from Congress, working to build a strong  security, intelligence, and defense relationship enshrined by shared  values and mutually strategic interests.   A strong and secure Israel is a vital pillar of the national security  policy of America in the Middle East for mutual benefit of stability  for all countries of the Middle East.   Congress has continually worked to support Israel with annual  security assistance, defense cooperation, and an emerging relationship  in key areas, including agriculture, high tech, homeland security,  cybersecurity, science, space, and health.   Both of our countries are committed to democracy and justice, and we  continue to look for new ways to integrate Israel into the region, such  as expanding the historic Abraham Accords that were promoted by  President Donald Trump that normalized ties between Israel and our Arab  allies--the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan.   Instead of boycotts and isolation, I am encouraged that our Gulf  allies see the future of Israel as working with the Middle East to  tackle regional problems.   Most importantly, Congress has marked the historic Abraham Accords by  passing the Israel Relations Normalization Act of 2021 and encouraging  more of our Middle East allies to deepen and expand their cooperation  with Israel.   Israel is the democratic anchor of the Middle East, and Congress will  continue to support important regional cooperation through partnerships  for peace and prosperity, including the Negev Forum.   We support Israel's right to defend herself against terrorism, and we  are inspired by the Israeli resistance in the face of mounting threats.  The borders of Israel are continually threatened by Iranian-backed  groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   Congress reaffirms its support for Israel's security by annually  funding $500 million for cooperative missile defense programs to help  Israel meet these growing threats funded by the Iranian regime.   Without lifesaving defensive systems like the Iron Dome, David's  Sling, and Arrow 3, both Israelis and Arabs living in the region would  be more endangered than ever.   Israel is also threatened by continued efforts of the Iranian regime  to get nuclear weapons. We are all concerned by the Iranian regime  advancement of highly enriched uranium, advanced centrifuges, and its  ballistic missile program, which it has never stopped despite every  effort of the Iran nuclear deal, which was such a fraud.   Sadly, the Iranians never stopped developing ICBMs to attack Israel  and attack, ultimately, of course, sadly, the people of the United  States.   When the extremists chant ``death to America, death to Israel,'' they  pledge to wipe Israel off the map by vaporization.   We will continue to support efforts to enforce sanctions on the  Iranian regime to cut off their resources and commitment to obtaining  nuclear weapons.   As we look to the growing challenges ahead and compete with the  Chinese Communist Party, we must continue to work with our trusted and  strategic ally to advance U.S. interests, as we also need to address  war criminal Putin in his invasion, aggression, and mass murder being  conducted, sadly, in Ukraine as we speak tonight.   I am grateful to have authored H.R. 1777, the United States-Israel  Future of Warfare Act, to meet increasing threats in areas of emerging  technology by establishing a research and development fund to deepen  defense collaboration with Israel.   Having visited Israel on several occasions, including the opening of  the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, a highlight of my service has  been to lead the House delegation to the U.S. Embassy May 14 opening in  Jerusalem with Ambassador David Friedman, fulfilling promises made,  promises kept by President Donald Trump.   I will always cherish the warmth of the people, and I am grateful to  partner with our ally in the charge ahead to prepare and confront the  challenges of the next 75 years.   May the U.S.-Israel relationship continue to flourish. May we  continue to promote our shared interests in supporting democracy,  peace, and cooperation throughout the region.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Strong).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  Gottheimer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  LaMalfa. We appreciate his leadership and tireless efforts on behalf of  the people of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, over the last week, I have had an extraordinary  opportunity to truly appreciate the people of Jewish faith and what  they have had to face. I visited Nuremburg in Germany, Courtroom 600,  where the Nazi leadership anti-Semites were convicted of the Holocaust,  murdering 6 million Jews. I was there to see the site of where these  perpetrators, these Nazi murderers were ultimately executed.   Additionally, I had the opportunity over the weekend to visit Warsaw,  Poland, the extraordinary people today of Poland, where I witnessed the  Museum of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, where Jews heroically resisted  the mass murder by the Nazis as the Soviets, sadly, were adjacent,  shamefully stood by within sight of the city of Warsaw and did not  help.   This really reminds us that the Russian people have been abused in  the past by their leadership, whether it be Joseph Stalin or now-war  criminal Putin. However, the people of Poland have resumed, they have  the second fastest growing economy in the world, as they have escaped  from Communist totalitarian oppression. So we know that ultimately good  will prevail, as we see in the State of Israel today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. McCormick).                                time  2150     Mr. Speaker, as we proceed, it should  always be remembered that the United States and Israel have a long  experience of a strong mutual beneficial relationship based on shared  values and security interests, while also promoting peace and regional  stability.   The United States and Israel face many shared threats. It is critical  that Israel and the United States are at the forefront of emerging  technology.   I was grateful to introduce the bipartisan U.S.-Israel Future of  Warfare Act of 2023, which provides for collaboration between the two  countries in the areas of defense, artificial intelligence,  cybersecurity, and directed energy. This is done in a bipartisan manner  with Congressmen   Steve Cohen of Tennessee,   David Cicilline of Rhode  Island, and Dean Phillips of Minnesota. Over and over again, this is  bipartisan, and I am grateful that we worked together to promote our  shared mutual interests with the people of Israel.   Israel's experience in combating terrorism is an invaluable resource  in developing strategies to protect American families. The U.S.-Israel  partnership supports over 255,000 American jobs. Bilateral trade has  grown to over $49 billion annually.   Israel is the leader in healthcare development. From cancer  development to emergency response, Israel is a trusted partner to  improve quality of life around the world.   As we conclude this evening, I would point out that my appreciation  of the Jewish State of Israel is something that I was born with. I was  very grateful to be born in the holy city of Charleston, South  Carolina.   As we claim holy, it is not to disparage Jerusalem. We just have a  significant number of churches that legitimately it can be the holy  city of Charleston.   Growing up in Charleston, a very important fact is that at the time  of the American Revolution the largest Jewish population in the New  World was in Charleston, South Carolina.   The first provincial constitution to recognize Judaism as a religion  was the provincial constitution of the province of South Carolina.   The first Jewish elected official was in the provincial assembly of  South Carolina.   Sadly, the first Jewish American patriot killed in the American  Revolution was in Charleston, South Carolina.   The people of South Carolina just cherish our relationship with the  people of Jewish faith, and we are strong supporters of the State of  Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 54 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 10, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
