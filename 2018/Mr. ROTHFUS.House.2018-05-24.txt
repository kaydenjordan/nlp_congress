 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, the Nation sets aside time to  remember those who gave all for our country.   Thousands will travel to Washington, D.C., for the annual Rolling  Thunder motorcycle ride to remember and honor the fallen, and millions  across the country will participate in parades or gather around  monuments and parks to recall a loved one or a neighbor who never came  home. There will be the playing of ``Taps'' and heartfelt and silent  whispers of: I miss you; I wish I could see you; and thank you.   Memorial Day is truly a national holiday in that it is a day that  politics are avoided, and given some of the debates we have been having  and what you see on TV, that is not a bad thing.   When you visit Arlington Cemetery or any of the national cemeteries  across the country, including the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies,  not far from my district, the gravestones don't mark one's party  affiliation. Rather, the simplicity of the stones remind us that they  were Americans, they served, and that they are remembered.   May God grant eternal rest to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice  to our country, and may He bless the families of the fallen with His  tender mercies.                            ____________________
