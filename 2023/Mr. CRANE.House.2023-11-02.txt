 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment,  which utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of the CEQ chair.   CEQ, in how it operates and what it prioritizes, is not doing its job  properly, especially regarding its implementation of NEPA. The Council  only focuses on the negative side effects of certain types of energy  production without considering cost-effective energy.   The Trump administration introduced reforms to remedy some of the  worst elements of this hyperpoliticized regime at CEQ and to facilitate  more efficient and timely permitting reviews.   Having unwisely reversed those reforms, President Biden and Ms.  Mallory are now grappling with regulatory barriers that hinder critical  infrastructure. As a result, the public will be deprived of much-needed  energy infrastructure.                                time  1845    Affordable and abundant energy is essential for a secure and  prosperous country. NEPA is now out of sync with current environmental,  political, social, and economic realities, with Ms. Mallory  spearheading its exacerbation and failures.   The average American family is now spending about $2,400 more today  than when President Biden took office. I have constituents who can  barely pay their energy bills solely because the administration chose  to raise their electric rates to pay for its Green New Deal agenda,  almost doubling some Arizonans' bills.   If Congress doesn't act to reverse Biden's energy crisis now, it may  not be long before more Americans can't afford soaring energy costs.   Ms. Mallory's incompetence has shown that Congress should reduce her  salary.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the bottom line is that the American people are  tired of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., affecting a policy that is  destroying their lives. That is why we are doing this.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment,  which defunds Public Land Order No. 7923.   In June, the Biden administration issued this public land order  banning over 300,000 acres of Federal mineral estate surrounding the  Chaco Culture National Historical Park for 20 years. This would  effectively prevent all private landowners and Navajo allottees from  mineral leasing land in this area.   The ban will have significant negative economic impacts on both the  Navajo Nation and American taxpayers, severely limiting Tribal revenue,  economic development, self-sufficiency, and American energy production.   Chaco Canyon carries both cultural and historical significance for  communities in the region. The development of this land should be  determined by those with lawful sovereignty, not out-of-touch Biden  administration officials hellbent on imposing their radical agenda on  Tribal communities.   In July, the House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the  ban, and we heard from Navajo Nation citizens who expressed  disappointment with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and the Bureau of  Land Management for stripping away their mineral rights. The government  of the Navajo Nation has called on Congress to oppose any buffer zone  in the area.   The Biden administration's decision to move forward with this ban  makes it clear that they only care about Tribal voices so long as they  are in line with the approved Biden agenda.   Interestingly, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, when serving in  Congress, worked on a lease sale that was ultimately deferred. She had  complained that the Trump administration failed to fulfill its legal  and moral obligation to consult with Native Americans.   The Biden administration, of which Secretary Haaland is a part, is  now opposing an unprecedented blockade on Native mineral rights and has  refused to listen to the Navajo Nation's concerns.   Mr. Chair, this administration likes to talk about their supposed  support of Tribal communities but has no problem implementing a  destructive choke hold on Tribal revenue and economic prosperity.  Secretary Haaland and President Biden are throwing the Navajo Nation  under the bus, driven by extremists with no concern for Native  interests or the energy needs of all Americans. I am proud to stand  with the Navajo Nation and offer this amendment that defunds this ban.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I represent the Navajo Nation in my State. The  Navajo Nation does support this amendment.   One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talked about  protecting the lands. What she didn't talk about, however, was  protecting the economy of the Navajo people and how this would impact  them, which is, once again, why they support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
