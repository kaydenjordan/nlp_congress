 Mr. Speaker, this May, students from across west  Michigan and the Nation will graduate from high school and college. I  am honored to recognize one of these outstanding and incredibly bright  graduates who hails from Michigan's Third Congressional District today.   Elle Bennett from Ada, Michigan, will graduate first in her class  from the United States Military Academy at West Point later this month.  After graduating, she will be commissioned as a second lieutenant in  the United States Army.   While at West Point, Elle majored in environmental science and  researched wastewater resilience, even having the opportunity to  publish and present on her findings. Drawing on her passions, she  served as an energy and environment officer at West Point, where she  led initiatives to increase recycling and pressed the institution to  choose greener options.  [[Page H2299]]    On behalf of our West Michigan community, including Elle's proud  parents, Bill and Amy, as well as her siblings, Kes and RaVell, I  congratulate her on her impressive accomplishments as she graduates  from West Point.                            ____________________
