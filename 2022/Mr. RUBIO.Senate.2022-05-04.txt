 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, this will not take long.   I don't think anybody at this point is unaware that China steals the  things that we in America innovate: our research, our ingenuity, our  products, our secrets. They steal it. So we are about to spend tens of  billions of dollars on research, and if we are going to do that, I  think we should take steps to make sure that the tens of billions  aren't also stolen.   It doesn't make a lot of sense--and most people would agree--to spend  all of this public money on research without enough protections to keep  the Chinese from stealing it. So what this motion to instruct would do  is it would ensure that the government undertakes a  counterintelligence review to certify that the entities that are  getting this public money--either through direct funding or through  intellectual property developed as a result--have national security  protections against the theft of American research and resources.    What this would ensure is that there are protections in place to  strengthen the bill's research funding accounting requirements in  section 2307 and to ensure review of the funding for university  technology centers.   If this bill is to truly be the America COMPETES Act, we need to make  sure that America's funding and grants and other taxpayer resources are  not going to be stolen by our adversaries to beat us using our own  money.   I ask my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to instruct.                                Vote on Motion
