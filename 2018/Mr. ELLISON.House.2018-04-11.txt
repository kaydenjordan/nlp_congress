 Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  California for yielding. I appreciate all of the work Congressman  DeSaulnier does in this area. And I want to thank him for raising this  particular issue for this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I agree with him that inequality is the issue of the  moment. Not only does inequality funnel money from working Americans up  to the richest people, but what do they do with the money once it is up  there? There is only a certain number of boats you can ski behind, only  a certain number of houses you can buy, and only a certain number of  luxury cars you can buy.   What do the billions go to? Much of it goes to things like merger and  acquisition, and also political influence. It is very important to  understand that as economic inequality has grown, political inequality  has also grown. Nowadays, the money goes into some super-PAC: some big,  giant thing where they do independent expenditures and pour money in  against their enemies and pour money in in favor of their friends.   Politics in America has become the battle of the billionaires now.  You have to get a billionaire on your side in order to win. I mean, we  know that whether it is the Coates', or the Mercers, or the Adelsons,  or whoever it is, it is some big, rich person who is going to sponsor a  political candidate, and that is who gets to represent us in what is  supposed to be a democratic society. So I think that it is critical to  make the link between economic inequality and political inequality.   I will say again, when we get economic inequality to the degree that  it is, one of the other things that is purchased, besides political  influence, is mergers and acquisitions.   I would just like to point out to everybody that it doesn't matter  what industry you are talking about, markets are deeply concentrated  and anticompetitive. If you are talking about like a pharmacy--not a  pharmaceutical company, but a pharmacy--CVS, Walgreens, we used to have  Rite Aid and, of course, they merged together. And, of course, there is  another merger coming up. Every day you open the paper, there is some  other big company buying up some other big company, concentrating  markets, making the barriers to entry even higher so that the small- business person is just locked out.   It costs a lot to get into business now. If your opponent, who is  some big, huge company, doesn't want you in the market, they can just  drop their prices, suffer the losses, because they are big, run you out  of business, and raise them right back on up.   But if you look at any market--beer, hamburger, chicken, online  search engines, anything you want--almost all of them are deeply  concentrated--two, three, maybe four--companies representing 80 or 90  percent of the industry, which cuts off opportunity, limits  competition, and it is bad for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I have a few more things to share, but I will kick it  back to Congressman DeSaulnier for now. Maybe he can kick it back to me  a little later, and we will just have a conversation for a little  while.    Madam Speaker, I definitely want to thank the gentleman  for the important information he has shared with us tonight. Folks who  are tuned in definitely, I believe, are interested in this topic. In  fact, it is the thing that most people think about.   As I am here tonight, I would say, Madam Speaker, that we just  celebrated, or shall I say we just memorialized the loss of Martin  Luther King, which it was his 50th anniversary of his passing, of his  assassination back on April 4. And just recently, this is the year that  we passed the fair housing law in 1968, so it has been 50 years.   A lot of people, when they think of King, they think, oh, he helped  African Americans defeat Jim Crow segregation, and that is true. That  is one way to look at it.   But when he died, he was marching with sanitation workers who were  paid so little they could not make ends meet. They weren't allowed to  go into adequate shelter when it was raining, so two of them, one day,  happened to go into the back of the garbage truck. The garbage truck  had a malfunction, and those two men were crushed in the garbage truck,  and so that initiated a strike which Martin Luther King came and joined  two times, it being the last fight he was ever in.   Why do I bring up this point? Because we think of America as being  more evolved since that time. We think, oh, we have got voting rights;  we have gotten rid of discrimination. It is illegal now.   But I will tell you what. Despite the fact that we still are battling  for racial equality, we have absolutely slipped backwards in the fight  for economic empowerment for working people, no matter what their  color.   In 1968, the Federal minimum wage, if it had been adjusted for  inflation, would be about $11.62. But as the gentleman just mentioned,  it is now $7.25. And the server minimum wage, the tip minimum wage is  $2.13. People don't believe me when I say that, but it is $2.13.   How can it be legal to pay a server $2.13? They say, oh, they make it  up in tips. Do they? What if their tips aren't given to them? What if  there is wage theft, which happens all the time?   I want to thank the gentleman from California for mentioning that in  1968, the average CEO got paid about 20 times more than the average  worker. Today, it is above 300 percent, 300 times. So the inequality  has dramatically not just enriched the rich, it has made working and  middle class and the working poor suffer.   There are--and this is a shocking statistic. There has been a 60  percent growth in people living under the Federal poverty guideline  since 1968. That is wrong, and this tax bill that we just passed will  do nothing other than make it all that much worse.   It is a cruel irony that, in the face of this spread, this gap that  working people are experiencing relative to their richer fellow  Americans, that we would say, oh, you know what we need to do? Give the  rich people even more money.   Now, again, I am not anti-rich. I wouldn't mind being rich myself one  day. But I do hope that if I ever were to be doing well financially,  that I would not pull the ladder up, climb up the ladder and then pull  it up so that people can't even follow me.   Wait a minute. That is exactly what they are doing. They are trying  to take away the Affordable Care Act, which actually gave millions of  people healthcare for the first time. They want to put work  requirements on receiving Federal benefit and aid. They want to make it  tougher to be working class and poor. It is outrageous.   I just want to wrap my own comments up tonight by just saying it  doesn't have to be this way. Poverty is not something that simply  happens like the weather. It is not a storm and, oh, boy, how did that  ever happen? No, it is a series of decisions made by people who have  political power, who advantage some and disadvantage others.   It is things that we do, and it is also things that we don't do. It  is when we just let markets concentrate and don't engage in legitimate  anti-trust action; and it is when we pass a tax bill that we know,  before anything has happened, that 83 percent of the benefits will go  to the top 1 percent. This is how you create massive inequality.   There are things we can do about it. I think we could start by  passing a policy that links CEO pay to raises for workers. What if a  CEO thinking about, you know, I am going to get my pay, I am going to  get a big fat old bonus. Oh, okay. If I do that, I have got  [[Page H3135]]  to make sure my folks get some of this too. What if we passed a policy  like that?   What if we said you couldn't deduct those bonuses off your taxes the  way that they do now?   What if we actually said to ourselves, we are going to have a very  high estate tax? I think that is fair enough. I mean, what did you do,  other than negotiate a birth canal, to get all that money? I think that  we should reward work, not just birth.   I think, what if we said we are going to make majo investments in  public wealth? What do I mean by public wealth? Well, I don't know, the  parks, the roads, the bridges, the transit, the schools. What if we  invested in those public institutions that actually help everybody come  up?    Even the rich folks can go to the public park. We don't ration that.  We say it is something for all of us.   What if we said we are going to make sure that the right to join a  union is a right that we are going to protect and defend, knowing that  the fortunes of unions--when union density goes up, working class  people do better. When union density goes down, working class people's  wages stagnate and go down.   What if we lifted the minimum wage to a livable wage?   What if we had real consumer protection?   What if we said that everybody can go to the doctor?   I believe that we should have universal single-payer healthcare. That  is my opinion, and I hope others join me.   What if we did things like looked at the labor policies that they  have in some countries around the world?   Do you know, in Germany, Madam Speaker, that workers have to be on  the board of the corporation if the corporation is above a certain  size?                                time  1800    That makes sense. They certainly are affected by what the company  does.   In Germany, if there is a slowdown, a recession, and that happens,  everybody takes fewer hours rather than just laying off people who are  just relegated to the unemployment lines, who see their skills  deteriorate and who are just out of the workforce and it is hard to get  back in.   What if we did these things? What if we said to ourselves that we  were going to have a trade policy that really factored in how is this  policy going to impact the local economy and workers? I definitely  think trade is a good thing, but what if we thought about how it is  going to impact this worker, these workers, this factory right here?   What if we got rid of the idea of right to work and said everybody in  American can join a union?   This would make America a stronger country for working Americans. It  would improve our economy. It would put money in the hands of working  Americans, and it wouldn't stop people from getting rich if they got a  great idea and made a lot of money. It wouldn't stop people from  amassing any wealth, but what it would do is make sure that people at  the middle and the bottom of the economy had a greater shot and a  better share.   My Republican friends' vision for the economy is that, look, you  know, here is how you have a good economy: You don't make rich people  or big companies pay any taxes, and you shuffle all the property taxes  and the sales taxes. You let those things be on the shoulders of the  working folk. Then you don't spend on public institutions like public  schools or anything. You just let those folks do the best they can.   If those kids aren't smart enough to be born to rich parents who send  them to private school, forget about it. We are just going to underfund  that, or we are going to do charters, and then we will let individuals  own those schools and make money off of them.   Their idea of a business model is to smash the workers down, treat  the workers like a cost, push their labor costs as far down as they can  get it, and amass the wealth at the top as much as they can, allow  stock buybacks, and don't regulate anybody, and don't have any rules of  the game so that you get a free-for-all, and then when the economy  finally goes bust, oh, you know, we just go back to John Q. Taxpayer  and Jane Q. Taxpayer and make them bail them out.   Anyway, I think there is a better way. I think we can have a better  economy. We can have a democracy. We can have an economy that allows  for free enterprise and we can have a public sector that makes sure  that liberty and justice and opportunity are for everyone, not just a  few.
