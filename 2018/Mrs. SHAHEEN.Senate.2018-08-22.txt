 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great American  and steadfast Air National guardsman.   Capt. Miguel ``Mike'' E. Cosio has distinguished himself through his  professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided  distinguished service to our country while assigned to the National  Capitol Region.   As an Air legislative liaison in the National Guard Bureau Office of  Legislative Liaison from May 2016 to August 2018, Captain Cosio  performed his duties well and without reservation. His strategic  thinking and foresight contributed to the completion of numerous high- level tasks and engagements between Congress and the National Guard.  During this assignment, Captain Cosio conducted more than 50  congressional engagements to provide Members insight into the worsening  trend of substance misuse and the critical role of the National Guard's  counterdrug program in effectively combating this epidemic. He also  actively engaged Members of Congress regarding the growth of the State  Partnership Program, a vital driver in strengthening our alliances  overseas. In addition to those meetings, he organized dozens of direct  engagements between Air National Guard senior leaders and Members of  Congress, which were essential in conveying important information on  behalf of the Department of Defense and building trust and  understanding.   After serving in this vital role for the past 2 years, Captain Cosio  will move to his next assignment: deploying in support of our Nation's  defense as a true citizen-airman. Mike, his wife, Traci, and their two  children have sacrificed much as a family in service to our Nation. I  am thankful for Mike's service and his work with my office over the  past 2 years on issues important to the State of New Hampshire and the  country. I salute this American patriot whose selfless service has kept  our country safe and strong.   Thank you.                            ____________________
