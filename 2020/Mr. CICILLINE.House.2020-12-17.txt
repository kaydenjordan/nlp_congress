 Madam Speaker, it has been 9 months since Congress  delivered a relief package for the American people. Since then, the  pandemic has grown worse.   Every time Democrats tried to pass a new relief package, the  Republicans who control the U.S. Senate have blocked it from reaching  the American people.   This has gone on long enough. It is long past time to provide the  relief that our folks who are living through this pandemic need.   We need to provide another round of stimulus payments to workers. We  need to extend and expand unemployment insurance. We need to establish  a national COVID testing program and make sure our hospitals and  community health centers have the resources they need to provide  lifesaving care.   We need to help small businesses that have already sacrificed so much  in the face of this pandemic, and we need to provide funding so that we  can get our population vaccinated against this disease and get our  lives back to normal as soon as possible.   Leaving town without an agreement is not an option. It is critical  that we get this done for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to work together to make  this happen.                            ____________________
