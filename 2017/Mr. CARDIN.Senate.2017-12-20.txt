 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to take this time to talk about two  matters of human rights, which I know the Presiding Officer has been  very much engaged with as an active member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. I want to share this information with our  colleagues.   This month marks the fifth anniversary of the 2012 Sergei Magnitsky  Rule of Law and Accountability Act. Today, with the publication of five  new sanctions designations, the citizens of the Russian Federation-- many of whom strive for a future governed by the rule of law--can claim  a small victory over oppression. I hope that today's news provides a  semblance of justice for the family of Sergei Magnitsky and those who  continue to fight against corruption and human rights abuses across the  country.   The Magnitsky list now includes 49 names--an important testament to  the central importance that accountability and human rights should play  in U.S. foreign policy.   I think the Members of this body are familiar with the circumstances  surrounding Sergei Magnitsky's death. He was a young lawyer in Russia  representing a company. He discovered corruption, and he did what any  lawyer should do. He reported it to the authorities. As a result, he  was arrested. He was tortured, denied medical care, and died in prison.   As a result of that, legislation was introduced. I was proud to  sponsor it with my good friend Senator McCain. It was enacted into law,  as I said, 5 years ago. It holds those who perpetrate these violations  of human rights accountable by denying them the right to visit our  country--visa applications--or to use our banking systems.   The five additions to this list include Andrei Pavlov, Yulia  Mayorova, and Alexei Sheshenya for their roles in the Magnitsky case  and Ramzan Kadyrov and Ayub Kataev for gross violations of human  rights. I appreciate the work of career officials at the Treasury and  State Departments for their work in investigating and designating these  important cases.    Andrei Pavlov is a Russian lawyer who played a central role  orchestrating the false claims used in the $230 million tax fraud that  Sergei Magnitsky uncovered. His addition to the Magnitsky list is long  overdue, as he played an essential role in the plot.   Yulia Mayorova is the former wife of Pavlov and a Russian lawyer. She  also reportedly played a role in helping to facilitate the fraud  uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky.   Alexei Sheshenia also reportedly played key roles in both the 2006  theft of the $107 million in taxes paid by RenGaz and in the 2007 theft  of the $230 million of taxes paid by Hermitage. I understand that in  both tax thefts, shell companies beneficially owned by Alexei Sheshenia  used forged backdated contracts to obtain judgments against companies  that paid a significant amount of taxes.   Ramzan Kadyrov is a renowned human rights abuser who has brutally run  the Republic of Chechnya for more than 10 years. Under his rule, human  rights offenders have been murdered, and gay men have disappeared. He  has destroyed any semblance of the rule of law in the Republic. Over  the course of his time in power, there have been credible allegations  of his directing assassinations deployed across Russia and Europe.  Human rights groups have documented many cases of torture and  extrajudicial killings by forces under his control.   Ayub Kataev is a prison warden and head of the branch of the Chechen  internal affairs ministry. Earlier this year, Chechen authorities  reportedly set up concentration camps for gay men under his control. He  certainly belongs on this list.   Since 2012, Senator McCain and I have conducted rigorous oversight to  ensure robust implementation of the Magnitsky law. In 2016, we wrote to  the State Department with certain suggestions for inclusions on the  list relevant to the death of Sergei Magnitsky. We also expressed  concerns that the allegations of torture in Chechnya against gay men  and other human rights violations in the North Caucasus should be  investigated. I am pleased they took action that was responsive to both  of our inquiries.   I want my colleagues to know that I do believe this administration  has conducted the review on the Magnitsky list the way it should have  been--keeping in close contact with Members of the Senate. I think the  result speaks to the quality of work that was done in this year's list.   America's values are our interests. As a country, we must remain  steadfastly committed to the principles embedded in the Magnitsky law-- accountability, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The  American people expect U.S. policymakers to advance these principles in  all aspects of our diplomatic relations. I welcome today's announcement  and also expect the first publication of the ``Global Magnitsky''  sanctions designations this week.   As the Presiding Officer is well aware, we have recently passed the  ``Global Magnitsky'' law that applies similar standards for human  rights violations globally. That list should be made available, we  hope, sometime this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a second subject that I wish to talk about  today on human rights deals with the collapse in Venezuela. I come to  the floor to speak about Venezuela's growing humanitarian tragedy and  accelerating economic collapse.   Late last June, here on the Senate floor, I described Venezuela as a  nearly failed State, where authoritarian leaders profit from links to  corruption and drug trafficking, while the Venezuelan people are  subject to precarious humanitarian conditions and human rights abuses.  Disturbingly, the situation has only deteriorated since the time I was  last on the floor talking about the circumstances.   With Venezuela's humanitarian crisis growing daily, conditions facing  Venezuelan children are particularly dire. This week, the New York  Times published a heartbreaking investigation of how Venezuelan  children dying of hunger. It states:         Parents go days without eating, shriveling to the weight of       children themselves. Women line up at sterilization clinics       to avoid having children they cannot feed. Boys leave home to       join street gangs that scavenge for scraps. . . . Crowds of       adults storm dumpsters after restaurants close. Babies die       because it is hard to find or afford infant formula, even in       emergency rooms.    That is in our hemisphere in Venezuela.   The Catholic relief organization Caritas has determined that over 50  percent of the children are suffering from nutritional deficiencies.  They project that 280,000 Venezuelan children could eventually die of  hunger without an urgently needed humanitarian response.   As the Venezuelans increasingly suffer the ravages of hunger, the  country's hospital system is collapsing. Essential medicines are in  short supply, and more than half of the Nation's operating facilities  no longer function or have sufficient supplies. Disturbingly,  international relief organizations have found that over 60 percent of  the Venezuelan hospitals don't even have potable water.   Amid these crisis conditions, Venezuelan President Maduro repeatedly  denies the existence of this country's humanitarian crisis. He has even  taken to the unprecedented step of setting up a party-controlled food  distribution system referred to as CLAPS, and his government now uses  food as a tool of political patronage.   The result is that the United States and our partners in the  hemisphere now confront the situation where the Maduro regime would  rather see its people go hungry than accept the foreign assistance the  Venezuelans desperately need. This man-made tragedy is absolutely  unacceptable.  [[Page S8171]]    Today I have written to Ambassador Nikki Haley, our Ambassador to the  United Nations, to urge her to call an emergency special session of the  U.N. Security Council to evaluate which United Nations mechanisms,  including U.N. Security Council resolutions, should be pursued to  alleviate the humanitarian suffering inside Venezuela.   As humanitarian concerns mount, human rights abuses of Venezuela are  rampant. Last month, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told  the U.N. Security Council that this year Venezuelan security forces  ``systematically resorted to the arbitrary detention of more than 5,000  protestors.''   A more recent report by Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal, a  Venezuelan nongovernmental organization, documents how Venezuelan  security forces have subjected political opponents to ``torture  involving electric shock and asphyxiation.''   In response, Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the OAS, has  convened a series of hearings to receive testimony to ascertain whether  members of the Venezuelan Government have committed crimes against  humanity that should be referred to the International Criminal Court  for prosecution. These efforts deserve our attention and our support.   Against this alarming backdrop, we require no explanation for why the  United States has received more asylum requests from Venezuela than  from any other nationality for 2 years straight.   These challenges will only grow as Venezuela's economy continues to  collapse. The country is in a selective default on its bonds.  Hyperinflation and rapid currency devaluation are ravaging family  incomes. This week, the country's parallel exchange rate reached 12,000  times the official rate, meaning that the average Venezuelan now earns  less than $10 a month.   The reasons for this collapse are simple. Venezuela's economy is  plagued by endemic corruption and gross mismanagement. As this calamity  grows, Senators need to be aware that Venezuela will eventually need a  major IMF program that may well surpass the $17 billion intervention  that Ukraine required in 2014. The international community will have to  respond, which will also include, of course, the United States.   We also need to recognize that Russia and China are now major  stakeholders in Venezuela, in our hemisphere, and will be at the table  as the international community copes with the pending collapse.   Russia, in particular, is playing geopolitics with the situation-- refinancing Venezuela's debt, offering loans in return for financial  stakes in U.S.-based CITGO, securing stakes in Venezuela's oil  industry, and expanding its influence in our hemisphere.   In response to these growing challenges, the Trump administration has  applied greater pressure by imposing targeted sanctions against a  number of individuals, including President Maduro. With this  designation, President Maduro has joined the list of notorious heads of  state on U.S. sanction list, including the likes of North Korea's Kim  Jong Un, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Zimbabwe's former President  Robert Mugabe, and Panama's former President Manuel Noriega.   President Trump has also imposed financial sanctions blocking the  issuance of new bonds to fund the Maduro regime's ongoing repressive  and economic mismanagement. The bond market has been one of the last  lifelines for the Maduro government. Investors are right to lose trust  in Venezuela's ability to pay its debt.   We must recognize, however, that sanctions alone will not resolve the  challenges the people of Venezuela are facing. We need a comprehensive  strategy that utilizes all elements of U.S. diplomacy. We must provide  critical foreign assistance to help mitigate the humanitarian crisis  and bolster essential support for human rights and democratic civil  society.   In May I introduced S. 1018, a bipartisan bill that lays out a  comprehensive strategy for U.S. policy. My bill includes humanitarian  assistance and funding to protect and promote human rights and  democracy. It also includes a more aggressive approach to tackling the  endemic corruption.   Earlier this month, the House of Representatives approved its version  of this bill. It is time for the Senate to act. While I see an  opportunity for bipartisanship in the Senate on U.S. policy toward  Venezuela, I must say that I was alarmed by President Trump's statement  in August about a potential military option. Such cavalier comments are  not helpful and, once again, call into question whether he has the  temperament and judgment for dealing with serious national security  challenges.   We must rise to the challenge of Venezuela as a great nation,  bringing our full diplomatic resources and skills to bear and avoiding  stooping to mere saber rattling.   I urge our colleagues to take on this challenge, to help the people  of Venezuela, who are suffering from this humanitarian crisis, and to  allow America's entire toolkit to be used to help resolve this problem  in our hemisphere.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
