 Mr. Speaker, in response to the blue anon rhetoric, I  rise in favor of H. Res. 12 to establish a subcommittee on the  weaponization of the Federal Government.   The authoritarian left has used the full might and authority of the  Federal Government to force its agenda on the American people. The  Federal Government has been weaponized to pressure private companies to  censor conservatives; target parents as domestic terrorists simply for  caring about their children and their education; manipulate the  American people by declaring Hunter Biden's laptop as Russian  disinformation; even failing to inform American citizens about  classified documents that a former Vice President had in his  possession; and launch an unwarranted investigation into President  Trump's Presidential campaign.   Mr. Speaker, our Constitution is a contract with the American people  and our government. That contract is designed to produce maximum  freedom and minimum tyranny for this great country.     Sadly, the FBI and the DOJ, and many other agencies,  are violating this contract and working to make the American people  subjects rather than free citizens.   This committee is essential, and I encourage its creation and the  adoption of this resolution.
