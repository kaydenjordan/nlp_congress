 Mr. President, I rise this morning with a heavy heart.  My city, my dear city of New York, no stranger to terrorism, was once  again its victim yesterday.   Yesterday afternoon, a man deliberately drove a rented truck into  groups of pedestrians and cyclists, killing eight and injuring about a  dozen more. Some of the injured were schoolchildren. These people were  biking or walking home, enjoying a brisk and beautiful New York autumn  day. It is tragic. It leaves a hole in your stomach.   Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we wish all  of the injured a full and speedy recovery. We are also grateful--deeply  grateful--to the New York Police Department and the first responders,  especially Officer Ryan Nash, 28 years old, who was the first on the  scene. He reacted quickly and decisively to bring down the attacker and  bring him into custody. Who knows how much worse the tragedy would have  been without his actions.   As one of thousands of New Yorkers who regularly ride on the path  where this attack took place--in the last month, I have ridden on it  twice--it hits close to home. My daughter went to the school near the  scene, Stuyvesant High School, and she used the bike path I don't know  how many times. This is our territory, our home.   The attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize, but, as the world  learned after 9/11 and will learn again, New York doesn't scare easily.  New Yorkers are resilient. We always bounce back. We won't let these  terrorists get their way or affect our way of life. We will never let  terror prevail.   True to form--something that made my heart swell with pride--the New  York City Halloween parade marched on last night. Thousands of school  kids went right into Stuyvesant today. The terrorists cannot stop us.  They cannot change our way of life. We love New York. We love America.  That bond holds us together.
