 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jackson for  yielding. I am so happy to be joining him and Representative Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order  hour. Indeed, it is a special honor to talk about our children and what  they need.   I am so proud to be a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Not  only am I a member of this esteemed body that is concerned about foster  youth, but I am also a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Caucus on  Foster Youth, and I serve in that caucus as one of the six bipartisan  chairs.   I thank the CBC and its members who supported the Congressional  Caucus on Foster Youth's Shadow Day this past June 14, last week. I  thank all the Members of the House who took time to allow a former  foster youth to join them in their day's activities as well as to hear  from and learn from their shadows.   If you didn't have a foster youth this year, be sure that Gwen Moore  will be calling upon you next year to enjoy this important experience  and feedback between the delegates and Members.   My fellow CBC members, in particular, demonstrated their commitment  to this special community through graciously hosting a former foster  youth in their office for 1 day and addressing the whole delegation and  cohort of 30 former foster youth from across the country, representing  20 States, directly during the youth's townhall meeting.   I thank those CBC members who stepped up last week to host a shadow,  including my Congressional Foster Youth Caucus co-chair, Representative  Sydney Kamlager-Dove; my Ways and Means Committee work fam subcommittee  ranking member and longtime foster youth advocate, Representative    Danny Davis of Illinois; and others, including Representative Emanuel  Cleaver, Representative Terri Sewell, Representative Bobby Scott,  Representative Barbara Lee, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee,  Representative Summer Lee, Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick,  and Representative Shontel Brown.    Mr. Speaker, I will give a special shout-out to Representative Maxine  Waters, who was busy with her committee and didn't actually take a  shadow, but she met and spoke with one of the students that I shadowed  and made his day. He was someone who was born in Los Angeles, and it  made his day to meet the Honorable Maxine Waters.   We also went over to the Senate side and met with Senator Booker. My  particular shadow, Theron, is someone who is a licensed therapist, and  his experience in foster care is that it is easier to get in trouble  and to come in contact with the juvenile justice system for doing  nothing but being a foster youth. He wants to make sure that we put a  focus on the juvenile justice system with regard to its nexus with  foster care.   We have to stop the foster care-to-prison pipeline, Mr. Speaker.  These are things that our foster youth are telling us.   I represented two outstanding foster youth, Shay Grey Woods and  Theron Ogedengbe. Just like all the foster youth that I have gotten to  know and had the privilege to participate with during Shadow Day,  including the late Dosha ``DJay'' Joi, I have been the student. I have  learned from them. They have informed me about the kinds of legislative  initiatives that need to occur and what we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, just let me say, these foster youth who come here every  year are leaders. These are people who have somehow overcome the many  barriers that foster youth experience, and they are able to be a voice  to speak for them. We should not think that because we meet these  brilliant, young, educated foster youth that there aren't thousands  more of them who are falling through the cracks for want of our  guidance and care.   It is a reminder. I remind you that behind all these statistics,  there are real people and real stories that demonstrate their  incredible resilience and hope that they have.   The reason that I am really proud of Shadow Day is because it  elevates the voices of the over 377,000 children in out-of-home care as  of the end of 2021.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, disproportionately, Black children are  overrepresented in the child welfare system. In my own home State of  Wisconsin, 28 percent of the youth in out-of-home placements were Black  or African American, whereas African-American youth in Wisconsin only  constitute 9 percent of the population. They are overrepresented by  three times.   The data from the United States as a whole is similarly  disproportionate, with 22 percent of children in the United States in  out-of-home care being Black and only 14 percent of youth in the  general population being African American.   When you say that you want to lift up National Reunification Month,  it is something we need to lift up because we have all heard the old  adage that you divide and conquer. This is our future workforce. These  are our future builders, doctors, teachers, people who repair our  roofs, and it is just about impossible to do that when they start out  with so many adverse childhood experiences, like being separated from  their birth parents, sometimes unnecessarily.   In a perfect world, no children would ever be separated. Of course,  we understand that sometimes that is in the best interests of the  children. Far too often, it is our policies under our child welfare  system and our welfare system and our unwillingness to support parents  where they are that are creating these out-of-home placements.   I want to talk about some very specific reasons that children are  taken out of these homes, if you will bear with me.   Child neglect is the number one reason that children are taken out of  these homes. No one wants children to be neglected. Not a single person  in the United States Congress would want a child to be stuck in a home  where they were being abused and neglected.   That is really an overstatement of what actually happens. What  actually happens is there are a lot of people who have more month than  money. If you come to June 26 and the resources for that household have  dried up, with some of the most onerous policies that we have around  who can get SNAP, also called food stamps, and when you think about  parents living in situations where 48 percent of their income has to go  for housing, and not necessarily good housing--houses with lead paint  in them and lead pipes and vermin, and they are still paying almost  half their income for housing, we see a situation where children can  easily be loved yet neglected.   One of the things that I am going to do is reintroduce, as I have  done for several cycles, the Family Poverty is Not Child Neglect Act. I  want to reinforce the notion that these agencies should not be  snatching kids out of their homes when providing maybe some SNAP or  other resources to the family could preserve that family.                                time  2000    It is in the best interest of children to be at home if they can be.  My bill would make it so much harder for these agencies to use poverty  as a rationale to pulling families apart.   I am looking for other ways to do it. I don't want to take up all the  time, but I just want to mention a second reason that children are  placed out of home, it is because of parental substance abuse.   Mr. Jackson, I have known you and your family for a long time, so I  know that you recall how substance abuse has become a real curse in  this country. Drug affliction and addiction happens in every corner of  the United States. How is it treated?   In some communities where there are fentanyl addictions, which are  tragic; meth addictions, which are tragic; opioid addictions, which are  tragic, we are proposing government interventions to help people. But  when children of foster families become addicted, they are treated  often like criminals and have their children taken from them instead of  them being offered treatment.   So this year's theme for National Reunification Month is ``We believe  in the resiliency and strength of our families.'' If that is going to  be our motto, Mr. Jackson, we ought to do something to reinforce this  strength and resilience and not just talk about it.   We need policies that match this audacious goal. Policies like the  new exemption from SNAP time arbitrary and  [[Page H2986]]  harmful time limits in the Fiscal Responsibility Act for former foster  youth up to age 24.   The White House has done a marvelous job, they estimated that as many  as 50,000 youth who have aged out of foster care will now be exempt  from onerous timelines which say that in the 3-year period you could  only be eligible for SNAP for 3 months. In 3 years you can only get  SNAP if you are an adult, but we have exempted foster youth from that  provision because who do we know, Representative Jackson, who is 18 or  19 on their own and can figure it out? I know I was still eating at  home when I was 19.   I am so proud, again, of you and Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick for  spending this time to lift this up to our community and our  constituents. I am inspired by your dedication and recommitted to  working with you as we move forward.   I thank you for yielding to me, Mr. Jackson.
