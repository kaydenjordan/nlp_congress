 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of H.R. 3101, the Strengthening  Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act.   Port facilities serve as a vital economic function for our Nation and  the communities in which they are located. The approximately 360  commercial maritime ports operating across the United States handle  more than $1.3 trillion in cargo, annually.   To facilitate and maintain this level of economic activity, the  maritime sector increasingly relies on technology to facilitate the  movement of cargo into and through port facilities. Collectively,  navigation, operations, and communication technologies enhance the  competitiveness, safety, and reliability of the U.S. maritime sector.   However, as port operations have become more automated, exposure to  cyber threats and attacks have also increased. This homeland security  threat is not unique to the maritime sector. In fact, since 2003, the  Government Accountability Office has warned about the vulnerability of  critical infrastructure and has called on the Federal Government to  support efforts to bolster cybersecurity.   To better protect port facilities from cyber attacks, Congress must  ensure that expertise in both the private and public sector is  leveraged effectively. H.R. 3101 would direct DHS to be more proactive  in how it addresses cybersecurity risks at our Nation's ports.   The first step in reducing cyber vulnerabilities is identifying the  weak points in network security through risk assessments. H.R. 3101  requires these assessments. The bill directs the Coast Guard to provide  port facilities with guidelines on how to report cybersecurity risks in  order to enhance the ability of both the Coast Guard and port operators  to respond effectively to such attacks.   By promoting cybersecurity information sharing and coordination  between public and private partners at maritime facilities, H.R. 3101  seeks to make a positive difference in how quickly terminal and port  operators are able to prevent, mitigate, and recover from such attacks.   H.R. 3101, if enacted, will help foster an environment in which DHS,  the Coast Guard, ports, and port stakeholders work together to enhance  the cybersecurity at our Nation's ports.   Lastly, I would like to note the bipartisan support for this bill in  the Homeland Security Committee. I thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking  Member Thompson, and my colleague Congresswoman Torres for their hard  work and leadership in this matter.   Mr. Speaker, when this bill was considered last Congress and earlier  this fall, committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle agreed that  H.R. 3101 is a timely and worthwhile measure to support. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 3101.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

With the increased need for and  use of technology at maritime facilities, it is in our national and  economic interest for there to be better cyber information sharing and  coordination efforts at our Nation's ports.   By assessing cyber risks at individual port facilities and  establishing countermeasures to mitigate these risks, the U.S. maritime  sector will be better prepared to protect these important centers of  economic activity.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3101, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I once again urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation. I want to thank Congresswoman Torres for her strong  leadership on this bill, Mr. Vela, Ranking Member Thompson.   Mr. Speaker, we have passed over 50 bills out of my committee, out of  the House floor, and sent them to the Senate, where they still sit  there with no action whatsoever. And when it comes to homeland security  measures, I believe that it is dangerous to do nothing, and I urge the  Senate to take up action on this bill and the other 50 bills that we  have sent over to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3101, the  Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our  Ports Act of 2017.  [[Page H8107]]    I thank Congresswoman Torres for introducing this important piece of  legislation that addresses security at our nation's ports.   H.R. 3101 requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to  facilitate increased information sharing about cybersecurity among  maritime interests.   The bill requires DHS to:   Develop, implement, and continually review a maritime cybersecurity  risk assessment model to evaluate current and future cybersecurity  risks;   Seek input from at least one information sharing and analysis  organization representing maritime interests in the National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center;   Establish voluntary reporting guidelines for maritime-related  cybersecurity risks and incidents;   Request that the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee report  and make recommendations to DHS about methods to enhance cybersecurity  and information sharing among security stakeholders from federal,  state, local, and tribal governments; public safety and emergency  response agencies; law enforcement and security organizations; maritime  industry participants; port owners and operators; and maritime terminal  owners and operators; and   Ensure that maritime security risk assessments include cybersecurity  risks to ports and the maritime border of the United States.   As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and  former Ranking Member of the Committee's Subcommittee on Border and  Maritime Security, I am well aware of the hard work that the Houston  Port Authority, and the Department of Homeland Security has done to  secure the port, its workers, and the millions of tons of imports and  exports that traverse the waters of the Port of Houston each week.   According to the U.S. Department of Transportation the U.S. maritime  border covers 95,000 miles of shoreline with 361 seaports.   Ocean transportation accounts for 95 percent of cargo tonnage that  moves in and out of the country, with 8,588 commercial vessels making  82,044 port calls in 2015.   The Port of Houston is a 25-mile-long complex of diversified public  and private facilities located just a few hours' sailing time from the  Gulf of Mexico.   In 2012, ship channel-related businesses contributed 1,026,820 jobs  and generated more than $178.5 billion in statewide economic activity.   In 2014, among U.S. ports the Port of Houston was ranked:   1st in foreign tonnage;   Largest Texas port with 46 percemt of market share by tonnage and 95  percent market share in containers by total TEUS in 2014;   Largest Gulf Coast container port, handling 67 percent of U.S. Gulf  Coast container traffic in 2014;   2nd in total foreign cargo value (based on U.S. Dept. of Commerce,  Bureau of Census).   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that the Port of  Houston port, and its waterways, and vessels are part of an economic  engine handling more than $700 billion in merchandise annually.   The Port of Houston houses approximately 100 steamship lines offering  services that link Houston with 1,053 ports in 203 countries.   The Port of Houston is a $15 billion petrochemical complex, the  largest in the nation and second largest worldwide.   These statistics clearly communicate the potential for a terrorist  attack using nuclear or radiological material may in some estimations  be low, but should an attack occur the consequences would be  catastrophic, and for this reason we cannot be lax in our efforts to  deter, detect and defeat attempts by terrorists to perpetrate such a  heinous act of terrorism.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays an essential role in  domestic defense against the potential smuggling of a weapon of mass  destruction in a shipping container or the use of a bomb-laden small  vessel to carry out an attack at a port.   Earlier this year, a global malware attack occurred that caused  significant harm to international shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk.   That attack revealed serious vulnerabilities in our nation's maritime  security, which is still being assessed.   The only way port operations were able to resume following the attack  at one of our nation's busiest ports was to revert to a manual system  to process cargo and ships.   This was not the first time that cyber criminals used technology  against port operations.   Approximately $1.3 trillion in cargo passes through our nation's 360  commercial ports.   The convenience, precision and accuracy provided by digital  technology in processing cargo through our nation's ports adds to their  capacity to manage tonnage.   Securing cyber technology to manage port operations, ranging from  communication and navigation to engineering, safety, and cargo, is  critical to protect our nation's maritime cyber infrastructure.   Government leaders and security experts are concerned that the  maritime transportation system could be used by terrorists to smuggle  personnel, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous materials  into the United States.   They are also concerned that ships in U.S. ports, particularly large  commercial cargo ships or cruise ships, could be attacked by  terrorists.    A large-scale terrorist attack at a U.S. port, experts warn, could  not only cause local death and damage, but also paralyze global  maritime commerce.   This is of particular concern at the Port of Houston, which is the  busiest port in the nited States in terms of foreign tonnage, second- busiest in the United States in terms of overall tonnage, and  fifteenth-busiest in the world.   DHS, through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation  Security Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard, administers several  essential programs that secure our Nation's ports and waterways.   I include in the Record a letter dated March 30, 2017, that I sent to  the Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security  requesting a field hearing on the topic of port security.   I ask my colleagues join me in voting to pass H.R. 3101, the  Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our  Ports Act of 2017.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chair, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Homeland Security, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: Your       leadership to secure the homeland from terrorist attacks by       putting the needs of the nation first in matters before the       Committee is commendable. I am writing to request that as       Chair and Ranking Member that you invite senior members of       the Committee to join you for a meeting with Houston Port       facility security and industrial manufacturing professionals       to discuss the work and industry that takes place at that       port.        The issue of port security remains integral to our       Committee's work, and this opportunity for you, and senior       members of the committee to learn more about modern ports is       appreciated. Ports are indispensable to our nation's economic       health as engines of commercial transportation as well as the       gateway for food and essential goods to the nation's       interior. The evolution of major ports, like the Port of       Houston into co-location sites for manufacturing means port       security challenges have expanded.        Thank you for your work to secure our nation from terrorist       threats by keeping the committee abreast of the most critical       security issues facing our nation. I look forward to your       positive reply to this request.            Very truly yours,                                                Sheila Jackson Lee,                                                Member of Congress.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3101, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
