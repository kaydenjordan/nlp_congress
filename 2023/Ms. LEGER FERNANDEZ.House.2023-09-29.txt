 Madam Speaker, this extreme Republican bill  reveals their mean-spirited values more than any words they utter.  Those values are to kick 275,000 young, 4-year-old children out of Head  Start.   Republicans hypocritically talk about fentanyl but then defund the  law enforcement officers who seize this deadly drug. This bill deprives  that brother, sister, daughter, a friend of yours that you might have  who is battling mental health or addiction, of the funds they use.   Don't talk about fentanyl. Don't talk about addiction if you are not  going to fund the law enforcement and the health resources we need to  truly tackle that.   Madam Speaker, then they slash BAA funding by 30 percent, including  slashing the Tribal law enforcement officers who are out there also  interdicting and protecting us from criminal activity.                                time  1100    The CR really reveals who extreme Republicans are--``sin verguenza,''  ``without shame'' about hurting those  [[Page H4866]]  most vulnerable, cutting programs for our world communities by 30  percent.   I stand for rural America--this bill does not, and it puts down our  ranchers and farmers.   If they don't get their way, what will they do? They will shut the  government down.   Let's remind everybody, every time we have a government shutdown of  any note, it is because Republicans did it under their leadership, and  they hurt everybody in the process. And why? To protect the rich and  the wealthy.   To protect the rich and the wealthy, the extreme Republicans will cut  Social Security. They have said it. We have the words. They will do it.  They will slash public school funding horribly--horribly--for those  schools that most need it. They will criminalize abortion. Over and  over again they have told us what they intend to do in their  appropriation bills. They are going to make it hard for women to get  access to the healthcare they need and they deserve everywhere.   I say that this bill is ``sin verguenza,'' ``without shame.''
