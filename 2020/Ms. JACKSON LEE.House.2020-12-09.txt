 Mr. Speaker, I know that we will be discussing  COVID-19, and I cannot stand on this floor without ever mentioning that  we must help the American people.   But today I stand on this floor to acknowledge the existence of the  Electoral College.   Mr. Speaker, many Americans are unfamiliar with this very interesting  fixture in law. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution gives us the  Electoral College. But let me be very clear. In the next couple of  days, many States will certify those who have voted. The Electoral  College will meet, by the Constitution, on December 14. Most State  legislators have indicated that the electors are to vote the popular  vote. All of the battleground States have certified that the next  President and Vice President of the United States are Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris.   What is my plea today?   My plea today is for us to harmoniously join together in recognizing  the value of this Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, and to  proceed as a House and Senate to embrace this election and the victors.   Why?   Because the Nation needs us, and the Constitution says so.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to us working together.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I certainly associate with the concerns  of the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer. I associate myself with his concerns  and my appreciation for the Appropriations Committee.   Let me thank Ms. DeLauro and my fellow Texan, Ms. Granger, and  certainly make mention of her ascending to continue as ranking member  in the next Congress.    I rise to support this underlying legislation for the extension of  the CR to December 18. And I rise to, as well, reemphasize the  desperate conditions Americans are in. There are 14 million COVID-19  cases, almost 300,000 dead. It is predicted to have Americans,  tragically, that will possibly lose their life in 2021, of upward of  500,000 Americans.   This is a funding bill. When we say keep the government open, what we  really mean is to serve the American people, to make sure that they  have healthcare, that they have education dollars, that they are able  to fund their local police and fire, that they have childcare dollars,  that they have research dollars.   At the same time, if I went on any local street in America today,  they would be asking me to give them a lifeline so their restaurants  can stay open. The small businesses, they would be asking about their  unemployment extension and the cash payments.   That is what we need to get into the negotiation, and we are hoping  to do the funding bill and COVID-19 as well.   I want to rise on the floor today to make a number of points in  particular: the necessity of the unemployment extension and increase-- we had $600 in the past--and the necessity of the cash payment as well.   But I also want to make mention of the fact that our local  jurisdictions, our cities and counties and Tribal jurisdictions, they  need the money for public funding to go directly to them, no strings  attached by the State. They are losing out. Their firefighters are  losing out; their health clinics are losing out; and their municipal  workers are losing out because it is getting entangled with the State.   Finally, the Department of Transportation needs funding for its  environmental assessment for projects like I-45.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many projects, like I-45  in Texas, that recklessly tears into minority neighborhoods without any  response to those voters, those constituents, wiping out their houses  and churches and schools. So the Department of Transportation funding  will be in here that we will have the opportunity to assess environment  impact statements.   Finally, let me offer my greatest appreciation for Chairwoman Nita  Lowey; yes, an angel on this floor for so many years, guiding us,  leading us in a way that brought back the kind of success that America  needs.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. DeLauro for her hard work and I wish her  success as well.
