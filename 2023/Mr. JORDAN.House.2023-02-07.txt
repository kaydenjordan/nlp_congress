 Mr. Speaker, this morning we will read the full text of  the United States Constitution. The text read today reflects the  changes to the Constitution made by the 27 amendments. Those portions  superseded by amendment will not be read.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of  California (Mr. Kiley).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Cline) control the time.
