 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, several hours ago, in the middle of the  night here in the United States, we received word that the summit in  Hanoi between the United States and North Korea would be ending  prematurely. Unable to reach an understanding on either sanctions  relief or denuclearization, President Trump decided to walk away from  the talks without an agreement.   Though I don't know the details yet, and I look forward to speaking  with Secretary Pompeo, I was pleased to see the President recognized  North Korea's unwillingness to strike a comprehensive deal. President  Trump did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal  for the sake of a photo op.   Just like the President, I want a deal with North Korea that will  bring an end to the conflict and change the course of the region.  However, I have always been concerned about the possibility of a bad  deal, especially with the other pressures currently on the President. A  deal that fell short of complete, verifiable denuclearization would  have only made North Korea stronger and the world less safe, and it  would have squandered the substantial leverage our negotiators have now  thanks to the bite of sanctions.   President Trump must now apply the lesson of North Korea diplomacy to  our trade negotiations with China. President Trump must have the  courage to do the same thing with China as he has done for North Korea.  The President must be willing to hold the line and walk away if China  does not agree to meaningful, enduring, structural reform of its unfair  trading policy. President Trump should not fall into the trap of  seeking a deal for the sake of a deal, especially now that talks with  Pyongyang are on hold.   What he did in North Korea was right. He must do the same thing in  China--hold out because he has the upper hand--until we get China to do  the right thing. Just because an accord is, for the moment, out of  reach in North Korea does not mean that the President should be any  more eager to strike one with China if the terms are inadequate or  unacceptable.   The President deserves credit for bringing China to the negotiating  table with tariffs, but he must not squander that opportunity by  cutting a deal that fails to achieve American priorities. Unless China  promises to end its predatory cyber theft of American intellectual  property and know-how, unless China promises to stop artificially  propping up its businesses, unless China promises to end its practice  of forcing American companies to give away their IP to their future  Chinese competitors in order to do business in China, President Trump  should walk away from the negotiations once again.   As important as North Korea is to national security, China is just as  critical--maybe even more critical--to American economic security.  President Trump and his team have a generational imperative to get this  one right. They have a generational imperative not to squander the  chance to achieve permanent reforms to China's economic relations with  the world, changes that would finally put American investors,  businesses, and workers on a level playing field.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, now I want to address two more issues  related to this topic.   First, are the reports that the President is planning to create a  panel of cherry-picked scientists who question the severity of climate  change to ``counter'' the scientific consensus. I mentioned these  reports earlier this week, but I want to update my friends in this  Chamber that Democrats are in the process of preparing legislation that  would defund this fake climate panel. We hope this legislation, like  our resolution, will eventually be bipartisan because it shouldn't be  partisan to oppose a group of handpicked climate deniers spreading the  fossil fuel industry's propaganda under the imprimatur of the White  House. It shouldn't be partisan to oppose the administration's setting  up its own Orwellian Ministry of Truth on climate change.   So I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle who believe in  climate science to sign on to our legislation once we have it ready.    Mr. President, I know my good friend from Georgia has to  get somewhere, and I have to get somewhere. I will be very brief.   I want to take a moment to pay tribute. We have staffers here who are  just unsung heroes. They work day in and day out. Because of their  diligent work, the world and the country is a better place.   One of these people who works in quiet dignity and gets so much done  and is so well respected is Bruce King. He has been indispensable at my  office, and today, this afternoon, it is my unfortunate duty to say  farewell to Bruce.   He has worked in the Senate in some capacity since 1984. He has  worked for Judiciary, Senator Lautenberg, the Budget Committee, and as  the senior  [[Page S1576]]  counsel for multiple Democratic leaders on the Federal budget,  stretching from Leader Daschle to Leader Reid to me. In that short  time, Bruce wasn't short of legislative achievement, from negotiating  the balanced budget agreement of 1997 to blocking the privatization of  Social Security in 2006, from shepherding health reform through the  Senate to passing the financial rescue bill after the crisis in 2008.   One of our most distinguished Senators would be proud of that record.  Their name would be in lights. Bruce did all of that and much more in  his, as I said, quiet, steadfast, brilliant dignity.   I have never sat on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, so when  I became leader, having his experience and wisdom was incredible. I  have met no one who could take these complex issues and put them in  terms that even someone like myself could understand, not being an  expert on those things. He was able to understand the big picture and  never get caught in the minutia, although he knew the minutia extremely  well.   When you ask Bruce's opinion on a matter, he presents it so  succinctly and persuasively that you know it is the right answer in a  matter of minutes, until he decides to play devil's advocate against  his first opinion and convinces you of the opposite because he is one  of those staffers who has never had an ax to grind. He said: Let my  Senators know both sides, and let them decide.    But we knew both sides so well and so lucidly because of Bruce's  ability to take these issues and help us understand them.   He can juggle so many variables in his head at once. He can weigh the  pros and cons. He has an instinctive knowledge of how to deal with the  tradeoffs, and he can keep it all in a simple way.   He is a modest man. He has sat at the same desk in the Capitol for 14  years. Every day, he brings his lunch--peanut butter and jelly  sandwiches--and he leaves the office at almost the same time every  night to have dinner at home with Janis, his beloved wife.   Senators get the spotlight and the credit when our initiatives  succeed, but so many initiatives would never have succeeded without  Bruce King. Bruce, through the years, deserves an ocean of credit for  his work. He would never claim a drop of it because he is a humble man.   For all his expertise, he is humble, kindhearted, and thoughtful.  Everyone likes him. In all the years he has worked here, I never heard  a single person say a single bad thing about him. That is a pretty good  tribute in a place like the Senate.   Bruce's departure will be a loss to his friends and colleagues and to  the Senate as a whole and, of course, to my office.   There is only one bad thing I can say about him. He switched his  allegiance from the New York Mets to the Nationals. The good news is  that he will be able to catch some more games with Janis, his son  Aaron, and his daughter Liana.   Bruce, you are a blessing to our office, to the Senate, and to the  country. We wish you the best.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am joined this morning by a group of my  Democratic colleagues to talk about the greatest threat facing our  country and our planet--climate change. Despite the gravity and scale  of the problem, at no time in the past 5 years have Republicans brought  even a single bill to the floor to meaningfully address climate change.  They brought CRAs to the floor to repeal critical environmental  protections that limited the emission of greenhouse gases like methane.  They brought legislation to open up more Federal lands to oil drilling,  but they haven't brought forward a single meaningful bill to address  climate change.   Ironically, the first bill Leader McConnell would bring to the floor  on climate change is a bill that he and his party intend to vote  against. What a ridiculous sham; what a pathetic political stunt. It  would be a stunt on its own from a leader who just a month ago claimed  he didn't bring sham bills to the floor, but it is an even greater  stunt because they have nothing positive to say about dealing with this  climate crisis.   So today, Democrats will be introducing a resolution to steer the  direction of this conversation about climate change back in the right  direction--all 47 Democrats, every single one.   We are introducing a resolution that affirms three simple things:  First, climate change is real; second, climate change is changed by  human activity; and third, Congress must act immediately to address  this problem. These are three simple things--three things that the vast  majority of the American people agree with. Two are plain facts, and  the third is just a statement that Congress should take action in light  of those two facts.   Our resolution does not prescribe what action we should take. It  doesn't say that someone has to be for this solution or that solution.  It simply states that climate change is happening, and we ought to do  something about it. It is like saying that opioid abuse is a problem,  and we should do something. Surely every Senator agrees with that.   In an ideal world, every single Republican Senator would sign on to  our climate change resolution because there should be nothing  controversial about it at all. But because one political party in  America largely denies the science or, as I am sure my colleague from  Rhode Island will address, is so in the pocket of Big Oil that it  refuses to admit the severity of it, I suspect many of our Republican  colleagues will not sign on, and what a shame--what a shame--that would  be. At least the American people will know which of their Senators  denies the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community.   So if and when Leader McConnell moves to proceed to the Green New  Deal, Democrats will demand a vote on our resolution, and we will see  if Leader McConnell is so eager to take that vote.   Again, I have asked him every day; I asked him earlier this morning:  Leader McConnell, do you believe climate change is real? Leader  McConnell, do you believe it is caused by human activity? And, Leader  McConnell, do you believe Congress has to act to deal with climate  change? We have simply heard silence from the leader and from just  about every other Republican so far.   So we are going to push this resolution, and we hope the American  people will let their Senators who are not on this resolution know that  they should be on it. It is the first step to moving something in a  positive direction because we intend to go on offense on climate.                                  ______                                         By Mr. UDALL (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Shaheen, and Ms.          Murkowski):   S.J. Res. 10. A joint resolution relating to a national emergency  declared by the President on February 15, 2019; to the Committee on  Armed Services.
