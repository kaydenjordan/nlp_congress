 Madam Chair, I rise to support H.R. 729.   I thank Congressman Case for yielding to me and call attention to the  [[Page H9975]]  Great Lakes Fishery Research Authorization Act, which authorizes the  U.S. Geological Service Science Center for the Great Lakes and commend  Congressman Quigley for his hard work on the legislation.   This service protects the Great Lakes Fishery from voracious,  destructive, invasive species that threaten the integrity of our entire  Great Lakes system.   Today, in our district, the Geological Service is leading the charge  to identify and contain grass carp, a pernicious invasive whose  population threatens to explode but for the work of the Federal science  agencies.   Every day, our country sits in neutral with inadequate direction to  the Geological Service we allow invasive species to undermine the  multibillion-dollar Great Lakes Fishery.   The Great Lakes have come a long way since the Cuyahoga River caught  fire 60 years ago and since has healed, but we have a long way to go.   With this authorization, the Geological Service will be able to  conduct deepwater ecosystem science to help us better understand fish  movement and behavior; and, for my district, which contains the most  productive, shallowest, and warmest $7 billion fishery of the Great  Lakes, the western basin of Lake Erie, the service's work protects the  region's priceless ecological and economic future.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 729.
