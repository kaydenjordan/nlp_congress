 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 6395) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the  Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense  activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with the Senate  amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and request a  conference with the Senate thereon.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 12 of rule  XXII, I move that meetings of the conference between the House and  Senate on H.R. 6395 may be closed to the public at such times as  classified national security information may be discussed, provided  that any sitting Member of Congress shall be entitled to attend any  meeting of the conference.
