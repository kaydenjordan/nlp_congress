 Mr. President, this morning the front page of the  Washington Post tells the story about our intelligence agencies  intercepting some communications among the Saudi Government officials.  It appeared they were exchanging information about how to lure a man  named Khashoggi back into Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi is a person who has  been openly critical of the Saudi Arabian leadership. He has published  articles around the world, including in the Washington Post.   We have a video that shows Mr. Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate  in Istanbul, Turkey. We have no video that shows him exiting that same  building. He has disappeared.   This intelligence data, as well as other information, leads us to  believe he has been assassinated--assassinated because he was critical  of the leadership of the Saudi Arabian kingdom. That is what happens in  a country of authoritarian rule that does not protect the right of  dissent.   We see it over and over in history--strong authoritarian rulers can't  stand dissenters. Many of them are killed, imprisoned, tortured, or run  out of the country. It still happens in China. It still happens in  Russia. It happens, obviously, when it comes to Saudi Arabia, Turkey,  and other countries.   We are different. I hope we are. The reason we are different is  because of 45 words--45 words--that were written over 200 years ago.  They are worth repeating. These are 45 words that have guided our  country and still should guide us today.   I am going to take a minute to read them. It is the First Amendment  to the Constitution of the United States, the First Amendment to our  Bill of Rights, credited to James Madison. Here is what it says:  ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''   These are 45 words that distinguish us from virtually every other  country in the world, where we expressly guarantee to ourselves and our  posterity freedoms that are fundamental to being an American.   I have heard my friend the senior Senator from Texas come to the  floor repeatedly now to talk about what happened last week during the  Kavanaugh nomination and in the weeks before, during the committee  hearing, and there were people who came to this Capitol because of  their intense personal and political feelings about that nomination and  what it meant to them personally and what they believed it meant to the  country. They brought their emotions to this place, and they did it  because they are guaranteed the right to do it in this Constitution.   Each of us is guaranteed the right to peaceably assemble and to  petition the government for a redress of grievances. The Senator from  Texas has referred to this as ``mob rule.'' I will tell you, if you  believe these 45 words and what the First Amendment in the Bill of  Rights instructs us in terms of this democracy, then it gives these  people--all people in this country--the right to speak, the right to  express their opinion, and the right to petition their government for a  redress of grievances.   Now, of course, that should never--never--condone violence nor the  incitement to violence. That is where we must draw the line.   If you are going to stand and defend this article of the  Constitution, which we have all taken an oath to defend, then you are  going to defend the right of individuals to speak in this country and  say things that are unpopular and maybe even unacceptable to you  personally.   I have found myself in that position, gritting my teeth and thinking  I wish to heck that person wasn't saying what they were saying, but  they have a constitutional right to do so. They don't have a  constitutional right to be violent or to incite to violence.   I might add, I think they cross the line when they go after  politicians'  [[Page S6787]]  family members and others. That clearly crosses the line. I have seen  it happen in my political life, and I am sure all my colleagues can  tell a similar story.   To call this mob rule is to take the actions of a few and to really  use those as a standard to judge everyone. That is fundamentally  unfair. There were people on both sides of the Kavanaugh nomination who  had intense, strong personal feelings and used their constitutional  rights under the Bill of Rights to express that. They did it peaceably.  They did it in a constructive way. As far as I am concerned, they have  a constitutional right to do it.   For those who crossed the line, they need to accept whatever  consequences come their way. For some, it means being arrested and  maybe more, but for those who complied with this article in the Bill of  Rights, I think we all ought to stand up and say, regardless of party,  this is the Constitution both parties swore to uphold.   To say that what happened last week--even in this Chamber and even in  this Gallery here--is really the whole story is ignoring the obvious.   When the Senator from Texas asks about mob rule, my response is to  say three words: ``Lock her up.''   This week in Iowa, the President held a rally. During the course of  that rally, he was critical of the senior Senator from California. As  he was critical of her, the people attending the rally started chanting  ``Lock her up. Lock her up,'' referring to my colleague from  California.   I am sure the Senator from Texas heard about this. I hope that when  he heard about it, he realized that an incitement to hold someone  criminally liable for using their office in a legal way really steps  over the line.   Let's be honest about this. In the last 2 years, we have seen a  coarsening of the rhetoric in politics in America. Things are being  said now that have never been said before. Oh, they were said in  private or maybe on some website, but now they are being said openly on  a regular basis.   If someone speaks up at a rally, to have a Presidential candidate  say: Let the crowd take care of that, and I will pay the legal fees of  whoever does it--that happened. It suggests to me a coarsening of our  rhetoric in this political world that we live in that is not conducive  to a civilized and constructive democracy. As the Senator from Texas  suggested, we need to really reward civility, and we need to show it  ourselves in the things we say and do as Members of the U.S. Senate.   No, I don't think it is evidence of mob rule in America. It wasn't a  mob that voted here on the floor of the Senate. One hundred Senators  voted, as the Constitution requires us to do, and we did it in an  orderly, democratic way, regardless of whether you agree with the  outcome. The mob didn't rule; the Constitution ruled, and the  Constitution needs to continue to rule.   There are limits to speech. The courts have talked about this for 200  years. But let us never forget that the first 45 words of the Bill of  Rights guarantees to us the right of free speech, peaceful assembly,  and the right to petition our government for redress of grievances.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 60  additional seconds.    The livelihoods of farmers in my home of Illinois depends  on our acting and preventing an endless cycle of historic storms,  floods, and droughts, causing millions of dollars in damage and crop  loss. We have a moral obligation to our kids and grandkids to leave  future generations with a planet that is not plagued by catastrophic  drought, famine, wildfires, hurricanes, and sea level rise. We have the  tools, and we know how to do it. It is time we rise to the challenge.    I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Eric  Dreiband to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights  Division of the Justice Department.   Mr. Dreiband has no experience working on many of the most important  duties of the Civil Rights Division, such as protecting voting rights,  combating hate crimes, and ensuring that police departments respect the  Constitution and civil rights laws.   Instead, he has extensive experience representing corporations who  have been accused of employment discrimination and advocating against  legislation to protect civil rights.   In his personal capacity, he has testified against the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act and against legislation to protect  older workers from discrimination.   We need a head of the Civil Rights Division who will demonstrate  independence and a willingness to preserve the right to vote and civil  rights laws in the face of this administration's regressive agenda.   I am not confident that Mr. Dreiband will be the independent leader  that the Civil Rights Division needs. I cannot support his nomination.    I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily  absent.

Mr. President, more than a year ago, Senator Sherrod  Brown of Ohio and I sent a letter to Purdue University President Mitch  Daniels in which we expressed our concerns about Purdue's proposed  acquisition of the predatory, for-profit Kaplan University.   Kaplan was notorious in the for-profit college industry for their  mistreatment of students.   They had been the subject of numerous State and Federal  investigations and lawsuits for misleading marketing claims, inflated  job placement numbers, and unfair recruiting.   As Senator Brown and I cautioned at the time, Kaplan's troubled  history posed major risks for Purdue's current students and the  institution's reputation as a top public university.   We suggested that at the very least Purdue should commit to clear  protections and reforms for students if it intended to press on with  the transaction.   Among our suggestions was an end to the use of predispute mandatory  arbitration in student enrollment.   Predispute mandatory arbitration clauses prevent students from  bringing suit against a school in a court of law when the school harms  a student, like misleading them about job placement rates or luring  them with other false information.   Instead, students are forced into a dispute resolution process, known  as arbitration, which lacks the procedures and precedents of the court  system and is often stacked against students.   The proceedings themselves, including the outcome, are secret which  hides misconduct from regulators and accreditors.   The clauses are often buried in the fine print of stacks of  enrollment documents that students must sign in order to enroll.   The practice, along with class action bans which prevent students  from bringing suit as a group, are a hallmark of the for-profit college  industry; schools like Corinthian, ITT Tech, and Kaplan notoriously  used the practice to shield themselves from being held accountable  while exploiting students and taxpayers.   But predispute mandatory arbitration and class action bans are almost  unheard of at public and legitimate not-for-profit institutions of  higher education.   In fact, in an August 30 public comment letter to the Department of  Education, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, APLU,  of which Purdue is a member, and other education organizations wrote,  ``We fail to see how allowing [pre-dispute mandatory arbitration and  class action bans] is beneficial to the public.''   Since the Purdue-Kaplan deal was finalized, creating Purdue Global  University, it turns out that the new school continues to use  predispute mandatory arbitration and class action bans.   In response to it coming to light, a Purdue spokesman said that the  practice was ``inherited from Kaplan,'' in an apparent attempt to  deflect responsibility.   The spokesman went on to assert that the Purdue board ``has complete  control over Purdue Global, and has the final say as to which policies  it retains, and which it alters . . . and to enact whatever policies it  deems to be in the interest of students . . .''   Well, Purdue can't have it both ways.   Either the continued use of predispute mandatory arbitration and  class actions bans are a remnant of Kaplan that the board disvows--in  which case, the board should use its authority to immediately end the  practice--or the board must accept responsibility for the practice  continuing under its control and acknowledge predispute mandatory  arbitration as an affirmed Purdue policy that it ``deems to be in the  best interest of students.''   As Senator Brown and I told the Purdue Board in a new letter  recently, they have to choose.   We will be waiting.   I want to be clear: Anything short of meeting the high bar set by  Purdue's fellow public universities and APLU institutions--not using  predispute mandatory arbitration and class action bans in student  enrollment--will be a betrayal of students and Indiana taxpayers.                            ____________________
