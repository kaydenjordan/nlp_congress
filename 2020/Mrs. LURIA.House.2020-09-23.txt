 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, H.R.  4447, and applaud the inclusion of nuclear power as a critical element  of our energy future and our national security.   As an engineer who operated nuclear reactors in the Navy, I saw  firsthand that nuclear power, when deployed safely and responsibly, can  play a key role in our future as a zero-carbon energy source. Advanced  nuclear designs carry potential for our economy, our national security,  and electrical grid, as they can provide a steady source of clean  energy and reduce carbon emissions.   The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act section of this bill would jump- start innovation and advanced nuclear energy by authorizing $55 million  per year through 2025 for an advanced reactor technologies program and  establish the University Nuclear Leadership Program to develop our  future nuclear workforce.   The inclusion of my bipartisan legislation, the Nuclear Energy  Leadership Act, in this bill will facilitate the path to market for  advanced reactors and help the U.S. maintain international leadership  in nuclear technology and safety.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Representative Lamb,  and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for working with me on  this important legislation, and for including the important element of  nuclear power in this energy package.
