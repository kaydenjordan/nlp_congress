 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of spaceflight Apollo 11 that  [[Page H5924]]  first landed humankind on the Moon. As we all know, aboard this mission  were American heroes: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Jr., and Michael  Collins.   When Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon on July 20, 1969, he  secured a place in a long, proud line of Ohioans who have performed  aviation firsts. Beginning with the Wright brothers and continuing  today with the fine scientists at NASA's Glenn Research Center,  generations of Ohioans have consistently led and driven innovation in  our country. For centuries, Ohio has been on the forefront of new  technologies and always pushed the boundaries of mankind in the name of  exploration.   I would be remiss if I did not personally thank those brave  astronauts who led the Apollo 11 mission 50 years ago for putting their  lives on the line in service to their country. When Commander Armstrong  took his first steps onto the Moon, surely, he couldn't have known that  a 7-year-old boy from his home State of Ohio was watching in amazement  with his whole life ahead of him.   May our country always remember how profound the Apollo 11 Moon  landings were, and still are. May we always honor the crew members,  backup crew, support crew, capsule communications, and flight directors  who made this mission a success and may the United States of America  forever remain not only the first, but the principal nation of space  exploration.                            ____________________
