 Madam President, our first session of the 118th  Congress is coming to a close. But in the flurry of last-minute  legislating, I want to call attention to one of the most important  stories that I have read this year.   Now, I don't want to ruin anyone's Christmas, but this isn't good  news. It is deeply sobering.   The Wall Street Journal article titled ``Alarm Grows Over Weakened  Militaries and Empty Arsenals in Europe'' is what I would like to talk  about. And here is how it begins:         The British military--the leading U.S. military ally and       Europe's biggest defense spender--has only around 150       deployable tanks and perhaps a dozen serviceable long-range       artillery pieces. So bare was the cupboard that last year the       British military considered sourcing multiple rocket       launchers from museums to upgrade and donate [those then] to       Ukraine, an idea that was dropped.        France, the next biggest spender, has fewer than 90 heavy       artillery pieces, equivalent to what Russia loses roughly       every month on the Ukraine battlefield. Denmark has no heavy       artillery, submarines or air-defense systems. Germany's army       has enough ammunition for two days of battle.    The war in Ukraine has exposed just how serious our friends'  readiness and supply problems are.   Think about what I said. The largest defense spender in Europe has  considered raiding museums for scraps of usable equipment. When it  comes to heavy artillery, Russia blows through France's entire arsenal  every month. At least, Germany is prepared to do battle, as long as the  war doesn't last longer than a 3-day weekend.   Europe's ``bare cupboards'' problem began many years ago at the end  of the Cold War, when European nations began slashing defense budgets  and drawing down troop numbers. Amazingly, the dire situation today is  actually an improvement from 10 years ago. Since Russia's invasion of  Crimea in 2014, the European Union has increased defense spending by 20  percent.    That is not nearly enough, and it has virtually nothing compared to  our adversaries. Russia's spending increased by 300 percent and China's  by almost 600 percent over the same time period.   European nations still rely on the military strength of the United  States, which was responsible for 70 percent of NATO defense spending  last year. But last year, America's defense spending was 3.1 percent of  GDP, which is very nearly the lowest since the Second World War. Even  if you add in the aid to Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine, America's defense  spending would still be far, far below 4.6 percent of GDP--the amount  spent during the height of Iraq and Afghanistan operations in 2010.   Although it is on the lower end historically, increasing spending  isn't the U.S. military's only concern. The past few decades show that  we are unprepared to increase munitions production at the scale and at  the speed to win a large war. In the Gulf and in the Iraq wars, it took  over 2 years for our munitions procurement and deliveries to reach the  necessary levels. And once these crises ended and demand for munitions  dropped, we again sidelined production and we cut our workforce.   We need to build up the weapons stockpiles required to deter or, if  necessary, fight and win a conflict against a peer adversary. To do so,  we must commit to sustained increases in munitions and weapons  production. Tools like multiyear procurement authority for additional  munitions, which we included in this year's NDAA, can contribute to  that long-term stability.   This boom-and-bust cycle we have of production has put the United  States dangerously behind adversaries like China and Russia, whose  capacity to build and replace equipment far outpace ours right now.   Take, for example, a war game that was recently conducted by the  Center for Strategic and International Studies. In the hypothetical  scenario where war breaks out over Taiwan, China could replace lost  naval ships three times as quickly as the United States.   And if Russia wins in Ukraine, it could rearm itself completely-- completely--in 3 to 4 years. The nation's finance ministry estimates  that national defense spending will grow to 6 percent of its economic  output next year, increasing by 2 percent. That 6 percent would be the  highest level since the downfall of the Soviet Union.   The U.K. has gone the opposite direction. The nation hasn't had a  fully deployable army in over 30 years. And its defense spending is  stuck at 2.2 percent. Britain has pledged to increase that number by a  meager .3 percent--but only when economic conditions allow.   And, unfortunately, industrial capacity will always lag behind  spending. Even if Britain and other nations of Europe massively  increase defense spending today, it would be years before we see that  spending translated into an increase in production capacity. And, by  then, it could be too late.   A new axis is forming. Russia and China have pledged new levels of  cooperation, and both have humming military production machines.   Our allies must invest more in their defense. They must prepare  themselves for what is coming. But they will not be alone.   Russia's war on Ukraine has highlighted a weakness in our collective  security. When the next crisis arises, NATO will be unequipped to  respond. But we cannot allow our alliance to remain unprepared.  Instead, we must make the necessary sustained investments--and we must  start making them now.   The United States must do everything in our power to accelerate our  own production. And we must strongly encourage Europe to do the same.   I yield the floor.
