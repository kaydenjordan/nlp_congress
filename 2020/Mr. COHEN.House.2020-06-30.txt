 Mr. Speaker, we have been experiencing a very unusual  pattern of behavior by the Attorney General of the United States,  behavior that has scared many, and should scare all, for he has abused  his power; he has obstructed justice; and he has violated the First  Amendment.  [[Page H2682]]    He has destroyed almost every norm that existed for Attorneys General  and their relationship to the rule of law, the rule of law that makes  America stand out as the beacon on the hill to nations all over the  world. No longer, for the rule of law has been diminished by his  actions with Michael Flynn, a person who pled guilty twice, admitted to  lying, and, yet, wanted to withdraw the prosecution. And the same for  the change in the plea agreement for Roger Stone and that  recommendation.   He violated the First Amendment at Lafayette Park when he cleared the  park for a photo op for the President.   He abused his power in the Mueller report when he misled the people  in what the Mueller report really said.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons and others, I have been joined by 35  of my colleagues today in introducing a resolution calling for the  impeachment of William Barr and calling on the Committee on the  Judiciary to look into it.                            ____________________
