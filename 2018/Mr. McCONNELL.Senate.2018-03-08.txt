 Mr. President, first, this morning, I would like to  recognize a remarkable Senate career that is drawing to a close.   Gary Endicott has served in the Office of the Legislative Counsel for  37 years. Since his appointment as the legislative counsel of the  Senate in 2015, he has directed that office and has done so with  distinction. Now he is embarking on a well-earned retirement. After  nearly four decades of service to this body, tomorrow is Gary's last  day.   Much has changed during the time Gary has been with us. Over the  years, Senators and staff have asked more and more of the legislative  counsel's office, but thanks in large part to Gary's hard work and then  to his leadership, we can always rely on his team for meticulous  professionalism and expertise.   I understand Gary is headed back to his native Midwest. He departs  with our gratitude and our best wishes for him and for his family.   Mr. President, on another matter, the Dodd-Frank law became effective  in 2010. It ostensibly targeted banks that were deemed too big to fail,  but 7\1/2\ years later, Dodd-Frank has proven to be far too blunt an  instrument. For one thing, it has imposed a crushing regulatory burden  on small community banks and credit unions. Rather than fixing too big  to fail, Dodd-Frank has threatened to make many of these Main Street  mainstays too small to succeed.   This is especially problematic because of the central role local  financial institutions play in each of their communities. Local lenders  provide a majority of small business loans and nearly three-quarters of  agricultural loans, and in low-income communities, when a local bank  closes, research suggests that loans to nearby small businesses plummet  by 40 percent.   With farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and vulnerable communities,  Americans need community banks, and they need credit unions, but Dodd- Frank is making it harder for these institutions to survive. Millions  of Americans, from rural areas to inner cities, now find themselves in  what researchers call banking deserts. Fortunately, help is on the way.   Thanks to the leadership of Senator Crapo, Democrats and Republicans  [[Page S1530]]  have joined together to cosponsor a modest but important bill that  would streamline the obstacles that are tripping up these smaller  institutions. It is a commonsense, compromise measure, and Senators do  not need to resolve all of our differences on Dodd-Frank in order to  unite behind it. I look forward to voting to pass these reforms very  soon.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on a final matter, as I have discussed, a number of  America's largest employers are already reinvesting their tax reform  savings in bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits for their employees.  Higher take-home pay and lower tax rates are helping families cover  today's expenses and save for the future.   In Nebraska, the Lincoln Journal Star reports that hometown companies  Nelnet and Pinnacle Bank have awarded tax reform bonuses to thousands  of workers. In Iowa, the Des Moines Register reports that utilities  will pass along $147 million in tax reform savings to their customers.  Acadia Healthcare, with operations in my home State of Kentucky, has  announced that tax reform will enable it to build additional facilities  on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic.   This week, Vice President Pence has been on the road, hearing how tax  reform is changing Americans' lives and livelihoods for the better. He  visited all three of those States and listened to workers and small  business owners.   It is interesting, though. The huge number of early tax reform  success stories is not getting the applause it deserves from over here  on the other side of the aisle. Every one of my Democratic colleagues  in the House and in the Senate made the political calculation to vote  along party lines and try to sink tax reform--every single one of them  in the House and the Senate. Fortunately, those efforts failed.   Yet, even with tax reform now as the law of the land, it seems my  Democratic friends are so unwilling to admit their mistake that they  would rather try to sabotage the law that is already helping families  and making American job creators more competitive. Just yesterday, for  example, Senate Democrats announced they would like to spend $1  trillion of taxpayer money and roll back Americans' brandnew tax cuts  while they are at it.   This popular, new tax bill has been in effect for a couple of months,  and they want to roll it back already, take the money, and spend it.  There they go again. They just can't help themselves. To tax more,  spend more, take money away from American families, and give it to the  Federal Government is a familiar refrain from our Democratic friends.   Even amidst this tidal wave of good news from tax reform, even in the  face of higher take-home pay, new jobs, new investments, raises, worker  bonuses, and foreign competitors like China getting nervous, Democrats  just can't help themselves. It must be in their DNA. They can't resist  turning back to their old, top-down, tax-and-spend playbook.   By lowering the tax burden on companies, large and small, America  turned on a bright neon sign that is telling the world we are open for  business. Democrats want to unplug it. By lowering middle-class rates  and expanding deductions, we gave families all across the country more  breathing room to save or pay their bills. Democrats want to claw that  money back.   Fortunately, for the American people, the Republicans in the House,  the Senate, and the White House will not let them take back your tax  relief, your lower utility rates, your bonuses, or your new  opportunities. We are proud that we took money out of Washington's  pocket and put it back in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and  that is exactly where it is going to stay.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I send a modification to amendment No.  2151 to the desk.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  amendment No. 2151, as modified.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the bill.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 598, Kevin McAleenan.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 1177 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 4 p.m., Monday,  March 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 2155, and  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the filing deadlines with  respect to the cloture motions filed during today's session be Monday  at 4:30 p.m. for first-degree amendments and 5:30 p.m. for second- degree amendments; finally, that notwithstanding the provisions of rule  XXII, the cloture motions filed during today's session ripen at 5:30  p.m. on Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:35 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 12, 2018, at 4 p.m.                            ____________________
