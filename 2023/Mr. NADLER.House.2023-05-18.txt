 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is nothing more than empty rhetoric  designed to score political points. It does nothing to help our law  enforcement officers do their jobs. It does nothing to solve crimes or  promote justice. It does nothing to take deadly weapons like those used  to target law enforcement off our streets, and it does nothing to make  our communities safer.   It is also wildly misleading and full of incendiary rhetoric that  does not match reality. Very conspicuously, it even fails to recognize  the service or contributions of Federal, State, or Tribal law  enforcement officers.   It is worth remembering that when the Republicans passed their rules  package at the beginning of the Congress, it included several  supposedly ``ready to go on day one'' bills.   An earlier version of this resolution was included in that list, but  it never made it to the floor. Now we know why. The problem is that the  original version praised all law enforcement, not just local law  enforcement, as this resolution does.   Why was that a problem?   Because as we have learned in recent months, House Republicans now  support defunding the police at the Federal level. Don't take my word  for it, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Jordan told FOX News that he wants to  ``look at the appropriations process and limit funds going to some of  these agencies.''   He later made clear he was referring to the FBI and the Department of  Justice.   Mr. Biggs has called directly for defunding those agencies, and Mr.  Gaetz has introduced a bill that would eliminate the ATF altogether.  [[Page H2434]]    Limiting the resolution to local law enforcement also helps  Republicans paper over an embarrassing split in their caucus over  whether even to recognize the contributions of our brave Capitol Police  officers who protected us on January 6.   I remind Members that 41 Republicans voted against awarding  Congressional Gold Medals to the Capitol Police officers and the D.C.  Metropolitan Police Department in recognition of their service on  January 6.   That must be why the resolution states that violent leftist  extremists have attacked law enforcement, but it makes no mention of  the violent mob of far-right extremists and white supremacists who  stormed the Capitol that day injuring 140 police officers with five  officers losing their lives in the days after.   H. Con. Res. 40 is a hopelessly misleading resolution that omits  crucial context and ignores crime trends in the country, including the  disturbing rise in gun violence and the higher per capita murder rate  in States won by Donald Trump.   While Republicans want to talk tough with nonbinding resolutions  about funding the police--local police that is--it was Democrats who  passed bill after bill last Congress to actually fund and support the  police.   So where were Republicans when Democrats went about the serious work  of legislating?   When given the opportunity to put action behind their cheap rhetoric,  time and again, Republicans voted ``no.'' For example, last Congress  Democrats advanced the Invest to Protect Act which would have  authorized $300 million in grants to law enforcement agencies with  fewer than 125 officers to smaller localities.   This legislation passed with bipartisan support, but 55 Republican  Members voted against it.   Democrats also advanced the VICTIM Act led by Congresswoman and  former police chief Val Demings which would have provided grants  totaling up to $100 million per year to law enforcement agencies to  help them solve violent crimes and close outstanding cases.   Mr. Speaker, 178 Republicans voted against it.   Democrats advanced the assault weapons ban which was supported by the  Major Cities Chiefs Association and the National Organization of Black  Law Enforcement Executives because they know that these weapons of war  are used to murder law enforcement officers and to terrorize their  communities.   Nearly every Republican voted ``no.''   House Democrats worked with Republican Senator John Cornyn--who is  not someone known to be soft on crime--to pass the Law Enforcement De- Escalation Training Act, a bill that increases safety for law  enforcement and community members alike.   This bipartisan bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, but when  it came to the House, 159 Republicans voted against it.   This is not and never has been a serious approach to legislating.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 40 is a wasted opportunity to advance  meaningful legislation that would support the men and women of law  enforcement who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker referred to some  remarks I made, and they are accurate.   What I said was that substantial resources should be taken from the  police and given to mental health services, and that was done. About a  billion dollars was taken from the police department in New York City  by the city council and the mayor and given to mental health services.   That made sense. Why? Because when someone is acting out on the  subway, when someone is threatening on the subway, what you usually  need is a mental health professional there, not a policeman who doesn't  know how to handle it.   Since a lot of resources were devoted to mental health, the situation  in the subways generally and on the streets has gotten much better. It  has worked.   I can't speak for anybody else, but I can say that when the gentleman  says we should honor local police, he is also saying we should not  honor Federal police.   This resolution does not honor Federal police. It does not honor the  ATF, the FBI, or thousands of Federal law enforcement officers, the law  enforcement officers who protected us on January 6 from a far-right  attack.   It talks about leftist violence, but it refuses to talk about  rightwing violence. It is not a balanced or fair resolution.   It seeks to give a distorted picture of what is going on in this  country, and that is why we cannot support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, before recognizing the next speaker, let me  also point out that this resolution also claims that progressive  politicians actively encourage resentment toward local law enforcement.   When we tried to remove such misleading claims during the markup,  Republicans said no. We tried to unite behind what should have been the  point of this resolution, support of all law enforcement without  language that shamed or demonized Members and misled Americans, but  Republicans refused. That is another reason we have to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to hear that the gentleman from  Colorado wants to honor Federal law enforcement personnel who defended  us on January 6 and otherwise, which leads me to the question of why  the Republicans refused to let us have an amendment to that effect in  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New York (Mr. Morelle).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the gentleman from  Colorado say he is interested in a resolution praising the Capitol  Police and so forth, which makes it all the more puzzling why the  Republicans refused to let us consider an amendment to that effect to  this resolution in committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, if the gentleman wanted to support our Federal police, the  ATF, the FBI, the Capitol Police, he had the opportunity in committee,  and the Republicans refused to let us consider that.   We have all of these statements from people like the chairman of the  committee saying defund the FBI, defend the ATF. This is being a  little, shall we say--I don't want to use the word ``hypocritical,''  but I can't think of a different word.   We should oppose this resolution because it is blatantly one-sided,  it blames leftist agitators improperly, and it does not deal with  Federal law enforcement agencies.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, police week ought to be a unifying event, a  time when we can all come together in a bipartisan fashion to recognize  and support the men and women of law enforcement who risk their lives  to keep us and our communities safe.   Instead of offering serious legislation, Republicans have brought  forward misleading and incendiary political talking points that will  neither protect law enforcement nor enhance public safety.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  oppose the D'Esposito amendment as its central focus is advocacy for  the law enforcement officers' bill of rights, a controversial measure  pushed by police unions and adopted by many States in response to  demands for greater accountability and transparency following many  high-profile incidents of police abuse and misconduct. While seemingly  benign, the impact of a bill of rights for law enforcement officers can  be profound.   For decades, this type of legislation has been one of the greatest  obstacles to police accountability, hindering investigations, and  shielding misconduct from public scrutiny, a likely explanation for why  less than half of all States have adopted one. In Maryland, the first  State to adopt and the first State to repeal an officers' bill of  rights, the statute was often cited as the reason for Baltimore's long  history of police misconduct.   In many instances, the statutes offer protections and procedural  privileges to law enforcement officers facing accusations of wrongdoing  or disciplinary action far beyond those afforded to other government  employees or to the average civilian accused of criminal behavior.   For instance, some States provide officers involved in an incident a  cooling-off period of 24 hours or so before they must cooperate with  internal investigators. During this cooling-off period, an officer and  his or her attorney may have access to evidence collected during the  investigation before the officer is interviewed.   Through these statutes, officers are shielded from the very interview  tactics that they use on civilians, such as lengthy interrogations or  the use of aggressive or threatening questioning, or promises of  rewards to induce cooperation, both of which this amendment suggests  should be avoided to ensure the fair administration of justice when  investigating officer misconduct and only officer misconduct.   These laws can allow officers accused of wrongdoing to remain on duty  for prolonged periods of time while investigations are conducted, as  well as limit the types of disciplinary actions that can be taken  against officers accused of wrongdoing. They also often limit the  authority of civilian review boards and make it difficult for the  public to access information about officers' misconduct in disciplinary  proceedings and, ultimately, for civilians to hold officers accountable  for their actions.   These concerns have led to calls across the country to repeal or  reform existing law enforcement officers' bills of rights to ensure  more transparency, accountability, and fairness in the disciplinary  process. When mayors and police chiefs have attempted to reform their  troubled police departments, it has been their States' officers' bills  of rights that have stood in the way.   While this amendment might be well intentioned, it encourages States  to adopt a bill of rights for local law enforcement personnel without  offering any guidance so that we might not further perpetuate the  already problematic nature of these measures which I have just  outlined.   Lastly, I note that just as the text of H. Con. Res. 40 celebrates  local law enforcement while ignoring thousands of Federal, State, and  Tribal law enforcement officers, so, too, does this amendment. It is  for these reasons that I must oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, if I mispronounced Mr.  D'Esposito's name, I apologize. I thought I said it correctly.   Secondly, I outlined in my remarks the problems with existing State  bills of rights for police officers. Some States have repealed them.  They have gotten in the way of investigations. They have gotten in the  way of investigations of police brutality and misconduct and generally  have aggravated all the reasons, all the problems that I spoke about in  my opposition to the main bill.   For that reason, I reiterate my opposition to this amendment, and I  urge all my colleagues to vote against it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1015     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
