 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Maryland and  from the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and  I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, the select committee is acting to fulfill a  predetermined narrative. It seems increasingly clear that my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle want to prolong this political process  to distract Americans from the very real issues concerning this  country.   We have record-high inflation, a flood of immigrants at our southern  border, a workforce and supply chain crisis, and instead of working  toward real ways we can combat these crises, or, in fact, even  admitting that these crises exist, we are back here, arguing if we  should continue down a path of yet another partisan investigation of  questionable motive and purpose.                                time  1215    That said, there are several questions that need to be resolved  before we can continue with this vote. The courts have found that the  power rests with Congress over subpoenas to private individuals if they  serve a legitimate legislative purpose.   A legitimate legislative purpose would be issuing subpoenas to the  leaders of the D.C. National Guard and the Sergeant at Arms so that we  can find out what gaps in communications and authorities need to be  filled and find solutions to ensure this doesn't happen again.   But have those been issued? Unfortunately not. Instead, House  Democrats are continuing their witch hunt into President Trump and  their political opponents who voted against the certification of the  election, something that they themselves did just 4 years before.   What information is intended to be gathered that would be useful for  a legitimate legislative purpose? It seems the majority keeps moving  the goalposts for what qualifies them to hold someone in contempt.   This recipient has been cooperative, providing almost 9,000 pages of  emails and other documents. But when the majority couldn't find what  they wanted, the committee subpoenaed Verizon, looking for other  information from his personal phone, invading his privacy.   There is no valid legislative purpose for this subpoena. Where does  it stop? When will they be satisfied with the information they receive?  They cannot continue punishing people just because they aren't getting  the answers that they want.   Furthermore, criminal contempt is not subpoena enforcement. This  decision will still not achieve the stated intent of obtaining the  records.   The committee should seek a civil judgment and legally obligate a  person to comply with the subpoena. Instead, my colleagues are going  forward with this political ploy. Holding someone in criminal contempt  is purely punitive. It leads me to wonder what the real mission of this  committee is.   Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats made it clear early  on that this committee and its investigation were predestined to be a  sham  [[Page H7647]]  when it tilted representation in favor of Democrats, rejecting two  Republican Members selected to serve on the commission by the minority  leader.   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about the precedent being set  today because the majority is blinded by their own political agenda. I  urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  offer an amendment to the rule to provide for the additional  consideration of H.R. 2729, the Finish the Wall Act, authored by  Representative Higgins.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, while the majority is playing their  political games in Washington, a real crisis situation at our southern  border remains. Illegal immigration is at a record high, and there are  real human costs associated with that.   Between the dangerous journey to get to our border and the dangerous  people coming across and continuing to commit crimes, people are dying  in huge numbers because of this crisis.   It is no secret that fentanyl is coming across the southern border.  This year, Border Patrol has seized twice as much of this deadly drug  as last year, and more than 100,000 Americans have died from overdoses.   Because we essentially have an open border, there is no way to  effectively keep criminals from crossing into our country.   Immigrants need to know there is a process for becoming an American  and doing it in the wrong way will have consequences.   Finishing the wall would be a huge deterrent for these bad actors. We  must finish the wall to slow the massive numbers of illegal immigrants  we are seeing before we can have a serious conversation about  immigration reform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Tony  Gonzales).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Garbarino.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Cammack)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this select committee is clearly operating outside the  realm of its intended purpose.   They do not like the information they are receiving, and they know  they aren't getting anywhere. So, instead, they criminally punish those  who they politically disagree with.   There isn't adequate minority representation, and because of that,  the majority has been able to turn the committee into a vehicle to push  their own narrative. It is clearly more interested in pursuing a  partisan agenda to politicize the January 6 attack rather than  conducting a legitimate, good-faith investigation into security  failures leading up to that day.   Again, this is nothing more than an attempt by the Democrats to  distract from the very real issues facing Americans every day. I look  forward to getting back to the real work of solving the supply chain  crisis, reclaiming American energy production, and empowering U.S.  citizens to live their lives without government interference.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and the underlying legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
