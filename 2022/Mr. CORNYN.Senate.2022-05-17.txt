 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled vote.    Madam President, well, as has since been reported in the  news despite our efforts to keep word of our travel somewhat under  wraps before it was accomplished, this last weekend, Senators Collins,  Barrasso, and I had the honor of traveling to Ukraine with Senator  McConnell on a trip where we visited not only President Zelenskyy in  the Presidential palace but also visited two of what we hope will be  the next members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, namely,  Sweden and Finland.   As we all know, it has been nearly 3 months now since Russia invaded  Ukraine. There is no telling what President Putin expected. Perhaps he  expected to be able to occupy Ukraine without firing a shot. But the  fact is that the Ukrainians' spirit and will to defend their country  remain unbroken and undaunted, and Putin's plans have failed and failed  miserably.   We saw this firsthand when we had a chance to visit Kyiv this  weekend. Before the invasion, Kyiv was a cultural, religious, and  economic hub for the great country of Ukraine. Despite being damaged by  Russia's failed attempt to seize the city and occupy Ukraine, Kyiv  still embodies the Ukrainian will to survive against all odds.   When we were there, we met, of course, with President Zelenskyy and  his advisers. They have done what I think we all hope we would do in  the face of an unprovoked invasion, and that is to remain steadfast in  dedication to your people and your country.   President Zelenskyy's leadership has inspired free nations and free  people around the world. His unwavering commitment to Ukraine and its  sovereignty has helped rally the rest of the freedom-loving world to  come to the aid of Ukraine in a number of different ways. President  Zelenskyy, of course, is a product of Ukrainian culture that values  strength, resilience, a love of homeland, and we know that the people  of Ukraine are the same and certainly no different.   The Ukrainian people are determined not just to defend their country  but to win in this fight against Russia, and that is what they have  been doing. What they have asked of us is to give them the tools they  need to fight their own fight.   Since the earliest days of this invasion, the United States has  provided billions of dollars in military and humanitarian assistance,  and we continue looking to President Zelenskyy so we can understand  what more is needed.   This is not only a security crisis, this is a humanitarian crisis as  well since Ukraine is known generally as the bread basket of Europe. He  and his advisers warned us about the possibility of global food  shortages caused by a Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. This will  lead to widespread famine not just in Europe but throughout Africa and  spread the pain far afield from Europe.   When it comes to military aid, President Zelenskyy emphasized a  message he has consistently shared with us: We need more, and we need  it faster--more Stingers, more Javelins, more air defenses, more lethal  aid.   Last week, President Biden signed a bill that I introduced along with  Senators Wicker, Cardin, and Shaheen, which was called the Ukraine  Democracy Lend-Lease Act.   This legislation is rooted in the same lend-lease legislation that  President Roosevelt signed into law in 1941 which allowed the United  States to supply Great Britain and other allies with military  equipment. At that time, President Roosevelt vowed to transform the  United States into what he called the ``arsenal of democracy,'' and the  Lend-Lease Act helped accomplish that.   This legislation, the Ukrainian Democracy Lend-Lease Act, which has  now been signed into law by President Biden, cuts redtape so we can  quickly give Ukraine what it needs to win the war against Russia.   During our visit, President Zelenskyy shared with us the importance  of this historic lend-lease program. We also discussed our commitment  to helping Ukraine until they are victorious and encourage our allies  and partners around the world to work with us--to continue to work with  us to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.    Of course, we are now, as I said, just shy of 3 months into this war,  and we know that we will be called upon to do more, but we all have a  part to play in ensuring that Putin ultimately abandons as futile this  mission to recreate the Soviet Union.   This week, as we know, the Senate will consider a supplemental  funding bill to provide Ukraine with even more security and  humanitarian assistance. I know there are some who disagree with more  funding for Ukraine. To them I would say, this funding, this support,  this military and humanitarian support is not strictly an act of  altruism on our part. We are doing this also because allowing Ukraine  to defend itself is in our best interest. We can't kid ourselves by  thinking that Putin would simply end with his brutal conquest of  Ukraine or if he did, that he wouldn't start it up again in the near  future. If Putin took Ukraine or a sizable portion of its geography,  this would be just the next domino to fall in Putin's mad drive to try  to cobble together whatever he can of the old Russian Empire, which  would have extreme consequences for America and the rest of the world.   Even though Ukraine is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, the outcome of this war will without a doubt have an  impact on the United States and our NATO allies. An invasion of a NATO  country would trigger article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance,  which would require us to come to the aid and defense of a fellow  member of that alliance.   Already Putin has made threats against Moldova, Romania, and now  Sweden and Finland. His actions are an attack on the entire West and  threaten peace and security around the world. It is literally a threat  on the idea of freedom itself. Today, the frontline is Ukraine. Where  that frontline will shift tomorrow is largely up to us and the  Ukrainians.   Peace on the European continent is a peace fought for and won by the  sacrifices of many who came before us. Obviously, we have experienced  an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity around the world  following the Second World War. Having experienced two world wars on  the same continent over a period of 40 or 50 years, anybody in their  right mind would look for ways to try to resist and reduce the  likelihood of another war in Europe during our lifetime.   It was because of the sacrifices of our parents and grandparents that  we have had this, what Bob Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, has  called a holiday from history. Most of us have grown up knowing nothing  but the peace and prosperity bought with the contributions and  sacrifices of our parents and grandparents. But we now have our own  responsibility, not only to our communities, to our families, and to  our Nation to act in the face of this aggression, we have to contribute  our part to the preservation of freedom and democracy around the world  by helping Ukraine defend its freedom and its democracy.   Of course our support for Ukraine has costs, but every position will  entail a cost. Of course, in this situation, the cost of the United  States doing nothing, of simply turning over this democracy and our  security and our economy to Putin, well, that is greater than any cost  that could come by a supplemental appropriation that the U.S. Congress  might make to assist  [[Page S2532]]  Ukraine. We know that world wars have been started by lesser action,  and we must do everything we can to prevent this contagion from  spreading beyond its current boundaries.   So what is at stake here is greater than the future of any one  nation. The security of Europe is in question. The reach of Russia's  aspirations to reestablish its former empire are as well. And we know  that there are global repercussions however we choose to respond.   Of course, other adversaries of the United States are watching to see  what we do. China, Iran, and North Korea are looking for any sign of  weakness that would permit them to take advantage of that weakness to  do something similar to what Putin is doing. We cannot show these  authoritarian governments or their leaders any weakness that might  encourage them to replicate Putin's unprovoked aggression.   While abroad, as I said, we visited with the leadership of Finland  and Sweden at a pivotal and historic time for them. Both countries have  historically been nonaligned with any warring power, but they realize  the imminent threat of this invasion of Ukraine, what that means to  them and their safety and their security. Both countries are now in the  process of applying for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, and I am pleased to see that they will move forward with  that decision and are as I speak.   Adding them to this alliance which has produced the longest unbroken  period of peace and security of any treaty that the United States has  been a part of, their participation will give the United States crucial  partners in Scandinavia and in the High North and in the Arctic region,  and it will nearly double the land border Russia shares with NATO  countries.   You know, it is ironic that Putin said that one reason he invaded  Ukraine is he did not want Ukraine to become part of NATO. He didn't  want NATO on his border. Well, thanks to his missteps and  miscalculation, now he will find Finland, with an 830-mile border, a  member of NATO and on the Russian border--exactly what he said he hoped  to avoid.   Now, I applaud the parliaments of both Sweden and Finland for  breaking with their longstanding provisions of neutrality in order to  serve the best interests of their people and to contribute to the  collective security of Europe. Sweden and Finland will be much safer  thanks to this bold decision by their governments, and they will  certainly add value to NATO and enhance the deterrence of this  collective defense agreement known as the North Atlantic Treaty  alliance.   During our meetings, I told our colleagues, our parliamentarians from  Sweden and Finland, that I backed their accessions unequivocally. Both  of these countries have seen and acted on a major lesson from Putin's  invasion of Ukraine: Putin does not honor internationally agreed-upon  borders no matter what the cost. Sweden and Finland both have robust,  well-resourced militaries, and I look forward as one Senator to  welcoming them into NATO, and I hope all of our colleagues will agree  with that when the time comes.   I am grateful to Leader McConnell for putting together this past  weekend's trip. I found it enormously educational, and I think it sent  a great message, not only to President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian  people that we will continue to support them, whether it is with lethal  aid or humanitarian assistance, but, likewise, I think it sent a  message to our impending additions to NATO--Sweden and Finland--that we  will support their addition to NATO when the time comes here in the  U.S. Senate.   Lastly, I want to share a message from Ukraine. President Zelenskyy  asked us, as Representatives of our various States and the American  people, to convey to the American people his personal thanks and  gratitude for supporting them during this existential fight with  Russia. We, in turn, thanked President Zelenskyy for showing the world  what one country and what one inspired leader can do to rally the cause  of freedom and democracy and nonaggression around the world.   President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians have changed the course of  history for the better, and we unequivocally are with the Ukrainian  people in their fight to remain a sovereign democracy.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
