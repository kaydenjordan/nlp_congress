 Mr. President, the next point of our business today is  going to be the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that is coming up in a  couple of votes from now. This is simply an amendment to be able to  clarify one section of that.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will withhold. I again ask  order on both sides of the aisle so we can proceed.   The Senator from Oklahoma.    This amendment simply clarifies one area. Faith-based  groups have reached out and said they understand this and are  supportive of this, but they would like to get clarity in one section.   I am going to just read this section to you. As it currently reads in  7(b), it says:         This title is subject to the applicability of religious       employment set out in Section 702(a), which is the Civil       Rights Act.    What we are asking for is very straightforward. Everyone has received  a copy of this. It just changes that language to read it to say:         This division shall not be construed to require a religious       entity described in Section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of       1964 to make an accommodation that would violate the entity's       religion.    It is very straightforward. It deals only with religious entities. It  reinforces the Civil Rights Act. I think it was an oversight in the way  this was written. There are some faith-based groups saying: We are  uncomfortable  [[Page S10070]]  with this. It is very narrowly tailored in the way it is written.   I, frankly, would accept this as a voice vote, as well, if we would  like to voice this right now.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.    Do I have time?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time remaining.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6577    The question is on agreeing to the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
