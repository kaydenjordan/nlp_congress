 Madam Speaker, you authorized holding an impeachment  hearing, but I don't think that is what you are really doing.   If so, you wouldn't have disregarded precedent from the Nixon and  Clinton eras, or we would have all voted before this was to proceed.   If so, you wouldn't have denied the minority the ability to call  witnesses or me and other Members the ability to attend hearings or  even view the transcripts.   Madam Speaker, approximately 90 percent of your party members wanted  to impeach before this so-called inquiry ever began. That is why I say  you are really not trying to hold an impeachment inquiry. You simply  want to remove a President. And we are within 1 year of an election.  You want to deny Americans the right to decide for themselves.   At the heart of the matter and the real reason you are doing this is  because your party does not have a winning Presidential candidate and  no significant accomplishments this session.   Madam Speaker, can we please go back to work?                            ____________________
