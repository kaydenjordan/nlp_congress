 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the incredible life  and legacy of Julie Beckett, a champion for individuals who experience  disabilities and for their families.   In 1978, Julie's daughter Katie was born, and 4 months later, Katie  contracted a brain infection that left her paralyzed and on a  ventilator. After 2 years of living in a hospital, Katie's family had  reached the limit on their health insurance policy and applied for  support through Medicaid but were told that Medicaid would not cover  at-home care.   Julie and her husband, Mark, knew they did not want their daughter  growing up in a hospital, especially when she could receive the care  that she needed at home while also being with her loved ones.   Faced with uncertainty and with Federal officials who would not make  an exception, Julie reached out to her Congressman. Julie noted that  making this exception for her daughter would not only be good for her  family but also that keeping her at home rather than at a hospital  would cost the government far less money.   Julie's advocacy worked. Because she made the choice to speak up and  share her story, Congress passed and President Reagan signed into law  an exception to Medicaid rules that enabled Julie's family and many  others to care for their loved ones at home.   Julie's work has had a profound impact on not just her own family but  countless others, including my own. My son Ben experiences severe  physical disabilities, and because of Julie's advocacy, he could grow  up at home and with family. And because he was able to live at home,  Ben had the opportunity to go to school, to learn, and make friends in  our community.   The terrible reality is that before Julie, many children grew up in  hospitals or in institutionalized care, instead of surrounded by the  love and care of their families, siblings, and neighbors.   But my family's story is not unique. In the decades since, what is  now known as the Katie Beckett waiver has changed hundreds of thousands  of lives. More than half a million children have received these waivers  and have been able to live, grow, and thrive at home.   Julie's story is an example of how one person can make a true  difference in our democracy. And even after her successful work in  securing this significant exception for Medicaid, Julie kept fighting  for children who experienced disabilities. She helped lead a charge to  expand coverage and fought against attempts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. And critically, she worked with families throughout the  country to show them how they could be advocates as well.   Julie passed away last month, but her legacy will live on in the  lives that she has changed and the advocacy that she helped to inspire.  I am profoundly grateful for her work, and I join with people across  the country in committing to carrying on her legacy of fighting to  fully include people with disabilities in every facet of American life.
