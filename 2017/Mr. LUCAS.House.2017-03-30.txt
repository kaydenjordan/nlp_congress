 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1431) to amend the Environmental Research, Development,  and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to provide for Scientific  Advisory Board member qualifications, public participation, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1431.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Chairman Smith and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Biggs  for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. I also  thank my good friend, Representative  [[Page H2566]]  Peterson for, yet again, working--helping, I should say--to make this  bill a bipartisan effort. I appreciate his willingness to sponsor this  bill with me.   I had the opportunity to speak in favor of this legislation when it  passed this House with bipartisan support in the 114th Congress. Now, I  come to the floor yet again to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  this important reform. The SAB Reform Act was a good bill then, and it  is a good bill now. This is a policy that is built on the values we  should uphold regardless of which side of the political aisle we are on  or who happens to be the President.   H.R. 1431, the Science Advisory Board Reform Act, ensures the best  experts are free to undertake a balanced and open review of regulatory  science. The Board was established to provide scientific advice to the  EPA and Congress, and to review the quality and relevance of science  EPA uses for regulations. But in recent years, shortcomings with the  process have arisen. Opportunities for public participation have been  limited, potential conflicts of interest have gone unchecked, and the  ability of the Board to speak independently has been curtailed.   If the administration undermines the Board's independence or prevents  it from providing advice to Congress, the valuable advice these experts  can provide is wasted.   Despite the existing requirement that the EPA's advisory panels be  fairly balanced in terms of point of view represented, the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee has identified a number of past  problems that have undermined the panel's credibility and work product.  These include a number of advisory members who received money from the  EPA. At the very least, this could create the appearance of a conflict  of interest.   Some of the panelists have taken public and even political positions  on issues they are advising about. For example, a lead reviewer of the  EPA's hydraulic fracking study published an anti-fracking article  titled, ``Regulate, Baby, Regulate.'' Now, this clearly is not an  objective viewpoint, and should be publicly disclosed.   Public participation is limited during most board meetings.  Interested parties have almost no ability to comment on the scope of  the work, and meeting records are often incomplete and hard to obtain.   This bill is both pro-science, and pro-sound science. This bill is  founded upon recommendations for reform outlined by the National  Academy of Sciences, and the EPA's Peer Review Handbook. This bill  ensures that the Board is balanced, transparent, and independent, all  of which will help prevent the SAB from being manipulated by any group.   H.R. 1431 makes sound science the driving force of the Board, no  matter who is the chief executive officer of our government.   Perhaps most importantly, this bill seeks to increase public  participation that benefits all stakeholders. Currently, valuable  opportunities for diverse perspectives are limited. The Federal  Government does not have a monopoly on the truth. Ask your constituents  back home if they know that.   The public has important expertise that can't afford to be ignored in  a democracy. State, local, tribal, and private sectors have a long  history of qualified scientific experts. Their contributions should be  taken seriously.   Unfortunately, the history of the SAB shows that private sector  representation is often lacking or simply nonexistent. Instead, in the  past, EPA has picked the Board, ignoring the knowledge, experience, and  contributions of those experts. This bill ensures that qualified  experts are not excluded simply due to their affiliation. This will add  value and credibility to future Board reviews.   Mr. Peterson and I recognize the important role science should play  in our policy debates and provides safeguards to give the public  confidence in science. It restores the independent Science Advisory  Board as a defender of scientific integrity.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee, a fellow who has worked very diligently on  the committee for many years.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), a member of the Environment Subcommittee of  the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record the following letters: a letter of support  from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, a letter of support  from the American Chemistry Council, a letter  [[Page H2568]]  of support from the National Cotton Council of America, another letter  of support from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, a letter  of support from the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a  letter of support from the CO2 Coalition, and a letter of  support from the Cato Institute.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 29, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the ``Honest and Open New       EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA       Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.'' These bills       would improve the transparency and reliability of scientific       and technical information that Federal agencies rely heavily       upon to support new regulatory actions.        The HONEST Act is designed to ensure that the studies and       data Federal agencies cite when they write new regulations,       standards, guidance, assessments of risk--or take other       regulatory action--are clearly identified and available for       public review. Additionally, information must be sufficiently       transparent to allow study findings to be reproduced and       validated. This is a critical safeguard to assure the public       that the data Federal agencies rely on is scientifically       sound, unbiased, and reliable.        The EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 would       help ensure that the Science Advisory Board (SAB), which       directly counsels the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) on key scientific and technical issues, is unbiased and       transparent in performing its duties. The bill would       establish requirements that SAB members are qualified       experts, that conflicts of interest and sources of bias are       disclosed, that the views of members--including dissenting       members--are available to the public, and that the public has       the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of       the Board and view EPA's responses. Because EPA relies on SAB       reviews and studies to support new regulations, standards,       guidance, assessments of risk, and other actions, the actions       of the SAB must be transparent and accountable. This is a       critical safeguard to assure the public that the data Federal       agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased.        The HONEST Act and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform       Act would improve the transparency and trustworthiness of       scientific and technical reviews and information that       agencies, including EPA, rely on to justify regulatory       actions that can significantly affect society. The American       public must have confidence that the scientific and technical       data driving regulatory action can be trusted. Accordingly,       the Chamber supports these important bills.            Sincerely,                                                Neil L. Bradley,                                Senior Vice President & Chief Policy      Officer, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                       American Chemistry Council,                                     Washington, DC, March 29, 2017.      Hon. Frank Lucas,      House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Vice Chairman Lucas: On behalf of the American       Chemistry Council (ACC), we want to thank you for introducing       H.R. 1431 ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017,''       to help improve the science employed by the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Agency's       regulatory decision making processes.        The proposed legislation would increase the transparency       and public confidence in the EPA's peer review panels.        The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the       peer review process--a critical component of the scientific       process used by EPA in their regulatory decisions about       potential risks to human health or the environment. The Act       would make peer reviewers accountable for responding to       public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts of       interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives       of qualified scientific experts in EPA's scientific peer       review panels and increase transparency in peer review       reports.        We commend you for your leadership and commitment to       advance this important issue. We look forward to working with       you and other cosponsors for quick passage of H.R. 1431.            Sincerely,                                                        Cal Dooley,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                             National Cotton Council                                                      of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the National Cotton       Council, thank you and your committee for the work on the EPA       Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 (H.R. 1431) and the       Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017--HONEST       Act (H.R. 1430). We support both of these critically       important bills in an effort to return sound science and       transparency to the regulatory process that affects our       members and all of agriculture.        The NCC is the central organization of the United States       cotton industry. Its members include growers, ginners,       cottonseed processors and merchandizers, merchants,       cooperatives, warehousers and textile manufacturers. A       majority of the industry is concentrated in 17 cotton-      producing states stretching from California to Virginia. U.S.       cotton producers cultivate between 9 and 12 million acres of       cotton with production averaging 12 to 18 million 480-lb       bales annually. The downstream manufacturers of cotton       apparel and home furnishings are located in virtually every       state. Farms and businesses directly involved in the       production, distribution and processing of cotton employ more       than 125,000 workers and produce direct business revenue of       more than $21 billion. Annual cotton production is valued at       more than $5.5 billion at the farm gate, the point at which       the producer markets the crop. Accounting for the ripple       effect of cotton through the broader economy, direct and       indirect employment surpasses 280,000 workers with economic       activity of almost $100 billion. In addition to the cotton       fiber, cottonseed products are used for livestock feed, and       cottonseed oil is used as an ingredient in food products as       well as being a premium cooking oil.        As you know, agriculture struggles with many factors in the       production of fiber, food, and fuel, but the regulatory       impact and burdens on our industry have greatly increased       over the last several years. In addition, we have found       ourselves unable to adequately defend and maintain many of       our crop protection products and technologies because we are       often unable to access the data used by federal government       agencies to place additional restrictions on these products       and technologies. We believe these two bills--H.R. 1430 and       H.R. 1431--will greatly improve the transparency of       regulatory review process. These two bills will substantially       enhance the role of sound science that was intended to be a       centerpiece of the regulatory process.        We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in       Congress to get these bills enacted into law. If you have any       questions or need any additional information from us, please       have your staff contact Steve Hensley in our office.            Sincerely,                                                     Reece Langley,      Vice President--Washington Operations.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports the ``Honest and Open New EPA       Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA       Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.''

Bradley,                                Senior Vice President & Chief Policy      Officer, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                      March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar S. Smith,      Chairman, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: The American Exploration & Production       Council (``AXPC'')  [[Page H2569]]       and the Independent Petroleum Association of America strongly       support the enactment of both the EPA Science Advisory Board       Reform Act and the Honest and Open New EPA Science-Treatment       Act and are most grateful to you and your committee for your       efforts in respect of the important objectives set forth in       each of these pieces of proposed legislation.        AXPC is a national trade association representing 33 of       America's largest and most active independent natural gas and       crude oil exploration and production companies, each with       considerable experience drilling, operating, and producing       oil and natural gas on federal lands. AXPC members are       ``independent'' in that their operations are limited to       exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.       Moreover, its members operate autonomously, unlike their       fully integrated counterparts, which operate in additional       segments of the energy business, such as downstream refining       and marketing. AXPC members are leaders in developing and       applying innovative and advanced technologies necessary to       explore for and produce oil and natural gas, both offshore       and onshore, from non-conventional sources.        IPAA represents the thousands of independent oil and       natural gas explorers and producers, as well as the service       and supply industries that support their efforts, that will       most directly be impacted by the U.S. Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) policy decisions to regulate methane       directly from the oil and natural gas sector. Independent       producers develop about 95 percent of American oil and       natural gas wells, produce 54 percent of American oil, and       produce 85 percent of American natural gas. Historically,       independent producers have invested over 150 percent of their       cash flow back into American oil and natural gas development       to find and produce more American energy. IPAA is dedicated       to ensuring a strong, viable American oil and natural gas       industry, recognizing that an adequate and secure supply of       energy is essential to the national economy.        The EPA's Science Advisory Board is a critical link in the       EPA's policy making process and must, therefore, be unbiased       and motivated only to seek the best possible policy result       based on the best possible, publicly available, verifiable       data. Moreover, open, public debate must be encouraged, not       discouraged. The goal must be to get the best possible       result, which is why the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform       Act should be enacted.        Science used to support or as a basis for regulations or       other policies should be based on publicly available       scientific and technical data so as to allow for and even       encourage independent fact finding and analysis. Transparency       is critical to this process. The Honest and Open New EPA       Science Treatment Act would accomplish this result.        AXPC and IPAA urge passage of both of these critical pieces       of legislation and stand ready to assist in any way you       believe we might be able to add value to this process.        Should you have any questions or require additional       information contact AXPC or IPAA. Thank you for your good       work on these and other issues.            Very truly yours,      V. Bruce Thompson,        President, AXPC.      Lee O. Fuller,        Executive Vice President, IPAA.                                   ____                                                    CO2 COALITION,                                       Arlington, VA, March 8, 2017.      House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lamar Smith and the Committee: The CO2       Coalition supports the purpose and principles of the ``Honest       and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017'' and the       ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.'' We would,       in fact, support such principles applied on a government-wide       basis.        The scientific method demands that the results of       scientific studies be capable of replication. While it is       generally up to individual scientists, journals and the       larger scientific community as to how the replication       requirement is satisfied, when it comes to science used to       set public policy, there can be no doubt that the relevant       methods and data must be publicly available for purposes of       replication.        With respect to the federal government obtaining       independent science advice from outside advisors, it goes       without saying that advisory panels should not be unduly       influenced by members hoping to curry government favor or to       advance personal agendas. Panels should be truly independent       and unbiased. Clear and enforceable standards will help meet       this goal.            Sincerely,                                                    William Happer,      President, CO2 Coalition.                                   ____                                                             CATO,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar S. Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives.        Dear Congressman Smith: Recently, Committee staff sent me       copies of two draft pieces of legislation, the ``HONEST Act''       and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017''.        The Cato Institute interprets its tax-exempt status as       precluding any specific support of adoption (or       recommendation of rejection) for pending legislation.       However, I can comment on substantive aspects of such       legislation.        The HONEST Act would require that regulations promulgated       by EPA be backed by reproducible and transparent science. In       the are of climate change, this will surely provoke a timely       inquiry as to whether the climate models that are used to       calculate the Social Cost of Carbon, and the justification of       subsequent regulations, are indeed ``science''. I would argue       that they are not.        A climate model is merely a complicated mathematical       statement of multiple hypotheses. These include a prediction       of a general warming of surface temperatures, and a greater       warming of the tropical troposphere. All subsequent changes       in weather regimes--such as rainfall, winter snows, and       Atlantic hurricanes derive from the warming and its       distribution.        As such, a reasonable test of hypothesis would be to       examine the performance of these models as carbon dioxide has       accumulated in the atmosphere, and during the period in which       we have multiple, independent measures of bulk atmospheric       global temperatures, which would be from 1979 to the present.       As I noted in recent (February 28) testimony, there is a       clear systematic failure of these models, with the central       estimate of warming generally twice as large as what is being       observed as a whole in the troposphere, and as much as seven       times larger than what is being observed in the tropical       upper troposphere.        This, and other recent refereed publications are finally       beginning to detail the subjective fashion by which the       equilibrium climate sensitivity is being derived, argue that       these models do not constitute science in the classical       sense. It would be more appropriate to call the field       ``climate studies''.        Litigation deriving from the HONEST Act is likely to       uncover this problem, with the likelihood that EPA's 2009       Endangerment Finding, which empowers subsequent regulation of       carbon dioxide, should be vacated because of a lack of       verifiable science associated with its determination.        The other piece of legislation will open up the EPA Science       Advisory Board(s) to more institutional diversity and less       political selection.        I hope you find my comments useful, and stand available to       answer any questions or provide any amplifications you may       desire.            Cordially,                                        Patrick J. Michaels, Ph.D.,                         Director, Center for the Study of Science.     Mr. Speaker, I would note to the body, part of the  challenge that we face here today on this bill is like so many  challenges we face as Members of Congress: How do you avoid the short- term perspective? How do you take the long view? How do you set into  motion things that, while they might not, perhaps, give us the great  advantage in the short-term sense that either side of the room would  want, in the long-term, they are in the best interest of the body?   I would remind my colleagues, the Scientific Advisory Board is  appointed by the EPA; the EPA is managed by the Director; the Director  is appointed by the President of the United States. If you believe that  the work product, if you believe that the rules that have been  generated by this in recent years reflect your perspective, I  understand that, but nothing is ever static.   We have recently had a change of administration. We have a change of  direction in the leadership of the EPA. That will be reflected in all  the appointments and the actions of the EPA.   I implore my colleagues, we need to work in the perspective of what  is in the long-term interest; and that long-term interest is providing  scientific review at the SAB that our fellow citizens have confidence  in and that will generate good rules and regulations when they have to  be created.   Following this course of action advocated in H.R. 1431 will not make  my most conservative constituents happy because they want to duplicate  what they believe my most liberal constituents have advocated for  years, but our goal here is not to empower one or the other side in  these perspectives to force their will upon the country. Our  responsibility with the SAB is to create a process where we can have  confidence in the results and where, when appropriate, the end  resulting regulations, the rules that come from it, will be in the best  long-term interest of the Nation as a whole.   I know there are requirements in here that, if you have taken money  as a scientist to do a research project from the EPA, you have to cool  off for 3 years. But what is wrong with allowing a little separation  between the people who take money to do the studies and then become the  judges of other studies in the knowledge that perhaps the people who  have done the studies will judge their studies? What is wrong with  that?   And the public disclosure about allowing people with knowledge and  expertise to participate, too, if they have  [[Page H2570]]  a conflict through these disclosures, we will know. I would hope that  whoever leads the EPA on whatever day would act in a responsible  fashion.   I just want, through this bill, to change the system so that the  perception is out there that the SAB and the scientific process and the  rulemaking that comes from it at EPA are being gained by one  perspective or the other because that is in no one's best interest.   I know we live in tough times and challenging times to legislate. I  think my colleagues know, in the legislation I have worked on before,  that I have always worked across the aisle. I have always worked with  every perspective within this body. I have always tried to take that  long-ball perspective. I know it is a challenging time, but think about  that as we continue this well-meaning, good-spirited, very focused  debate.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), the former chairman of the Science, Space,  and Technology's Subcommittee on Environment.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the second set of  letters which I referred to earlier.                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the 140,000 members of       the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am       writing to express NAHB's strong support for the Honest and       Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 and the EPA       Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. These bills would       ensure an open and honest scientific process by allowing the       public access to the science that underpins regulations       developed by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and       ensuring that scientists advising the EPA on regulatory       decisions are not the same scientists receiving EPA grants.        It is important for the EPA to use sound science in order       to support their rulemakings. Far too often, the EPA relies       on science that lacks transparency and reliability to       buttress their rulemakings. This is a consequence of the EPA       conducting their scientific review of rulemakings behind       closed doors. The EPA frequently ignores scientific integrity       by limiting public participation, excluding state and private       sector expertise, and pushing a specific agenda by appointing       scientists who are biased. In some cases, scientists that       have been appointed to review proposed regulations have       received EPA grants which the EPA disregards as a conflict of       interest.        The EPA should not be able to create costly regulations       without being transparent, fair and open to public input when       considering the science behind a rulemaking. However, the EPA       has sacrificed the integrity of the rulemaking process by       using biased science to push their agenda. It is important to       address these shortcomings so that future rules can be       transparent and honest.        For these reasons, NAHB urges the House Science, Space and       Technology Committee to support the Honest and Open New EPA       Science Treatment Act of 2017 and the EPA Science Advisory       Board Reform Act of 2017, in order to bring transparency and       integrity to the regulatory process.        Thank you for giving consideration to our views.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III,        Executive Vice President & Chief Lobbyist, Government       Affairs and Communications Group.                                   ____                                                    Small Business &                                           Entreneurship Counsel,                                          Vienna, VA, March 7, 2017.      Hon. Frank Lucas,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Science, Space and Technology Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Representative Lucas: On behalf of       the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council)       and its more than 100,000 members nationwide, I am pleased to       voice our strong support for the ``EPA Science Advisory Board       Reform Act of 2017.''        This important legislation reforms the Environmental       Protection Agency's (EPA's) Science Advisory Board (SAB) and       its subpanels by strengthening public participation,       improving the process for selecting expert advisors,       expanding transparency requirements by board members, opening       the board's research to public review, and limiting       nonscientific policy advice. The reforms proposed by the       legislation are especially critical given the growing impact       of EPA's regulations on America's small business sector, the       controversial science used as the basis to advance certain       rulemakings, and the need to ensure that sound science is       guiding EPA actions.        Balance, independence and transparency are critical to       EPA's scientific advisory process. The bill addresses key       concerns with the SAB, such as placing limitations on its       members who receive environmental research grants, applying       conflict of interest standards, and ensuring balanced       representation on the board's membership.        These are sensible reforms that will strengthen the SAB's       integrity and work, and by extension EPA's regulatory       process.        SBE Council supports solutions that improve the regulatory       system to ensure the voice of small businesses and       entrepreneurs is heard and considered, that they operate and       compete under rational rules, and transparency throughout the       regulatory process. The ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform       Act of 2017'' is an important legislative initiative that       brings fairness, transparency and objectivity to the SAB and       EPA rulemakings.        Please let SBE Council know how we can further support your       efforts to advance this important legislation into law. Thank       you for your leadership, and support of America's small       business and entrepreneurial sector.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                              National Stone, Sand &                                              Gravel Association,                                                     Alexandria, VA.        The National Stone Sand and Gravel Association supports       both The Honest and Open New Science Treatment Act of 2017       (HONEST Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017.        Both acts go a long way towards addressing many of the       current issues our industry has with regulatory science, and       we encourage the House Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology to mark up both pieces of legislation.        Our association represents 100,000 jobs across the United       States. The regulatory burden on our workforce dramatically       impacts our ability to provide cost-effective materials for       America's roads, runways, bridges and ports. Our members       pride themselves on their commitment to environmental       stewardship and are heavily involved in sustainability and       reclamation in their communities.        Federal regulations must balance industry's voice and       environmental and health concerns. Unfortunately, we often       see problems in the scientific underpinnings of regulations       when agencies select studies that are neither public nor       reproducible as the basis of new rules. This practice chips       away at the credibility of any regulatory action and makes it       difficult for industries to respect the regulatory process.       Our members have the right to comment on regulations and it       is not reasonable to ask hard working men and women of any       industry to trust that an agency has selected good science       without if an agency is not being transparent.        Stakeholder input in the regulatory process is required       under federal law and valuable for the justification and the       implementation of rules.        NSSGA stands ready to work with Congress to ensure that       industry, states and the scientific community can work       together openly and honestly to create regulations.            Sincerely,                                             Michael W. Johnson,                                                  President and CEO,      National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association.                                   ____                                      Portland Cement Association,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.      Chairman Lamar Smith,      The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington,           DC.      Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson,      The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Bernice Johnson: The       Portland Cement  [[Page H2573]]       Association (PCA) supports the EPA Science Advisory Board       (SAB) Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest and Open New EPA       Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. PCA is the       premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence       organization serving America's cement manufacturers. PCA       members represent 92 percent of U.S. cement production       capacity and have facilities in all 50 states. The       Association promotes safety, sustainability, and innovation       in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous       improvement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and       generally promotes economic growth and sound infrastructure       investment.        PCA supports these bills because they would improve       fairness and transparency in the regulatory process, while       promoting use of the best available science. As you know, SAB       reform is needed to update and strengthen the scientific       foundation of EPA's regulatory decisions. The SAB Reform Act       would improve the Science Advisory Board by ensuring balance       among its members and providing better public access to       scientific information and data. SAB reform is an important       step toward improving EPA's regulatory process, public access       to information, and transparency.        The HONEST Act would similarly improve transparency and       access to information. Scientists reviewing agency studies       and rulemakings need a fair chance to evaluate and validate       the studies EPA relies on in the rulemaking process. The       HONEST Act protects the sensitive and confidential       information often covered by confidentiality agreements,       while allowing EPA to make critical information available for       public comment and access. The HONEST Act follows the data       access requirements of many scientific journals. This level       of transparency and potential for peer review are critical to       improving regulatory decisions.        PCA supports the Committees' efforts to improve       accountability, public access, and better science in the EPA       rulemaking process. Please feel free to contact Rachel Derby,       PCA's Vice President of Government Affairs, for further       information on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                  A. Todd Johnston,      Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                       American Farm                                               Bureau Federation,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chair, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and           Technology, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: Later this       week, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee will       consider legislation to provide for Scientific Advisory Board       (SAB) member qualifications and public participation. The       American Farm Bureau strongly supports this legislation and       pledges our commitment to work with the committee in pressing       for its swift consideration.        This legislation is a priority because it reforms the SAB       process by strengthening public participation, improving the       process of selecting expert advisors, and expanding the       overall transparency of the SAB. While the SAB should be a       critical part of the scientific foundation of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory process,       EPA has systematically used its authority to silence       dissenting scientific experts. Rather than promote fairness,       transparency and independence to ensure unbiased scientific       advice, EPA routinely has ignored its own Peer Review       Handbook and silenced dissenting voices on expert panels.        This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a       tool that can help policymakers with complex issues while       preventing EPA from muzzling impartial scientific advice.       This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We       applaud your leadership in this effort and will work with you       to ensure passage.            Sincerely,                                                      Zippy Duvall,      President.                                   ____                                                      March 9, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: We are writing to express our strong       support for H.R. 1430, the ``Honest and Open New EPA Science       Treatment Act of 2017'' (HONEST Act), and H.R. 1431, the       ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.''        For too long now, the Environmental Protection Agency has       hidden key scientific data from the public and corrupted its       own boards of outside science advisors. This subversion of       science and the regulatory process has produced costly, job-      killing regulations of dubious-to-no merit to public health       and the environment.        We welcome these bills in the names of transparent       government, and unbiased and balanced peer review.            Sincerely,      Craig Richardson,        President, Energy & Environment Action Team (E&E Action).      Amy Oliver Cooke,        Executive vice president, Independence Institute.      Kathleen Sgamma,        President, Western Energy Alliance.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate to my colleagues, this is a situation  where the goal really is not to empower one perspective or one faction  over another. The goal, ultimately, of this bill--and, yes, this did  come out of the inspector general's report, the initial work and  effort. The goal of the bill is to add transparency, accountability.  The goal of the bill is to increase the American people's confidence in  the work product that is then used by the EPA to craft the rules and  regulations that impact every life in this country on a daily basis.   Whatever your perspective may be, remember, the pendulum in this  great Nation, when it comes to the executive branch, in my time, every  8 years, has swung back and forth. Just because at the present moment  or the past moment you think you got your perspective's way, or if  perhaps you think with the pendulum swing now you will get your  perspective's way, that is not what the focus should be here.   I would also remind my colleagues, in my 23 years, I have served in  the minority soon to be for 4\1/2\ years. But the other 18\1/2\ years,  I have served in the majority. I have served in the majority. So when I  step up to you and say we can do better, we can enhance the quality of  information, we can do it in a way that the American people have more  confidence in ultimately what goes on, and we can do it in a way that  makes it more difficult for anyone to hijack the process, I say that  sincerely.   There is nothing wrong with full disclosure for everyone who can add  to the process, who should be available for consideration. There is  nothing wrong with a financial cooling-off between benefiting from the  studies and analyzing someone else's studies. There is nothing wrong  with this.   But if you stay with the status quo, this Board and this Agency are  in change. Get ready for 8 years of a dramatically different way of  doing things.   Now, maybe you are so confident that the pendulum will swing back  again that you are willing to accept that. But as for me, I want to  stay between the lines. I want to focus in ways that, for the long  term, represent the best interests of this great country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1431. I ask my  colleagues to think about 10 or 20 years down the road. I ask my  colleagues to put the long-term best interests of their constituents  first.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    I claim the time in opposition to the motion, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I look at this language--and I am a farmer by  trade; I am not an attorney; I will confess that--but the phrase ``or  other entity'' seems to be a very broad concept. How will that affect  people who work for research foundations at institutions of higher  education? How will that affect entities, people who are part of so- called think tanks in places like Washington, D.C.? I personally  believe the language is intended more to simply turn the bill inside  out.   On that basis, I would ask my colleagues to reject the motion to  recommit with instructions and to pass the underlying bill.   But I go one step further, and I offer this in the most sincerest of  ways: if you look at the discussion today and if you look at the  discussion that has gone on for some time on these issues, it is almost  as though there are those with certain perspectives who are trying to  force their will--their perspective of what is right and wrong  scientifically or economically or socially--on the rest of the country,  on the rest of us, and, for that matter, on the rest of the world.   That is why I am the author of this bill. No one entity should have  the power by manipulating the bureaucratic process or the rulemaking  process to enforce their definitions of everything on the rest of us.  We have both the right and the responsibility to judge this information  and to make decisions about what is in our enlightened self-interest,  as the old economist would say, or in the best interest of the country  or of society as a whole.   That is why I want all of us--the great American people--to have  access and some certainty about the people and the process that are  driving everything in our world.   Reject the motion, pass the bill, create greater transparency,  incorporate more input, and when it is necessary to have rules and  regulations, generate good rules and regulations so that we all have a  chance to prosper and to live up to our potential in this country.  Don't let the tyranny of the idealistic--whatever perspective they may  have--drive us all into despair and destruction.   With that, I respectfully ask my colleagues to reject this motion and  pass the underlying bill.   I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.
