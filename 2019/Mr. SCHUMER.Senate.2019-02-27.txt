 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I heard Leader McConnell knocking the  Green New Deal. I would ask the leader--and we are going to keep asking  him and every Republican in this Chamber--what they would do about  climate change, about global warming.   So, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change, global  warming, is real? Yes or no.   Second, do you believe that climate change, global warming, is caused  by humans?   And, three, do you believe that Congress should take immediate action  to deal with the problem?   Until Leader McConnell and his Republican majority answer those  questions, the games they are playing here will have no meaning. This  is not a debate. It is a diversion. It is a sham.   Democrats will be introducing a resolution in a few days--shortly-- that says we believe in these three things, and we will be asking our  Republicans if they support or oppose that resolution.   The silence of the Republican majority on climate change is enormous.  Is it because the oil industry gives so much money to our Republican  friends? Is it because they are antiscience? What is the reason?   Not a single bill has been brought to the floor to deal with climate  change or global warming in the 5 years Leader McConnell has been the  majority leader. What is your plan, Leader McConnell? What is your  answer? We know what you don't like. What do you like? Anything?
