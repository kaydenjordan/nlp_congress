 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be up  to 6 minutes of debate before the next rollcall vote.    Now, Madam President, I think we can move along quickly  if we do have order, and I do appreciate that.   I call up my amendment No. 1055 and ask that it be reported by  number.    Mr. President, I ask consent to have 1 additional minute  on each side.    I reserve the time of the proponents.    Mr. President, I claim the time.    Mr. President, to close on behalf of the proponents, this  is a bipartisan amendment, and it deserves bipartisan support by the  U.S. Senate.   Rather than set up a disruptive new bureaucracy, it builds on the  requirement for the President simply to select, of the inspectors  general, a lead inspector general reporting directly to the Secretaries  of Defense and State.   If you want true oversight and you want to put it in the statute,  this amendment is necessary. That is what it does. It is simple, it is  effective, and it puts it into law with the signature of the President.   I urge a bipartisan ``yes'' vote for this bipartisan amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1055     I ask for the yeas and nays.
