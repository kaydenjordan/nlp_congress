 Mr. President, I want to talk specifically for a few  minutes about mental health care and about an amendment that I will be  offering this evening. But I do want to start off by stepping back for  a moment and indicating that, from my perspective, I know those of us  on the Democratic side of the aisle understand that we have work to do  together to continue to bring down costs for health care and, in some  areas where there is not enough competition, in fact, to create that  competition. Affordable health care is the goal for all of us. I have  concerns in looking at my small business community that we continue to  do things that support them. That is different than what we are being  asked to vote on here.   What we are being asked to vote on is a repeal of health reform that  touches every American and all of the patient protections that we put  in place that have moved total control from insurance companies to  people with insurance so that we can't quit a job if we get sick. If  you have a preexisting condition, are a diabetic, or have heart disease  or you had some other challenge or your child has, you know that you  will have confidence that you will continue to be able to find  insurance and see your doctor. There are all of the provisions that are  here--young people up to age 26, all of the efforts that we put in  place to make sure that you have the confidence and the ability to know  that you have insurance. We need to ensure that if someone has cancer,  they are not going to be capped with the amount of care they can get.   Yesterday in the capitol in Lansing, MI, there were physicians and  pediatricians working with cancer patients, with children and their  families, who were talking about the fact that, because of the  Affordable Care Act and taking off the caps on the amount and kinds of  treatment that children with cancer can get, literally, lives have been  saved. Parents are now looking at this body and the Congress as a whole  and the new President and are saying: Why in the world would we want to  go back to a situation where people can't get the level of care, the  quality of care, or, in some cases, the care at all for themselves or  their families?   So we are proposing that, rather than repealing health reform, which  unravels the entire health care system because part of it is Medicare,  part of it is prescription drugs going back up--it weakens the Medicare  system, and it weakens the Medicaid system, where most of the dollars  are going to seniors in nursing homes. It creates a situation where  someone who is working very hard at a minimum-wage job and hasn't been  able to have insurance because their employer didn't provide it can now  have the assurance that they can care for themselves and their families  and see a doctor without using the emergency room for regular  treatment, which, of course, is the most expensive way to get health  care and drives the costs up. What is being proposed is that we unravel  all of it and literally create chaos in the system. We are for  affordable health care, and we are willing to work with anybody at any  time. I, certainly, will be ready and willing to do that. But I reject  the idea that we are going to repeal and unravel the entire health care  system and create chaos for families, businesses, and communities.  There are many communities where the hospital system is the major  employer in the community. Health care is one-sixth of the entire  economy and is going to be impacted by this.   I want to specifically speak about the importance of accessible and  affordable mental health services and what we have been able to achieve  with protections established by the Affordable Care Act that ensure  people can receive care. We have come a long way since over 50 years  ago when President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health  Act and put down a marker about the importance of treating health  issues above the neck as well as below the neck. Comprehensive health  care should affect every organ, every part of the body, every kind of  disease. We have made major steps in that direction. We have a long way  to go to get the comprehensive care we need in the community, but we  have made major steps forward, including bipartisan efforts here  related to the Cures Act, as well as the efforts that Senator Roy Blunt  and I have been working on to make sure the payments for providing  services in the community are the same for mental health and substance  abuse services as well as physical health. So we have made steps  forward, but the reality is that repealing the Affordable Care Act will  take us backwards in a major way.   I have introduced, along with colleagues who are also champions on  this issue--Senators Cardin, Murphy, Durbin, and a number of other  Democratic colleagues--an amendment that would help to prevent passage  of any legislation that would reduce or eliminate services and access  to mental health care. This is an amendment that should not even be  necessary, particularly given the fact that we have worked in a  bipartisan way on other pieces of legislation to move forward.   I don't know why we would ever pass something that reduces or  eliminates access to mental health or substance abuse services such as  opioid treatment. Why in the world would this body come together and  jeopardize work we have already done, essentially ripping it apart? The  repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the cuts to the Medicaid Program  do exactly that.   Why is this important? Well, nearly one in five adults in our country  has a mental illness. About 4 percent of adults have serious mental  illness. Unfortunately, even now, with work we have been doing, we  still have over 60  [[Page S241]]  percent of people who don't receive the full treatment they need. We  should be working together on that, not taking away the access to  treatment that people already have.   This touches all of us in one way or another. I think all of us--our  families, our friends--know someone. In my case it is very personal. I  grew up with a loving, wonderful father who became ill when I was in  elementary school. He was misdiagnosed and mistreated for years, and  finally was accurately diagnosed as being bipolar, meaning he had a  chemical imbalance in the brain. So contrary to other people who may  have a sugar imbalance and they take their insulin because they are  diabetic or they may have some other chemical change or imbalance where  they can get treatment that has been covered under health insurance, if  it is a chemical imbalance in their brain, up until the Affordable Care  Act, it was not required to be covered under health insurance. It was  not required, even though we passed policies stating that there should  be mental health parity. For the first time, in the Affordable Care  Act, we said in every definition that, when we talked about health  care, it would include behavioral health, mental health, and substance  abuse. As a member of the Finance Committee, that was a top priority  for me. I indicated to the chairman at the time that I would not  support any health care reform that did not define essential health  care benefits as including mental health and substance abuse services.  We know that definitions drive every new system, and we were successful  in making sure that, in every part of health reform, we defined health  care in a comprehensive way for the first time.   Mental health used to be considered a preexisting condition--not any  more. Health insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage or  raise your rates because you need mental health treatment. My dad  struggled with that throughout his life. When he was finally diagnosed  correctly and got the medications and the help that he needed, he never  went back into the hospital again. I have seen what happens when  someone doesn't get the help they need and when they do and the  challenges to the families as well, and I am committed to making sure  that services and treatment are available for every family.   Americans now have coverage for preventive services like depression  screenings with no cost-share. You can see your doctor to get help  without breaking the bank. Mental health and substance abuse are also  now guaranteed benefits, as I mentioned before. They are covered as  essential health care benefits. Why in the world would we not want to  do that? Why would we say we want people to have access to health care,  but it depends on what part of the body your disease is in?   That makes absolutely no sense. The Affordable Care Act makes sure  that our law defines comprehensive health care from your head to your  toes. It is the right thing to do.   These are all commonsense reforms, and we cannot afford to roll this  back. A Harvard Medical School and New York University study released  just this morning shows that if the ACA were repealed, 1.2 million  Americans with serious mental disorders and 2.8 million Americans with  substance abuse disorders would lose some or all of their coverage.  This is 4 million people losing treatment that is allowing them to get  help, move on with their lives, and be productive citizens as we all  want to be and as we all want to have available to our family members.   Think of all the millions more who could again be in a situation of  not being able to afford insurance once relabeled with a preexisting  condition. The opioid treatment gap--the gap between the number of  people who seek services and those who can find or afford--would  increase by 50 percent if the ACA is repealed. There would be 50  percent more people unable to find or afford services.   We just had major debate on the floor and passed grant funding to  help with this very serious issue. But why in the world should we say  for a critical part of health care affecting every family, one out of  five Americans, that it will be only around grants and not a part of  our comprehensive health care system?   What happens now? The grant runs out: Gosh, I am so sorry you are  sick. I am so sorry that you need to see a therapist or that you need  medications. I am so sorry the grant ran out.   I don't think we would do that to somebody who had a heart attack: I  am so sorry you have had a heart attack. You need surgery, but the  grant ran out.   But with mental health illness, that is what happens every day. That  is what happens.   Frankly, it is outrageous that we don't have a comprehensive health  care system that is completely treating and responding in every way and  reimbursing physicians and nurses for all of the different kinds of  treatments, services, and medical help they provide.   We have put into law in the ACA that insurance companies cannot  discriminate, you cannot have larger copays, you cannot have caps on  services, you cannot have larger premiums--and this is a fundamental  baseline right that we have placed into law as it relates to access to  mental health and substance abuse services. To see that ripped away  from Americans across the country is unbelievable to me. It is totally  unacceptable.   The amendment we are offering would create a budget point of order  against any legislation that comes to this floor that reduces access to  mental health services for children, for adults, for seniors in this  country. I would hope that all of us could join together and state  through our votes that we understand how important these services are  and what a difference they have made. Right now, repeal of the ACA  means 4 million people will lose those services, not counting all of  the others that would be blocked because of future access problems and  preexisting conditions and caps on services and all of those patient  protections that go away.   I hope that we will join together in a bipartisan way, as we have  done on bills such as the Cures Act and others, to say we understand  this is the fundamental piece. It starts with mental health parity. To  me it is incredibly hypocritical to talk about these issues and want to  provide grant funding when the fundamental question of whether mental  health and substance abuse services covered under your insurance are  ripped away, which is what will happen with the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act.   I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.
