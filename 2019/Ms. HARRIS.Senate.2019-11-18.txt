 Mr. President, I was absent but had I been present  I would have voted no on rollcall vote No. 357, the motion to invoke  cloture on Executive Calendar No. 487, Robert J. Luck, of Florida, to  be United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, our nation mourns the loss of  former Senator Kay Hagan, an exemplary civil servant who thoughtfully  represented the people of her beloved North Carolina. She was a role  model for women across the Nation, and will be remembered as an example  of committed service to the American public.   Senator Hagan was born on May 26, 1953, in Shelby, NC. She learned  about the importance of public service at an early age from her uncle,  U.S. Senator and former Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, and her father,  Joe P. Ruthven, a Navy veteran who served as the mayor of Lakeland, FL.  Senator Hagan earned her bachelor's degree in 1975 from Florida State  University, followed by a juris doctorate from Wake Forest University.  She worked in banking and as a stay-at-home mother before turning to  politics, which gave her a valuable insight into both the private  sector and the needs of everyday families.   Senator Hagan served in the North Carolina Senate, where she became  one of the body's chief budget writers. This  [[Page S6620]]  was where Senator Hagan earned her reputation as an effective civil  servant and where she laid the ground work for many of the policies she  would champion when elected to Congress in 2008.   Senator Hagan was a champion for the people, working to secure  healthcare for all Americans, support working families, protect the  right to marry for same-sex couples, and aid in the recovery efforts  following the 2008 financial crisis. Throughout this time, she proved  herself to be an outstanding example of a leader guided by her moral  compass and the needs of her constituents. She was a force for good.  After her time in Congress, she devoted herself to studying the role of  money in politics and strove to preserve government accountability to  the public.   Senator Hagan's steadfast dedication to the State of North Carolina  and our entire country will continue to inspire others for generations  to come. She will be remembered as a role model for young women and a  voice dedicated to empowering and uplifting middle-class families.  Senator Hagan is survived by her husband, Chip Hagan, her children, and  a host of family and friends. She will be dearly missed, and her legacy  will live on through everyone she touched while serving the American  people.                            ____________________
