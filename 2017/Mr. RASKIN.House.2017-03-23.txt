 Mr. Speaker, we are here to discuss the rule for voting  on TrumpCare, or RyanCare, or whatever they are calling it today, based  on whoever is willing to put their name to it. But we learned upon  arrival at work that the rules are that there are no rules.   It is ``Lord of the Flies Day'' here in the House of Representatives.  They want to make us vote on a bill that no one has even read. No one  can find it. Anything goes. The whole process has been a disaster, a  debacle, a mockery of democracy--no hearings, no witnesses, no experts,  no process, no deliberation, and now no bill even.   But the American people are saying ``no way.'' The polls show people  are turning dramatically against that wreck of legislation that is  missing in Washington today.   Yesterday, we heard about the Buffalo Bribe, the Hudson Hustle, the  Kinderhook Kickback, every manner to try to round up votes from Members  who know their political careers are in danger for going anywhere near  this bill.   What do they propose to do?   What we know is they want to kick 24 million Americans off their  health care, destroy Planned Parenthood, and transfer $600 billion up  the wealth ladder in the United States.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    This legislation, however it turns out today, will crash  the system, which is what their chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has  said he wants to do. If a foreign power like the Russians proposed to  do this to America, we would consider it an act of aggression and war  against the American people.   This bill is not a rescue mission, as they say. It is a wrecking  ball, and we should put it to bed once and for all today.
