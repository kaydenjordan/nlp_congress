 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an  important milestone for a Hoosier manufacturer.   Berry Global, located in Evansville, Indiana, recently celebrated its  50th anniversary. What started as an operation of three employees has  grown to an international powerhouse of 2,400 employees and 23,000  employees throughout the world.   As the Evansville Courier and Press wrote recently, ``Berry Global is  an undeniable Evansville success story.''   Berry Global has been a pillar of our community and helped support  our economy in southern Indiana.   This success is an undeniable testament to the hardworking men and  women who go to work at Berry Global every day. Congratulations to  everyone at Berry Global on a tremendous 50 years. Here is to the next  50.                            ____________________
