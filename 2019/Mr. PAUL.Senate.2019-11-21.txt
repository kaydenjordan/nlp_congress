 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  vote on the Brouillette nomination occur at 1:30 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I rise to present an amendment to this bill.  My amendment is simple, and it reflects the kind of commonsense  budgeting we ought to be doing in Washington. Today I offer the penny  plan for infrastructure. This plan cuts one penny, 1 percent of all  spending, and puts that money in a fund for infrastructure.   My amendment would put about $12 billion per year into a fund to fix  our roads and bridges. Every agency would still get 99 percent of the  spending they got the previous year. Sure, they would need to trim some  fat, but they would still be fine. A lot of businesses and  organizations will tell you they have to cut much greater than 1  percent a year.   I visited a business recently that in the downturn of 2008-2009 had  to cut 30 percent of their expenditures. Business men and women in  America are used to having to cut expenditures; government never does.   Whether it is our highways or our bridges or our waterways, our  infrastructure in America is falling behind. Everyone knows it, but  like so many things, Washington can't figure out how to fix it, how to  find the money to fix it.   Politicians on both sides of the aisle talk about trillion-dollar  infrastructure plans but offer no way to pay for it. My plan is much  more modest, doesn't increase taxes, and doesn't increase our debt. The  penny plan for infrastructure pays for it with money we have already  allocated.   To be clear, we do have the money. Washington just spends it in  inappropriate ways. Washington spends, for example, $233 million on a  single highway in Afghanistan. We have money to pave roads in  Afghanistan, but they will not vote to spend the money here to pave  roads.   The people in Afghanistan got $233 million for a road, but they  couldn't even maintain it, so we gave them another $22 million to  maintain the road.   We spent $326 million to pave 2,000 kilometers of dirt roads in  Afghanistan. We have enough money to spend over $300 million to pave  dirt roads in Afghanistan, but we can't come up with $1 billion to help  our infrastructure here. They were supposed to pave 2,000 kilometers;  it turned out they only paved 159 kilometers. They paved less than 10  percent of what they actually promised to do with the money. What is  that equal to--$2.7 million per mile.   It is outrageous, and it goes on year after year after year. I think  it is time we try a new way. Just in Afghanistan, we have spent more  than the Marshall Plan did to rebuild Europe after the devastation of  World War II, and we are still there, spending good money after bad. So  when people come up here and  [[Page S6734]]  say that a 1-percent cut would somehow be a disaster, we need to remind  them that the money is there. They just have to listen to the people  and pull the plug on this kind of crazy spending overseas.    My amendment would move 1 percent of current spending, and it would  put that 1 percent of the current spending bill into infrastructure.   Supposedly, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all agree on  infrastructure. Yet we don't allocate more money to it because we are  too busy paving roads in Afghanistan. If we did this, it would be about  $12 billion. It is not enough to fix everything in the country. It is a  modest sum. This is actually a modest proposal to move over a few  billion dollars.   Do you know what it would do? Twelve billion dollars would pave up to  6,200 miles of a new four-lane highway, resurface 20,000 miles of a  four-lane highway, and 2,200 miles of a six-lane interstate. It would  pay for multiple big-ticket infrastructure projects that are currently  stuck without funding. In my State, they have been advocating money for  the Brent Spence Bridge across the Ohio River since before I was  elected--8 or 9 years of advocating for a bridge for which we can't  find the money. We have the money. Quit paving roads in Afghanistan,  and let's start building bridges and paving roads here.   This amendment would improve our infrastructure, benefit our  communities, eliminate government waste, and help our economy. By  cutting 1 percent of the current spending, we will force all of  government to do a better job.   There is at least 1 percent waste. There is probably 10 percent waste  in government. I am asking to cut 1 percent of waste. Take that money  you cut by making government more efficient and put it into  infrastructure.   I encourage the Senate to consider this amendment. I think we have  very few amendments come forward where people have a chance to vote for  infrastructure.   At this point, I move to concur on the House amendment to the Senate  amendment--    At this point, I am about ready to do that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to H.R. 3055, with a further amendment numbered  1250.
