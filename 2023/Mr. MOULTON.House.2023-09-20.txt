 Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues often blame the  military's current recruitment crisis on DEI initiatives. They say the  military is becoming too woke and that it is driving away recruits.   The only problem with that is that the survey data we have actually  says the exact opposite. It says that what recruits are concerned about  is being welcomed into an organization that will accept who they are.   With this anti-abortion policy, Republicans are effectively telling  50 percent of America and 20 percent of our current fighting force: You  are not welcome here because of who you are.   If you are a White guy, you are probably fine. If you are a woman,  sorry, you are a second-class citizen. You don't have the healthcare  options that the rest of us have.   It is no wonder that every branch except the Marine Corps is  struggling to meet recruitment goals.   Instead of seriously focusing on how we deter a war with China, we  are having politically motivated debates in this Chamber over a woman's  private healthcare decisions.   What my Republican colleagues won't say is that the DOD's abortion  travel policy does not even pay for this medical care. It doesn't even  pay for it. It simply allows a woman who has put her life on the line  for our country the necessary leave if she is stationed in a State  where abortions are not available.   I voted against the NDAA because it doesn't support our  servicemembers. It makes them political pawns. It is a slap in the face  to every woman who serves or might consider it in the future. We need  to treat women with the respect they deserve for serving our country.
