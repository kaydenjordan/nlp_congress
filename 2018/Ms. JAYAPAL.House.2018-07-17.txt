 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee and the chair and ranking member of the  Interior Subcommittee.   Mr. Chair, today I rise to highlight the importance of the EPA's  Superfund Enforcement program. Around the country, communities are  being put at risk by those who do not responsibly handle the waste that  they actually create, and it can result in years of ongoing damage,  which leads to health complications and environmental degradation.   The Superfund Enforcement program at the EPA was granted authority  under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act, or CERCLA, to enforce environmental cleanup laws that  bring habitats and communities back from the brink in places where  pollutants have seeped into the ground.   One of the Superfund sites in my State is the Hanford site, which is  a decommissioned nuclear production complex next to the Columbia River.  It was established as part of the Manhattan Project in 1943, and it was  the location of the first full-scale plutonium production reactor.   The site is massive, and its legacy not only includes its devastating  role in World War II but also the environmental impacts in central  Washington and beyond.                                time  2230    The EPA has referred to the Columbia River as the ``lifeblood of the  Pacific Northwest,'' and they are right. And it is why it is so crucial  that we at the Federal Government do everything we can to clean up  Hanford.   Another Superfund site, this one in my district, is the Duwamish  River, which was designated as a Superfund site in 2001. Over the  course of many years, factory waste and household pollutants have run  into the Duwamish, and the Duwamish air quality is the most toxic in  our State.   Water pollutants have affected our local fish and they have  threatened the food supply and the fishing culture, particularly of  those non-English speakers, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and people of  multiracial backgrounds who depend on the river as a way of life.   It has gotten so dangerous that the State and Federal Governments  have actually issued a warning against the consumption of fish from the  river. On average, community members in the Duwamish live an average of  8 years shorter than other King County residents.   The Superfund Enforcement program allows the Federal Government to  assess locations like this from Washington State to Washington, D.C.,  and determine who is responsible for cleaning up these potentially  devastating contaminants.   By the numbers, Mr. Chairman, the Superfund Enforcement program has  not only been incredibly successful, it has actually saved taxpayers  money and leveraged a lot of money for us.   According to the EPA, in fiscal year 2017, the agency reported that  they reduced, treated, or eliminated 217 million in pollution. During  that same time, 245 million pounds of hazardous waste was treated,  minimized, or properly disposed of, and 416,000 people were protected  by the enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act.   Thanks to the Superfund Enforcement program, many of the bad actors  who create the problems are actually responsible for cleaning them up,  and we leverage a lot of the Federal Government's money. In fiscal year  2017, the amount committed by liable parties to clean up Superfund  sites was $1.227 billion, which goes a long way toward ensuring that  communities can be safe, healthy, and protected.   While the funding levels in the 2019 bill are not as low as the  President's budget requested, I urge my colleagues to support continued  funding in 2018 at the 2018 enacted level of $166 million or higher.  [[Page H6454]]    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the chairman and the  ranking member of the subcommittee to ensure that this program is  meaningfully supported, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks, and  I did mention that I appreciated that there was more allocated than the  President's budget.   I think the magnitude of the problem that we are dealing with and the  hundreds of thousands of lives that are at stake in terms of who  depends on the waterways that go through these Superfund sites is why I  am asking the chairman if he might consider restoring the original  level, which is, of course, more than was allocated.   I do understand the challenges, but I think that these are historical  harms that we are trying to correct and money that is leveraged  substantially by the companies that create the waste, and it is because  the Federal Government is putting money into these that we are able to  do that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
