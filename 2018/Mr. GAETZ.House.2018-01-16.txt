 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte) for yielding me time, and I thank the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Byrne) for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians  Land Reaffirmation Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   The Poarch Creek have been in Alabama and northwest Florida since the  War of 1812, but they were only recognized federally in 1984. Soon  afterward,  [[Page H394]]  the Poarch Creek obtained land in both Florida and Alabama, land that  was held in trust.   The Poarch Creek contribute greatly to the Florida and Alabama  region. Their unique history forms a vital part of our culture, and  their businesses strengthen our region's economy and create jobs. They  give back to our community from museums to scholarships to services for  the elderly and students and much more.   But if lands currently in trust lost their status, the Tribal economy  could be shattered, businesses could close, incomes could plummet, and  we would have robbed our Nation of a great part of its cultural  heritage, all in the name of a confusing legal decision.   This good bill reaffirms the trust status of the Poarch Creek land.  It is fair, just, and important, and I encourage my colleagues to  support it.
