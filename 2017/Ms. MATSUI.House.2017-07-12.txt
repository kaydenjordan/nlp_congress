 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the  FDA user fee reauthorization bill that I worked on with my colleagues  on the Energy & Commerce Committee.   Without Congress' swift action to reauthorize this bill, the FDA  would not be able to conduct its critical work ensuring that our  nation's drugs and devices are safe and effective.   Patients and families across the country battling diseases like  Alzheimer's, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), and diabetes, rely on  innovation to provide new life-saving and life-enhancing treatments and  hopefully one day, cures. Without the FDA, we would not be able to  ensure that those treatments and cures work and that they're safe.   To quote Dr. Jeff Allen of the Friends of Cancer Research, ``for the  people who currently depend on safe and effective medicines . . . for  those who are holding strong for breakthroughs to come . . . and for  every future patient . . . there isn't time to waste.''   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the  House is considering H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. I  note that H.R. 2430 would provide the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) with new statutory authority to require the sponsor of an orphan- designated drug, which has certain similarities to an already approved  drug, to demonstrate ``clinical superiority'' compared to the already  approved drug as a condition of receiving seven years of market  exclusivity.   This authority will limit the number of drugs that are automatically  entitled to seven years of exclusivity, while maintaining incentives  for the development of innovative treatments for rare diseases.   I also note that the bill would improve transparency of the FDA's  execution of the Orphan Drug Act. Specifically, the bill directs the  FDA to notify a sponsor in writing of any clinical superiority  rationale on which the FDA relied in designating the sponsor's drug as  an orphan drug. Further, it would require the FDA to publish its  clinical superiority findings summaries for all drugs granted  exclusivity based on a demonstration of clinical superiority.   I urge my colleagues to support the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania). The question is  on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that  the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2430, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 23. Yet, again, it  seems that instead of addressing the issues underlying California's  water supply, some of my colleagues are more interested in fanning the  flames of century-old water disputes.   The city of Sacramento, which I represent, sits at the confluence of  two major rivers, the Sacramento and the American. Because there is no  such thing as an average water year in California, living under the  threat of drought and flood has become a way of life for Sacramento  residents.   We are working with the Army Corps to invest billions of dollars in  flood protection, and we are collaborating with the Bureau of  Reclamation to build a groundwater bank and a water recycling facility  to increase access to drinking water.   Congress should explore real solutions to drought challenges, as the  Sacramento region is doing.   In the short term, we must be efficient about fixing leaks and waste  while also continuing conservation efforts.   In the long-term, we should be taking advantage of new technologies  to monitor our water use and making investments in wastewater cycling  in above- and below-ground water storage.   Last Congress, I introduced a commonsense bill that removed barriers  to wastewater cycling projects, making it possible for them to move  forward more quickly and efficiently with Federal support. It  ultimately became law. Yet instead of debating these types of  solutions, we are wasting time on a bill that does not solve our  underlying water supply problem.                                time  1700    I grew up on a farm in the Central Valley. My father, my uncles, and  my grandfather were farmers. We raised peaches, plums, nectarines, and  grapes. I recall living and understanding what water means to us, so I  do understand the value and sensitivities about water.   Now, in the Sacramento region, where I now represent, we have tried  to take a balanced approach, working to protect the environment while  providing water for our farms and our cities.   It is misleading to claim that H.R. 23 will solve our drought  problems. This legislation only prioritizes certain regions or  industries instead of taking the comprehensive approach we need.   And by giving the Federal Government power to dictate the best uses  of the State's water, H.R. 23 sets a disastrous precedent for other  States across the country that should raise alarm on both sides of the  aisle.   The bill we are discussing today undermines a State's autonomy.  Ultimately, I am concerned that this bill will weaken environmental  protections for the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, and harm our State's  ability to manage its own water.   That is why I join my district and the State of California in  strongly opposing this bill. We cannot afford to  [[Page H5507]]  give up California's right to control its own water future. We must  focus on an all-of-the-above strategy that puts us on the path to a  sustainable water supply while protecting our environment.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this  legislation.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Mr. DeSaulnier's  amendment to H.R. 23.   Recycling projects provide sustainable water sources that help make  our communities drought-resilient. In Sacramento, we are working to  build a project that would use claimed wastewater to irrigate up to  18,000 acres of farmland and habitat.   These are the types of projects that help prepare California for the  next drought, and they result in more water for our farms and cities.  We should be working on sustainable solutions like these.   Last Congress, I introduced a bill to improve the Bureau of  Reclamation's Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Funding Program by  removing the requirement that each recycling project receive an  explicit congressional authorization. The bill was included in the WIIN  Act passed into law last year, thereby expanding the pool of eligible  projects.   Mr. DeSaulnier's amendment continues to move us forward by  emphasizing the importance of recycling in our approach to managing  water use. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).
