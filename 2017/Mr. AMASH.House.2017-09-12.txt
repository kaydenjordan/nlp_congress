 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ____.  None of the funds made available by this Act       may be used for activities prohibited by the order issued by       the Attorney General entitled ``Prohibition on Certain       Federal Adoptions of Seizures by State and Local Law       Enforcement Agencies'' (Order No. 3488-2015, dated January       16, 2015) or the order entitled ``Prohibition on Certain       Federal Adoptions of Seizures by State and Local Law       Enforcement Agencies'' (Order No. 3485-2015, dated January       12, 2015).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, each year the Federal Government uses civil asset  forfeiture to take billions of dollars' worth of property from people  who have not been charged with any crime. It is an unconstitutional  practice that is used to violate the due process rights of innocent  people.   Fortunately, some States have passed laws to limit asset forfeiture;  but the Federal Government helps State law enforcement evade these  requirements by doing adoptive forfeitures where the Federal Government  accepts property seized by the State law enforcement, forfeits it under  Federal law, and gives the State agency a cut of the proceeds.   Mr. Chairman, this practice is outrageous. It supplants the authority  of States to regulate their own law enforcement, and it further mires  the Federal Government in unconstitutional asset forfeitures.   In 2015, the Department of Justice placed limits on adoptive  forfeiture, prohibiting the Federal Government from accepting property  seized by local police when there is no involvement by Federal law  enforcement and the property does not relate to public safety. These  are commonsense restrictions that prevent the most egregious seizures.   Unfortunately, these restrictions were revoked in June of this year.  My amendment would restore them by prohibiting the use of funds to do  adoptive forfeitures that were banned under the 2015 rules.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 10 seconds  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I encourage everyone to support this  amendment. We must defend the Fifth  [[Page H7273]]  Amendment and we must protect property rights.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 127 Offered by Mr. Roskam    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 127  printed in House Report 115-297.
