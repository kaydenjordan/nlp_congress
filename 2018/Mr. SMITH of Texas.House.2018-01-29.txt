 Mr. Speaker, the administration's immigration  proposal is flawed. It doesn't include workforce verification, which  would protect jobs for American workers and reduce illegal immigration.   The proposal grants amnesty to twice as many people as President  Obama did. It gives amnesty today but delays legal immigration reforms  until a distant tomorrow. For example, the elimination of chain  migration won't occur for 17 years, if then.   The proposal is also ripe for fraud. Illegal immigrant adults can  claim they arrived as children, but there is no practical way to  confirm that.   The immigration plan is not a good deal for the American people.  Immigration policy should put the interests of American workers first.                            ____________________
