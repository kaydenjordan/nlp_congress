 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Kentucky  for his leadership and my colleague from Indiana for his leadership on  this legislation as well.   Mr. Speaker, from day one, President Trump's message to North Korea  has been clear: the U.S. will not tolerate any North Korean actions  that threaten American lives.   Hoosiers appreciate President Trump's leadership and understand the  crisis we face. North Korea is an erratic and brutal regime. We simply  cannot accept a world in which North Korea has nuclear weapons that can  reach American shores.   Unfortunately, with each missile test, we are moving closer to that  world becoming a reality. That is why I am proud to work with my  colleague from Kentucky and other colleagues on the Otto Warmbier North  Korean Nuclear Sanctions Act. With this bill, we will give foreign  financial institutions a clear choice: you can either do business with  Kim Jong-un in North Korea, or you can do business with the United  States--but not both.   By imposing the toughest financial sanctions ever on North Korea,  this bill cuts off crucial resources that the regime relies on to  finance its weapons program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, help us  meet the North Korean threat head-on, and do what is necessary to  protect our country.    Mr. Speaker, every year, middle class seniors are forced  to pay billions in taxes on their Social Security benefits. This tax is  fundamentally not fair and penalizes folks who have paid into the  system their entire lives.   There is a better way. We should give these seniors a tax cut, let  them keep more of their benefits, and create a better, fairer system  for all Americans.   In 1984, when Congress passed this tax on seniors, it was designed to  only impact high-income seniors, about 14 percent. But the tax was  never adjusted for inflation, and today, fully half of seniors are  paying this onerous tax. In fact, there are over 280,000 Hoosiers  making less than $75,000 per year who are subject to this tax.   I introduced the Social Security Tax Fairness Act to give these  seniors the tax break they deserve. This bill cuts taxes for seniors,  single and married seniors, and ends the marriage penalty on Social  Security benefits, too.   Under this bill, a retired married couple with $70,000 in income will  see $2,000 in tax cuts. It is time to deliver tax cuts for every  American, and this legislation would ensure Hoosier seniors aren't left  behind either.                            ____________________
