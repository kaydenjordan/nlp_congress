 Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board  Reform Act of 2017. Like the bill we considered yesterday, the so- called HONEST Act, H.R. 1431 is designed to harm the Environmental  Protection Agency's ability to use science to make informed decisions.   The bill before us today claims to reform the EPA's Science Advisory  Board. And let's talk about what these reforms would mean.   First, the bill establishes a series of roadblocks to prevent  independent academic scientists from serving on the Board. It  accomplishes this by turning the term ``conflict of interest'' on its  head by excluding scientists who have done the most relevant research  on the topic being considered by the Board. The bill also prohibits  Science Advisory Board members from obtaining extramural research  grants for 3 years after their service on the Board, which would be a  major disincentive for scientists to serve on the panel.   At the same time that this bill makes it much more difficult for  academic researchers to serve on the Science Advisory Board, the bill  also makes it much easier for corporate interests to serve. This  is accomplished by gutting actual financial conflict-of-interest  restrictions against industry representatives. Under this legislation,  those industry representatives would simply have to disclose their  financial conflicts, and they could serve on panels directly related to  their corporate interests.    Finally, H.R. 1431 imposes exhaustive and duplicative notice-and- comment requirements on the Science Advisory Board. I say these  requirements are exhaustive because, in addition to being an open-ended  process, the Board would also have to respond in writing to any and all  significant comments. In fact, I find it hard to believe that the  advisory process created by this bill could ever be completed.   Of course, that is the real purpose of this provision. It is designed  to throw sand in the gears of the Science Advisory Board process, and  prevent board members from ever rendering their expert advice.   These additions are totally unnecessary. The Science Advisory Board  already has statutorily mandated notice-and-comment obligations, and  the Federal Advisory Committee Act already applies to their activities.   So if this bill passes, what would happen?   As an example, I will turn to a case study from the early 1990s. At  that time, the EPA was forming a Scientific Advisory Panel to review  evidence of harm from secondhand tobacco smoke. Thanks to internal  tobacco industry documents that have been made public, we now know that  Big Tobacco made a concerted effort to stack the Scientific Advisory  Panel with tobacco industry hacks.   We take it for granted now that tobacco smoke is dangerous, but at  that time, in the early nineties, Big Tobacco had succeeded in muddying  the scientific waters around this issue by investing tens of millions  of dollars in a coordinated attempt to defraud the American people.   If H.R. 1431 had been in effect back then, Big Tobacco likely would  have succeeded in co-opting the Science Advisory Board.   What would the effects have been on public health to have had the  EPA's science review body controlled by tobacco interests?   That is why a number of public health and environmental interest  groups have come out against H.R. 1431. In a letter penned by the  American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, and  several other health groups, the effects of H.R. 1431 are summed up  like this:   ``In short, EPA's Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit the  voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to respond to  important questions, and increase the influence of industry in shaping  EPA policy. This is not the best interest of the American public.''   I couldn't agree more. I strongly urge Members to oppose this  misguided bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record correspondence in opposition to this bill: a letter from the  American Lung Association, the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy  Environments, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, the American  Public Health Association, the National Medical Association, the Health  Care Without Harm Association, the Physicians for Social  Responsibility, and the American Thoracic Society; along with a letter  from the Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, League of Conservation  Voters, and Natural Resources Defense Council; as well as a letter from  the League of Conservation Voters.                                                     March 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical       organizations are writing to express our opposition to the       EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest       and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our       organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving       public health.        Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health       decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our       organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,       EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for       seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on       standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these       bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the       review of complex issues and add undue industry influence       into EPA's decision-making process.        As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would       make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:        Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that       include their own expertise;        Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on       the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the       expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them       these highly competitive grants;        Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making       policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have       regularly sought their advice in the past;        Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA       Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and       unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues       already include public notice and comment; and        Reallocate membership requirements to increase the       influence of industry representatives on the scientific       advisory panels.        In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit       the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to       respond to important questions, and increase the influence of       industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best       interest of the American public.        We also have concerns with the HONEST Act. This legislation       would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it       develops policy to protect the American public from       environmental exposures and permit violation of patient       confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:        Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient       information to third parties, including industry;        Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research       that documents the adverse health effects of environmental       pollution; and        Impose new standards for the publication and distribution       of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing       requirements of many scientific journals.        Science, developed by the respected men and women       scientists at colleges and universities across the United       States, has always been the foundation of the nation's       environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making       process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in       the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the       earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the       research-based scientific advice that scientists have       provided to EPA.        Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,       not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's       decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in       EPA's policy-setting process.        We strongly urge you to oppose these bills.            Sincerely,      Katie Huffling, RN, CNM,        Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.      Harold P. Wimmer,        National President and CEO, American Lung Association.      Georges C. Benjamin, MD,        Executive Director, American Public Health Association.      Stephen C.

Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: We are       writing to express our strong opposition to the draft       legislation, the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017'' (H.R. 1431). The bill, which would amend the       Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration       Authorization Act of 1978, would hinder the ability of the       Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Board (EPA       SAB) to reach timely, independent, objective, credible       conclusions that can form the basis of policy. While the bill       is not identical to previous versions of this legislation,       the bill would still weaken longstanding conflict-of-interest       considerations for industry scientists while imposing       unprecedented and unnecessary limitations on government-      funded scientists, and complicating the SAB review process,       with no discernible benefit to EPA or the public.        Our most serious specific concerns with the bill are       described below, in the order in which the provisions appear:        P.3, lines 1-8, creating Section 8(b)(2)(C) in the       underlying Act, promotes inclusion of panelists with       financial conflicts, as long as they disclose their conflicts       and obtain a waiver.        As with previous versions of this legislation, the bill       shifts the current presumption against including people with       financial conflicts on the SAB. The bill appears to       effectively mandate the inclusion of scientists with       financial conflicts, as long as the conflicts are disclosed,       notwithstanding the reference to one portion of existing       ethics law. Disclosure does not eliminate the problems that       can occur when someone with a conflict influences policy       guidance.        Policies and practices to identify and eliminate persons       with financial conflicts, interests, and undue biases from       independent scientific advisory committees have been       implemented by all the federal agencies, the National Academy       of Sciences, and international scientific bodies such as the       International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World       Health Organization. The bill's provisions are inconsistent       with a set of nearly universally accepted scientific       principles to eliminate or limit financial conflicts.       Following these principles is the way agencies, the public,       and Congress should ensure their scientific advice is       credible and independent.        Moreover, EPA already grants exemptions as needed to allow       scientists to participate if their expertise is required       despite their potential conflicts.        P.3, line 23 to P.4, line 2, creating a Section 8(b)(2)(H)       in the underlying Act, establishes an arbitrary and       unwarranted bar on non-industry scientists who are receiving       grants or contracts from EPA, or who may do so in the future.        This provision would bar participation by any academic or       government scientist who is currently receiving a grant or       under contract from EPA, and bar any Board member from       seeking any grant or contract from EPA for three years after       the end of their term on the Board. This arbitrary and       unwarranted limitation on current or future recipients of       government funding would severely limit the ability of EPA to       get the best, most independent scientists on its premier       advisory board--as well as any committees or panels of the       board--without any evidence that no-strings government       funding, such as research grants, constitute a conflict of       interest.        P.6, lines 1-21, amending Section 8(c) of the underlying       act, expands the scope of the SAB's work, and increases the       burden.        This provision broadens the scope of documents that must be       submitted to the SAB for review to include every risk or       hazard assessment proposed by the agency, a dramatic and       unnecessary expansion. The expansion  [[Page H2571]]       would provide an expanded platform for the new industry-      stacked panels envisioned by this bill to challenge proposed       actions by EPA, including hazard and risk assessments.        P.8, lines 8-23 creating a Section 8(h)(4) in the       underlying Act, ensures endless delay, burden and red tape       under the guise of ``transparency.''        This provision would give industry unlimited time to       present its arguments to the SAB. Industry representatives       already dominate proceedings because of their greater numbers       and resources. In addition, the requirement for the SAB to       respond in writing to ``significant'' public comments is       vague (e.g., who defines what is ``significant,'' and how?)       and would tie down the SAB with needless and burdensome       process. It also misconstrues the nature of both the SAB's       role and the role of public comment in the SAB process. The       role of the SAB is to provide its expert advice to the       Agency. The role of the public comments during this phase is       to provide informative input to the SAB as it deliberates,       but the final product of the SAB deliberation is advice from       the panel members, not an agency proposal or decision that       requires response to public comment. Members of the public,       including stakeholders, have multiple opportunities to       provide input directly to the agency.        In short, the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017'' would alter the nature of the SAB, which has been       largely successful in providing the EPA expert review of key       scientific and technical questions and would encourage       industry conflicts in the review of scientific materials. It       would also pile new and burdensome requirements on the Board,       severely hampering its work and effectiveness. The result       would be to further stall and undermine important public       health, safety and environmental measures.        We urge you to abandon plans to advance this legislation.       We would be happy to discuss our concerns with you further.            Sincerely,      Clean Water Action.      Earthjustice.      League of Conservation Voters (LCV).      Natural Resources Defense Council.                                   ____                                    League of Conservation Voters,                                     Washington, DC, March 28, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 1430 and H.R. 1431--Attacks on Science and           Public Health.       United States House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,       the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn       environmental values into national, state, and local       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        LCV urges you to vote NO on H.R. 1430 and H.R. 1431. These       two bills are backdoor attempts to undermine the       Environmental Protection Agency's ability to use science in       decision-making and obstruct the process for developing       effective public health safeguards.        H.R. 1430, the ``HONEST Act'', would endanger public health       by making it extremely difficult for the EPA to use the best       available science. The bill contains favorable exemptions for       industry and would restrict the health studies that the EPA       is able to use by requiring that data is shared with anyone       willing to sign a vague confidentiality agreement. These       provisions would severely limit the EPA's ability to use data       that includes studies with confidential health information.       These types of studies are the basis for the best research on       pollution's effects on people, but include individual health       records that are legally required to remain confidential.       H.R. 1430 would cripple the EPA's ability to develop       effective public health safeguards by forcing them to       disregard the results of these studies, resulting in less       protective standards.        H.R. 1431, the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017'', would undermine the ability of the Science Advisory       Board to provide independent, objective, and credible       scientific advice to the EPA. This bill would facilitate       greater industry influence of the Scientific Advisory Board       by weakening conflict-of-interest protections while       unnecessarily and arbitrarily limiting the participation of       subject experts. Additionally, new burdens imposed on the       Board and provisions that allow industry to significantly       prolong the Board's scientific review process would delay key       public health and environmental protections.        These two bills would significantly undermine the EPA's       ability to protect public health and the environment. LCV       urges you to REJECT H.R. 1430 and H.R. 1431 and will consider       including votes on these bills in the 2017 Scorecard. If you       need more information, please call my office and ask to speak       with a member of our Government Relations team.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,                                                         President.     I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Let me thank the other side for their vigorous defense of this bill.   I must say that I am a nurse by profession, and I appreciate the  gains we have made for using scientific data to determine what is  unhealthy for the people; and it really does disturb me to see these  protections being torn apart.   It is really unfortunate that we have spent so much time putting  these protections of the people in place to see that, in this  administration, they will probably fly away. Only the people of this  Nation will be the losers, with more healthcare costs when they don't  even want health care; more people not able to get out of dirty areas.   I live in the State of Texas where we have seen the detriment of all  of the lack of these protections before they came about. Scientists are  in science because they believe in the theories that put forth the  procedures for us to follow for the safety and protection of human  beings.   I regret that we are at a point this time in history where we are  willing to throw all that away because of allowing the polluting  companies to have more to say about policy. I regret that I have to  stand against my colleagues that feel so strongly about getting rid of  these protections, but I cannot sit idly by without saying that our  Nation will not be in better shape when we take away all the  protections for the people and their health.   Everybody wants clean air and clean food and protections from the  damage that a bad environment brings, and all this is is taking away  those protections.   I ask everyone to vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
