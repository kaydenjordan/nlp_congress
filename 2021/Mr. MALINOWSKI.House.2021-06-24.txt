 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor BSA Troop 19 in  Short Hills, New Jersey, and their historic first class of female Eagle  Scouts.   Five members in the troop in my district earned this prestigious rank  in the first year young women were able to obtain the status in the  organization's 111-year history.   I first met Katelyn Cannon, Keira Lowden, Riya Tyagi, and Bridget and  Morgan Lomax virtually in February and I was lucky enough to attend  their Eagle ceremony earlier this month. Their pioneering leadership  has paved the way for many more young women to follow.   From creating a nonprofit corporation, to leading conservation  efforts for koalas; to preserving and digitizing hundreds of hours of  music for the New Jersey Youth Symphony; to building and installing  houses for bats in local open spaces, these Scouts have gone above and  beyond.   The Scouting community is better with Katelyn, Keira, Riya, Bridget,  and Morgan as Eagle Scouts.   Congratulations to these trailblazing young women, and thank you to  their Scoutmaster, Daniel Cannon.                            ____________________
