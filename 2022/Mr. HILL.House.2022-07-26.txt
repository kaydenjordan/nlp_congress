 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in support of H.R. 1842, the Harriet  Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.   Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross, is one of the most well-known  conductors of the Underground Railroad. An escaped slave herself,  Harriet navigated the Underground Railroad and reached safety in  Philadelphia in 1849.   Instead of remaining in Philadelphia, Harriet made numerous secret  return trips to Maryland to free her friends and family. It is unclear  just how many trips she made, but over a 10-year period, she never once  lost one of her passengers, and she was never caught.   Many know Harriet for her contributions to the Underground Railroad.  However, the knowledge she gained by leading numerous covert missions  was also critical to the Union military success.   In addition to mapping Southern towns and transportation routes for  the Union Army, Harriet Tubman would disguise herself as an unassuming  elderly slave and wander the streets of Confederate towns, scouting  military positions and supply lines, once again proving that Harriet  was always willing to put her life on the line to defeat and destroy  the system of slavery.   Harriet Tubman lived a truly extraordinary life and, in doing so,  saved countless lives, not only those she navigated to freedom but of  Union soldiers who used her intelligence to defeat their opponents, the  Confederate forces.   Her incredible life cannot be summarized in 1 speech or 10 on this  House floor, but the commemorative coin produced by H.R. 1842 will  hopefully inspire a new generation to study her history.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me say that each day as I drive through  downtown Little Rock, I pass the most handsome statue of Harriet Tubman  right outside our city hall. She has her walking stick and her cape.  She is in that disguise as that slave woman walking the streets of that  Confederate town. It brings inspiration to all the citizens of Little  Rock to see this extraordinary woman in this public piece of art in  front of our city hall.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Katko), an author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, on the morning of January 9, a fire broke out in the  Twin Parks North West apartment building in the Bronx, New York.  Seventeen lives were tragically lost that day, including eight  children. Investigators later determined that the fire was caused by a  defective space heater left on to warm an apartment that was too cold  on that terrible January winter night.   H.R. 6528, ably written by my good friend from the Bronx, New York  (Mr. Torres), would create a pilot program at the Department of Housing  and Urban Development for building owners to voluntarily install  temperature sensors in federally assisted buildings. The hope is that  temperature sensors authorized by this pilot program will help monitor  the conditions inside housing units to ensure that conditions are not  too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.   Property owners who contract with HUD have a responsibility to  maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and this legislation might  help to ensure that these homes have adequate heat during the winter so  residents will not have to rely on space heaters to keep warm.   Representative Torres' idea will try to protect the welfare of  renters in federally assisted housing and is a pilot program worth  taking a look at to see if this can make a real difference.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to commend my friend from New York  (Mr. Torres) who has brought his exceptional service to the people of  the Bronx to the people's House. He does what all Members do here which  is take a great idea at a time of tragedy when he learned a better way  to do something and bring that to the House, use it as an example from  which all Americans can benefit.   So, again, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R.  6528, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, the number of community  financial institutions has steadily declined. Republicans know this  trend is due to increased regulatory and compliance burdens banks and  credit unions face that inhibit their ability to survive, let alone,  thrive. Republicans have consistently pushed for regulatory rightsizing  including tailoring regulation, not imposing one-size-fits-all  requirements.   H.R. 4950 directs the banking agencies to study ways to promote the  establishment of new banks and credit unions, including community  development financial institutions, CDFIs, and minority financial  institutions.   This bill requires the banking agencies to report to this body, the  Congress, on challenges faced by proposed depository institutions and  to develop a strategic plan to promote establishment of new financial  institutions.   The banking agencies will provide the Congress with recommendations  on how best to propose financial institutions and help them navigate  that regulatory process.   H.R. 4950 is a first step toward identifying and addressing the  challenges posed to the chartering of new banks and credit unions.   The fact is, Madam Speaker, encouraging the establishment of de novo  financial institutions will help fill the needs left by bank  consolidations and bank closures over the past decade. This will  increase banking options and competition to better serve families,  small businesses, and our local communities. The loss of local banks  and credit unions has disproportionately affected rural communities.   Republicans support efforts to better understand the challenges that  prospective de novo depository institutions face and identifying the  solutions to promote a greater number of new charters.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me thank my friend from Massachusetts  for his passion on this. I spent the better part of half of my career  in community banking, and I know the consolidation, how it has  impacted, particularly, rural counties that no longer have a banking  office.   And I also know how the regulatory burden has raised the immense  costs of trying to form a new de novo banking corporation. It is just  putting it out of reach of many, many groups of civic leaders,  entrepreneurs, local people and, certainly, those trying to form a  minority depository institution, or a CDFI.   So I commend my friend from Massachusetts for his work on this bill.  It does have bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support it.   In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the  Speaker and the minority leader, in addition to the chair and ranking  member of the House Financial Services Committee from the Independent  Community Bankers of America expressing their full support of H.R.  4590.                                               Independent Community                                              Bankers of America,                                                      July 26, 2022.      Re Support for the Promoting New and Diverse Depository           Institutions Act (H.R. 4590).       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Republican, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Chairwoman       Waters, and Ranking Member McHenry:        On behalf of community banks across the country, with       nearly 50,000 locations, I write to thank you for scheduling       floor consideration of the Promoting New and Diverse       Depository Institutions Act (H.R. 4590), sponsored by Rep.       Jake Auchincloss, and to express our support for this       legislation. ICBA urges all Members of the House to vote YES       on H.R. 4590.        The Promoting New and Diverse Depository Institutions Act       requires the Federal banking regulators to conduct a joint       study to assess the challenges faced by proposed depository       institutions, including proposed minority depository       institutions (MDIs), seeking de novo depository institution       charters and to provide legislative recommendations to help       these proposed institutions successfully obtain charters.       There has been a dearth of de novo charters in the past       decade. An infusion of new charters is needed to offset       consolidation in the banking sector and create a competitive       landscape that will benefit consumers and small businesses       alike. Notably, new community bank charters, including new       MDI charters, are needed to provide access to capital and       banking services that play a pivotal role in reaching       unbanked populations and underserved communities across the       nation.        Concrete, actionable proposals are needed to turn the tide       of stagnant de novo bank formation. ICBA supports an array of       measures, such as phasing in capital standards for de novo       banks over a period of three years and allowing for greater       flexibility to modify the de novo business plan as conditions       warrant. Start-up capital is often the greatest impediment to       forming a new bank, and these provisions, among others, would       help spur the creation of de novo charters, including MDIs.        Thank you for your consideration. ICBA looks forward to       working with you to advance H.R. 4590 into law.            Sincerely,                                              Rebeca Romero Rainey,                                                   President & CEO.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise, as well, in support of H.R. 4227, the Developing and  Empowering our Aspiring Leaders Act, or DEAL Act. I commend my  colleague from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth) and my colleagues from  across the aisle for collaborating on H.R. 4227.   By investing in companies that help drive economic growth and job  creation, venture capital funds play an important role in the success  and overall health of the American economy. In fact, earlier this year,  it was reported that employment from U.S.-backed VC companies grew 960  percent from 1990 to 2020. That is eight times the employment growth at  non-venture-capital-backed companies.   Jobs created by VC-backed enterprises are widely distributed across  the U.S.   In 2020, despite COVID-19 pandemic conditions, more than 10,800  companies across the United States received venture capital funding.  Additionally, in 2020, venture capital investment in the United States  totaled $164 billion.   However, the registered investment adviser rules, promulgated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission under the Dodd-Frank Act,  inadvertently discouraged some venture capital firms from continuing to  invest in companies through what are called secondary investments.   Though advisers from venture capital funds were exempt statutorily  from registration as a registered investment adviser, the Dodd-Frank  Act required the SEC to define what qualified as a venture capital  fund.   As written, the SEC's rules state that VC funds can only have 20  percent of their capital commitments in nonqualifying investments.   Specifically, the SEC definition for qualifying investments for  venture capital funds prohibits secondary acquisitions from being  considered as qualifying investments, which means that the secondary  acquisitions fall into that 20 percent nonqualifying bucket.   Therefore, Madam Speaker, small, private companies that need  additional capital to grow and grow big enough to then go public cannot  turn to the venture capital industry for secondary acquisition because  such funds are concerned that they might well exceed the 20 percent  limit and then trigger that the VC fund has to register as an RIA.   Mr. Hollingsworth's bill, H.R. 4227, remedies this problem by  requiring the SEC to revise the definition of a qualifying investment  to include secondary acquisitions for purposes of the RIA exemption.   This bill is a commonsense piece of legislation to ensure that our  venture capital funds can continue to provide capital to small business  across our land.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Hollingsworth, for his work on  this legislation, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on Mr. Hollingsworth's  bill, H.R. 4227.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of H.R. 1057, the Greatest  Generation Commemorative Coin Act.   What an honor to stand on this House floor and pay tribute to that  generation, the World War II heroes who we know and love so much,  including my father-in-law, who helped free the Buchenwald  concentration camp, and my dad, who flew a B-25.   Since its inception in 2024, the National World War II Memorial has  been a popular attraction for anybody visiting Washington. Millions  visit this iconic site annually.   Along the entrance to the memorial plaza are 12 bronze relief panels  that show scenes from the Atlantic front and 12 scenes from the Pacific  front. The Rainbow Pool is at the center of the plaza, and behind that  pool is the Freedom Wall.   During World War II, the gold star was used as a symbol to indicate  that a member of the family had lost their life in the war. The 4,048  gold stars on the Freedom Wall commemorate the more than 400,000  Americans who paid the ultimate cost and gave their life in the war for  freedom in Europe and in the Pacific.   Anytime I visit the memorial, I always take an extra second to walk  and read the quote from President Truman found on the memorial wall. It  reads:  [[Page H7155]]  ``Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our  country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude.  America will never forget their sacrifices.''   This memorial is an important place for all Americans, but  unfortunately, its age is beginning to show. Coming up on its 18th year  of service, the memorial is in need of repair--hence the importance,  Madam Speaker, of passing this legislation today.                                time  2140    The surcharges or proceeds from this coin program will go to the  Friends of the National World War II Memorial to support the  maintenance and repair of the memorial and the continuation of  important education programs so that the youth of tomorrow never forget  the service and sacrifice of those who came before.   I thank my old friend Senator Bob Dole for all the years that he  supported us in trying to get this memorial built and was there and  lived to see it. And I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), my  dear friend, not only for the bill today to maintain the memorial but  for originating the legislation that authorized the commission that  established the memorial back in 1993.   Those who give their lives for our country should be memorialized and  remembered for all future generations. I support this bill, and I urge  the entire House to stand up and support this bill for the memories of  all those who served in World War II.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 5 minutes for 1 hour under  the House rules, which I don't believe is very helpful to my  colleagues.   So let me begin that we are here to talk about inflation and the  impact of inflation on our constituents.   I will start out briefly and talk about Melissa from Adona, Arkansas.  She says: It is severely impacting us, with gas and grocery prices so  high that we couldn't make our $300 car payment last month because my  husband had four doctor visits to make. We have to do without air  conditioning unless it gets above 97 degrees. Our grandkids come over  and say: We thought y'all bought groceries. And we tell them we did,  but that is all we could get. My husband is a disabled veteran, and we  could barely make it before. With the rise in prices, we just have  faith in the Lord that we can meet our needs.   Madam Speaker, that is Melissa from Adona, Arkansas.   All of our constituents are suffering.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) to  talk about the impact of inflation in his district.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Kentucky for his  strong words.   While Mr. Donalds is coming forward, I got a note from Ron in Little  Rock. He is a 100 percent disabled veteran. He is not eating well. He  is not able to go places because of the cost of gas in this country. He  has to conserve his gas money in order to go to the VA for his primary  care.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds),  my friend from Florida's 19th Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Kim), who will tell us how inflation is impacting her  constituents.                                time  2200
