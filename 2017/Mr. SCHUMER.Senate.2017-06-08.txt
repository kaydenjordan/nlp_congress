 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning the Intelligence Committee  is hearing testimony from former FBI Director James Comey. I hope and  expect him to be as forthright and straightforward as he can. The  Senate and, by extension, the American people deserve to know the truth  about Mr. Comey's interactions with the President.   Based on the opening statement Mr. Comey submitted to the committee,  we know that he will confirm much of what we have already learned about  the events of the past few months through the press. That is important  in and of itself. Until now, we have read these reports with a healthy  dose of skepticism, waiting for Mr. Comey to confirm or to refute their  veracity. It appears the bulk of what we learned from the reports about  Mr. Comey's memos is true.   The President asked Mr. Comey to pledge ``loyalty'' to the President  and asked him if he could ``let go'' of an investigation into one of  the President's close associates, former National Security Advisor  General Flynn. That conversation took place in a meeting during which  the President raised the prospect of Mr. Comey not continuing in the  job.   The Senate appreciates this testimony. I am sure members of the  Intelligence Committee will seek answers to many of the remaining and  new questions the testimony raises.   There are so many questions that Mr. Comey's testimony leaves hanging  out there. Every single lead should be pursued. Let's not lose sight of  the very heart of this matter: a foreign adversary interfering with our  democracy. There is an open counterintelligence investigation into  whether members of the Trump campaign worked with that foreign  adversary to help that campaign win the White House. This issue gets to  the very foundation of our democracy: free and fair elections and the  rule of law.   There is no process more sacred in democracy than the people  exercising their voice at the ballot box. There is no principle more  enshrined in our legal system than the principle that no one--no one-- is above the law. Members of both parties should deeply care about  getting the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hope that  spirit will direct Senators in their questioning today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Senators from both parties are  negotiating the content of an amendment to the bill for tough,  bipartisan Russia sanctions legislation.   On the Democratic side, we feel very strongly that we need a tough,  effective package of Russia sanctions to move alongside Iran sanctions.  I believe many of my Republican colleagues do, as well, so there is  very likely an agreement to be reached.   President Putin has violated the sovereignty of Ukraine by annexing  Crimea. He has committed human rights abuses, including the propping up  of the brutal Assad regime in Syria, of stifling political dissent and  the rights of his own people, and our intelligence community has  concluded that Russia made a direct assault on our democracy by  conducting a campaign to interfere in our elections.   That is why, principally, I proposed a vote on a bill put forward by  my friend, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, Senator Graham.  This is a bill that includes as its cosponsors Senators McCain and  Rubio on the Republican side and Senators Cardin, Brown, and McCaskill  on the Democratic side. It is a strong bipartisan bill.   The bill would establish a process for Congress to review any Russia- related sanctions relief. The President and administration officials  have demonstrated they are willing to consider lifting sanctions on  Russia in exchange for vague, yet-to-be-articulated concessions, if any  concessions at all. Congress ought to have the power to review any  decision made by this administration before sanctions on Russia are  lifted.   Senator McCain has also introduced an amendment, along with Senator  Cardin, which would impose new sanctions on Russia. Given the  revelations of Russian interference in our elections, new sanctions are  warranted in addition to the existing sanctions. In addition to the  Graham-Cardin bill,  [[Page S3347]]  which should definitely be included, I hope Senator McCain's proposal  is part of our consideration of Russia-related sanctions as well.   Chairman Corker, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and Ranking  Member Cardin are in ongoing discussions, as are the majority leader  and I, about the content of the Russia sanctions and amendment. I am  hopeful that we can resolve this issue and vote to advance both  measures.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my friends on the other side of the aisle  continue to work on their healthcare bill behind closed doors. They  haven't made public a shred of bill text or even considered holding a  committee hearing to debate the topic. Yesterday my friend the majority  leader filed a motion to bring TrumpCare directly to the floor,  skipping the committee process.   This is a party that screamed from the rafters ``Read the bill, read  the bill'' when Democrats were putting together the Affordable Care  Act. We spent over a year debating that bill. We tried with a  bipartisan group of six to come up with a solution.   Republicans are putting together their bill in secret, with no  Democratic input, and then will rush their bill to the floor without a  single committee hearing, all in the span of 3 short weeks. This is a  bill that will alter one-sixth of the American economy and affect tens  of millions of American lives. For many, it will have life-and-death  consequences.   The way Republicans are crafting this legislation is pulling the wool  over the eyes of the American people on one of the most crucial issues  affecting their lives. Why? There is only one explanation: They don't  want the American people to see their bill. They don't want to go home  to townhall meetings and let people give their opinions. Keep it under  wraps, rush it through? There is only one good reason: They are not  very proud of the product that they have put together.   The Republicans know that even if they make some changes to the bill  that came over from the House--they may increase subsidies a bit or  lower the amount of tax breaks they give to millionaires--they will  still wind up with a bill that is far worse than the status quo: higher  costs, less care. That is because they are working from a fundamentally  flawed premise, which is to take support away from healthcare programs  like Medicaid to give a tax break to the wealthiest Americans. Senate  Republicans can nibble around the edges, but they will not be able to  excise the rotten core of their healthcare plan.   The House bill has the support of approximately 18 percent of  Americans. A majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans don't  like it. Don't you get the message, my Republican friends? We  understand the ideologues are telling you that you must repeal. But now  that people have actually looked at repeal, they realize that is not  the way to go.   The right approach is not to move backward, not to undo all the  progress we have made in healthcare over the past 8 years and start  from scratch. The American people don't want to go back to the days  when an insurance company could discriminate against you because you  have a preexisting condition or jack up your rates simply because you  are older. That is not the kind of healthcare system the American  people want. But that seems to be what our Republican colleagues, in  the dark of night, are considering.   The right approach is to keep all the good things in the existing law  and work in a bipartisan way to make more progress on lowering costs  for consumers and improving the quality of care.   Again, I urge my Republican colleagues to drop their repeal efforts  and, instead, work with Democrats on actually improving our healthcare  system.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I heard President Trump talk about  Democrats being obstructionists yesterday--out in Ohio, Kentucky--about  a healthcare bill in which they are not asking for Democratic help or  input. They are tied in a knot because their own party can't agree on  the tax bill. They again are not asking for Democratic input. They are  tied in a knot because their own party can't agree.   Now it looks as if they are doing the same thing on infrastructure.  The President is in an ``alter reality'' world. He blames Democrats,  but then his Republican colleagues, often at his instruction, are told  not to work on the bill with Democrats. What is going on here?   What the President tweets and talks about at his rallies and what is  actually happening are two different worlds--two different worlds. That  is no good. It is no good for America, no good for the American people,  and, frankly, no good for the President.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would like to address the hearings  that concluded just a few hours ago.   After hearing Mr. Comey's testimony today, America is stunned. The  cloud hanging over this administration has just gotten a whole lot  darker.   I commend both the chairman, Senator Burr, and the vice chairman,  Senator Warner, for the way they ran this hearing. The Senate and the  American people are better informed as a result of their work. Few  committee hearings in the history of the Senate have produced the kind  of eye-opening testimony we heard today. In its wake, I would like to  make a few points.   First, for weeks, media reports indicated that the President had  directly and indirectly pressured the FBI Director to end the FBI's  investigation into General Flynn. Innuendos and intimations swirled  around. But we now know much more of the truth. There is now no doubt  that Mr. Comey understood the President's request that he let go of the  investigation into General Flynn--in a meeting during which it was  discussed whether Mr. Comey would keep his job as FBI Director--as a  direct effort to prevent that investigation from going further that  looks a lot like a quid pro quo.   During questioning from a Republican Senator, Mr. Risch, Mr. Comey  told us that he took the President's conversation with him about the  FBI investigation into General Flynn as a directive to scuttle that  investigation.   It is clear that President Trump's legal defense is to refute Mr.  Comey's account. Well, the President threatened Mr. Comey with the  release of tapes of their conversations. Presumably that includes the  conversation in which President Trump asked Director Comey to ``let  go'' of the Flynn investigation. It is awfully curious that no one from  the President's team will either confirm or deny the existence of the  tapes when the tapes are the only way to prove that Mr. Comey's  testimony, which came under oath, is false or misleading. If President  Trump disagrees with anything the Director has said today, he should  play the tapes for all of America to hear or admit that there were no  tapes.   Second, Director Comey's contrasting view of the Clinton email case  and the Russia case is telling. Mr. Comey did not wish to see a special  counsel in the Clinton case because he looked at the facts and  determined there wasn't a case for one. With respect to the Russia  probe, the Director examined the facts and felt there was enough  potential evidence that a special counsel was warranted. Again, the  contrast is telling.   Democrats and Republicans alike and the American people as well  should be pleased that the investigation is in the hands of former  Director Mueller.   Third, the hearing raised serious questions about Attorney General  Sessions that he and the Justice Department must answer immediately.  Senators Wyden and Harris repeatedly asked Director Comey about  Attorney General Sessions' involvement in the investigation before he  recused himself. Director Comey didn't have direct knowledge of his  involvement but made clear that he suspected that the Attorney General  needed to recuse himself weeks before he actually did so and that he  could not share the reasons for that in an unclassified briefing.   So we need to know the answers to a number of questions regarding the  Attorney General. The Senate Intelligence Committee investigation and  Special Counsel Mueller ought to get to the bottom of this matter.   In conclusion, Mr. Comey's testimony has been very enlightening, but  there is much work ahead for investigators in Congress and those under  the direction of Mr. Mueller.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
