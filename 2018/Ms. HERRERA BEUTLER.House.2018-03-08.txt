 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of  Marvin ``Cy'' Meyers and recognize his lifelong service to the United  States Military and to his community of Winlock and across Lewis  County.   Born during the Great Depression and from a military family, Cy grew  up poor, but he had an abundant love of family. In the summer of 1943,  Cy joined the Marines and served in World War II, where he fought at  Iwo Jima.   After his service in the military, Cy came home to the Pacific  Northwest and met the love of his life, Bonita. A friend of Cy's  started an egg farm in Winlock and asked him to work delivering eggs, a  job Cy maintained for 20 years. Cy and Bonita bought a home in Winlock,  where they settled for the remainder of their lives and raised their  four children.   Cy was a cornerstone community member. Everyone in Lewis County knew  him. He served on the city council, Educational Service District 113  Board, Civil Service Commission, Board of Adjustment, and the  Washington State Republicans Executive Board. Cy also served as mayor  of Winlock for 6 years.   Please join me in honoring the selfless and passionate dedication of  Marvin ``Cy'' Meyers and his legacy that will remain with us all, as  this was the week that he left this world for the next. We love him. We  are grateful to him and his family for his service, and we will  remember him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.
