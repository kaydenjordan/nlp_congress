 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4366,  the fiscal year 2024 military construction and veteran affairs  appropriations bill, which honors our veterans, supports our national  security, and cuts wasteful government spending. I say again, it cuts  wasteful government spending.   Last November, when the American people entrusted Republicans with  the House majority, we made a commitment to a Nation that is safe.  Today's legislation delivers on that commitment and ensures the  Department of Defense has the resources and facilities it needs to  protect our homeland from foreign adversaries.   H.R. 4366 provides nearly $800 million above the President's budget  for military construction, including $80 million for the first phase of  construction for the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence Signal School  at Fort Gordon.   Building a 21st century military is crucial to fielding threats in  the ever-evolving cyber environment, and that starts with these  critical investments being made at Fort Gordon.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 4366.
