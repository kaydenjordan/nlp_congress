 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Hugh Brown McNatt, who passed away on June 1, 2021.   Hugh was known throughout Georgia for his remarkable career as a  trial lawyer for over 50 years. Born on June 23, 1946, in Uvalda,  Georgia, Hugh learned the importance of hard work, humility, and  dedication to helping others. He flourished in law school and  immediately began trying cases all over Georgia and throughout the  southeast.   After advocating for others his entire life, he won several awards,  including the Tradition of Excellence Award and the Thomas O. Marshall  Professionalism Award.   Outside the courtroom, he was a member of many organizations,  including the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Board of  Trial Advocates, and the International Society of Barristers.   He left a lifelong impact on his community, Georgia politics, his  countless friends, and his family.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all those  who knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
