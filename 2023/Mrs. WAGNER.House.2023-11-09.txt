 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to prevent the Financial  Stability Oversight Council, FSOC, from making it easier to designate  nonbank financial companies as a systemically important financial  institution, or SIFI.   The 2008 financial crisis was a result of Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac's poor government housing policy that bilked taxpayers out of  billions of dollars and the inability of financial regulators to  properly identify systemic risk and take action until it was too late.   As a response to the crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of  2010. The Democrats' law has dramatically reduced competition in the  banking sector, imposed barriers to entry for new banks, and saddled  financial institutions with a mountain of new requirements that hit  small, midsize, and regional banks particularly hard.   Under Dodd-Frank, FSOC has the power to designate companies as a SIFI  and, therefore, subject to Federal Reserve supervision and enhanced  prudential standards--in other words, too big to fail.   Last week, FSOC finalized guidance that would allow it to apply these  same ``too big to fail'' burdens to nonbank financial institutions,  such as asset managers or broker-dealers, insurance companies, and  private funds.   It has been reported that the annual consumer cost of designating a  nonbank financial institution as a SIFI could range from $5 billion to  $8 billion, yet FSOC's new guidance fails to require any cost-benefit  analysis when making such a designation. Let me repeat that one more  time. These designations would cost consumers, American taxpayers, $5  billion to $8 billion per year.   This guidance put forth by the Biden administration rescinds the 2019  changes that rightfully moved FSOC's authority from an entities-based  approach to an activities-based approach in determining whether a  nonbank entity should be deemed a SIFI. To grant such unfettered  discretionary power to a government agency should concern every  American, particularly when the body exercising that power, FSOC, is  composed almost entirely of members of a single political party.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment that  reins in our regulators, restores Congress' Article I powers, and saves  Main Street investors billions of dollars.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his consideration  of the amendment. However, we have, in fact, held a hearing in the  Financial Services Committee about this very issue and some of the  costs that I am talking about. The $5 billion to $8 billion that this  would cost our taxpayers to implement was a part of that discussion  within the Financial Services Committee and came from testimony  directly there.   Again, these designations would cost consumers, American taxpayers,  $5 billion to $8 billion per year, and I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment that reins in our regulators, restores Congress' Article  I powers, and saves our Main Street investors billions and billions of  dollars.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend across the aisle for his  consideration and his kind words. I would just simply urge my  colleagues to support this amendment that would rein in our regulators,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
