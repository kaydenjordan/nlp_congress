 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 414 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 414         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3003) to       amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify       provisions relating to assistance by States, and political       subdivision of States, in the enforcement of Federal       immigration laws, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on House Resolution 414,  currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring this  rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary  for Criminals Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally  divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my  fellow Judiciary Committee members Mr. Johnson of Louisiana and Ms.  Lofgren of California.   H.R. 3003 received consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part  of a larger bill, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of  State and Local Law Enforcement Act. That legislation was marked up and  ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee on May 24.   As a cosponsor and strong advocate of the Davis-Oliver Act, I  supported the passage of legislation before the full House. Today we  have the opportunity to move an important piece of that bill forward  and to strengthen our policies against jurisdictions that flout  America's laws.   Mr. Speaker, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is just simply common  sense. John Adams said that we are a government of laws, not of men. As  we approach the Fourth of July week, we recognize that America's  foundation is that of the rule of law. Yet too often we have seen local  jurisdictions ignore Federal immigration law and declare themselves  sanctuary cities, as though their actions have no consequences for  their law-abiding neighbors.   The reality, however, is that the localities that refuse to enforce  Federal immigration law undermine public safety and break the  democratic contract. Mr. Speaker, the sanctuary cities do not act in a  vacuum. They endanger lives and set dangerous precedent.                                time  1230    To many people, it would seem obvious that local and State law  enforcement should comply with Federal immigration laws and cooperate  with its fair enforcement by communicating openly with Federal  officials. It would also seem clear that jurisdictions that ignore  these laws should forfeit the Federal funds set aside to support  compliance with those same laws.   Despite this, sanctuary cities oppose Federal immigration officials  routinely. These men and women find themselves handicapped by local  officials implementing obstructionist policies.   In light of this, Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to better protect  our communities by ensuring our laws are followed. H.R. 3003 takes  steps do that.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman King, and Congressman Biggs  for their work on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These Members are  colleagues of mine on the Judiciary Committee, and they recognize the  need to respond to the continuing problem of sanctuary cities with  resolve, with confidence that Federal immigration laws safeguard every  American community and apply equally to every American community.   The underlying bill provided for by this rule also includes  legislation offered by Mr. King--Sarah's and Grant's Law. Sarah's and  Grant's Law is named after two individuals, Sarah Root and Grant  Ronnebeck, who were tragically killed by unlawful immigrants. The  unlawful immigrants were released and remain at large, and the Root and  Ronnebeck families were left to grieve unspeakable losses while the  lawlessness continues.   It is past time for us to take action to combat dangerous sanctuary  policies. We are a nation of laws and we need to act like it.   While there is no uniform definition of sanctuary cities, and no  comprehensive or official list of these jurisdictions, we have,  regrettably, become all too familiar with them. So-called sanctuary  cities are those jurisdictions that obstruct immigration enforcement  through noncompliance with detainers. They construct unreasonable  hurdles to compliance and create barriers to communication between  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local personnel.   We understand that ICE has a job to do and that its officers took  oaths to uphold those duties. Opponents will claim that this bill is  unnecessary because ICE has the jurisdiction it needs. The truth is,  sanctuary policies make the ICE agents' jobs more difficult, more  dangerous, and endanger communities.   While the previous administration frequently flouted immigration laws  and, for far too long, took a rain check on holding sanctuary cities  accountable, even former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh  Johnson agreed that sanctuary cities shouldn't simply be allowed to  decline to cooperate with Federal Government authorities. In fact, he  said in 2015 that it is ``not acceptable to have no policy of  cooperation with immigration enforcement.''   Mr. Speaker, faithfulness to the law isn't like being offered a cup  of coffee. You can't look at the Federal statutes and say: You know, no  thanks, but I appreciate you offering.   H.R. 3003 confirms that this option is not on the table.   While I agree with former Secretary Johnson that we must have a  policy of cooperation, the policies of the former administration too  frequently didn't indicate a commitment to that goal. In fact, State  and local jurisdictions ignored more than 12,000 Federal detainer  requests in 2014.   Now is the time for action.   Thankfully, President Trump issued an executive order directing the  Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE to  ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions are ineligible for Federal grants  and are subject to enforcement actions. The President also charged  these agencies with reporting on jurisdictions that have refused to  comply with detainers to hold criminal aliens.   The first week this report was issued, it showed 206 known instances  in which local personnel declined ICE detainers and released criminal  aliens. These aliens reentered the communities after they had committed  crimes such as assault, aggravated assault or battery, driving under  the influence, or domestic violence abuses.   The reports indicate that we have work to do, but it helps us by  identifying jurisdictions where personnel are  [[Page H5245]]  thwarting Federal law. It throws into relief the glaring problem of  sanctuary cities and provides information that law enforcement and  lawmakers can use as we assess the problem and develop meaningful  solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I was in the Georgia State House when we took action  there to address the issue of sanctuary cities. In 2009, we in Georgia  outlawed sanctuary cities in our State. Last year, the legislature went  further by requiring local governments to certify their cooperation  with immigration officials in order to receive State funds.   Today we have a chance to take a step in a positive direction on the  Federal level.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act prohibits States and localities  from implementing policies that restrict law enforcement agencies from  cooperating with immigration laws and officials. It gives teeth to that  restriction by tying eligibility for certain Department of Justice and  Homeland Security grants to State and local compliance with existing  immigration laws.   The bill requires that there will be probable cause before ICE can  issue a detainer, and focuses on grant programs reasonably related to  the scope of the bill.   Importantly, this bill also calls for aliens to be detained if the  alien is engaged in a crime that caused death or serious injury to  another person. Had this provision been law at the time, it could have  helped prevent what happened in the heartbreaking death of Sarah Root,  where an alien who caused her death was freed on bond and remains at  large.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act also takes the commonsense step of  allowing DHS to withhold aliens rather than transferring them to  sanctuary jurisdictions, even if the jurisdiction has a warrant. It  simply doesn't make sense for DHS to transfer aliens who are removable  under the law to jurisdictions that are looking for opportunities to  let them go.    Mr. Speaker, I cannot talk about holding sanctuary cities accountable  by strengthening our laws without mentioning the work of Chairman John  Culberson.   In 2016, Chairman Culberson successfully convinced the Department of  Justice to update guidelines in order to disqualify sanctuary cities  from receiving DOJ grant money should they be found in violation of  title 8 U.S. Code, section 1373.   Attorney General Sessions has reiterated that Federal law enforcement  grants are contingent on compliance with existing law, and that the DOJ  will deny fiscal year 2017 grant funds to jurisdictions that have  refused to share information regarding illegal aliens in their custody.   Chairman Culberson's efforts made clear that State and local law  enforcement agencies are expected to work with Federal law enforcement  agencies on immigration matters. Through his diligent work, meaningful  steps have been taken to restore accountability.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act builds on these efforts and  ensures that jurisdictions comply with the detainers while  strengthening our law to ensure that aliens who have been committing  crimes such as drunk driving are detained pending their removal.   H.R. 3003 permits the Secretary of DHS to issue a detainer for any  individual arrested for violation of a criminal or motor vehicle law  upon probable cause that an individual is an inadmissible or deportable  alien.   In this critically important step, the bill grants immunity to State  and local entities for compliance with any detainer.   Jurisdictions that want to act in good faith and follow the law  should be able to cooperate without being held liable for their  compliance. The protections provided in this bill are a major step  forward to effective enforcement.   Finally, this bill gives victims and their families a private right  of action against a State and local government whose noncompliance and  release of an alien results in a murder, rape, or serious injury of the  victim. This measure, were it law, would have allowed Kate Steinle's  family to sue after her tragic murder at the hands of a criminal and  unlawful immigrant.   Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions ignore the law. They do it at the  expense of the American people. Our citizens surely deserve better.  They deserve to live in communities that don't let dangerous criminals  back out into the streets. They deserve to see the law upheld rather  than ignored. Law-abiding citizens deserve to see individuals who break  our laws--not only by entering and residing in our country illegally,  but by committing crimes once here--to be removed.   This rule provides for the consideration of legislation to strengthen  the rule of law and to protect our neighbors and communities.   It demands that jurisdictions comply with our Nation's immigration  laws and enforcement or face penalties.   Today we can take action to turn off the spigot of Federal funds to  those jurisdictions that obstruct ICE efforts at the expense of  Americans. We demonstrate that Members of this House will not sit idly  by while sanctuary cities continue flouting the laws of our land with  impunity. We strengthen our detainer policy, enable ICE to do its job,  and, at the same time, help protect our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  closed rule, and in strong opposition to the underlying bill, H.R.  3003.   Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider its 37th closed rule for  the year, and tomorrow it will take up number 38. My Republican friends  are breaking all kinds of records here.   While I often wonder just why the Republican leadership is so afraid  of open debate in the United States House of Representatives, I do  recognize that it goes right along with the Republican majority's  complete rejection of regular order.   The House of Representatives, I am sad to say, has ceased being a  deliberative body where important issues are debated freely. The  Republican leadership has shut this place down, and this is yet another  example of it.   Look up the history of the bill the House will debate later today or  tomorrow, H.R. 3003, the so-called No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It  was introduced on June 22. That was last Thursday. Like its 2015  predecessor, it has had no hearings, no markup, no input from local law  enforcement, no regular order.   No one had a chance to testify about this bill. Not the U.S.  Conference of Mayors that includes the mayors of over 1,000 cities and  towns, Democrat and Republican alike, who represent over 150 million  people.   Not the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities,  Church World Service, and religious and faith leaders from all across  the land.   Not the National Fraternal Order of Police, the Law Enforcement  Immigration Task Force, or the National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence.   Not the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the YWCA, or hundreds  of national civil rights, human rights, labor, immigration, and  humanitarian organizations.   Mr. Speaker, on a bill that would affect hundreds of cities and towns  and counties across America, why wouldn't we want to hear the views of  these important law enforcement, State and local government, religious,  civil society, and victims' organizations?   The answer is simple, Mr. Speaker. Because they all oppose this  legislation. All of them.    It is much easier for Republicans to close down the process and  steamroll this terrible bill through Congress than to actually get  feedback from the American people and the leaders charged with keeping  them safe.   If you are going to pass a bill that has so much public opposition, I  guess it makes sense to do it quickly and with as little debate as  possible.   Welcome to the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, where the  voices of the American people are shut out as Republicans continue to  ram through their radical agenda.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 does nothing to advance cooperation between  local law enforcement with the Federal Immigration and Customs  Enforcement.  [[Page H5246]]  Cooperation between local and Federal agencies to apprehend, try, and  punish serious criminal offenders, and in the case of foreign  nationals, to imprison and then deport them, has always been a high  priority. These are matters of national security.   But instead of continuing to foster cooperation and strengthen this  priority, this bill chooses to blackmail, coerce, and penalize local  law enforcement agencies and demand that they potentially violate the  Constitution of the United States, in particular the Fourth Amendment,  the 10th Amendment, and the 14th amendment.   I wish my Republican friends were as faithful to the rights enshrined  in these amendments of the Bill of Rights as they are to the Second  Amendment, but then that is a whole other debate.   And let's think about this for a minute. What are they proposing to  do?   For communities and local law enforcement that believe that doing  what this bill asks them to do would make it more difficult for them to  do local policing, and would make it more difficult for them to have  the trust of members in their community to report crimes. What my  Republican friends propose to do is take away important Federal funding  to help keep these communities safe.   What are we talking about here?   I think it is important for people to understand this. Programs like  the COPS programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services; the State  Criminal Alien Assistance Program; the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  program; and national security programs, those things would be taken  away from local communities. It doesn't make any sense.   For example, the Bynre JAG is a major source of criminal justice  funding for local law enforcement and provided $275 million in fiscal  year 2016 for prevention and education programs, drug treatment and  enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and other community- based programs.   Other funding programs and grants that are threatened under this bill  are used to address sexual assault, gang violence, and trafficking such  as the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, the Violent Gang and Gun Crime  Reduction Program, and the Reach and Evaluation on Trafficking in  Persons program.   Maybe nobody read what this bill does before they brought it to the  floor. I just don't understand the logic of basically trying to  blackmail communities by taking away important funding that is designed  to protect the citizens of various communities across this country.   Mr. Speaker, this so-called sanctuary cities bill, as I mentioned,  threatens to strip local jurisdictions of Federal grants and funding.  It specifically targets law enforcement, counterterrorism, and national  security grants when they prioritize working with immigrant communities  to keep our neighbors and cities and towns safe.                                time  1245    I don't think Washington knows best all the time, unlike my  Republican colleagues. I trust my local police departments on this  issue more than I trust my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Republicans would rather demonize these cities, towns, and local police  agencies and force them to squander scarce local resources on  immigration enforcement instead of local policing, making our cities  and our communities less safe, not more safe.   This is why law enforcement and city governments oppose this bill. It  deliberately and cynically undermines their ability to protect their  communities, nurture public trust in the police and our legal system,  and strengthen public safety.   Mr. Speaker, this bill reeks of prejudice. It isn't meant to solve  any problem. It is meant to punish cities that don't embrace the  radical views of the anti-immigrant rightwing of the Republican Party.  It is meant to demonize all immigrants as criminals. It is meant to  turn our local police into the lackeys of ICE.   Mr. Speaker, this House continues to wait and wait and wait for the  Republican majority to show some leadership and bring up a  comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has been more than 4 years  since the Senate passed a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill,  and we are still waiting for House Republicans to step up and act, to  actually try to solve a problem rather than continue to divide our  country and continue to act in a way that is polarizing.   What we need is a way to bring 11 million of our neighbors, friends,  colleagues, small-business owners, and hardworking residents out of the  shadows. That is what makes America stronger. That is why 9 out of 10  Americans support immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship  for the undocumented, according to a March 2017 poll by CNN/ORC.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article about the poll.                       [From cnn.com, Mar. 17, 2017]       CNN/ORC Poll: Americans Break With Trump on Immigration Policy                    (By Tal Kopan and Jennifer Agiesta)         Washington (CNN).--Americans disagree with President Donald       Trump's immigration priorities, according to a new CNN/ORC       poll, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying they'd like       to see a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants       rather than deportations.        Trump has made tough border security and strict enforcement       of US immigration laws a focal point of his campaign and       presidency--using some of his first executive orders to pave       the way for far more deportations and detentions as well as       ordering the construction of a Southern border wall.        But a CNN/ORC poll released Friday finds that the public is       actually moving in the opposite direction since Trump has won       election.        Americans are more likely to say that the nation's top       immigration priority should be to allow those in the US       illegally to gain legal status--and six in 10 say they are       more concerned that deportation efforts will be overzealous       than they are that dangerous criminals will be overlooked.        All told, 60% say the government's top priority in dealing       with illegal immigration should be developing a plan to allow       those in the US illegally who have jobs to become legal       residents.        In contrast, 26% say developing a plan to stop illegal       border crossings should be the top priority and 13% say       deportation of those in the US illegally should be the first       priority.        The number who prioritize legal status for those working in       the US illegally is up from 51% who said so last fall. That       shift comes across party lines, with Democrats and       independents each 10 points more likely and Republicans 8       points more likely to choose a plan for legal status now       compared with last fall.        While Trump campaigned heavily against ``amnesty'' for       undocumented immigrants, he has avoided rescinding an Obama       administration program offering protections and work permits       to those who were brought to the US as children, and in a       recent meeting with reporters a senior administration       official indicated Trump could be open to a compromise that       included a path to legalization, if not citizenship, if it       came to his desk.        Trump told Congress in his joint address last month that he       supported the idea of an immigration reform compromise, but       offered few details.        Offering citizenship to those immigrants who are living in       the US illegally but hold a job, speak English and are       willing to pay back taxes is immensely popular, with 90%       behind such a plan. That's consistent across party lines,       with 96% of Democrats, 89% of independents and 87% of       Republicans behind it.        The President has described his immigration policies as       focused on removing criminals, though critics of his       administration say enforcement agencies' definition of       criminal is too expansive and sweeps up people who only broke       immigration laws.        He has also ordered the creation of offices and reports       focused on publicizing victims of crimes committed by       undocumented immigrants.        Americans say, however, they are more concerned about the       effects of deportations than they are about immigrant crimes.        Overall, 58% say they're more concerned that deportation       efforts will go too far and result in deportation of people       who haven't committed serious crimes, while 40% say they're       more concerned that those efforts will not go far enough and       dangerous criminals will remain in the US. That number is       largely driven by Democrats--more than two-thirds of       Republicans say they are concerned efforts won't go far       enough.        As for deportation priorities, seven in 10 say the       government should not attempt to deport all immigrants living       in the country illegally, up from 66% in the fall.        A wide majority, nearly eight in 10, support deporting       undocumented immigrants who have committed other crimes,       however, an area Trump says is his focus. There has been a       small uptick, nevertheless, in the share who say the       government shouldn't be deporting those living in the US       illegally who have been convicted of other crimes, from 15%       to 19%.        Opinions vary by party on both of these questions, though       majorities across party lines are on the same side of both       arguments. Among Republicans, 55% oppose attempts to deport       all people living in the US illegally, below the 86% of       Democrats and 71% of independents who feel that way.       Considering deportation of those in the country illegally  [[Page H5247]]       who have been convicted of other crimes, 64% of Democrats       favor that, below the 79% of independents and 93% of       Republicans who say the same.        CNN/ORC interviewed 1,025 American adults by phone from       March 1 to 4 for the poll, which has a margin of error of       plus or minus 3 percentage points. Results by party have a       margin of error of plus or minus 6 points.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, instead of working together to find  commonsense solutions to immigration, the Republican leadership offers  extreme, deportation-only bills that undermine public safety and hurt  our communities. Let them register; let them pay a fine; let them be  documented and not fear talking with the police; and let us recognize  their many contributions to communities across America.   These are our friends, our colleagues, and our neighbors. Our kids go  to school together. We shop at the same grocery stores and eat at the  same restaurants. We serve together on the PTA and worship together at  church. Our country is strongest when we lift up our neighbors. This  bill will only drive us apart.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is just more of the same old divisive  Republican anti-immigrant formula. It will sow fear among the immigrant  community, regardless of their status; it will tear families apart; it  will subvert public trust of local law enforcement and police; and it  will undermine the Constitution of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, America is better than this. I urge my colleagues to  reject this closed rule and to oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts a great  deal. I am not sure what is subversive to the Constitution in upholding  the law.   When we deal with this issue, it is about a choice. We can talk about  local law enforcement and we can talk about cities that do not want to  do this, but they are making the choice here. It is time we hold people  accountable for choices.   I think it is really interesting that we mentioned the State Criminal  Alien Assistance Program, which, by the way, was meant to reimburse  localities for holding illegal immigrants. If they are not holding  them, then why do they need the money to start with?   So let's at least put it in perspective here. I can talk about  immigration reform. I believe there is a lot that we can do in that. I  agree with the gentleman. However, I disagree in the part here, why  don't we enforce the law that is here?   By the way, that is currently the law under both President Obama and  President Trump. Under U.S. Code section 1373, in order to get Federal  money, they have to comply with this section. This simply builds upon  what we have already done.   So I think it is a choice here. I think making it out to be anything  other than a choice that the localities have made is really trying to  subvert the process and discuss another issue. We can do that all we  want. That is what ended up, a lot of times, happening in this rule  debate.   But at the end of the day, this is about simply enforcing the law. I  think if you go to places all over the country and you begin to ask  them just a simple question and start it off with this, ``Don't you  think we ought to enforce the law?'' the answer you get over 90 percent  of the time is yes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is clear that the laws aren't working. That is why we need  comprehensive immigration reform, and that is why it is so unfortunate  that the Republicans in this House have stalled on that issue. We had  bipartisan support a few years ago for comprehensive immigration  reform, but people here, for some reason, would rather just demagogue  the issue than do something about it.   As I said before, I actually trust my local officials, my local  police, more than I do my Republican friends who are speaking here  today and who spoke in the Rules Committee last night.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to all of us from the  National Fraternal Order of Police, which is strongly opposed to this  bill; a letter to all of us from The United States Conference of  Mayors, which is strongly opposed to all of this; a letter to all of us  from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which is strongly  opposed to this bill; and a letter to all of us from Cities for Action,  which is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                            National                                       Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any       amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law       enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or       resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an       effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The       House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and       Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance       Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered       by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.        The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly       believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should       cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,       withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--      which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety       efforts.        Local police departments answer to local civilian       government and it is the local government which enacts       statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement       officers have no more say in these matters than any other       citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be       argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to       pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out       lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the       civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to       penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because       Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with       respect to our nation's immigration laws.        The FOP issued a statement in January of this year       regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary       cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The       President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law       enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the       political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S.       Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the       public safety impact without an automatic suspension from       Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is       no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's       existing policy.        The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,       which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and       we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce       or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for       local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect       policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find       another way to do so.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R.       3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to       find a better way to improve public safety in our       communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior       Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any       further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                                   The United States                                            Conference of Mayors,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: I write to register the strong       opposition of the nation's mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan       bill that seeks to punish so-called ``sanctuary cities,''       which is expected to be considered by the full House this       week.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a       thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we       concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of       Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on       previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in       this bill. Specifically, the nation's mayors:        urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that       attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to       ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that       violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United       States citizens and immigrant populations, and further       criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of       immigrant;  [[Page H5248]]         oppose punitive policies that limit local control and       discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the       Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that       recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources       and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and       the safety of our communities;        oppose federal policies that commandeer local law       enforcement or require local UN authorities to violate, or be       placed at risk of violating, a person's Fourth Amendment       rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration       agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities       beyond what is determined by local policy.        HR 3003 would do all of these things and more:        It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical       public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their       police officers not to ask an individual their immigration       status. Many departments have such policies to encourage       crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build       trust with immigrant communities.        It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an       individual's Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable       cause standards for ICE's issuance of detainers that do not       require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous       federal courts have found that continued detention under an       ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for       a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining       officer or jurisdiction to civil liability.        While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions       which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any       suits filed against them, they would still be subject to       Fourth Amendment challenges.        Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain       enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and       cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not       comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents       and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety,       preempt local authority, and expose local governments to       litigation and potential findings of damages. America's       mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against       H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on       positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration       system and make our cities safer. The nation's mayors pledge       to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation       that will fix our nation's broken immigration system. We need       to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an       immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and       our people.        To make our cities safer we urge you to consider       legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent       terrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities       Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America       safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between       communities and police, expand homeland security grants,       invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce       gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and       strengthen reentry services.            Sincerely,                                              Mitchell J. Landrieu,      Mayor of New Orleans, President.                                   ____                                                       Law Enforcement                                          Immigration Task Force,                                                      June 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: As law enforcement leaders       dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our       communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals       that would attempt to impose punitive, ``one-size-fits-all''       policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than       strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us       with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of       our communities, these proposals would represent a step       backwards.        Attempts to defund so-called sanctuary cities regularly       sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in       well-established community policing practices or adhere to       federal court decisions that have found federal immigration       detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose       these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage--      rather than compel--law enforcement agency cooperation within       our federal system.        We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners.       Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and       constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are       not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even       though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful,       some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce       them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would       reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions       and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still       require our agencies and officers carry out federal       directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we       are sworn to follow.        Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal       responsibility. Making our communities safer means better       defining roles and improving relationships between local law       enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in       attempting to defund ``sanctuary cities'' and require state       and local law enforcement to carry out the federal       government's immigration enforcement responsibilities, the       federal government would be substituting its judgment for the       judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies. Local       control has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement       for decades--having the federal government compel state and       local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes       problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal balance and       will harm locally-based policing.        Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement       agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement       activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the       broken immigration system to allow state and local law       enforcement to focus their resources on true threats--      dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe       that state and local law enforcement must work together with       federal authorities to protect our communities and that we       can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of       immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the       removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the       health and well-being of communities across the nation would       not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of       our broken immigration system.        Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of       a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what       our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative       solution--broad-based immigration reform.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: Cities for Action (C4A) is a       coalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that       advocates for policies and programs that promote inclusion of       foreign-born residents. Our coalition has a deep commitment       to promoting public safety and building trust between law       enforcement and immigrant communities. We are writing to you       today to urge that you oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals       Act, H.R. 3003.        Cities and counties are united in our opposition to       Representative Goodlatte's bill, which would undermine local       public safety efforts. Nearly 600 jurisdictions have a       variety of policies that would put them at risk of losing       millions of dollars in federal funding for local law       enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime       victim initiatives. These policies were adopted due to       constitutional concerns and judgements made on the best use       of limited resources. Rather than empowering localities to       adopt measures designed to enhance the general welfare of       their residents, H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the       ability to enact common-sense crime prevention policies that       ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report       crimes.        Among the types of grants that would be at risk are: the       Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, which addresses the growing       number of unsubmitted sexual assault kits in law enforcement       custody and aims to provide help for victims; the Violent       Gang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, which is designed to       create safer neighborhoods through a sustained reduction in       gang violence and gun crime; and the Research and Evaluation       on Trafficking of Persons, which helps support cities'       efforts to respond to the challenges that human trafficking       pose in their jurisdiction.        This bill also raises serious concerns by undermining local       laws and criminal prosecutions. It would prevent states or       localities from establishing laws or policies that  [[Page H5249]]       prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This       intrudes into local policies that help foster a relationship       of trust between law enforcement officials and immigrants       that will, in turn, promote public safety for all our       residents.        This also raises serious constitutional concerns. The Tenth       Amendment to the U. S. Constitution limits the federal       government's ability to mandate particular action by states       and localities, including in the area of federal immigration       law enforcement and investigations. The federal government       cannot force states or localities to enact or administer a       federal regulatory program, or compel state or local       employees to participate in the administration of a federally       enacted regulatory scheme.        In addition, this bill permits DHS to ignore validly issued       state or local criminal warrants, which would prevent       jurisdictions from completing their prosecution of criminals.       The provisions of this bill undercut local law enforcement       and will jeopardize public safety efforts.        Local governments have a strong interest in protecting all       residents and maintaining public safety. Therefore, we urge       you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,       and ensure it never becomes law.        Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter,                                                 Cities for Action.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I know my friends think Washington knows  best, but I trust my local police more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, just going on this, immigration is an interesting  issue, and we can discuss this. There probably are not a lot of folks  that I respect more than the gentlewoman from California, but this is a  constitutional issue. Immigration is a national issue.   If we are willing to reverse this out and let the States and  localities determine immigration, I think we settled that way over 200  years ago. This is where this belongs.   So, as we look at this, Washington is not saying it knows best. But  on this issue, it is our domain; it is where we are supposed to be.  This is our role.   We believe, simply, that enforcing the law is what we need here. If  the gentleman believes that States ought to have more control in a lot  of things that we do, then I think maybe I am getting him closer to  agreeing with us on healthcare that we need to reform and replace  ObamaCare and let States have a little bit more information in that.   But one of the things is that there is no affirmative action on the  cities here. I think there is sort of a point to make here. There is no  affirmative action on cities or localities to comply with this issue.  They are simply, again, as I said earlier, making a choice.   If they choose not to work through it the current way, then they are  giving up Federal funding. That is their choice. If they choose to do  it, they are giving up Federal funding. They are not being forced and  coerced. They are simply saying: You actually look at it; you make the  choice in how you want to do it; then explain it to your population. If  they are agreeing with that, that is your choice.   One of the things that often is said here is we trot out letters from  associations. And I agree. I respect the National Fraternal Order of  Police and mayors. They have a great thing. But they also represent  members who are, right now, actually, not in compliance with this, who  dislike this law. So, naturally, you would say part of their membership  is going to be supportive of them.   But, also, growing up in the household of a Georgia State trooper, I  also know a few things about law enforcement as well. Law enforcement  wants to protect the communities they serve, and they want to enforce  the law.    What is happening right now is that local law enforcement is deciding  how they are going to do this. They are not cooperating with ICE to  find a better way to work in their communities. They are simply saying:  We made a political choice to do something.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I think with the Constitution, this body has the  political choice to say: That is your choice; just do it without  Federal funds.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman, my friend, says that this is a constitutional  question. We agree that the Constitution is an important document, and  it goes to the heart of why we are opposed to the bill that the  gentleman is supporting here. The reason why we say that is because we  have had Federal courts that have decided in ways in the past that  cause great concern that much in this bill may be unconstitutional.   Now, that is why we should have had hearings, that radical idea that  we keep on bringing up, like hearings where people come and testify.  But I guess that is too much to ask.   One of the reasons why we are opposed to this is because we are  concerned that it may undermine the Constitution, and that is a pretty  big deal. I am happy to give the gentleman my copy of the Constitution  and references to court cases if he would like to do a little research,  but, boy, it would have been nice to have a hearing.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on behalf of 407 local,  State, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-based, and labor  organizations in strong opposition to H.R. 3003.                                                      June 28, 2017.      Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,           and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned       local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-      based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R.       3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public       safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and       its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and       incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly       needed law enforcement funding for state and local       jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,       and unnecessarily expands the government's detention       apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal       government's  [[Page H5250]]       ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for immigration-      based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian protections       for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on the failed       experiment of incarceration for immigration violations.        Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or       ordinances that disentangle their state and local law       enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.       The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to       attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do       not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and       local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the       U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally       infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,       including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       any other federal grant related to law enforcement or       immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding       federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely       runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on       commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law       professors.        ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public       safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of       crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local       law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have       repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that       community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public       safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime       and more economic development than similarly situated non-      ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed       federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the       ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the       public safety needs of their communities.        Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the       immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for       immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation       Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with       employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under       Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes       immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical       measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,       wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished       thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the       United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.       We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry       would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison       population, and cost billions of dollars.        Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only       legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just       immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to       citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring       Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation       programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation       that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic       processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns       represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to       enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of       the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will address my remarks to the Chair, but I also will  not stand here and let it be said from some political angle that the  son of a Georgia State trooper has anything less than respect for law  enforcement or wants anything more than to have law enforcement  agencies do their job. And this is exactly what we are talking about.  Do your job.   If you want to make a political statement, then work it out  politically. But this is: Do your job, keep the law.   I mean, what else--are we going to get another letter from another  police association saying: Well, we decided we are not going to enforce  Federal whatever else?   This is an issue that needs to be discussed, and I will just simply  say, from this perspective, of one who has lived it for 50 years and  who lived it under the same house for 21 years, no, there is no one  that respects law enforcement and their role more than this Member. And  this Member is simply reflecting a lot of views of law enforcement.   This says: Let us do our job. We will work on these issues, but you  are making a choice. If you don't want to enforce it, then don't take  the money. Do what you want to do. Just don't take the money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) in order to respond.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are trying to bring this  to the floor by way of defeating the previous question is because the  Republican majority in this House had basically locked everything down  so we can't get important bills to the floor.   We can't even get amendments to the underlying bill that we are  debating here today. It is really unfortunate and sad for this  institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do believe that in just a little bit we will be  debating this bill. I do believe in just a short time it will pass.   I think what was very interesting, Mr. Speaker, is the frustrations  of my friend, and I believe they are true frustrations, and the stories  of folks coming from terrible places around the world wanting to get  here. We are the light on a hill. We are the ones that everybody wants  to come to. I grant you that.   But I do have a question. For these folks who are leaving disaster,  places in which law and order are not enforced, in which people are  dying, and they are striving to get someplace else,  [[Page H5260]]  why in the world would we want to get to here to find that we have a  situation in which local law enforcement can sort of decide what they  want to do, where law and order is not followed?   You are leaving one area to get to an area in which what they say is  law and order is what is needed and what is followed and why they come  here, but yet we are saying no.   I think it has also been, possibly, Mr. Speaker, a vast  mischaracterization to say that all police are against this. In fact,  if we have seen, there was 200 that was identified earlier, the vast  majority of police departments in this country uphold the law. So let's  don't make a blanket assessment of police here.   I think it is just an interesting development here. I think you can  talk about laws. You can like laws, you cannot like laws, you can do  something about immigration.   But I do think we also need to address something else. It wasn't a  part of this bill, but we wanted to make it a part of this bill, and  that is comprehensive immigration reform.   I do agree with my friend. There needs to be immigration reform. I  think it needs to start with security and safety and protection. It  needs to start with actually enforcing law, and then begin the  foundation of finding a way to get workers here--our guest worker  program, our ag worker program, the things that we need to make our  expansion so that we do it properly. I agree completely.   But, Mr. Speaker, I do find it has been amazing here because, just in  the context of this debate, these were words that were used: We're  demagoguing this issue. We didn't have the guts to address this issue.  Our DNA of leadership is to obstruct or to not bring this forward.   Well, I think the one thing that I do need to remind is, this body,  Mr. Speaker, if you are very familiar with this, over the last few  weeks, we have been dealing with a very difficult issue--we passed it  out of the House--that is healthcare, which was passed when this body  was filled in a majority of a different party, my friends across the  aisle, when they had, at times, filibuster-proof majorities.   They worked to pass healthcare. They worked to pass Dodd-Frank. They  worked to pass their priorities.   My interesting question is, they did not work to pass comprehensive  immigration reform. I am not sure why now we decide that it is such  their issue that they are now blaming us, many of us who want to find a  way forward.   But I think the answer is plain and obvious in history. They chose  not to do it. I repeat, they chose not to do it.   So I think in the discussion of this battle, we will continue these  discussions. We will continue to have differences of opinion. I think  it is sort of amazing though that we do have to have a discussion here  on telling police to enforce the law and work out the details as we go,  work out what is in this bill.   But it also is about priorities, Mr. Speaker. For those of us who  have had to look at the tragedies left behind as a result of some of  these decisions that they have made to ``better'' their community, the  deaths, the tragedies, then it is a pretty interesting choice. Is the  death more important or less important than your policy?   All we are simply saying is: just don't take the money. Look at it  from that perspective.   And we will continue to have these debates. My friend and I will  continue to be passionately different on this, and that is okay. That  is what this floor is for because, at the end of the day, we are going  to have a vote. One side is going to win and one side is going to lose  in this vote. And the debate is going to happen, and the bill is going  to come forward. There will be another vote. And then it will go to the  Senate.   I disagree with my friend from Massachusetts, respect his opinion,  but, in this case, I believe the debate is fairly clear to most  Americans. All we are asking is, and what the current law already  states, follow the rules. And all we are simply saying is, follow the  rules.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 414 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       15) to provide for increases in the Federal minimum wage, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 15.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.
