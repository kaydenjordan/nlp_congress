 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, I said I hoped the second  day of Judge Jackson's responses would provide more clarity on some  vital questions. Unfortunately, the nominee's answers trended the other  way. Regarding the Court as an institution, the nominee continued to  reject the examples of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. She refused to  denounce partisan Court packing. On judicial philosophy, the judge  continued to deflect actually basic questions.   The lack of candor is especially troubling since the President sent  us a nominee with no meaningful written record on constitutional  matters. For more than 8 of Judge Jackson's 9 years on the Federal  bench, she was a trial judge on the district court. As the nominee  herself explained on Tuesday, that role neither requires a particular  talent for constitutional interpretation nor gives judges much of a  chance to exhibit one. She deflected a question about judicial  philosophy by explaining that such questions do not often occur to her  on the lower court.   District court records alone shed little light on what kind of  Supreme Court Justice someone might be.   Now, Judge Jackson's current post on the DC Circuit is a much closer  analog. The problem is, she has held that position for less than a year  and has only published two opinions. Justice Gorsuch had authored 212  circuit court opinions before he was nominated to the Supreme Court.  Justice Kavanaugh had written 306. Senators had an unbelievable wealth  of writings to examine. As to Justice Barrett, in just 3 years on the  Seventh Circuit, she had already written 91 appellate opinions, not to  mention her many academic writings on constitutional law. Judge Jackson  has written a total of two circuit court opinions--just two.   The only real body of evidence before the Senate is her record as a  trial judge. Like I mentioned, those rulings communicate very little  about the judge's approach to big-picture questions of interpretation.  But to make matters worse, Judge Jackson declined to answer basic  questions about those rulings. Senators asked about clear patterns in  the judge's criminal sentencing decisions. The nominee deflected by  saying every case is unique. So Senators tried to examine one case at a  time. Then the nominee said she couldn't recall details. So Senators  tried to supply the details. Then the nominee stonewalled and said no  one case can fully capture a judge's record.   This made up an endless circle of evasion. Judge Jackson wouldn't  address broad patterns in her rulings because she said it was unfair-- unfair--for Senators to zoom out, and she wouldn't discuss specific  cases because she said it was unfair for Senators to zoom in.   Since the only real body of evidence before the Senate is Judge  Jackson's trial records, Senators asked why she consistently opposed  weak sentences for certain crimes.  [[Page S1759]]    The nominee then ducked the question over and over. She blamed  Congress for giving her that discretion in the first place. Both the  nominee and then Chairman Durbin kept repeating that if Senators wanted  to guarantee harsher penalties, we could mandate them.   That is true, but it is a non sequitur.   Senators wanted to know why Judge Jackson used the discretion she  actually did have in the specific ways she chose to use it. The  Senators were trying to understand what this nominee does with  discretion when she has it.   But, again, the nominee would not answer. She kept blaming the mere  existence of her discretion for her decisions to go soft on criminals,  when she could have just as easily used that discretion to be tough. We  basically had a nominee saying that: If Senators want me to be tough on  crime, you will have to change the laws to force me--force me--to do  it.   In several egregious instances, from child exploitation to fentanyl  trafficking, the nominee used especially unusual and creative legal  moves that stretched the bounds of the judicial role. In the nominee's  own words, she simply has a ``policy disagreement'' with parts of the  sentencing law.   Evidently, the judge's personal policy views change how she applies  the law.   Finally, I understand some Democratic Senators held a press  conference yesterday to complain that Republicans' questions were too  tough.   Of course, nobody could have less credibility to police the fine  details of confirmation hearings than our Democratic colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee. The last 48 hours were a dry and friendly legal  seminar compared to the circus that Democrats inflicted on the country  just a few years back.   The American people know it is not asking too much to ask a Federal  judge legal questions about her record. I just wish the Senate had  gotten more answers.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, now on a different matter, today, President Biden is  overseas meeting with America's closest European allies as Vladimir  Putin's war in Ukraine enters its second month.   He is engaging with a Europe that has been profoundly changed. NATO  allies have watched a neighbor invaded by an aggressive Russia. Some,  like Germany, are ending 30 years--30 years--of post-Cold War neglect  for military modernization and energy security.   I am glad that, as I urged last week, the President's itinerary will  include not just Western Europe, but also Poland. His presence on the  eastern flank will send an important message. Of course, the most  concrete way to support Ukraine is with greater commitments of lethal  aid. Ukrainian forces can win this fight.   Let me say that again. Ukrainian forces can win this fight. But they  need more weapons, more ammunition, more fuel, and they need it all as  fast as possible.   The allies and partners who are helping equip Ukraine also need  replenishing their own arsenals. But the fight has highlighted  shortcomings in both our current stockpiles of critical weapons and  munitions and our industrial capacity to produce more quickly.   As other NATO members wake up to the importance of long-term  investments in defense, America should lead by example. We have to meet  the military requirements that come from being a superpower facing  growing threats to our global interests: sustained increases in defense  spending, deeper inventories of critical weapons systems and munitions,  less redtape, work with industry to make our development and production  systems more nimble.   This will not only help us meet the growing requirements of our  military but also ensure we can be a reliable supplier of weapons and  munitions to our allies and our partners.   As the Washington Post reported just yesterday, recent events have  caught our defense industrial base napping.   Here is the quote from the Post:         [W]eapons manufacturers weren't geared up to make antitank       and antiaircraft arms at a wartime pace. While the United       States had 13,000 Stingers in its stockpile before the       invasion, there were no plans to produce more en masse . . .       Militaries in Europe that have given their Stingers and       antitank missiles to Ukraine now want to refill depleted       stocks, creating competition for new units rolling off the       assembly line.    So President Biden already has real power to address this himself.  The Defense Production Act was created during a period of tense  competition with Russia to bolster production of critical military  supplies. The exact circumstance we are in right now.   Ironically, the far left has demanded the President invoke the  Defense Production Act for everything but--everything but--its central  purpose. They don't want to use the Defense Production Act to bolster  defenses, but, rather, to force taxpayer money into renewable energy  schemes that are not ready for prime time. Democrats should be using  the Defense Production Act to literally produce more defenses, but they  want, instead, to use it to spin up some more Solyndras.   Of course, the real solution for global energy concerns is not  throwing money into finicky technologies that themselves rely on  Russian and Chinese supply chains. It is to unshackle U.S. energy  producers. We can help meet Europe's needs by increasing American crude  and LNG exports, but our European friends will have to make necessary  sacrifices to wean themselves off of reliance on Russia.    Putin's war of aggression reminds us the so-called international  order is not self-enforcing. The relative Pax Americana that has lasted  for the better part of a century does not--not--sustain itself  automatically. American leadership remains in very high demand.   Putin's unprovoked war has further discredited the small pockets in  both of our political parties who want America to pull back from the  world stage, who excuse the behavior of tyrants, who think it would be  prudent and sensible to cede vast spheres of influence to Russia and  China. There is nothing remotely prudent or sensible about handing over  entire regions of the world to these thugs.   The national security interests of the United States have never  stopped at our own borders, and they certainly do not today. We are a  superpower with worldwide interests requiring a worldwide presence and  a worldwide network of allies and partners. American power will not  preserve itself. American security will not protect itself. American  interests will not uphold themselves. And America's partners will not  lead themselves.   This awesome responsibility falls on the shoulders of the President  of the United States, the leader of the free world. President Biden has  an opportunity as soon as he returns from Europe to begin charting the  right course for America and the West.   On Monday, his administration will submit his budget request for the  next fiscal year. We will see if the President finally commits to  investing in a future of strong American leadership.   Our global challenges are not partisan issues; they are American  issues. I sincerely hope that the Commander in Chief of our Armed  Forces submits a defense budget request that reflects this reality.   The world is dangerous and getting smaller. America must not shrink  from the challenge, but rise and meet it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has completed  its hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. I enjoyed meeting the  nominee. I went into the Senate's process with an open mind.   But after studying the nominee's record and watching her performance  this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime  appointment to the Supreme Court.   First, Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that  Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg and  Justice Breyer had no problem denouncing this unpopular view and  defending their institution. I assumed this would be an easy softball  for Judge Jackson, but it wasn't. The nominee suggested there are two  legitimate sides to the issue. She testified she has a view on the  matter but would not share it. She inaccurately compared her nonanswer  to a different, narrower question that a prior nominee was asked. But  Judge Jackson, seemingly, actually tipped her hand. She said she would  be ``thrilled to be one of however many.''   ``However many.''  [[Page S1785]]    The opposite of Ginsburg and Breyer's sentiment. The most radical  pro-court-packing fringe groups badly wanted this nominee for this  vacancy. Judge Jackson was the court-packer's pick, and she testified  like it.   Second, for decades, activist judges have hurt the country by trying  to make policy from the bench. This has made judicial philosophy a key  qualification that Senators must consider.   President Biden stated he would only appoint a Supreme Court Justice  with a specific approach that is neither textualist nor originalist.  That is the President's litmus test: No strict constructionists need  apply. And that President picked Judge Jackson.   If the nominee had a paper trail on constitutional issues, perhaps it  could reassure us, but she doesn't. When Justice Gorsuch was nominated  to the Supreme Court, he had written more than 200 circuit court  opinions that Senators could actually study. Justice Kavanaugh had  written more than 300. Justice Barrett outpaced them both. She wrote  almost 100 appellate opinions in just 3 years, plus years of  scholarship as a star professor that Senators could actually examine.   Judge Jackson has been on the DC Circuit for less than a year. She  has published only two opinions. Beforehand, Judge Jackson served as a  trial judge on the district court. She testified on Tuesday that that  role did not provide many opportunities to think about constitutional  interpretation.   Yet when Senators tried to dig in on judicial philosophy, the judge  deflected and pointed back to the same record she acknowledged would  not shed much light. One Senator simply asked the judge to summarize-- summarize--well-known differences between the approaches of some  current Justices. The nominee replied that 2 weeks' notice had not been  enough time to prepare an answer.   President Biden said he would only nominate a judicial activist.  Unfortunately, we saw no reason to suspect that he accidentally did the  opposite.   Third, and relatedly, we are in the midst of a national violent crime  wave and exploding illegal immigration. Unbelievably, the Biden  administration has nevertheless launched a national campaign to make  the Federal bench systemically softer on crime. The New York Times  calls this a ``sea change.''   Is it more likely the administration chose a Supreme Court nominee  who would push against their big campaign or somebody who would be its  crowning jewel?   This is one area where Judge Jackson's trial court records provide a  wealth of information, and it is troubling, indeed.   The judge regularly gave certain terrible kinds of criminals light  sentences that were beneath the sentencing guidelines and beneath the  prosecutor's request.    The judge herself, this week, used the phrase ``policy disagreement''  to describe this subject. The issue isn't just the sentences. It is  also the judge's rhetoric and trial transcript and the creative ways  she actually bent the law.   In one instance, Judge Jackson used COVID as a pretext to essentially  rewrite--rewrite--a criminal justice reform law from the bench and make  it retroactive, which Congress, of course, had declined to do. She did  so to cut the sentence of a fentanyl trafficker while Americans died in  huge numbers from overdoses.   Judge Jackson declined to walk Senators through the merits of her  reasoning in specific cases. She just kept repeating that it was her  discretion and if Congress didn't like it, it was our fault for giving  her the discretion. That is hardly an explanation as to why she uses  her discretion the way she does.   It was not reassuring to hear Judge Jackson essentially say that if  Senators want her to be tough on crime, we need to change the law, take  away her discretion, and force her to do it.   That response seems to confirm that deeply held personal policy views  seep into her jurisprudence, and that is exactly what the record  suggests.   I will conclude with this. Late on Tuesday, after hours of  questioning, I believe we may have witnessed a telling moment. Under  questioning about judicial activism, Judge Jackson bluntly said this:         Well, any time the Supreme Court has five votes, then they       have a majority for whatever opinion they determine.    That isn't just a factual observation. It is a clear echo of a famous  quotation from perhaps the most famous judicial activist of all time,  the archliberal William Brennan.   The late Justice Brennan told people the most important rule in  constitutional law was ``the Rule of Five.'' With five votes, a  majority can do whatever it wants.   That is a perfect summary of judicial activism. It is a recipe for  courts to wander into policymaking and prevent healthy democratic  compromise.   This is the misunderstanding of the separation of powers that I have  spent my entire career fighting against. But President Biden made that  misunderstanding his litmus test.   And nothing we saw this week convinced me that either President Biden  or Judge Jackson's deeply invested, far-left fan club have misjudged  her.   I will vote against this nominee on the Senate floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
