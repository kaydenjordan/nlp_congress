 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding the time and for his steadfastness in standing up for the  public health of all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican's bill, S.J. Res.  11. What my Republican colleagues are trying to do here is roll back a  very important Environmental Protection Act rule that was developed to  tackle air pollution across America under the Clean Air Act, air  pollution specifically that comes from heavy-duty trucks and buses.   For over 50 years, the Clean Air Act has served us well. It is one of  our bedrock environmental laws that improves the air that we breathe.  It tackles polluting plants and vehicles through using the latest  science and technology to constantly evolve and improve.   Oftentimes, the EPA works with industry, as they did here with the  trucking industry, to ensure that there is a balance, that we are  improving the air we breathe and still maintaining jobs and economic  growth over time.                                time  1430    What the Clean Air Act has brought us over the past 50 years has been  consistent improvement in the air that we breathe. In fact, there have  been dramatic improvements. When we are talking about cleaner air, we  are talking about healthier communities and healthier families.   Think about your friends and family members with asthma or heart  disease or some kind of lung infection. That is why it is so important  to make sure that EPA is constantly evolving in the science and  technology we are using in cleaning up our air.   It is important to tackle the problem of heavy-duty trucks and buses.  Why? They constitute about 6 percent of the vehicles on the road, but  59 percent of smog-producing elements: that means nitrogen dioxide,  ozone, and particulate matter. The last time that EPA updated their  rule relating to heavy-duty trucks and buses was 20 years ago.   Science and technology have evolved. The trucking industry has  evolved. We can continue to make progress for American families. Even  with the progress that we have made, one in three Americans live in  counties with unhealthy air pollution. Back home in the Tampa Bay area,  I can think of many communities along the interstate highways and along  our industrial centers where there is a lot of traffic, especially from  heavy-duty trucks and buses that are really weighing on the air quality  in those neighborhoods.   This is a way, thankfully, for EPA to continue its mission to clean  up the air under the Clean Air Act and make sure they are doing it in a  scientifically sound manner. They are always working with industry on  ways to improve and to protect public health. For all those reasons, I  urge my colleagues to oppose this Republican resolution. Allow the  Environmental Protection Agency to cut pollution, improve our health,  and save lives. Let's put people over politics and make sure we are  doing all we can do to improve the health and lives of our American  neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
