 Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on the 73rd  anniversary of the invasion of Normandy, Omaha Beach, and Sword Beach  by 156,000 brave Americans who saved our freedom and liberty, for the  American people as well as all of Europe, who put an end to the reign  of Adolph Hitler, and remind me every day as chairman of the Veterans'  Committee why I am here in the U.S. Senate--and that is to see to it  that we take care of those who have taken care of us.   Somebody asked me this morning: Is it coincidence that D-day was 73  years ago today? I said: It is Divine providence that we are on the  floor today paying back those brave 156,000 who invaded those beaches  to make the Veterans' Administration a more favorable agency than it is  already.   I am proud to be on the floor to lead a part of the debate with  Senator Tester--my ranking member on the committee and my dear friend-- on a bill that I think is of great significance. It is the Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.   The best quote is not one I could come up with or I doubt that Jon  could come up with. The best quote really was come up with by the Iraq  and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the IAVA. When asked, they said:  ``This is the strongest VA accountability measure that can be signed  into law.'' I want to reiterate that: the strongest accountability  measure of the VA that can be signed into law. Which means we are  reaching into every corner of problems in the VA which have existed  over the last years. We are making sure we make the corrections  necessary to make the VA an accountable organization, and we are doing  it in a bipartisan fashion together, Democrats and Republicans alike.   As I have said very often, there aren't Republican casualties and  Democratic casualties on the battlefield. They are American citizens  who have fought and died for this country. So there is no room for  partisanship when it comes to providing them with the benefits that are  necessary and seeing to it that they get what they deserve.   I thank all the members of the committee; in particular, Ranking  Member Tester for his work; Senator Moran, who did such great work for  us on the accountability measure; Senator Rubio, who is not a member of  the committee but did a great job in terms of accountability, and he  will speak later on the floor--as I am sure others will--about this.   We have had a great committee working for a long period of time. We  passed a bill--almost--last year and then failed at the last few  moments of the session to get it done. So we are back a second time,  but we are back  [[Page S3267]]  with a bill that has come unanimously from the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs and I hope will leave this Senate floor unanimously so we send  a clear signal to our veterans: We will hold ourselves accountable to  you.   What specifically does the legislation do that is important? One, it  makes what President Trump referred to in an Executive order about 3  weeks ago, the veterans whistleblower protection act, a reality and  codifies it into law. Second, it removes many of the bureaucratic  hurdles currently in place, making it easier for the VA Secretary to  remove employees of all departments in the VA who are found guilty of  wrongdoing or misconduct, and I underscore found guilty of wrongdoing  or misconduct.   The bill shortens the removal process for employees of the VA and  ensures an individual appealing removal from the VA is not kept on VA's  payroll indefinitely while they appeal. The Department of Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act also prohibits  the VA from awarding bonuses to employees found guilty of misconduct.  The bill would remove the bureaucratic Merit System Protection Board  from appeals by the senior management--top management--of the Veterans'  Administration.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act establishes the Office of Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection to make it permanent in the United States of  America.   In essence, and very simply, this bill ensures and codifies into law  the accountability of this agency and its operation to the American  people and to the veterans of the United States of America for all they  have done for each and every one of us.   It is very important to appreciate that this does not come to us by  some Senator or some Representative coming up with a bunch of crazy  ideas at the last minute. This is a response to what we have seen  happen over and over again over the past few years. Most, if not all,  of the employees in the Veterans' Administration are hard-working,  dedicated, committed individuals, but there have been, from time to  time, questions that have arisen about the handling of certain  situations: the situation that took place in Phoenix, AZ, in terms of  appointments; the rash number of suicides and mishandling of  pharmaceuticals in the Atlanta office of Clairmont, near where I am in  my office in Atlanta, GA; the situation of transfers in Philadelphia,  PA, where people were transferred rather than disciplined and were paid  their moving expenses and cost-of-living adjustments upward--all to get  rid of somebody in one office but move them to another, instead of  handling them in the way in which they should have been, which holds  them accountable, rather than making sure they work somewhere else. We  took instances where people themselves were breaking the law and  violating the law, and we are now holding them accountable because of  what is written into the VA accountability and whistleblower act.   Simply put, we have taken the worst performance, in isolated cases in  the past few years, and did what was right. We have corrected it where  it needed to be corrected, we have eliminated it where it needed to be  eliminated, and we have given the authority to the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs and employees under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to discipline people who work for them and hold them accountable for  doing the wrong thing and encourage them to do the right thing.   I reiterate, though, that we are not singling out an agency which has  a large number of people who are not performing. We are singling out an  agency which has had some situations where a few employees have done  some egregious things that need to be addressed. They were addressed  but couldn't be addressed under the current status of the law, which  now will be able to be addressed under the status of the new law and  held accountable for their actions.   Nothing happens when one person does it. Everything happens when  people come together as a team. It has been a pleasure for me to have a  great teammate in this effort; that is, Jon Tester from Montana. I have  been on the committee 12 years, and I think Jon has been on the  committee 8 or 9 years.   You are on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, first of all, because you  want to be on it. It is what we refer to as a B committee, which means  it is a second tier. A lot of times it is a fill-in committee for  Members of the Senate or the House, but for me and for Jon, it is our  principal and primary responsibility. We know to whom we owe  everything, and that is our veterans to whom we owe everything.   Jon Tester has been a great teammate. He has been great to work with.  He has helped us get through some times of difficulty and some good  times of common understanding and settlement, and I appreciate that  very much.   I want Jon to tell me what the people of Montana are telling him  about our Veterans' Administration and the need for stronger  accountability in the VA of Montana. Tell us what they are saying in  Montana, Jon.    Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on the 73rd  anniversary of the invasion of Normandy, Omaha Beach, and Sword Beach  by 156,000 brave Americans who saved our freedom and liberty, for the  American people as well as all of Europe, who put an end to the reign  of Adolph Hitler, and remind me every day as chairman of the Veterans'  Committee why I am here in the U.S. Senate--and that is to see to it  that we take care of those who have taken care of us.

Most, if not all,  of the employees in the Veterans' Administration are hard-working,  dedicated, committed individuals, but there have been, from time to  time, questions that have arisen about the handling of certain  situations: the situation that took place in Phoenix, AZ, in terms of  appointments; the rash number of suicides and mishandling of  pharmaceuticals in the Atlanta office of Clairmont, near where I am in  my office in Atlanta, GA; the situation of transfers in Philadelphia,  PA, where people were transferred rather than disciplined and were paid  their moving expenses and cost-of-living adjustments upward--all to get  rid of somebody in one office but move them to another, instead of  handling them in the way in which they should have been, which holds  them accountable, rather than making sure they work somewhere else. We  took instances where people themselves were breaking the law and  violating the law, and we are now holding them accountable because of  what is written into the VA accountability and whistleblower act.   Simply put, we have taken the worst performance, in isolated cases in  the past few years, and did what was right. We have corrected it where  it needed to be corrected, we have eliminated it where it needed to be  eliminated, and we have given the authority to the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs and employees under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to discipline people who work for them and hold them accountable for  doing the wrong thing and encourage them to do the right thing.   I reiterate, though, that we are not singling out an agency which has  a large number of people who are not performing. We are singling out an  agency which has had some situations where a few employees have done  some egregious things that need to be addressed. They were addressed  but couldn't be addressed under the current status of the law, which  now will be able to be addressed under the status of the new law and  held accountable for their actions.   Nothing happens when one person does it. Everything happens when  people come together as a team. It has been a pleasure for me to have a  great teammate in this effort; that is, Jon Tester from Montana. I have  been on the committee 12 years, and I think Jon has been on the  committee 8 or 9 years.   You are on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, first of all, because you  want to be on it. It is what we refer to as a B committee, which means  it is a second tier. A lot of times it is a fill-in committee for  Members of the Senate or the House, but for me and for Jon, it is our  principal and primary responsibility. We know to whom we owe  everything, and that is our veterans to whom we owe everything.   Jon Tester has been a great teammate. He has been great to work with.  He has helped us get through some times of difficulty and some good  times of common understanding and settlement, and I appreciate that  very much.   I want Jon to tell me what the people of Montana are telling him  about our Veterans' Administration and the need for stronger  accountability in the VA of Montana. Tell us what they are saying in  Montana, Jon.    Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on the 73rd  anniversary of the invasion of Normandy, Omaha Beach, and Sword Beach  by 156,000 brave Americans who saved our freedom and liberty, for the  American people as well as all of Europe, who put an end to the reign  of Adolph Hitler, and remind me every day as chairman of the Veterans'  Committee why I am here in the U.S. Senate--and that is to see to it  that we take care of those who have taken care of us.   Somebody asked me this morning: Is it coincidence that D-day was 73  years ago today? I said: It is Divine providence that we are on the  floor today paying back those brave 156,000 who invaded those beaches  to make the Veterans' Administration a more favorable agency than it is  already.   I am proud to be on the floor to lead a part of the debate with  Senator Tester--my ranking member on the committee and my dear friend-- on a bill that I think is of great significance. It is the Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.   The best quote is not one I could come up with or I doubt that Jon  could come up with. The best quote really was come up with by the Iraq  and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the IAVA. When asked, they said:  ``This is the strongest VA accountability measure that can be signed  into law.'' I want to reiterate that: the strongest accountability  measure of the VA that can be signed into law. Which means we are  reaching into every corner of problems in the VA which have existed  over the last years. We are making sure we make the corrections  necessary to make the VA an accountable organization, and we are doing  it in a bipartisan fashion together, Democrats and Republicans alike.   As I have said very often, there aren't Republican casualties and  Democratic casualties on the battlefield. They are American citizens  who have fought and died for this country. So there is no room for  partisanship when it comes to providing them with the benefits that are  necessary and seeing to it that they get what they deserve.   I thank all the members of the committee; in particular, Ranking  Member Tester for his work; Senator Moran, who did such great work for  us on the accountability measure; Senator Rubio, who is not a member of  the committee but did a great job in terms of accountability, and he  will speak later on the floor--as I am sure others will--about this.   We have had a great committee working for a long period of time. We  passed a bill--almost--last year and then failed at the last few  moments of the session to get it done. So we are back a second time,  but we are back  [[Page S3267]]  with a bill that has come unanimously from the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs and I hope will leave this Senate floor unanimously so we send  a clear signal to our veterans: We will hold ourselves accountable to  you.   What specifically does the legislation do that is important? One, it  makes what President Trump referred to in an Executive order about 3  weeks ago, the veterans whistleblower protection act, a reality and  codifies it into law. Second, it removes many of the bureaucratic  hurdles currently in place, making it easier for the VA Secretary to  remove employees of all departments in the VA who are found guilty of  wrongdoing or misconduct, and I underscore found guilty of wrongdoing  or misconduct.   The bill shortens the removal process for employees of the VA and  ensures an individual appealing removal from the VA is not kept on VA's  payroll indefinitely while they appeal. The Department of Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act also prohibits  the VA from awarding bonuses to employees found guilty of misconduct.  The bill would remove the bureaucratic Merit System Protection Board  from appeals by the senior management--top management--of the Veterans'  Administration.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act establishes the Office of Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection to make it permanent in the United States of  America.   In essence, and very simply, this bill ensures and codifies into law  the accountability of this agency and its operation to the American  people and to the veterans of the United States of America for all they  have done for each and every one of us.

I want Jon to tell me what the people of Montana are telling him  about our Veterans' Administration and the need for stronger  accountability in the VA of Montana. Tell us what they are saying in  Montana, Jon.    Senator Tester, like you, I get my best information at  the Legion, the IAVA, and from folks around my State. I am a member of  the American Legion post at Loganville, GA, and go every once in a  while to the bar and get a drink just to find out what is going on. I  find out more there in an hour socializing than I find out by reading  every newspaper in the United States of America.   Let me tell you what some of the organizations are saying--because  these veterans service organizations are the voice of the American  people who served in our military, and they are the people who  communicate to us in committee.   The VFW wants the Secretary to weed out misperformers and especially  the criminals, regardless of whether the crime was committed on or off  duty.   The VFW wants a bill passed because maintaining the status quo does  not work for those who have borne the battle and borne the fight.   They want to make sure the VA holds their employees to the standards  the veterans of America feel they have committed themselves to as  veterans serving in our military.   The American Legion applauds the bipartisan effort to provide  Secretary Shulkin the additional tools to increase accountability and  address poor performance within the Department of Veterans Affairs.   I underscore this, because in the bill Jon and I ensure we motivate  management to understand it is their job to seek out nonperformance and  correct it before it runs amuck. So this bill incentivizes management  of the Veterans' Administration to find those employees who are not  performing well and turn them around and reward those employees who are  turned around to be an example they set for all the rest of the  employees.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act will give Secretary Shulkin the authority he needs to  hold Department employees responsible for their actions. ``We strongly  agree with the Senate to take the bill immediately and pass it,'' said  Dan Caldwell of Concerned Veterans of America.   So, once and for all, all around our State our VSO organizations are  getting a response to the questions they have asked of all of us, and  that is what this bill does.   There is misinformation out there. There are rumors flying around in  Montana, some flying around in Georgia. Can the Senator help clear up  some of the errors?    I want to talk about the culture the Senator just  mentioned. He is exactly right. The main thing the American people are  going to see from the Veterans' Administration now is a culture  throughout that organization of excellence to serve the veterans the  way they should be served. And where there might be an isolated  problem, make sure it is sought out, rooted out, and corrected within  the agency. Our veterans deserve the highest quality care.   Secretary Shulkin has asked for more authority to hold accountable  those who are not meeting standards. He wants to recognize those who  have not only met but exceeded standards as well.   This bill gives VA the authority to expedite the removal of a bad  employee, but it doesn't motivate them to get rid of people, it gives  them the parameters by which people should be dealt with if, in fact,  they are behaving poorly. It shortens the process for removing an  employee to 15 days. That doesn't mean you act recklessly or quickly,  it means you act expeditiously to see to it that if you have a problem,  it is addressed quickly for the benefit of all the agencies.   It removes the Merit Systems Protection Board from the appeal process  for senior executives. There is some bad talk out there about removing  the Merit Systems Protection Board for all employees. It doesn't do  that at all. But the most senior employees of the Veterans'  Administration deserve to be held accountable without lots of hoops you  have to go through before ever getting to them. So by taking the Merit  Systems Protection Board away from those senior executives, you are  holding them totally accountable in the bright light of day for their  own actions, without some hoop to go through for the agency trying to  remove them.   It prohibits bonuses and relocation expenses for employees guilty of  wrongdoing. I mentioned this in my earlier remarks, and I will  reiterate. This deals with things like what happened in Pennsylvania,  where two employees were reassigned for a discipline, yet they were  given bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments in their pay upward for  doing something wrong. That sends exactly the wrong signal to any  employee in the Veterans' Administration.   For anyone doing a good job, it pats them on the back and lets them  know they can do an even better job.   It expedites the hiring of VA medical center directors, which is  absolutely critical. We have far too many people in the VA healthcare  system today who are acting. They are acting director or acting  assistant. We don't need any more ``acting'' in the Veterans'  Administration; we need performance.   That is what this bill ends up being about--the performance of  delivery of quality healthcare to our veterans, rewarding those  employees who are doing a good job, encouraging those who aren't to do  a better job, and seeing all American veterans get the services they  deserve to get.   The need for this bill does not come out of thin air. I say to  Senator Tester, can you tell me why the VA and veterans need this  legislation to strengthen accountability at the VA?    I thank Senator Tester.   I started my remarks a few minutes ago by saying that this will be  the 73rd anniversary of D-day. Nobody who charged Omaha Beach or  climbed those cliffs in Normandy had second thoughts about what they  were doing or asked questions about their leadership or tolerated  anything but the best they could out of themselves. Because of that,  they won.   Today, our veterans are winning. Our committee--the Senate is going  to pass in I think a unanimous or near-unanimous fashion a piece of  legislation that is a byproduct of a good bipartisan effort to see to  it that we correct the problems of the past, give the Secretary of the  VA the ability to do it in the future, and if he or she doesn't do it,  it gives us the ability to change them so they are held accountable as  well.   It has been a pleasure to work with you and a privilege to work for  our veterans.   On this special day, we honor those who served America 73 years ago  by the beginning of the end of World War II, thank them for their  service, and thank all veterans who provide service to the people of  the United States of America.   I want to end by noting that we have 32 sponsors of this legislation,  which is almost exactly one-third of the Senate, Republican and  Democrat alike. That sends the proper signal that this is the right  bill at the right time for the right people--veterans of the United  States of America.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Rubio, who has been a  steadfast leader on this issue for years.   People have heard the term ``years'' mentioned. It is plural. We have  worked on this thing for a long time. It started coming together last  year, but it fell apart at the last minute. Thanks to the Senator's  work and the work of the committee and the staffs on both committees  and the leadership on the Democratic side--Mr. Tester's and mine--we  found a way to do what, as I said in my opening remarks earlier--3  hours ago--is an act of Divine Providence. None of us really ever  planned that this bill would come to the floor on the 73rd anniversary  of the invasion of Normandy.   It was a great day in American history and world history when the  evil German empire--Adolf Hitler--was destroyed by the Allied Forces  and the United States of America. It is only appropriate that on the  anniversary of that date 73 years later, we say to those who have worn  the uniform and who wear the uniform, who represent us every day and  fight for us and ask nothing in return: We will see to it that you get  what you were promised in terms of healthcare and benefits, and we will  be sure you have a mechanism to hold it accountable in order to give  you the type of service as a veteran that you gave to us when you  fought for our country.   I will repeat what has been said by the others in thanking the staff  members who have worked so hard. This has not been an easy battle. It  has appeared easy because nobody has been down here, arguing. All of  the arguments are over. The veterans won. Doing the right thing won. It  all would not have happened had it not been for a lot of hard-working  staff.   I thank Jon Tester and his staff, on the Democratic side, for all of  their work on this. I want to particularly thank the Republican  staffers who worked countless, tireless hours in order to make this  take place: Staff Director Tom Bowman, Amanda Meredith, Adam Reece,  Gretchan Blum, Kristen Hines, Maureen O'Neill, Leslie Campbell, David  Shearman, Jillian Workman, Thomas Coleman, John Ashley, Mitchell  Sylvest, and Heather Vachon.   We could not have done what we did nor would we have been here today  without their help. Yet, as has always been true, we would not as a  country have been here today nor would we have ever existed had it not  been for the brave men and women who bore the battle--who fought the  battle--who defended our country and made sure we had the opportunity  to become what is now acknowledged around the world--the greatest  government on the face of this Earth.   On this day, the anniversary of the invasion of Normandy on D-day, we  are guaranteeing our veterans the type of service that they fought for  and deserve. God bless America, and God bless the veterans who proudly  serve America day in and day out in every uniform around the world.   In the absence of another speaker, I yield back the remaining time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall it pass?   The bill (S. 1094), as amended, was passed.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   The Senator from Rhode Island.                            ____________________
