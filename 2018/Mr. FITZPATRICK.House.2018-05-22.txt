 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize approximately  60 firefighters in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently graduated  from the national certification program. These brave men and women  satisfactorily completed the Firefighter One training program offered  by the Bucks County Public Safety Training Center.   I would like to commend these firefighters for the work they do to  protect and serve our community, selflessly putting their lives on the  line on a regular basis.   Recently, Firefighter Tim Pristatskiy of the Trevose Fire Company ran  into a burning house in Lower Southampton to look for victims. With the  compromised structure of the house, the second floor collapsed and Tim  fell through. Despite the odds, Tim suffered no injuries, thankfully,  and he is back serving on the force.   Mr. Speaker, it is crucial that we honor our firefighters, like Tim,  for the brave work they do in protecting the lives of our loved ones  and our own. We truly owe them a debt of gratitude.                                time  1030                            Recognizing Bob Duaime     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a resident of  [[Page H4291]]  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose dedication to service has been a  centerpiece of his life and his career.   Bob Duaime of Middletown Township will receive the Give Life Hero  Award from the American Red Cross later this month.   Since 1972, Bob has donated blood 360 times and, over the past  decade, has frequently donated the maximum amount of times permitted by  law annually.   A retired Council Rock High School teacher, Bob truly understands the  value of community and the importance of leading by example. He is the  cofounder and treasurer of Camp Discovery, a camp for child victims of  abuse, and he volunteers for the Bucks County Emergency Homeless  Shelter, the Churchville Nature Center, and Langhorne Open Space, Inc.   Mr. Speaker, it is impossible to summarize all of Bob's contributions  to our community in this speech here today. I applaud Bob for his good  works and encourage my constituents to follow his lead.      Recognizing the Muslim Community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Muslim  community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, who are currently observing  Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic faith. I wish them peace and  renewal as they take on the virtues of charity and sacrifice.   In this spirit, I would like to honor an organization in our  community that seeks to provide cultural understanding between women in  the Islamic and Jewish faiths.   The Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a national organization, recently  established a chapter in Bucks County. Founded by Aliya Murad of  Yardley, this chapter seeks to bridge the gap between young women of  separate creeds who are both devoted to their community and to their  faith.   Despite still being in high school, Aliya has already made a lasting  difference in our community, and I call on all of my constituents to  follow her lead. I thank her for her advocacy of compassion and  understanding.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is long overdue; long, long  overdue. I want to thank Leader McCarthy, Chairman Walden, Dr. Burgess,  Mr. Griffith, my friend and colleague,  Andy Biggs, Senator Ron  Johnson, and all of the advocates who have had a relentless fight to  see right to try debated, passed, and signed into law once and for all.   And I want to thank the overwhelming bipartisan majority of my  colleagues here in the House who we had to work on, many of them, back  in March, who supported the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan  McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act and proved emphatically  that right to try is about more than politics. It is about hope.   For those patients caught in between traditional drug delay  approvals, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and  limited time, the Right to Try Act.   Simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try  therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them the  option of saving their life.   Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the Wendler, Bellina, Mongiello,  McLinn families, all who are here with us in this Chamber today to see  history be made.   Although the FDA has a program that allows terminal patients to apply  for early access to promising treatments, the Right to Try Act is  needed because the FDA's compassionate use process does not help enough  people.   While 99 percent of expanded access applications are approved, the  application process is complicated, it is time consuming, and it is  expensive.   Moreover, only about 1,200 people a year can make it through the  application process. By contrast, Mr. Speaker, in 2014, more than  12,000 people in France were using investigational treatments through  that government's equivalent program.   How is it, pray tell, that a country one-fifth the size of the United  States can help 900 percent more people? The FDA program clearly is not  working.   Mr. Speaker, the Right to Try Act gives people hope. And let me be  clear: This bill requires robust informed consent between the patient,  the doctor, and the manufacturer, while requiring notification be given  to the FDA after an unapproved drug becomes available to an eligible  patient, and requiring doctors and the manufacturers to report adverse  events.    Mr. Speaker, when life hangs in the balance, the  Federal Government must not stand in the way of this process. We have  to get this done once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, today, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  appeal to the better angels of your nature. All the groups that they  say are opposed to this bill, I will tell you who is in favor of this  bill: Over 80 percent of the American people, and they are the ones who  have the power in this country, and they are the ones we have to listen  to.
