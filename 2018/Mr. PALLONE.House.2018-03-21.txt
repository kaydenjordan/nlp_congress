 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to H.R. 5247,  the Right to Try Act of 2018.   This legislation, introduced only last week, is an egregious attempt,  in my opinion, by the Goldwater Institute to undermine the gold  standard drug approval process at the Food and Drug Administration.   The supporters of this bill claim to be helping desperate patients  who are looking for hope.   If this is such a patient-centered bill, then why does every major  patient organization overwhelmingly oppose it?   More than 100 patient organizations, including the National  Organization for Rare Disorders, the Friends of Cancer Research, and  the American Cancer Society have all written in opposition to this  legislation.   In a letter to congressional leadership, these 103 patient  organizations noted ``that the alternative pathway in the latest  version of this legislation is still less safe for our patients than  the current expanded access process under the FDA.''   It is not only the patient organizations that are voicing concerns.  Four former FDA Commissioners--Drs. Hamburg and Califf, who served  under the Obama administration; and Drs. McClellan and Andrew von  Eschenbach, who served under the Bush administration--also oppose this  legislation. That is two former Republican Commissioners and two former  Democratic Commissioners who are opposed to both the House bill and the  Senate bill on this same issue.   These four Commissioners explained their opposition by saying:  ``There is no evidence that either bill would meaningfully improve  access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and  create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for  vulnerable patients.''   Mr. Speaker, I think most importantly, I would stress that this  legislation is simply not needed. There is already a successful program  in place today at the FDA in which seriously ill patients and their  doctors can request access to an experimental treatment from a  manufacturer. This application process, which takes as little as 45  minutes for a physician to complete, has been overwhelmingly  successful.   Last summer, a review by the Government Accountability Office found  that the FDA approves 99 percent of the requests submitted to the  agency. In fact, of the nearly 1,700 requests the FDA received last  year, only 9 were not approved.   Physicians and patients also receive approval quickly. Emergency  requests are often granted immediately over the phone and, on average,  receive a response within 4 days.   While the FDA approves 99 percent of the treatments it reviews  through this expanded access process, as it is called, it also adjusts  applications for 11 percent of the patients to improve patient safety  protections.   In order to protect patients, this review, in my opinion, should  continue. We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous  treatments that might make their lives worse. Just imagine the health  consequences to patients if these 11 percent of applicants had not been  adjusted.   This is the very reason that the FDA must be involved in the process.  If you eliminate FDA review, as this bill does, you are putting  patients at risk.   I want to talk a little bit about the fact that many States now have  right-to-try statutes. I fear that some Members--and I heard this last  week when the bill was on the suspension list--might support this  legislation under the false belief that the State right-to-try laws in  their States have provided help to patients. But nothing could be  further from the truth.   One example supporters of this legislation like to bring up is Dr.  Delpassand from Texas, who claims to have treated patients under the  State right to try.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Mr. Andrew  McFadyen of The Isaac Foundation, who dispels this myth.                                           The Isaac Foundation,                                                     March 20, 2018.      Rep. Greg Walden, Chair,      Rep. Frank Pallone, Ranking Member,      Energy & Commerce Committee.        Dear Mr. Pallone and Mr. Walden: I am writing to you       regarding your upcoming debate on HR 5247, the Right to Try       initiative fronted by the Goldwater Institute. I am the       Executive Director of The Isaac Foundation, an organization       that is dedicated to providing advocacy and support to       patients dealing with a wide range of disorders and needing       access to rare disease treatments. Our work pushes       international boundaries, with the bulk of our efforts taking       place in Canada and the United States. I am also a member of       the NYU Working Group on Compassionate Use and Pre-Approval       Access where we are making a concerted effort to improve and       address the issues around access to experimental medications,       and I'm involved with a non-profit called GE2P2.        I'm proud to say at The Isaac Foundation that we've never       been unsuccessful gaining access to life-saving medications       and treatments for patients in Canada, and our work directly       with pharmaceutical companies is helping countless patients       see similar results in the United States. We have had success       by being collaborative partners with industry, regulatory       authorities, and patients in need.        I watched the discussion last week with growing       consternation that many of our elected officials have not       taken the opportunity to fact-check claims being made by RTT       proponents. Most notably, continued mention of Right to Try       being used by Dr.  [[Page H1741]]       Delpassand out of Texas is both egregiously wrong and,       indeed, is the perfect example of why RTT should not be       passed by lawmakers.        In October 2016, I testified during Senator Ron Johnson's       hearing on Right to Try, at which Johnson introduced and       played a video created by the Goldwater Institute of Dr.       Delpassand. During that 3-minute video, Dr. Delpassand       explained that he was using the state RTT law to treat his       patients because the FDA would not allow him to do it through       an Expanded Access Program. Senator Johnson asked me what I       thought about this video--which included few facts, no       context, and was edited by the people fronting the RTT push       themselves. I explained that there must be a reason why Dr.       Delpassand was in the 1% of cases not allowed by the FDA and       vowed I would investigate.        In March of 2017, I received a set of documents from the       FDA under a FOIA request. They show that Dr. Delpassand's       clinic failed inspections during the clinical trial of       Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate). Specifically, he failed       inspection due to 3 key and very important reasons:        1. Enrolling subjects into the study during a partial       clinical hold, issued by the Agency.        2. Underreporting of Adverse Events.        3. 1572-protocol noncompliance.        The failed inspections were discovered after complaint from       the CDER Good Clinical Practice Compliance Oversight Branch,       Division of Good Clinical Practice Compliance Evaluation,       Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI). A ``Clinical       Hold'' was placed on the lab and Dr. Delpassand. During a       clinical hold, subjects may not be given an investigational       drug. Dr. Delpassand and his clinic disregarded this clinical       hold and enrolled 6 patients.        Additionally, and just as concerning in terms of patient       safety, Dr. Delpassand's clinic failed to promptly report       significant new adverse events or risks to the FDA. This       failure to report was noted numerous times during the       inspection. The inspection also found numerous other areas of       concern. I have attached the full report for your       consideration.        After these inspections, the FDA would not allow Dr.       Delpassand to open an EAP at his clinic for patients in need,       and rightly so. They FDA did, however, allow 42 different       locations the ability to provide this drug for patients       requiring access, including two sites in Texas. A quick       search on ClinicialTrials.gov shows this information, further       proving that the FDA has been able to provide patients the       required access they need, ensuring the environment that they       are receiving the drug they need is safe.        My understanding of the situation is that the company       running the clinical trial distanced themselves from Dr.       Delpassand after these failed inspections. Without company       support, and without the FDA's permission to open an EAP, Dr.       Delpassand had to use the state legislation to provide drug       to his patients. Questions remain, however, such as how Dr.       Delpassand paid for the product he was giving his patients,       did patients themselves have to pay for that drug supply       (which isn't allowed under the Texas RTT law) and who, if       anyone, was overseeing the program to ensure safety of the       patients, especially after multiple infractions were seen       during the failed FDA inspection.        Most important, it should be noted that the FDA process       here worked exactly how it is supposed to. A lab was       inspected for safety to ensure patients are looked after in       the appropriate fashion. That inspection placed a hold on       further treating of patients due to numerous infractions. The       FDA worked with the company to ensure access for patients       across the USA in 42 different sites, helping to monitor       adverse events while also allowing the product to advance to       approval. That product was approved by the FDA in January       2018.        Also importantly, RTT was used because it was the only way       for Dr. Delpassand to treat patients in his clinic after it       failed inspection. RTT is a loophole designed to allow people       who cannot otherwise follow safety rules set forth by the FDA       that are meant to protect vulnerable patients. It's not being       used--anywhere--to provide patients with hope or access to       life-saving drugs.        One final note, and one that I've not see mentioned       anywhere. HR 5247 includes the name of a young child--a brave       child battling Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy--named Jordan       McLinn. Jordan has been photographed numerous times with Vice       President Pence, and is often used as an example of why Right       to Try is needed. The problem with these optics is that       Jordan has never received any treatment under Right to Try,       even though Right to Try has been available in his state of       Indiana for 3 years. He already has access to the life-saving       treatment he needs--through an FDA approved clinical trial.       He's doing well on that trial drug, as I understand it, and       receives all the benefits of FDA oversite to ensure his       safety on that trial. In essence, the child used to promote       RTT is the perfect example of why the FDA process works and       is needed.        The true reality is that the landscape for access to       medications for dying patients does not change tomorrow if a       Federal Right to Try law is passed today. Very clearly, those       patients in dire need of help today will wake up tomorrow       needing access to the same life-saving treatments, and feel       the same despair because they will not be getting the access       they need through Right to Try.        The barrier to that access here isn't the FDA, and no Right       to Try law enacted by lawmakers in this country is going to       remove the true barrier--pharmaceutical companies. The       gatekeepers to these medications are the pharmaceutical       companies themselves, and we need to be working       collaboratively as a team--Industry, Government, physicians,       and Patients--to craft solutions that will work for everyone,       keeping in mind that we are all on the same side, that we all       want the same thing--broad and expeditious access to life-      saving medications for patients in need.        I understand how difficult this is for patients--I see it       every day, and I feel it every night as I check in on my son       (who is battling his own devastating and very rare disease)       to make sure he is still breathing, to make sure he is still       with us. But I also understand that the change we all need       will not come with Right to Try. It will come through       collaboration with all stakeholders and by providing       companies the safety and assurances they need to make their       medications available to our dying patients.        Lawmakers should be spending their time helping make that       collaboration happen because that is how we are going to save       our dying patients. They should not spin their wheels passing       legislation like Right to Try that looks good, and feels       good, but will do nothing for those in need. If they do, they       are doing a disservice to a large and very vulnerable group       of patients now and in the future, my own son, my own hero       Isaac, included.        Thank you for your time on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                   Andrew McFadyen,                          Executive Director, The Isaac Foundation.     Andrew McFadyen said:         Dr. Delpassand claims to have used right to try because FDA       would not allow him to do expanded access. And this was for a       very good reason. FDA placed a clinical hold on a study, due       to the fact that his clinic was not reporting serious,       adverse events, as required; and he continued to enroll       patients, despite the clinic hold.        The work of Dr. Delpassand's study was associated with 40       deaths and 2 hospitalizations. FDA's clinical hold on Dr.       Delpassand's work is a sign to me that FDA's expanded access       pathway was working to prevent bad actors from continuing to       expose vulnerable patients to experimental treatments.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5247 is dangerous for our patients. It is an  unprecedented attempt to roll back the FDA's oversight of  investigational treatments. I urge my colleagues to stand with more  than 100 organizations that have come forward to oppose this misguided  and, I believe, harmful legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who is the ranking member  for the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to explain some other reasons why I am very  opposed to this bill. I am concerned that H.R. 5247 essentially does  nothing to address what may be the true barrier to expanded access, and  that is the determination by the manufacturer as to whether or not they  will provide access to their product that is under development. And I  want to stress, there is nothing in this legislation before us today  that would compel a manufacturer to grant access upon request.   Further, I believe that trusted manufacturers like J&J, or Johnson &  Johnson, which is headquartered in my district, have already said that  any compassionate use request must be subject to FDA review. Now, I  have heard my colleagues refer to this as a Hail Mary pass for the  terminally ill. I think, in reality, it is offering false hope of a  cure to patients and their families when there is no guarantee that any  patient will receive access to treatment from a manufacturer.   In fact, H.R. 5247 sets an extremely low threshold for the types of  experimental treatments that may be available through this alternative  pathway by allowing patients access to investigational treatments that  have only completed a phase 1 clinical trial. Patients will be exposed  to treatments with no or relatively little data that they are actually  effective. These extremely small trials only examine the safety and  toxicity of a drug and do not determine the effectiveness or potential  side effects. Access at this phase 1 stage in the development could  expose patients to untested products and further harm and result in  delaying access to a treatment that may be more appropriate and more  beneficial for their underlying disease or condition.   Only 1 in 10 products move on from phase 1 clinical trials to FDA  approval. Mr. Speaker, the bill does not make any adverse-event  reporting to the FDA immediate. It also limits FDA's ability to use  clinical outcomes associated with the use of an investigational product  when reviewing a product for approval if it could adversely impact its  review. It also prevents any entity from being held liable for use of  the treatment.   Again, these are some of the many reasons that more than 100  organizations oppose this dangerous bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the ranking member of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of misinformation spread by  supporters of this legislation that FDA is a barrier to patients  receiving access to these investigational treatments, and I want to be  very clear that that is simply not the case.   FDA's expanded access program approves nearly all requests for  investigational drugs or biologics it receives. For the past 5 years,  FDA's approval rate for expanded access requests has been over 99  percent. In fiscal year 2017, as I previously mentioned, only nine  individual requests were denied.   FDA also conducts its review quickly. FDA physicians are available 24  hours a day to approve any emergency expanded access requests the  agency receives, typically granting emergency requests immediately,  over the phone, and nonemergency requests in a median time of 4 days  and, generally, no longer than 30 days.   FDA has also taken actions to streamline the expanded access request  process for physicians to make it less burdensome. I think that was  mentioned by Mr. Walden, the chairman.   Pharmaceutical companies can choose to deny a patient access to an  experimental treatment because, for example, there is not enough of the  drug available or they are concerned about dangerous side effects. The  fact is, when a patient is denied access to an experimental treatment,  it is because the company has said no, not the FDA.   So let's be clear as to what this legislation is. It is an attempt to  undermine the authority of the expert public health agency charged with  reviewing drugs to ensure their safety and efficacy.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this grab at FDA's authority.  That is really what this legislation is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I said before that I have found that some Members were  looking to vote for this bill because they said: Well, we have the  right to try in our State by State statute, so what is the difference  if we do it on the Federal level?   I just want to stress again that the State right-to-try laws do not  give patients a right to try effectively and have done little to expand  access to investigational treatments.   There are 37 States and the District of Columbia that have enacted  right-to-try laws, and there is no evidence that anyone has obtained an  investigational treatment via these laws that couldn't have been  obtained through FDA's expanded access program.   Right-to-try laws do not compel companies to provide patients access  to investigational treatments; therefore, under these State laws,  patients still do not have a right to try, only the  [[Page H1746]]  right to request the treatment from the company.   State right-to-try laws do not address the fundamental barriers of  cost and company restrictions. Neither the FDA nor States require  insurers or pharmaceutical companies to cover the cost or reduce the  costs of these often expensive treatments. Instead, these laws put  patients at higher risk by prohibiting or weakening FDA's oversight of  investigational treatments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains and  whether the gentleman has additional speakers on his side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to stress that, as I said before, we have  the four previous FDA Commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans  appointed by President Bush, who have raised serious concerns about  this legislation because it excludes FDA review and they think could  pose serious risks to vulnerable patients.   I just wanted to read, once again, a statement that they made jointly  to The Washington Post, where they said: ``There is no evidence that  either bill would meaningfully improve access for patients, but both  would remove the FDA from the process and create a dangerous precedent  that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.''   Mr. Speaker, I just want to stress to my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle that my concern is that no one is actually going to be able  to get an experimental drug by this bill. In other words, if you are a  manufacturer that actually has done something and come up with an  experimental drug that you believe will make a difference to someone  who is terminally ill, you are likely going to want to go through the  FDA expanded access process because then there is a seal of approval  that the FDA has actually looked at this and said that it is relatively  safe to use.   So my real fear is that the only thing this is going to do is open up  to the possibility of some charlatan, fly-by-night snake oil drug  company or manufacturer who is going to make all kinds of claims that  have not been reviewed by the FDA for any kind of safety, and that then  people may say: Okay. Well, I will take that because I am terminally  ill and I might as well try something.   But that isn't really what we should be doing here. We should be  providing a process, as the FDA does right now, where, if someone is  terminally ill and they want to try something, they at least have some  certification of approval by the FDA that this is something that may  help them, that may make a difference, and that, in the case of about  11 percent of the cases where the application is made to the FDA, some  changes are made to make sure that even though there is a certain level  of risk, that that level of risk is reduced by the FDA putting on  additional safety precautions.   So my real concern here is I don't want people to vote for this  legislation thinking that somehow it is going to make a difference. I  really don't believe that is true. Otherwise, I wouldn't urge the  opposition that I am. But for all these reasons, I do urge strong  opposition to this bill and ask that my colleagues vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed to the bill in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is an amendment to the bill, or the  final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it  back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to  final passage, as amended. And this amendment would offer a more  targeted approach to improving the FDA's current expanded access  program.   In October, the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the  widely opposed Senate right-to-try legislation. At that hearing, we  heard concerns from FDA Commissioner Gottlieb and also from  manufacturers, academic experts, and patient groups that S. 204 was  legislation that would expose broad numbers of patients to harm, and  sought to hamstrung the FDA's ability to oversee or engage in any  meaningful way on the use of investigational treatments.   Since that time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  drafted new legislation that maintains, in my opinion, the same harmful  approach prohibiting FDA review of experimental treatments. The FDA is  part of the process for a reason. It protects patients from potentially  bad actors or from experimental treatments that might do more harm than  good.   So my motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, abandons this harmful attempt  to undermine the FDA's expanded access pathway and, instead, seeks to  make two improvements that have been identified as meaningful by both  manufacturers and patient groups.   This proposal will also not be any surprise to Chairman Walden or  Chairman Burgess because it was the bipartisan proposal our staffs were  negotiating prior to the introduction of the current Republican bill.   So I want to stress that, unlike the current bill, H.R. 5247, this  proposal is not based on the false premise that FDA approval is a  barrier to accessing investigational treatments. Rather, it addresses  the two key problems identified by expert witnesses at our hearing: how  the FDA will utilize clinical outcomes of investigational treatments  and liability protection.   To that end, under this motion to recommit, the FDA is directed to  issue guidance to manufacturers specifically on how and when the FDA  will consider clinical outcomes, and when a sponsor may request the  consideration of such outcomes when it comes time to submit an  application for approval for the investigational treatment.   This will provide manufacturers with the clarity they are seeking  regarding  [[Page H1748]]  how allowing patients access to drugs that are still under development  may impact their ability to gain full FDA approval. It will also ensure  that there is a public process for such guidance, ensuring that  stakeholders will have the opportunity to offer their views on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit also provides liability  protection to manufacturers, physicians, clinical investigators, and  hospitals, if they are in compliance with the current law and  regulations for expanded access. If you are a manufacturer, a  physician, or a hospital that is in compliance with current rules and  requirements related to expanded access, you will receive protection  for allowing access to the investigational treatment.   Finally, it also provides transparency around the number of expanded  access requests the FDA receives and grants, how many requests a  manufacturer receives and grants, and if there are any serious adverse  events. This transparency, I believe, will provide clear data as to how  many patients are making expanded access requests and how often these  requests are granted or denied by the FDA and manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that these legislative fixes will go a long  way to bolstering the existing successful expanded access pathway,  while maintaining the critical review and oversight of the agency  charged with protecting our public health, that being the FDA.   I just want to say that, last fall, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb  testified on right-to-try efforts and told our committee: ``There is a  perception that certain products that aren't being offered under FDA  expanded access will be offered under right-to-try, and I don't see  that.''   That is our current Commissioner Gottlieb, who I respect a great  deal.   Rather than creating an unnecessary alternative pathway that  threatens our drug approval process and our clinical trial program, I  would urge my colleagues to join with Democrats and 103 patient  organizations in supporting the current expanded access program.   These targeted improvements under the motion to recommit to the  existing program are, I think, a way to achieve a better goal. So I  urge my colleagues to support my motion to recommit and oppose this,  what I consider, dangerous Republican proposal in the bill before us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
