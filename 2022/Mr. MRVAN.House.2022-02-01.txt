 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound  appreciation that the House is expected to consider this week H.R.  4521, the America COMPETES Act of 2022.   Indiana's First Congressional District is home to an incredible  manufacturing, steel, and industrial workforce. These workers can  compete with anyone in the world. When they are provided with a level  playing field, they can thrive in our global economy.   I am pleased that the America COMPETES Act will take historic strides  to defend the American worker, our manufacturing base, and grow our  economy.   Together we can take action in this legislation to address supply  chain vulnerabilities, increase the production of American-made  semiconductors, and improve our ability to defend against illegally  traded goods.   I commend all the leaders for advancing this legislation, and I look  forward to its prompt consideration on the House floor.                            ____________________
