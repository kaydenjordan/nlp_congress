 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard people say that this bill gives folks a  false hope. There is no false hope.   They know it is a Hail Mary pass. They know it is unlikely to  succeed, but they are willing to make the decision and the choice to  take that chance.   I have heard that patients will be at risk, that they lose their  safeguards. They have received a terminal diagnosis. They know they are  at risk. They don't care about safeguards. They want to fight for life.  They know they have that terminal disease or diagnosis and they may  lose a few weeks, as we heard from my colleague, but they may gain  years, and they are willing to take that risk.  [[Page H1526]]    Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you, if I had a terminal diagnosis, I  would even consider injecting monkey urine if I thought it would give  me a few more months or a few more years with my children, who are  currently 18, 12, and 10. Others may choose not to try something. They  may not want the right to try. They may not want to try the Hail Mary  pass, but they should have the choice. They should have the right to  try.
