 Mr. Speaker, every day, more and more families are  struggling to find the basic goods they need to run their lives. This  latest shortage, 40 percent of all baby formula out of stock,  highlights exactly how out of control this crisis has become.   Orange County families are no stranger to the pressures of our broken  supply chain. For months, we have been under the strain that millions  of Americans are now experiencing.   I have been calling on this administration, as well as Governor  Newsom, to ease the restrictions that are further burdening our already  crippled supply chains.   From removing unworkable regulatory standards impacting the trucking  industry, to embracing American energy independence, there are concrete  steps that the Governor and President can take to address this crisis.   They should do so immediately to provide relief to southern  Californians and all Americans.                            ____________________
