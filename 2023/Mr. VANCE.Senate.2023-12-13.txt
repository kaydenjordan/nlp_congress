 Madam President, reserving the right to object and with  respect to my colleague from Illinois, my argument here is very simple,  and it is this: The Department of Justice, under Joe Biden and under  Merrick Garland's leadership, has become a weapon for political  intimidation as opposed to an instrument to prosecute justice in this  country.   My colleague from Illinois says that Donald Trump has asked me to do  this. He, of course, has no evidence for this fact, and I have never  had a conversation with President Trump to this effect.   What I have said publicly and privately and to anyone who will listen  is that the Department of Justice should be about justice and not about  politics.   This hold policy, which covers two nominees right now and maybe a  third coming up to the Department of Justice, is simply to say that  this cannot go on. We are a republic, not a banana republic. So long as  Merrick Garland prosecutes not just Donald Trump but any number of  political opponents--from Catholic fathers of seven to parents  protesting peacefully at their school board meetings--so long as the  Department of Justice focuses on citizens exercising their rights  rather than criminals who are violating the rights of others, I will  continue to object, and I do object.
