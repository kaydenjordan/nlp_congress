 Mr. Speaker, last week, House Republicans sadly  displayed their incoherent and chaotic approach toward governing in  this country.   But when it comes to ripping away the reproductive rights and  freedoms of women across the country, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have never been more united.   Despite the many immediate challenges facing our country, their  priority was to criminalize abortion care and to put the health of  women at risk.   The party that claims they want government out of our lives could not  move more quickly to put the government and politicians in charge of  one of the most personal decisions a woman can ever make.   Listening to my colleagues pontificate about the sanctity of life  while attempting to take away life-saving healthcare for millions of  women is appalling.   I am proud to stand with House Democrats to continue to fight for  reproductive freedom and reproductive justice and the right to abortion  across the United States.                            ____________________
