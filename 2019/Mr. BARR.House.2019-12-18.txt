 Madam Speaker, don't be fooled. Democrats are not  impeaching the President to protect national security.   Democrats are impeaching the President for following a law that they  themselves voted for.   No less than five times in the last 6 years, bipartisan Congresses  imposed on the executive branch an affirmative duty to ensure that the  Government of Ukraine was countering corruption.   And for good reason: Ukraine is the third-most corrupt nation on  Earth.   So the President not only had the legal authority to temporarily  pause security assistance to Ukraine, he had a mandate from Congress to  do it.   As a result, President Zelensky's government made historic  anticorruption reforms, making Ukraine a more reliable ally, countering  Russian aggression.   Far from compromising national security, the President's actions  advanced national security.   Oppose this impeachment.
