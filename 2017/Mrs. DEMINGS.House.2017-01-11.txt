 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed to the bill in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, throughout my 27 years of law enforcement experience, I  protected and served my community, and I stand here today to protect  the most vulnerable of seniors in central Florida, and seniors all  around this Nation.   We have a responsibility to see that seniors are not put in a  position where they will have to choose between buying food or buying  their medication, which was the case before the Affordable Care Act. We  must resist all efforts to reopen the Medicare part D prescription drug  coverage doughnut hole. This doughnut hole required seniors to pay full  price for their prescription drugs after they reach their catastrophic  threshold.   Research found, because of this doughnut hole, seniors would put  their health at risk because they could not afford to pay the  prescriptions, which ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, this doughnut hole is being  completely phased out of the Medicare part D prescription drug program  by the year 2020.   Since the ACA passed in 2010, closing the doughnut hole has saved our  seniors more than $23.5 billion on their prescription drugs. We know  this is working. Florida seniors enrolled in the program are now saving  an average of $987 a year because of closing the loophole.                                time  1830    We know what $987 means to the average senior on Medicare. We also  know that if these coverage gap discounts disappeared, part D enrollees  would have to pay $3,725 for the time period they are in the doughnut  hole. This $3,725 represents nearly 15 percent of a Medicare enrollee's  income.   With too many Floridians and seniors across the Nation struggling to  make ends meet, I strongly believe that Congress can do more to make  sure we do not go backwards and reopen this doughnut hole. No one  should ever have to choose between food or medicine.   I urge my colleagues to consider the livelihood and dignity of our  most vulnerable seniors and vote for my amendment to protect access to  affordable prescription drugs for older Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
