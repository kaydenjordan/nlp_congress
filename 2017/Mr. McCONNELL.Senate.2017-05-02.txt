 Mr. President, yesterday, after months of committee  work and bicameral negotiations, the government funding agreement that  abides by the spending caps set in the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015  was filed over in the House. This legislation will promote a number of  American and conservative priorities.   It will help to strengthen the border with the largest border  security funding increase in a decade.   It will help to strengthen the military with funding for a pay raise  for our troops, along with a critically needed downpayment on the long  overdue task of rebuilding our military.   It will help to streamline the Federal bureaucracy with the  elimination or consolidation of more than 150 government programs and  initiatives.   It contains many other conservative wins, too, like freezing funding  for the IRS, cutting funding for the EPA, prohibiting funding for  President Obama's climate slush fund, and prohibiting a taxpayer  bailout of ObamaCare's risk corridors. It maintains the Hyde Amendment,  will help veterans, and will fund implementation of the law that shifts  control of education back to parents, States, and local school  districts.   Additionally, this legislation will provide more of the resources we  need to help communities across our country that continue to suffer  from the opioid epidemic. It also permanently extends healthcare for  thousands of retired coal miners from States like Kentucky--something  for which I have fought for a long time and something I was proud to  secure in this bill, as we put together the final package.   Each of these measures is included in the funding bill we will take  up later this week.   I wish to commend President Trump and his team, including Director  Mulvaney, Secretary Mattis, and Secretary Kelly, for quickly  identifying national security priorities and working with the  Republican Congress to enact some of them. Secretary Mattis has made  clear that rebuilding our military and restoring combat readiness for  today and tomorrow will require a multiyear, bipartisan commitment to  meet the needs of the force. The additional contingency operations  funding provided in this legislation represents an important first step  toward meeting that goal.   While this funding bill is the product of bipartisan negotiations, it  delivers some important conservative wins, including critical steps  forward on defense and border security. Senators should continue  reviewing the bill text now so that we can pass it without delay after  we receive it from the House.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter, Senators voted  on a bipartisan basis yesterday to advance Jay Clayton's nomination to  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and soon we will take  another vote to confirm him.   As Chairman Crapo noted at Clayton's confirmation hearing, this  nominee has an impressive background. His extensive work in the private  sector will serve him well as he looks to strengthen our financial  markets, thereby supporting American businesses, boosting job creation,  and spurring economic growth. I appreciate Mr. Clayton's willingness to  take on this important task, as well as his vision, which he outlined  at his hearing, to promote fair and transparent practices at the SEC.   I look forward to his confirmation and to his leadership at this  agency.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 40, H.R. 274.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 41, H.R. 366.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendments be considered and agreed to, the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of and the Senate now proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 137.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 149, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, May 3; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we  expect to have a rollcall vote on the motion to proceed to H.J. Res.  66, the States' savings CRA resolution of disapproval, between 10:30  and 11 a.m. tomorrow morning.                            ____________________     If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:59 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, May 3, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
