 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 84, a bill that  would allow for General James Mattis to be considered for an  appointment as the 26th Secretary of Defense of the United States.   Leading up to this vote, I have heard time and time again from my  colleagues that they respect General Mattis' service to our country. I  have also heard that they understand him to be an intelligent, capable  leader. Some have even gone so far as to say he is a military hero. I  don't doubt the sincerity of my colleagues' words. In fact, I echo  them.   But for some of my colleagues, this praise for General Mattis is  followed by what I believe is a flawed line of thinking. I have heard  the argument that this vote we have before us today is not about  General Mattis.   My friends, today's vote is clearly about General Mattis. Make no  mistake, a ``yes'' vote today will not permanently change the  requirements prohibiting the appointment of anyone inside of 7 years of  Active Duty service.                                time  1415    This vote will provide a one-time-only exception for General Mattis,  a man of the utmost character.   The original intent of this law was to prevent an Active-Duty  servicemember from retiring and then becoming Secretary of Defense  within the same Presidential administration. With President-elect Trump  raising his right hand in 7 days, it is clear that General Mattis does  not violate the law's original intent. The fact that we are here to  deliberate this issue only proves that the nomination and appointment  process works.   I am encouraged that we are having this debate today. But at the end  of the day, we should not deny the best candidate to become the  Secretary of Defense.   A vote of ``no'' is a vote against General James Mattis. I urge my  fellow colleagues to join me in voting in favor of an exception for an  exceptional American, General James Mattis.   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This is not a vote against General Mattis. I think I made that very,  very clear. I think it is very important that  [[Page H524]]  the House have the opportunity to hear from him, as we said we were  going to do.   Now, yes, he has appeared before the Senate. But, as all of us on the  Armed Services Committee know, after the transition is over and the new  Secretary of Defense is in place, one of the first things they do is  come up and report the budget to us. The Secretary of Defense and the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs will come up. They go to the  Senate, too.   Are we just going to say we can watch the television? Why does he  need to go to both places? Why would we bother to have him come all the  way over to the House and have our members have the opportunity to ask  him questions? I don't want to set that precedent.   So, as passionate as the previous speaker was, please understand--and  I have expressed this directly to General Mattis--this is not a vote  against General Mattis. In fact, I have said: if we have the  opportunity to do our job as the House Armed Services Committee, if we  simply do not roll over for the transition team, we would be more than  happy to support General Mattis in a bipartisan way. We have plenty of  time to do this right, instead of doing it in the rushed way that  disregards the power and importance of the House Armed Services  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
