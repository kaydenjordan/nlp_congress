 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewomen from Wisconsin and  California for their wise words and for invoking the angels that we  lost in Florida as well.   In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to recognize Carmen  Carrasquillo.   Carmen is a graduate of New York's Baruch Community College and  earned a business management certification from Columbia University.  She worked as the administrator of the Boriken Health Center for the  indigent community in East Harlem, New York.   Since joining the council in 1992 as the senior center coordinator,  Carmen has worked with residents and leaders to initiate and sustain  programs serving seniors and disabled adults. These have earned the  Osceola Council on Aging Senior Center numerous awards for maintaining  the independence and dignity of our constituents, including Outstanding  Senior Center in the State of Florida.   Her background as a bilingual teacher led to the first English  classes for Spanish-speaking adults in Osceola County. This also led  her to become a founding member of BRAVO, a nonprofit organization that  provided necessary information and referrals to a newly emigrating  Hispanic population in Osceola County. Carmen was also named Woman of  the Year in 1994.   Carmen assisted the Council on Aging with the opening of the first  Hispanic site, Centro Latino Americano Edad de Oro, in the Buena  Ventura Lakes Community Center, also known as the Roberto Guevara  Community Center.   She was also one of the founders of the Senior Follies with the  Osceola Center for the Arts, partnered with Southwest Airlines on a  Home for the Holidays program, organized volunteer activities for AARP  Community Care Days, organized Hispanic outreach for the South Florida  Water Management District, started an intergenerational program with  New Beginnings Educational Complex that partners at-risk high school  students with seniors in various social activities, operating the  Federal Emergency Food Assistance program and local food bank that  supplies commodities to the poor and area organizations feeding the  poor in Osceola County, and was appointed to the Florida Department of  Agriculture TEFAP Advisory Board by Charles Bronson, our former ag  commissioner.   For that, Ms. Carmen Carrasquillo, we honor you.                        Honoring Deborah Guerrera Gale     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I would  like to honor Deborah Guerrera Gale.

After retirement, Deborah turned her attention full-time to civic  activism and founded the Democrats of St. Cloud Club and was elected as  chair of the Osceola County Democratic Party in 2019.   Deborah's belief that she can make a difference has fueled her  passion to advance causes that can make our community and our county a  better place for the next generation.   Deborah lives in St. Cloud with her husband, Michael Womick. They  have one daughter, Jenna Womick Stowers, and a grandson, Treston James.   For that, Deborah Guerrera Gale, we honor you.                        Honoring Giorgina Pinedo-Rolon     In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to  recognize Dr. Giorgina Pinedo-Rolon.

Honoring Ernestine Mason Davis     In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to  recognize Ernestine Mason Davis.   Ernestine Mason Davis grew up in the Florence Villa community and  attended Jewett High School. She is a member of the First Missionary  Baptist Church.   She is a founding member and a board member of the Lake Maude  Recreation Center, now known as the Neighborhood Service Center.

Honoring Maria Ramos     In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to  recognize Maria Ramos.   Maria Ramos Joiner was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. At the age of 3,  her father decided to move the family to the Bronx in New York in  search of the American Dream.   The New York public school system gave her the opportunity to attend  field trips to museums and cultural art centers, sparking her love for  the arts with her first visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.   Influenced by her mother's old Bible, with its beautiful  illustrations and stories, Maria's passion for artistic expression  further grew. The oldest of six, she collected brown paper bags as her  canvases and confiscated every pen, pencil, or crayon that was  unattended for her pretend studio.   Mostly self-taught, Maria's work has been shown in galleries and  museums. Maria has also donated work for fundraisers to raise money for  various causes.   One of the most important works she has exhibited was at the Mennello  Museum, honoring the Pulse nightclub victims in 2016. After its  exhibition initially, Maria graciously donated the piece to the city of  Orlando.   Maria has also been recognized for her art depicting the culture of  Puerto Rico, with an influence from the European masters she studied.   Maria is an advocate for the homeless and is known for her charitable  work throughout the years, whether through her art donations or when  someone is in need.   For that, Maria Ramos, we honor you.                       Honoring Colonel Paulette Schank     In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to  recognize Colonel Paulette Schank.   Colonel Paulette Schank began her outstanding career as a licensed  practical nurse out of high school, eventually achieving her master's  degree in nursing in pursuit of a career in patient care.   After gaining clinical experience, and speaking to several registered  nurses in the anesthesia field, she decided her desire for further  autonomy and utilization of critical thinking skills was perfectly  matched to a career in the anesthesia profession.   Upon successful completion of a post-master's certificate in nurse  anesthesia, she worked for 6 years at Frankford Hospital and later at  Osceola Regional Medical Center in Florida.   However, as the daughter of a retired naval chief petty officer,  family legacy and patriotism drove Colonel Schank's wish to assist  patients in a much different setting. She enlisted in the Air Force and  learned to transport patients in critical conditions.   These skills served her well in support of Operation Desert Storm,  where she evacuated troops, with a 100 percent survival rate of those  transported. During her 24 years in the service, Colonel Schank  provided medical assistance in times of war and in humanitarian  efforts--from Iraq to Turkey, Mozambique to Honduras and beyond.   As both a civilian nurse anesthetist and Air Force Reserve officer,  she has dedicated her life to caring for others, be it in Florida or  around the world.   Her love for education and helping those in need is ever present, and  she  [[Page H1248]]  continues to surpass what it means to be a student, nurse, and a  constituent of Florida's Ninth Congressional District.   For that, Colonel Paulette Schank, we honor you.                                time  1600                         Honoring Yasmin Flasterstein     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I would  like to recognize Yasmin Flasterstein.   Yasmin Flasterstein is the cofounder and executive director of Peer  Support Space, Inc., which serves as a hub for diverse peer communities  in central Florida. She also works as a wellness recovery action plan  facilitator, is a board member and the Community Engagement Committee  chair for the One Orlando Alliance, is a founding leader of Orlando  Trans Collective, and sits on the board of directors for Central  Florida Cares and Peer Support Coalition of Florida.   Yasmin has been in social justice leadership positions since she was  14; and in college, she brought membership of a mental health advocacy  group, UCF Active Minds, from 20 to over 200 members in one semester.   Yasmin has worked in various clinical roles at La Amistad Behavioral  Health Services and at the Mental Health Association of Central  Florida.   Yasmin was a leader in the mental health response to the Pulse  tragedy, working as the program director for Orlando United Counseling,  providing long-term counseling for those affected directly and  indirectly. During this time, Yasmin also set up events to destigmatize  mental health in LGBTQ+ communities and Latin, Black, and immigrant  communities as well.   She has since shifted from working in clinical environments to the  peer professional environment. She believes in the power of peers with  similar lived experiences, particularly from within marginalized  communities, and works to train and support them in using their own  experience with mental health in order to guide and support others.   She is passionate about breaking the mental health stigma that leaves  people suffering alone and uses her experience as a suicide survivor  living with PTSD and dissociative disorder to help others.   Her nonprofit, Peer Support Space, has helped over 2,500 individuals  with free services during its inaugural year, and they have recently  opened central Florida's very first peer respite in my district.   And for that, Ms. Yasmin Flasterstein, we honor you.                          Honoring Catherine Haynes     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I would  like to recognize Catherine Haynes.   Originally from Indiana, Catherine now lives in Orlando, Florida. She  is known to be a dedicated volunteer, member, and supporter of the  central Florida veteran and military community.   Fourteen years ago, she realized veterans weren't receiving  information about events that would be helpful to them. In order to  fulfill that need, she created a massive email distribution list that  includes veterans from six counties who are served by the Orlando VA  Medical Center in Lake Nona.   As part of her patriotic duty, she regularly greets the three Honor  Flight hubs at the Orlando International Airport. Once she greeted and  thanked over 3,000 senior veterans for their service.   Catherine's patriotism is inherent. She can trace her family's  military history back to the Revolutionary War, where her family served  and became America's first veterans. Almost every generation in her  family has served our country, including her son, Andrew, who served in  the United States Navy.   For several years, Catherine has volunteered with the Wall of Faces  national project, whose goal is to match a photograph with every name  that appears on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. Last  year, she found a Florida Vietnam war casualty without a photograph. By  using reverse genealogy, she found the veteran's family, received his  photo, and found where he had been buried in an unmarked grave for  almost 50 years.   Catherine has been finding photographs of war casualties across the  Nation for years and recently began focusing her efforts on Puerto  Rico, where she has faced several challenges in locating nearly 100  pictures of the remaining Vietnam war casualties.   One of her favorite quotes is: ``Well-behaved women seldom make  history.'' Her motto is: ``The soles of my shoes seldom cool off, and  neither do the tires on my car.''   Catherine is supported by her husband, Joseph, in her continual  efforts to support our central Florida veterans and military community.   And for that, Ms. Catherine Haynes, we honor you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 6 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, February 28, 2020,  at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
