 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Back in 2019, while running for the White House,  President Biden made a public promise. Here is what he said:         I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil fuels.        I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil fuels.    Once in office, he wasted no time starting down that path, and now  working families are paying the price.   During the previous administration, under Republican policies, our  Nation became a net exporter of oil for the first time literally in  decades. We were producing all that we needed and then some. The  headlines under this all-Democratic-controlled government are quite  different.   Here are two from January 2021, right out of the gate: ``Biden halts  oil and gas leases [and] permits on US land and water.'' Here is  another: ``Biden Order Blocks Keystone XL Pipeline.'' January 2021.   Here are the headlines more recently. From a few weeks ago: ``Biden  pulls 3 offshore oil lease sales, curbing new drilling this year.''  From just this past week: ``Biden EPA to make it easier for states to  block fossil fuel projects.''   So even if oil and gas producers could get past the Biden regulatory  gauntlet to actually explore and produce in this country, they likely  could not get a pipeline approved to move it to market.   President Biden is delivering the holy war on domestic American  energy that he promised on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, energy costs  and gas prices for American families have absolutely skyrocketed. Gas  prices have literally doubled since his administration took office. The  average price at the pump has doubled.   The President's staff try to play this off as ``Putin's price hike.''  How many times have we heard that? But the reality is that prices were  already climbing steadily long before--long before--the escalation in  Ukraine; up more than $1 per gallon before--before--Putin's escalation.  Prices for natural gas and other home heating sources were likewise  elevated all last winter.   Don't count on the warmer months bringing much relief. Here is what  the New York Times wrote about a month ago. ``Get Ready,'' the Times  said, ``for Another Energy Price Spike: High Electric Bills.''         Already frustrated and angry about high gasoline prices,       many Americans are being hit by rapidly rising electricity       bills . . . the biggest annual increase in more than a       decade.    According to another report, ``the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission predicts electricity prices could rise by as much as 233  percent over last summer's power prices.   And electricity costs aren't the only problem; there is also the  question of reliability. According to the North American Electric  Reliability Corporation, Americans--particularly in the West and  Midwest--should brace for potentially dangerous electricity blackouts  this summer.   Once again, you can credit Democrats' war on fossil fuels. It retired  too many fossil fuel-powered electricity generators too quickly, while  replacing them with big subsidies for less reliable sources of power.   Just a few days ago, President Biden said that soaring gas prices  were just part of ``an incredible transition that will leave us less  reliant on fossil fuels.'' Did you hear that, American  [[Page S2797]]  workers? Democrats say your financial pain is the necessary cost to  make America more to the liking of the radical environmental left.   The Secretary of Energy has naively suggested that green energy will  leave us in a better strategic position than fossil fuels. Well, maybe  she is not aware that more than 80 percent of the world's polysilicon  is made in China, and about 80 percent of America's rare earth mineral  needs are met by Chinese imports as well.   This is why it is such a joke for the administration to misuse the  Defense Production Act to prop up solar panel manufacturers. They will  just end up subsidizing Chinese suppliers upstream.   Our stockpiles of actual military requirements, like Javelin missiles  and essential munitions, are being depleted. Production of critical  inputs, like energetics and solid rocket motors, is backed up months  and even years. But instead of using the Defense Production Act for our  Nation's defense, the President is using it to indirectly line China's  pocket.   Washington Democrats are hostile to the kinds of domestic mining and  drilling that we will need to produce any kind of energy here at home,  even green energy.    Last year, House Democrats proposed a literal dirt tax--dirt tax-- that would crush domestic minerals and rare earth mining. They are so  opposed to domestic mining, including for critical and rare earth  minerals, Democrats literally tried to tax--listen to this--they wanted  to tax dirt. Tax dirt.   So, look, this doesn't have to be this way. The American people know  exactly what we need: an all-American domestic energy strategy, crude  oil responsibly drilled in America, natural gas responsibly fracked in  America, and more minerals and high-tech components responsibly mined  in America. Democrats have a different plan: less production and higher  prices. And Americans are paying for it literally every day.
