 Madam President, the last few months have presented an  unprecedented challenge for communities and families across the  country, and Vermont is no different. It is refreshing to take a moment  to celebrate the people and entities that are at the foundation of our  community identities. I want to take a moment to recognize one of these  people in Vermont--Doreen Kraft--who was profiled in March for her  leadership of Burlington City Arts.   For the past 25 years, Doreen has been the director of Burlington  City Arts--BCA--a Burlington city department that promotes Vermont  artists while supporting art exhibition, creation, and education.  Doreen is an integral member of the Burlington city government and arts  community. As described by Pat Robbins, the former BCA Center board  chair, Doreen is ``overcommitted . . . and always overscheduled, but  she is a marvelous fundraiser. Everybody takes her calls. Everybody  goes to lunch with her.'' As the director of the BCA Center, Doreen has  raised millions of dollars that have helped BCA further the arts in  Burlington. Something that I most appreciate about Doreen is that she  makes the arts accessible for all Vermonters. Jacqueline Posley, a BCA  board member who relocated to our beautiful State from Mississippi, put  it best by saying that Doreen fosters an environment at BCA that values  people most for the connections they make in the community, rather than  ``by the depth of their pockets.'' While she has led the BCA Center for  25 years, Doreen's work in Burlington began long before she was  appointed director. In 1981, as the mayor of Burlington, now-Senator  Bernie Sanders made the accessibility of the arts a priority, and  Doreen became the first paid employee of the mayor's Task Force for the  Arts. Doreen established a concert series in Burlington's Battery Park  and the annual Burlington Discover Jazz Festival. By 1990, the task  force had become a department of the city government, renamed  Burlington City Arts. In 1995, the year Doreen was appointed as  director, BCA opened its first gallery in the old Firehouse on Church  Street, Burlington's main downtown area. Since then, the Firehouse  Gallery and BCA have gained substantial recognition. With extensive  fundraising and community investment, BCA renovated the Firehouse into  a full visual arts center, renaming the gallery to BCA Center in 2011.  Since 1995, the gallery has become a hub for visual arts in downtown  Burlington, helping the city to become a destination known for its  burgeoning arts scene, due in large part to Doreen's work as director.   Doreen has continued to expand the reach of BCA beyond Church Street.  BCA recently purchased and began the renovation of a 9,000-square-foot  warehouse in Burlington's South End, a post-industrial neighborhood  with its own indigenous art scene. While South End artists and  businessowners initially saw the warehouse purchase as an encroachment  by city government on their turf, relations have improved as  collaboration between BCA and South End artists has grown, on issues of  art promotion and city planning.   As renovation of the warehouse continues, I look forward to seeing  how Doreen and Burlington City Arts can continue to give voice to new  artists and perspectives, promoting not only the arts community but  also greater conversation and cooperation between the government and  the people it serves. With that, as we make decisions on how to assist  our communities through this crisis, we must also remember the  communities that we represent, and individuals that make our  communities so remarkable. I want to recognize and thank Doreen Kraft,  not only for her everlasting support of the arts, but as an ardent  public servant whose efforts highlight the importance of community,  equality, and accessibility.   I ask unanimous consent that her profile be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Seven Days, Mar. 11, 2020]    After 40 Years and Five Mayors, Doreen Kraft Steers Burlington City                          Arts Into the South End                           (By Margaret Grayson)         Doreen Kraft doesn't really want to talk about Doreen       Kraft. During a recent reception for new exhibitions at the       BCA Center on Church Street, she preferred to direct a       reporter's attention to everyone else in the room: a       dedicated board member; Burlington's supportive mayor; the       brilliant director of another local nonprofit.        Upstairs in her office, the longtime executive director of       Burlington City Arts praised its successive gallery curators       and explained how willing they had been to do hands-on work       and volunteer extra time. She talked up a waitress at a       restaurant that was partnering with BCA, who, unacquainted       with Kraft, recently encouraged her to make a donation to the       organization.        Kraft excels at this kind of schmoozing, probing and       promoting at the same time. People describe her as a coach,       an advocate, a great listener--essentially, who she is to       other people, as if her role is to reflect the best version       of everyone around her. It's an approach that has helped her       grow BCA--through the administrations of five different       mayors--from a janitor's closet in the basement of city hall       to a municipal department charged with fostering public art       and culture.        Since the organization's founding in 1980, Kraft, 68, has       been a driving force. For the last 25 years, she's led BCA as       it has created galleries and studios, developed art classes       and summer camps, curated art in public spaces, won and       distributed grants, and organized citywide events such as       Festival of Fools and Highlight, Burlington's New Year's Eve       celebration. The city contributes a portion of the funds for       those cultural activities.        Kraft raises at least half of the rest of the money single-      handedly. Most recently, she  [[Page S2803]]       spearheaded the purchase of a building at 405 Pine Street       that now houses the organization's art studios. Kraft and her       team need to find $5 million to renovate it.        ``She gets overcommitted. She's always overscheduled. But       she's a marvelous fundraiser,'' said Pat Robins, cofounder of       the Church Street Marketplace and former BCA board chair.       ``Everybody takes her calls. Everybody goes to lunch with       her.''        Jacqueline Posley, a recent transplant to Vermont by way of       the state's Stay to Stay program, joined the BCA board last       June. She said that in her home state of Mississippi, she       felt the arts were only for people with money. At BCA, she       said she felt valued more for her willingness to make       connections in the community than the depth of her pockets.       She describes Kraft as an inclusive and unpretentious leader.        ``Doreen will put out the food trays, will sweep the       floors,'' Posley said. ``Every job that needs to be done, I       could see Doreen doing it.''        Robins credited BCA's long-running success with Kraft's       ability to take risks and, more importantly, pull them off.       If this story were a documentary, there'd be short takes of       nearly a dozen Burlington leaders all saying the same thing:       BCA would not exist today without Kraft, despite her attempts       to redirect the spotlight. When BCA is praised, Kraft's name       is attached. When it's criticized, she is often targeted       personally.        This particular arts job also comes with political perils.       BCA is an arm of city government and whoever happens to be       running it, and Kraft is, technically, an annual appointee of       the mayor. She navigates it all with a highly developed sense       of direction and diplomacy.        ``I love to see and engage with people who believe that the       arts are central to community life,'' Kraft said. ``And if I       can be a part of that process and move that forward and make       that more possible and attainable, then my heart sings.''       She's deeply loyal to Burlington: ``I cannot imagine doing       this anywhere else.''        Working the gallery opening at the BCA Center, Kraft       noticed immediately when Mayor Miro Weinberger walked in. She       asked her boss if he'd be willing to speak to the crowd, then       jumped into action to corral all the featured artists and       curators to start speeches before he had to leave, and gave a       glowing, on-the-spot introduction praising Weinberger's       support for BCA.        It was a calculated move on Kraft's part, honed from       decades of experience. But her words, delivered in a loud but       warm New York-accented alto, rang totally authentic.                              Government Startup         When he became mayor of Burlington in 1981, Bernie Sanders       had an agenda. On it was a desire to ``make the arts more       accessible to all, regardless of social, economic or physical       constraints.'' But he faced a powerful board of aldermen,       known today as the Burlington City Council, who stymied his       attempts to hire staff and appoint department heads.        So Sanders created the Community and Economic Development       Office, along with a youth office and the Mayor's Task Force       on the Arts, to circumvent the board of aldermen's control.        Kraft was appointed to the cultural task force and became       its first paid employee in 1983, working out of a closet-size       office. Soon known as the Mayor's Arts Council, the group       started a concert series in Battery Park and cofounded the       Burlington Discover Jazz Festival with the Flynn Center for       the Performing Arts in 1985.        In 1990, the Mayor's Arts Council became an official city       department, renamed Burlington City Arts. Kraft was on the       board at the time but didn't become executive director until       1995. Like Fletcher Free Library, BCA derived only a portion       of its budget from taxpayers. Today, it gets 40 percent of       its $2.2 million operating budget from the city and 60       percent from philanthropy and outside grants.        Kraft had the requisite fundraising skills to make that       arrangement workable. As it turned out, she also had a knack       for recruiting young talent.        When Pascal Spengemann came to Burlington in 1995, planning       to stay for only a few months, he saw BCA's Firehouse Gallery       on Church Street and thought it was cool that there was art       on Burlington's main drag. BCA had converted the ground floor       of the historic firehouse into a gallery that same year.       Through the windows, he saw makeshift walls and paintings       hung with fishing line.        But one day during business hours, Spengemann went by and       the space was closed. So he went next door to city hall,       found Kraft, and convinced her to hire him to supervise the       gallery and keep its doors open.        Spengemann lobbied to take over the curatorial duties, and       after he put on a well-received test-run show, Kraft let him       take the reins.        ``I was pretty green and looking for something to do, and       she really believed in me,'' Spengemann said. ``I felt really       supported by her.''        Under his supervision, the Firehouse Gallery began to gain       recognition. In 1998, the Burlington City Council approved a       proposal to renovate the old firehouse building into a visual       arts center, and the newly formed BCA Foundation launched its       first capital campaign. In 2004 the renovation was finished,       and in 2011 it was renamed the BCA Center.        Today, curator Heather Ferrell cites receiving grants from       the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts as evidence       that the BCA Center is respected in the broader contemporary       art community. Many considerations go into the shows the BCA       Center puts on throughout the year. Ferrell said they aim for       various levels of ``accessibility,'' meaning how much       interpretation to add so people can understand and enjoy the       work, and how much to challenge the audience.        She also tries to balance showing Vermont artists and       national artists, and integrating the two rather than having       a separate gallery for Vermonters as was done in the past.       For example, local artist Stella Marrs guest-curated the       current main-floor exhibit, ``Apocalypse Diet,'' at the BCA       Center, featuring Vermont and national artists.        Sara Katz started working at BCA in 1999, but it was after       she volunteered to help out in Kraft's garden that she got to       know the director. The two chatted, pulled weeds and began       what is now a 20-year working relationship.        ``She's curious about people,'' said Katz, who has since       become the organization's assistant director. ``I was just,       like, a 22-year-old nobody at that time, and she wanted to       know how I thought.''        Today, Katz is BCA's behind-the-scenes force, making sure       administrative tasks are handled so Kraft has time to be the       face of the organization.        ``You know, she's just this kind of public dynamo,'' Katz       said. ``She's really incredible with human relationships. She       just understands people in a really intuitive way, so it       makes a lot of sense for her to be out in the world as much       as possible.''                            Filmmaker to Rainmaker         Kraft grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and majored in studio       art at the University of New Mexico. But, unsure what to do       after graduation, she fell in with ``a group of merry       pranksters,'' she said. Kraft moved to a farm in Bethel, VT,       as part of the back-to-the-land movement. Though she enjoys       gardening, she admitted it was a hard year.        ``There was just no question I was not cut out to be a       farmer,'' Kraft said.        She started teaching an art class at a local high school       and met Robin Lloyd, who was teaching in nearby Rochester.       Lloyd was making films, which Kraft had never done before.       But they started working together, and Lloyd taught her the       medium. They both moved to Burlington, into the house on       Maple Street where Lloyd still lives today, and Kraft went       back to school at the University of Vermont, studying film       production in the communications department. (She also did       stints at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and Hampshire       College.)        Kraft and Lloyd were both influenced by the work of Maya       Deren, an experimental filmmaker whose work focused on       Haitian vodou. In 1973 the two took the first of many trips       to Haiti, where they made a short film about the country's       colorful painted buses.        Later, Kraft and Lloyd commissioned local artists to make       paintings that they then used in a 20-minute stop-motion       animated film, called ``Black Dawn,'' exploring Haitian       history. The French government bought copies for all of its       embassies; Kraft said it's the only movie of hers that has       ever made money. She and Lloyd founded a production company       called Green Valley Media in 1974; Kraft still sits on the       board.        Kraft also embarked on more personal filmmaking projects,       including a re-enactment of her mother's childhood in a       convent school in Ireland. Kraft called that still-unfinished       work her ``film in a can.'' She'd like to edit it someday,       but ``it's not something you can do on a weekend,'' she       noted. ``I mean, I would need a sabbatical, and they don't       have sabbaticals in the arts.''        In a way, making films helped prepare Kraft for her job at       BCA. ``In the early days . . . I would be petrified of being       onstage or, you know, introducing concerts at Battery Park,''       she said. ``People would push me out there.        ``If you have a camera and a microphone, you have an excuse       to pretty much ask a lot of questions and get to talk to       people,'' Kraft said. Still, she added, ``There are days that       I go an entire day and literally, when I get home, I can't       speak. I'm, like, done. I have to go through that quiet time,       listen to music, listen to news, just transition out of the       day and also reflect.''        Kraft lives in East Charlotte with her husband, artist       Marvin Fishman, whom she met making films. The couple is       thinking of moving back to Burlington, where Kraft hasn't       lived since the 1990s. If they do it, she said, she'd       actually miss the commute, which marks a defined transition       between her job and her home.        Kraft doesn't always achieve work-life balance. Most       recently, she has lost sleep over the purchase of the new       building on Pine Street. A walk through the empty warehouse       that BCA now owns--9,000 square feet of which will be       converted into new studio space and a community room--reveals       just what a mammoth task this renovation will be. Especially       when you factor in BCA's commitment to making the building       net zero in energy consumption. Kraft said she hopes to get       it done in three years.        She's already started giving tours of the building and       reaching out to potential donors. ``She's very good at       establishing the vision, and she's very good at then asking       for people to support it,'' said Chris Thompson, a former BCA       Center curator and former executive director of Generator       maker space.  [[Page S2804]]       ``Having done a lot of fundraising myself recently,'' he       added, it taught him that ``you have to believe passionately       in the mission. And if you believe strongly enough in the       mission, you're willing to ask anybody for anything.''                               South End `Plan'         Kraft has often been compared to another local woman who       built a thriving arts organization: Andrea Rogers. She was       the founding executive director of the Flynn, instrumental in       transitioning it from a moribund movie theater to a restored       art-deco performing arts center. Rogers ran the Flynn for 29       years before retiring in 2010.        BCA focused on the visual arts because it was       underrepresented in Burlington's arts scene. Avoiding       duplication of the Flynn's performing arts programming and       classes was helpful to what Rogers described as a ``good       working relationship'' with BCA, citing their collaboration       in producing the annual Burlington Discover Jazz Festival.        ``We were both dedicated to our own institutions,'' Rogers       said. ``There's no question about that. And I think, because       we were early leaders of our institutions, the both of us       could be charged with being too protective of our own       kingdoms. I'm sure I was considered that, and she probably       has been, too.''        It's a diplomatic way of acknowledging that Burlington's       arts community has seen some turf battles over the years. BCA       has run into resistance from the artists and business owners       along the Pine Street corridor--later dubbed the South End       Arts District--who were protective of their neighborhood and       fiercely opposed to any development that might threaten       scarce, affordable studio space. They rallied behind the       South End Arts and Business Association, which created and       still organizes Burlington's annual South End Art Hop.        Whether or not it was warranted, some believed that BCA--      and, by extension, Kraft--wanted to stake a claim in the       South End, perhaps because of the organization's city-      department status.        That came to a head with planBTV. In June 2015, the city       released a draft of a plan to redevelop the South End--the       postindustrial area of Burlington along Pine Street and Flynn       Avenue. BCA, with the help of a National Endowment for the       Arts grant, recruited artists to create works that would       engage the public and solicit comments on the proposed plan.        But in August, many of those artists became disenchanted       with the process and didn't think their voices had been       heard. They worried that a proposed zoning change to allow       more housing in the area would displace them, and they       believed BCA was complicit.        Amey Radcliffe, one of the artists who received funding for       a community engagement project, put it this way in a recent       email to Seven Days: ``I don't necessarily feel that the       artist/activists that emerged at that time were fully heard       or fully understood. If BCA were less under the purview of       the Mayor, we might see BCA taking more independent stands       and actions--less in-step with the Mayor's development       agendas for the area.''        Signs began to appear around the neighborhood, according to       local media reports, including ones that read, ``BCA: Will       you stand with the arts community to preserve industrial       zoning in the SEAD?'' At that year's South End Art Hop in       September, artists built a temporary cardboard house across       the street from ArtsRiot that was dubbed ``Miroville.''        Kraft was also the subject of some Art Hop protest art. One       of the buildings in the Howard Space--the warren of artist       studios at Pine and Howard streets--was topped with a large       sculpture depicting Weinberger holding puppet versions of       Kraft and the city's director of planning, David White, on       strings.        ``I tried to buy it,'' Kraft said of the artwork. ``I stood       there that night, and I remember saying to people, `I do get       this. I understand it, you know? I'll take the criticism.'       But I also felt that BCA was misunderstood, and our role in       that planning.''        Relations have improved since then. SEABA's current       executive director, Christy Mitchell, said she's excited to       have another organization with a stake in the South End and       sees BCA as a potential ally in getting new signage and maps       pointing tourists to Pine Street. Radcliffe said she thought       the perception of BCA in the area was generally positive and       that the purchase of the building on Pine Street could       provide new opportunities for South End artists.        Steve Conant, owner of Conant Metal & Light and the Soda       Plant--and an early member of SEABA--said he'd been aware of       a ``turf war'' between the two organizations, though not when       he was directly involved. ``It's hard to complain about an       organization that anchors 30,000 square feet of real estate       and commits it to the arts,'' Conant said. ``That's the       biggest risk in the South End: the loss of real estate that       supports the arts.''        BCA's relationship with the city is a double-edged sword.       On one hand, it provides the organization with a significant       portion of its budget, covering staff and overhead costs. It       also provides easy connections with other city departments       and a larger stake in city decision making. On the other       hand, the public money opens the organization up to criticism       about how those funds are used. Dissatisfaction with       Weinberger generally casts a shadow on his appointees.        Kraft, one of the original members of the Sanders       administration, has another challenge: walking a line between       the passionate, activist tendencies of the community and the       bureaucratic nature of city government.        John Franco, once Sanders' assistant city attorney, has       represented opponents of the Weinberger administration in       court; Steve Goodkind, another original Sanders appointee who       headed up the Department of Public Works, ran against       Weinberger in 2015. Among the original group of Bernie       acolytes that former Seven Days columnist Peter Freyne called       the ``inner circle of Sanderistas,'' Kraft is the only one       still on the city payroll.        Lloyd is a longtime peace activist in Vermont and said that       has led to friendly disagreements between her and Kraft. For       example, BCA's annual Festival of Fools often lands on the       August anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki       in World War II.        ``I said, `OK, Doreen, you're having a Festival of Fools,       but I'm going to walk down Church Street with ashes on my       head impersonating what happened in Hiroshima many years       ago,' '' Lloyd described with a laugh.        Because of their long-standing friendship, Lloyd said, she       and Kraft can usually work out a deal when their interests       collide. In the case of the Festival of Fools, Lloyd planned       her demonstration on the waterfront after the last festival       act had performed there.        The women agree to disagree on other controversial city       projects, too, such as the long-planned and much-delayed       construction of the Champlain Parkway through the South End.        ``She's a very loyal person for what she gets involved       with,'' Lloyd said. ``I think she's a vital person for Miro,       because she has contacts with a lot of people he might not       have within the arts community and with the alternative       community.''        Lots of people confide in Kraft. ``Not that she gossips,''       said Lloyd, ``but she could certainly do a lot of gossiping       if she wanted to.''        ``I'm just pretty open and honest with people,'' Kraft       said. ``Not that we haven't had knock-down, drag-out debate       on certain issues, you know, but I think people respect my       role in the city and that you can't have another identity       outside of BCA. It's just not possible. I can be active in       causes, but I certainly can't take sides, because Burlington       City Arts has to be neutral . . . I don't think I hold back       on my opinion; I just use it appropriately.''        Kraft said the BCA board has considered, multiple times,       whether staying associated with the city is the best path       forward.        ``We've gone through that exercise to sort of really look       at ourselves at that time and to analyze the relationship       with the city,'' Kraft said. ``There have been mayors who       said, `You know, it's a good exercise, because are we holding       you back from becoming something you could be more of if you       weren't associated with the city?' ''        But the answer, Kraft said, is always no--the benefits       always outweigh the costs. BCA's new Pine Street studio space       proves her point.        ``We would not exist if it wasn't for the platform of the       city,'' she said. ``Either we wouldn't exist or we'd be a       completely independent nonprofit that probably would have       accomplished a quarter of what we've accomplished today.
