 Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to speak about a book, a book  much like ``I Am Jazz'' that I have had the privilege of reading before  on the House floor for a number of years. It is an opportunity for  children to explore their gender identity without being criticized.  This book is titled ``They, She, He easy as ABC.''         They! they! They! they! New friends are everywhere waiting       to play!        Out on the dance floor we love to sing they. They is a way       to let everyone be. No one left out and everyone free. Then       when we're friends, we sing they, she, he, ze. Making it easy       as a-b-c-d.        Let's dance!        A. Ari loves to arabesque. They hold their pose with ease.        B. Brody is a break dancer. Brody loves to freeze.        C. Cory leaps high like a cat. She springs and leaps and       bounds.        D. Diego drums and dances. Tree has all the sounds.        E. Ebony flies everywhere. They spread their arms like       wings.        F. Fawn is free as a flower. Fawn can bring the spring.        G. Gia's going fast and strong. She's dancing on the go.        H. Harvey's heart beats happily. Hip hop makes her flow.        I. Indigo's into insects. Ze loves the buzzing vibe.        J. Jorge jams to jazzy tunes. He or they can jive.        K. Kelly can kick super high. His heart lives in the sky.        L. Lourdes sings of lofty heights. Their songs let them       fly.        M. Marley is a star mermaid. He or she flows with the sea.        N. Nathan is a nesting bird. He just wants to be.        O. Ocean's arms are open wide. Tree swings and sways about.        P. Paul pretends to be a plant. Paul grows up and OUT.        Q. Quetzal is so, so quiet. He rests just like a queen.        R. Rene is into rainbows. He creates the scene.        S. Sky is like a star so bright. All the pronouns are       right.        T. Tai is tiger in the night. He claims his own might.        U. Una is a unicorn. They prance to their own sound.        V. Viola's a volcano. Her power's in her ground.        W. Wren whistles when she dances. She knows just what to       do.        X. Xander exaggerates moves. They're extremely cool.        Y. Yoli yells YES! joyously. Their voice becomes the song.        Z. Zahara zooms in and out. Ze knows that ze belongs.        Now's your chance. We need your moves.        Join the dance. There's always room.        Maya makes the art and words. She sings the song to life.       Matthew dreams and tinkers. He makes the work tight.        Together they make books for the kids they used to be. And       for their own two kids so all kids can grow free!  [[Page H1231]]                                ____________________
