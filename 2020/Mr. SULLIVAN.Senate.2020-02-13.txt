 Madam President.   The Senator from Alaska.    Madam President, no one wants war with Iran, but while  I respect Senator Kaine and my other colleagues who are supporting the  broader AUMF, it has fatal flaws.   First, it says the United States should cease its hostilities against  Iran. This is completely backward. The United States is not actively  conducting hostilities against Iran, but Iran has been actively  conducting hostilities against us and our troops for decades. Just look  at the long, bloody list: thousands of Americans dead and wounded,  Marine barracks in Lebanon, Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, Soleimani,  and deadly IEDs in Iraq.   Second, the broader AUMF of Senator Kaine dramatically limits our  ability to protect these very forces from future attacks, which we know  the Iranians are planning. Close to half of the forces in Iraq right  now are Alaska-based military forces, our friends and neighbors in  Alaska. I want to make sure they are protected.    My amendment does that by making sure the President has  clear authority to protect our troops.
