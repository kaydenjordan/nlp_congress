 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true American  hero, Pierre King, who is a police officer with the York Police  Department in York, South Carolina.   I say this because, on May 11, 2019, Jamie Brock and his wife,  Kimberly, were having dinner at Longhorn Steakhouse, celebrating their  oldest son's graduation from the University of South Carolina. While  eating their food, Jamie began choking and unable to breathe due to  experiencing an allergic reaction to the food.   Kimberly, his wife, began screaming for help, and Officer King, who  was off duty at the time, rushed to help the choking man, whom he did  not know, and was able to use lifesaving techniques that he had been  trained to administer and was successful in dislodging the food from  Jamie's throat.   Due to the actions of Officer King, a life was saved, and in the  words of Brock family: ``God put you there that day, and you saved my  husband and you saved our kids' father.''   In the words of Officer King: ``All I knew is that I was not going to  let this man die, and he would do the same thing for me.''   Officer King is a true American hero who epitomizes the slogan ``to  live is to serve'' and is an example for all of us to follow.   When I think of Officer King, I think of the words of Winston  Churchill, who, when Great Britain was about to be under siege by  Germany, said:         There will be a time when doing your best is not good       enough. We must do what is required.    Mr. Speaker, Officer King did what was required.                            ____________________
