The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).    Mr. President, we reached a milestone last week with the  confirmation of President Trump's 100th Federal judge, and, frankly, it  is a milestone that should have come earlier. Had this been another  President, it almost undoubtedly would have come earlier. But,  unfortunately, the response to this President has been characterized by  what the leader aptly referred to yesterday as ``unhinged  partisanship.''   Now, 2\1/2\ years on from President Trump's election, Democrats still  can't get over the fact that they lost. Somehow, my colleagues missed  the section in government class where you learn that is what happens  sometimes in democracies. Sometimes you win. Sometimes--and I hate to  break it to my colleagues--sometimes you lose. It is not fun. No one  likes having their candidate lose, but that is what happens sometimes  when you have free elections.   No one expects Democrats to just sign on to everything President  Trump says or does. No one expects them to sign on to most of what  President Trump says or does. I certainly understand that they have  philosophical disagreements with many of his policies. I have been in  their position. During my time in public office, there have certainly  been Presidents with whom I disagreed a substantial part of the time. I  like to think that I didn't reflexively oppose everything they said or  did simply because they weren't my preferred candidate for the office.  I am fairly certain President Trump couldn't eat a cheese sandwich  without some Democrat crying treason.   Well, let's step back a minute. Maybe it is not that my Democratic  colleagues are reflexively opposing everything this President does.  Maybe it is not unhinged partisanship. Maybe it is just that they  disagree with every single word he says, every single thing he does,  and every single individual he nominates--except in the case of  nominees, at least, we know that isn't true.   Let's go back to those judicial nominations. Democrats have engaged  in a  [[Page S2712]]  truly unprecedented amount of obstruction on President Trump's judicial  nominees. As of May 2, Democrats have forced cloture votes on almost 65  percent of President Trump's judicial nominees--65 percent. At the same  point in President Obama's first term, Republicans had required cloture  votes on just 2\1/2\ percent of his judicial nominees--65 percent to  2\1/2\ percent. But, again, maybe that is because Democrats have  serious philosophical objections to these nominees--except they don't,  because again and again, Democrats have turned around and voted for the  Trump judicial nominees they obstructed.   One egregious example occurred in January of 2018 when Democrats  forced the Senate to spend more than a week considering four district  court judges even though not one single Democrat voted against their  confirmation. That is right. Democrats forced the Senate to spend more  than a week considering the nomination of four judges even though not  one single Democrat opposed their confirmation. These judges could have  been confirmed in a matter of minutes by voice vote, but Democrats  forced the Senate to spend more than a week on their consideration-- time that could have been spent on genuinely controversial nominees or  on some of the many important issues facing our country.   As of April 2 of this year, Democrats have forced cloture votes on 20  of the district court judges the Senate has confirmed. Ultimately,  however, 19 of those 20 judges were confirmed by more than 68 votes.  Now, 17 of those 20 were confirmed by more than 80 votes, and 12 of  those 20 were confirmed without a single vote in opposition. Yet  Democrats obstructed all of them.   One hundred judicial nominees confirmed is a solid milestone, but, as  I said before, it is a milestone that should have come earlier and  would have come earlier if Democrats hadn't chosen to engage in a  massive campaign of partisan obstruction. Despite a lot of hard work by  the Judiciary Committee and a robust pace of nominations from the  President, the number of judicial vacancies is actually 25 percent  higher today than it was when the President took office, and a near  record number of those vacancies are designated as judicial  emergencies. That shouldn't be the case, but thanks to Democrats' knee- jerk obstruction, that is where we are.   Regardless of how much the Democrats obstruct, though, Republicans  will keep moving forward. Despite Democrats' best efforts, we confirmed  a record number of circuit court judges during the President's first 2  years, and we are going to keep working our way through the President's  nominees, judicial and otherwise. We are committed to filling vacancies  in both the executive branch and the judiciary so that the American  people have the fully functioning government they deserve.   Perhaps someday Democrats will decide to drop the obstruction and to  join us in the business of actually getting things done for the  American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
