 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the trees, the  forest they call home, and all Americans who live near there.   In the words of the poet Joyce Kilmer:       I think that I shall never see      A poem as lovely as a tree.      A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed      Against the Earth's sweet flowing breast.      A tree that looks at God all day      And lifts her leaf-filled arms to pray.      A tree that may in summer wear      A nest of robins in her hair.      Upon whose bosom snow has lain,      Who's intimately lived with rain.      Poems are made by folks like me,      But only God can make a tree.    Mr. Speaker, trees are truly amazing. Through the remarkable process  of photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide. They store the carbon  in the wood, and they release the oxygen back for us to breathe. Trees  provide us with clean air.   But just as important as clean air, trees provide us with clean  water. Their roots hold the soil together, and as water percolates  through, they clean the water.   Forests also provide wildlife habitat. They provide us places for  outdoor recreation. Trees provide amazing green building products, like  mass timber. Trees provide packaging for shipping. And let us not  forget where toilet paper comes from.   No wonder trees are so admired, as they should be. However, our  beloved trees and forests in the West have a different image today, one  not of grandeur and amazing beauty, but one of fuel in an apocalyptic  inferno that is killing people, destroying homes and property, and  leaving barren landscapes below and choking smoke above.   Mr. Speaker, unlike the mythical Ents of middle-earth in the ``Lord  of the Rings,'' our trees cannot speak for themselves. I don't claim to  be Dr. Seuss' Lorax, but if trees could talk, I believe they would be  crying out: Hey, humans, stop loving us to death. Hey, humans, we need  some relief, and you are supposed to be taking care of us. Hey,  Congress, you are killing us, and if we die, you die. Please work  together and apply your husbandry skills to give us a chance. When  trees win, humans win.   Mr. Speaker, even as the climate changes and fire threats increase in  the West, there is hope if we will just do the right thing. That right  thing is forest management, and it looks different on different sites.   Here is an example of how it looks in my home State of Arkansas. This  is the Felsenthal National Wildlife Management area. You can see an  unmanaged forest, the control site. You see the thick underbrush, the  midstory and the understory that is too thick. You see the simple  management practices of thinning out the understory, doing controlled  burns, and at the bottom you see what a beautiful, healthy forest looks  like.   Here is an example of how it looks in California. This is an aerial  shot from the devastating Camp fire near Paradise. This red hatched  area, that is where the fire burned. This dark red line, that is where  the fire was stopped.   You can see this little band right here. That was actually a  firebreak  [[Page H4436]]  that was put in place by a private forestry company to stop the spread  of fire onto their land because public lands are so mismanaged.   Here is what that firebreak looked like. It was a thinned area where  the fire came in from this direction. It went down to the ground, and  firemen were actually able to put it out and save the forest on the  other side.   That is what sound forest management looks like. This is not clear- cutting. It is commonsense, science-based management that works.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time to act--not after the election, not the  next Congress, but now. In the Trillion Trees Act, we have outlined  policies to implement the most basic forest management practices to the  four most critical areas:   The wildland urban interface where fire can start, but where breaks  can be created and we can thin;   Energy transportation corridors. We know fires can start from  electric arcs;   Transportation corridors, where trains and cars can create sparks and  where more humans are near the forest;   And last but not least, in critical watersheds where the damage is  felt long after the fires are out.   For the sake of our forests, our environment, and all Americans, I  urge Congress to act. Pass the Trillion Trees Act, and let's be the  good stewards that the trees deserve.                            ____________________
