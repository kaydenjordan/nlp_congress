 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the House Paper and  Packaging Caucus, I rise today to recognize the 57th anniversary of  National Forest Products Week.   As an Oregonian, this week takes on special significance for me and  my constituents. Oregon is home to over 174 wood products, paper, and  packaging manufacturing facilities that make nearly $11 billion in  products annually and contribute over $2 billion to the State and local  economies through wages and compensation.   I would like to recognize and thank the nearly 38,000 hardworking men  and women employed by the forest products industry in my State. Your  contributions to our State and your local communities are greatly  appreciated.   In this country, we are fortunate to have the renewable natural  resources and domestic manufacturing to be able to provide Americans  with the paper or packaging tissue and wood products that are central  to modern life and the modern economy.   I want to thank and congratulate the people and employees in the  forest products industry for the valuable role they play in the economy  not only in my State and district, but to rural communities across this  country.                            ____________________
