 Madam President, last week, while I was meeting with  constituents in Iowa, news broke here  [[Page S4489]]  in Washington, DC, about Assistant Special Agent in Charge Tim  Thibault's retirement.   Since May 31 of this year, I have highlighted Tim Thibault's partisan  bias and how it infected major FBI investigations. That included a July  18 letter of this year that highlighted his role in opening a criminal  investigation into Trump's campaign and advisers. That investigation is  the electoral investigation that has been in the news.   For example, on July 26 of this year, the Washington Post reported on  that very same Trump investigation. Now, however, the Post failed to  note that Thibault was the prime mover in opening it.   Now get this: The Post failed to note that Tim Thibault predicated  the investigation, in a substantial part, on liberal news articles, as  well as information derived from a liberal nonprofit. Attorney General  Garland and Director Wray approved a full investigation anyway, which,  as we all know, was contrary to standard procedure for moving ahead on  an investigation.   That Washington Post article occurred 1 day after I made the Trump  investigation letter public and 1 day after I made the July 25 Hunter  Biden investigation letter public.   Since Tim Thibault's exit from the FBI, I have noticed more news  articles and reporting that haven't been accurate with respect to the  allegations that I have made public. Let me take this opportunity,  then, to correct the record with respect to that inaccurate reporting.   Some reports have noted that the Hunter Biden criminal probe is  ongoing; therefore, how can the allegations of Thibault shutting down  investigation activity relating to Hunter Biden be credible?   Well, this is the difference: The whistleblower disclosures to me  relate to investigative activity and avenues of information that  originated entirely separate from the ongoing Hunter Biden criminal  probe. That is why the allegations that I made--that I brought  forward--are so very, very important, because we are dealing with a  separate category of potentially criminal information relating to  Hunter Biden that the FBI has within its possession and the information  received by the FBI was either verified or verifiable. Even so, based  on allegations, the investigative activity was shut down by Special  Agent Thibault and, of course, by others based on the false assertion  that it was disinformation.    How many times do we have this ``disinformation'' coming up as an  excuse all the time with Grassley's investigations?   Now, to be precise, FBI officials want to take action with respect to  this separate investigative information that the FBI had in its  possession related to Hunter Biden. However, Thibault blocked the FBI  from doing what would normally be done. Accordingly, the investigative  activity and the information cannot be advanced as it should have been,  which means the FBI could have gathered more evidence with respect to  Hunter Biden but cut bait instead. And the FBI and Thibault cut bait  right before the 2020 Presidential election.   Since the information and activity was shut down, it wouldn't have  been initially shared with any ongoing criminal probe. That calls into  question, then, what U.S. Attorney Weiss is actually investigating. It  also calls into question what the FBI's Baltimore field office is  reviewing and whether it is the full scope of evidence.   Now, I have asked Director Wray about that whole issue. I asked him:         How can verified and verifiable information relating to the       Hunter Biden's potential criminality be shared with U.S.       Attorney Weiss if it is shut down?    We have no answer from Director Wray.   At the Judiciary Committee's August 4 oversight hearing, Director  Wray said that it is his expectation that such information would be  shared with relevant offices.   So, Director Wray, I have this question: What have you done to ensure  that your expectation has been met?   Because of Director Wray's failure to answer, Congress is unaware of  whether or not the FBI has finally shared full and complete information  and investigative activity with any ongoing criminal probe.   Therefore, without additional transparency from the government, there  is a very real chance the Hunter Biden criminal probe doesn't include  the full evidentiary picture.   Now, how can the American people trust the results? Some have also  questioned how an assistant special agent in charge like Thibault can  have so much power--power to open and close investigative activities.   Well, that is exactly what he did. And that power is often abused  within the FBI. For example, on March 28 of this year, Chairman Durbin  and I wrote a letter to the FBI about an audit. That audit showed  widespread violations of internal policies designed to ensure proper  handling of the FBI's most sensitive investigations.   To read from my letter with Chairman Durbin:         The FBI reviewed 353 Sensitive Investigative Matters--just       under half of all such matters that were pending during this       18-month review period--and identified 747 violations.    In 45 investigations, the FBI didn't conduct or document a legal  review prior to opening it. In 40 investigations, the FBI officials who  opened a sensitive investigative matter didn't obtain approval from the  relevant special agent in charge or even the assistant special agent in  charge.   Now, with those statistics, I fear that is just the tip of the  iceberg.   In conclusion, let's look at Thibault's recent statement and the  allegations he didn't address. I think we have five or six.   First, he didn't address his role in opening a Trump investigation  based on liberal news articles and information derived from a liberal  nonprofit. Secondly, he didn't address his collaboration with Richard  Pilger with respect to that investigation. Third, he didn't address  efforts to water down the Trump investigation memo sent to Attorney  General Garland and Director Wray which they ultimately approved.  Fourth, he didn't address the shutting down of the investigative  activity and avenues of information relating to Hunter Biden. Fifth, he  didn't address the alleged criminality within the information provided  to the FBI about Hunter Biden. Sixth, he didn't address the August 2020  assessment opened by Brian Auten that was used to falsely label Hunter  Biden's information as ``disinformation.'' Seventh, he didn't address  his actions to try and improperly mark investigative closings so that  they couldn't be opened in the future. Lastly, Thibault said that he  ``welcomes any investigation'' into allegations against him.   Well, Mr. Thibault, come on in. Sit for a transcribed interview with  me and my colleagues.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
