 Mr. Speaker, there is an intractable bias and prejudice  that infects Robert Mueller's investigation of President Trump and his  team.   Look no further than Peter Strzok. He was central to clearing Hillary  Clinton by changing the information in her exoneration statement from  grossly negligent to extremely careless. Then, somehow, he gets drafted  into the Mueller probe and starts sending anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text  messages to his mistress.   Then we learn that Bruce Ohr, who was also involved in the  investigation, met with Fusion GPS officials proximate to their  interactions that impacted the election. Now we have learned that the  wife of Bruce Ohr--the wife of a senior official involved in this  investigation--was moonlighting, working for Fusion GPS and bringing up  scandalous, unverified, and salacious accusations against the  President.   Even Mueller's number two, Andrew Weissmann, praised Sally Yates for  defying a direct order from the President.   It is time to bring this witch hunt of an investigation to a close  and move on to Make America Great Again.                            ____________________
