 Madam Speaker, I am so blessed to have known Louise  McIntosh Slaughter, and I am so pleased to speak on her behalf today.   Louise was a legislator, with a capital L, and she lived up to the  legacy of the ladies of New York. She represented Seneca Falls, and not  only because it was her district, but she represented it in terms of  her sentiments.   She was the sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. She was the  head of the Pro-Choice Caucus. She focused on medical research for  women.   She was a thought leader. Consistent with her training in chemistry,  she fought to decrease the amount of antibiotics, eliminate antibiotics  in animals for consumption. She led on the issues of getting rid of  lead, and, also, she really understood chemistry.   The first time she saw Bob Slaughter, she said, ``I have just got to  have him,'' and she went and got him.   She was a bridge to leadership. These freshmen would have really,  really enjoyed being around the head of the Rules Committee, their  bridge to the leadership.   And let me tell you, I loved her because she really knew how to make  people happy. Madam Speaker, she gave me an orange purse because she  thought that orange was a happy color and that I deserved to be  surrounded by it.
