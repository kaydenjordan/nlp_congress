 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a prominent  Civil War historian, whose work spans the globe as a lecturer, guide,  and preservationist. Dennis Frye is the chief historian at Harpers  Ferry National Park in my home State of West Virginia.   Born out of the fiery turmoil of the Civil War, the Mountain State  was founded by courageous patriots who were willing to risk their lives  and fortunes in a united pursuit of justice and freedom for all. As  West Virginians, we take great pride in our history, and it is so  important to instill this commitment to our values in the next  generation. That is Dennis's legacy.   As a preservationist, Dennis is a cofounder and first president of  the Save Historic Antietam Foundation and is also a cofounder and  former president of the Civil War Trust. His lifetime achievements in  the Civil War history community have earned him numerous awards and  recognitions, including the Shelby Foote Award by the Civil War Trust  and the Nevins-Freeman Award by the Civil War Roundtable of Chicago-- the first and oldest Civil War roundtable.   Dennis has authored nearly 100 articles and 10 books and also helped  produce the Emmy Award-winning television features about the Battle of  Antietam, abolitionist John Brown, and Maryland during the Civil War.  He has been published in countless prestigious Civil War magazines,  including Civil War Times Illustrated, America's Civil War, Blue & Gray  Magazine, North and South Magazine, and Hallowed Ground and has been  featured as a guest contributor to the Washington Post. His book,  ``Harpers Ferry Under Fire,'' received the national book of the year  award from the Association of Partners for Public Lands. ``September  Suspense: Lincoln's Union in Peril'' was awarded the 2012 Laney Book  Prize for distinguished scholarship and writing on the military and  political history of the Civil War.   Dennis is a highly sought after tour guide, having worked with the  Smithsonian, National Geographic, and numerous colleges and  universities. He has a remarkable gift for storytelling and has  certainly made history a favorite subject for countless students.   West Virginia is great because our people are great--Mountaineers who  will always be free. In fact, when visitors come to West Virginia, I  jump at the chance to tell them about our wonderful State. We have more  veterans per capita than most any State in the Nation. We have fought  in more wars, shed more blood, and lost more lives for the cause of  freedom than most any State. We have always done the heavy lifting and  never complained. We have mined the coal and forged the steel that  built the guns, ships, and factories that have protected and continue  to protect our country. I am so deeply proud of what our citizens have  accomplished and what they will continue to accomplish in the days and  years ahead.   Dennis has been a vital part of keeping the legacy of our State alive  and inspiring the next generation to research, learn, and appreciate  what makes West Virginia so special.   While he is retiring and everyone is sure to miss his strong  leadership, Dennis's unwavering dedication passion for his work will  leave a lasting legacy with the countless lives he has touched. I am  sincerely grateful for his remarkable work and for showcasing our  beautiful State to the rest of the Nation. I am deeply honored to wish  good health and much happiness to Dennis and his family in the days and  years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the legacy  of a trailblazing musician and conductor from beautiful Wheeling, WV:  Everett Lee.   Everett has not only been witness to changes in the classical music  industry in the last century, but he has been an integral part of the  change as well. His story began while working at a hotel in Cleveland,  OH, where he met the Cleveland Orchestra music director, Artur  Rodzinkski. The director, having already heard of Everett's remarkable  talent, invited him to attend concerts on Saturdays. Rodzinkski was a  mentor to Everett and inspired him to continue his violin training and  eventually enroll at the Cleveland Institute of Music.   Everett enlisted in the military of June 1943, serving as an aviation  cadet at the Tuskegee Army Air Field. Following an injury in the  military, Everett made his way to New York to serve in the orchestra  for Broadway's ``Carmen Jones,'' a reimagining of Bizet's opera with an  all African-American cast. One evening, the conductor was unable to  attend a performance, and  [[Page S1376]]  Everett stepped up to fill the role, a move that launched his talent  and professionalism into the spotlight.   In 1945, Everett served as the music director of ``On the Town,'' a  groundbreaking show for having an integrated cast. Still, despite his  success, Everett faced adversity and was once advised against  auditioning for a seat in the New York Philharmonic. Many thought the  South would not yet embrace him either. His response was to aim even  higher and pursue an even more challenging career path as a conductor.  In 1947, he founded the Cosmopolitan Symphony, which became famous for  its inclusion of all ethnicities and backgrounds.   In time, Everett was invited by national and international symphonies  to conduct, including the Louisville Symphony, which in 1953 made  Everett the first African-American to lead a major symphony orchestra  in the U.S. South. He went on to break even more barriers and rise  above any challenge that came his way. Conducting an acclaimed New York  City Opera production of ``La Traviata'' in 1955 made him the first  African-American to conduct a professional grand opera in the United  States.   Deciding that he would find better opportunities outside of America,  Everett and his family moved to Germany in 1957. He held the position  as chief conductor of the Norrkoping Symphony Orchestra in Sweden for a  decade. In 1976, he conducted the New York Philharmonic for the first  time. It was a concert in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which  was particularly fitting; both men held the ideal that they could  embody the change they wanted to see in the world and created  opportunities for those who wanted to follow in their footsteps.   Time and time again, sheer talent and strength of character have  transcended societal obstacles. It is because of individuals such as  Everett Lee that countless musicians, regardless of their background or  ethnicity, have pursued their dreams.   On his 100th birthday, the Mayor of Wheeling designated August 31 as  ``Everett Lee Day'' so we could all celebrate his extraordinary talent  and strength of character. We are truly blessed to have such an  international treasure as a part of our West Virginia family. Again, it  is a great honor and privilege to recognize his many accomplishments,  and I wish him and his family the very best.                            ____________________
