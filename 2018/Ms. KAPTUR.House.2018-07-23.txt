 Mr. Speaker, like a bull in a china shop, President Trump  bulldozed his way through the NATO summit, offending our allies, and  then in Helsinki was shamefully servile to Russia's autocratic ruler,  Vladimir Putin. Autocrat Putin boasts a long list of brutal and violent  threats to liberty here at home and abroad.   In early 2014, Russian forces illegally invaded Ukraine's Crimea and  the Donbass region. Thousands have been killed and millions of  Ukrainians displaced.   On February 27, 2015, Russian freedom fighter, Boris Nemtsov, was  gunned down outside the Kremlin's crimson walls.   In the 2016 election, Russian intelligence services used social media  and cyber attacks to target our democratic elections and those of  several of our allies.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 58 Russian  journalists have been brutally murdered since 1992.   Mr. Speaker, Russia is ``Murder Incorporated'' under Putin's  abhorrent rule.   I include in the Record a long list of some of Russia's brutal,  murderous actions.    Brutal and Undemocratic Actions of Dictator Vladimir Putin's Russia         2000--Putin was supposed to face a second-round runoff in       the 2000 presidential election, had it not been for       widespread fraud. Biased coverage by large media outlets       controlled by the Russian state and Kremlin supporters can be       accredited for this. (Freedom House)        2003--Mikhail Khodorkovsky is arrested by Russian       authorities and charged with fraud. The trial was criticized       for lack of due process. Charges against him were grounded in       reasonable suspicion.        2003--Russia ranked 86 out of 133 countries in Transparency       International's 2003 Corruption Perceptions Index.        2003--Russia saw a significant deterioration of fundamental       rights and the emergence of an increasingly aggressive       foreign  [[Page H6636]]       policy, reflecting the consolidation of power by former       security and military officers. Russia's constitutional court       struck down key provisions of the law that banned journalists       from making positive or negative observations about       candidates or parties.        2006 October 7--Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who       exposed the corruption of the Russian army and its conduct in       Chechnya, was shot and killed in the lobby of her apartment.        2006--Alexander Litvinenko is poisoned. Litvinenko was a       former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)       and KGB, who fled from court prosecution in Russia and       received political asylum in the United Kingdom.        2008--Russia wages a war against Georgia. Today, thousands       of Russian troops occupy Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region,       which constitutes about 20% of Georgia's internationally       recognized territory. Russia has never fulfilled its       obligations under the Six-Point Cease-Fire Agreement (also       known as the Sarkozy Plan) that ended the fighting.        2010: Polish Air Force Tu-154 Crash over Smolensk, Russia.       Antoni Macierewicz (Poland's defense minister) claims the       fatal crash which killed Poland's President Lech Kaczynski,       the First Lady and 94 others in 2010 in Russia was preceded       by two explosions on board. A previous Polish government       concluded that pilot error was to blame for the crash, but       Law and Justice ordered a new investigation which concluded       this year that the plane was brought down by explosions on       board. No international analysis was allowed by Russia.        2013--Putin signs law banning gay publications. ``It       officially declares that gays and lesbians are inferior       beings,'' says Elena Klimova, a gay rights activist in Russia       who was convicted under the law in 2014.        2014--Putin illegally invades Ukraine. More than 10,000       have been killed, and millions of Ukrainians have been       displaced.        2014--Russia occupies Crimean Peninsula and nearly ten       thousand Crimean Tatars are displaced from their homes.       Russia under the Putin regime has violated UN human rights,       and infringements of the Geneva Convention.        2014--Russian forces shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight       MH17 over occupied Ukrainian territory, killing 298 innocent       passengers. Russia attempts to use disinformation and       propaganda to cover up obfuscate the truth of its brutality.        2014--Human rights abuses in Russia are more prevalent than       ever. The LGBTQ+ community is targeted. Independent media       report that 31 civilians were killed in the first nine months       of 2014. Abduction-style detentions, torture, and enforced       disappearances persisted in the North Caucasus, as did       attacks against government critics, the report says, adding       that the situation is particularly bad in Dagestan.        2014--Oleg Sentsov, Ukrainian filmmaker, is arrested under       charges of running ``terrorist organizations'' in Crimea.        2015--Natalya Sharina, the director of the Ukrainian       Literature Library in Moscow, was put under house arrest in       2015 under the charges of inciting ethnic hatred and       spreading ``anti-Russian propaganda.''        2015--Journalist Boris Nemstov is shot and killed. Nemstov       was planning on leading a rally to protest the war in Ukraine       days before his killing.        2016--Russian authorities arrested Roman Sushchenko, a       Ukrainian journalist with the state news service, Ukrinform,       on dubious espionage charges.        2016--Russia attacks U.S. election. Wisconsin, Ohio,       California and 10 other states said they were among 21 states       that Russian government hackers targeted in an effort to sway       the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump       though no votes were changed.        Federal and congressional intelligence groups that have       stated that Russia interfered in the election: CIA, Office of       the Director of National Intelligence, FBI, NSA, Justice       Department, House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence       Committee.        2017: In December, the Central Election Commission banned       opposition leader Aleksey Navalny from challenging Putin in       the 2018 presidential election, removing from the contest the       only credible opposition to have announced a campaign.        2017--Russian authorities banned the activities of the       Jehovah's Witnesses, which was deemed an extremist group.        2017: Investigative journalist and Novy Peterburg cofounder       Nikolay Andrushchenko died in April, weeks after he was       severely beaten, and Dmitriy Popkov, editor of the       investigative online outlet Ton-M, was shot to death in May.        2017--Workers on stadiums built for the 2017 FIFA       Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup reported exploitation,       including non-provision of contracts, non-payment of wages,       and retaliation for reporting abuses. The Building and       Woodworkers International trade union reported at least 17       deaths on stadiums since construction began.        2017--By February 2017, the number of people imprisoned for       extremist speech spiked to 94, from 54 in 2015.        2017--In the first six months of 2017 alone, the number of       people administratively punished by Russian authorities for       supposedly violating the country's regulations on public       gatherings was two-and-a-half times higher than throughout       2016.        2017--Denis Voronenkov, a onetime Communist member of       Russia's lower house of parliament, dies after being shot       outside a hotel in Kyiv. President Poroshenko calls the       shooting a ``Russian state terrorist act.'' Voronenkov, who       fled to Ukraine in 2016, is the latest in a string of Putin       and Russia's critics who were killed or injured under       mysterious circumstances.        2017--Russia interferes in the French election between       opponents Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. The Macron       presidential campaign accused the Kremlin of election       meddling, saying that servers belonging to the team were       hacked by a group likely to be associated with Russia.        2018--Father and daughter Sergei and Yulia Skripal are       poisoned. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson said on 16       March that it was ``overwhelmingly likely'' that the       poisoning had been ordered directly by Russian president       Putin, which marked the first time the British government       accused Vladimir Putin of personally ordering the poisoning.        2018: Donald Trump accepts Putin's lies on Russian       interference in U.S. elections over statement from U.S.       Intelligence Community: ``My people came to me, Dan Coats       came to me and some others, they think it's Russia. I have       President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I will say       this; I don't see any reason why it would be. I have great       confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you       that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his       denial today.'' --Trump, Helsinki Conference 2018     Mr. Speaker, I urge our President to see Putin for what  he is: an enemy of liberty, not a competitor.                            ____________________
