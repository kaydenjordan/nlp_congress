 Mr. President, I rise also in opposition to the  nomination of John Kenneth Bush. Mr. Bush, who has been nominated to  serve as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, has the dubious  distinction of having anonymously written scores of blog posts that  aren't just offensive--which, believe me, they are--but that call into  question the nominee's ability to be a fair and impartial arbiter of  the law, which is the job of a judge, especially a circuit court judge.  In my view, the nominee's lengthy record of inflammatory and  intemperate writings stands as evidence that Mr. Bush falls far short  of the high standards that the Senate should demand of nominees to the  Federal bench.   Over the course of nearly 10 years, Mr. Bush wrote under the  pseudonym ``G. Morris.'' He wrote under a pseudonym on a political blog  operated by his wife, where he published hundreds of incendiary posts.   Let me be absolutely clear. Being politically active or expressing  political opinions is not a disqualifying characteristic in a judicial  nominee--at least, not in my view. But as I said during Mr. Bush's  hearing, it is important for the Senate, in attempting to determine  whether a nominee is qualified to serve as a Federal judge, to assess  that nominee's judgment as a judge--to assess his or her judgement--and  that is what I would like the President and all our Members to  consider.   In the hundreds upon hundreds of posts that Mr. Bush anonymously  published on his wife's blog, Mr. Bush did not demonstrate what any  Member of this body would characterize as good judgment. It was far  from it. During his hearing, I questioned the nominee about a series of  posts in which he seemed to fixate on President Obama's Kenyan  heritage. In one post, Mr. Bush discussed an article that suggested a  reporter was detained by the Kenyan Government because he was  investigating ``Barack Obama's connections in the country'' and that  authorities had locked up the reporter in order to prevent him from  publishing what he discovered. The article Mr. Bush quoted from and  linked to was published on World Net Daily, a website known for  peddling conspiracy theories, bogus claims, and White nationalism. In  fact, World Net Daily is widely known for trafficking in birtherism-- the widely debunked and racist belief that President Obama was not born  in this country. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush presented the World Net Daily  article as fact. This is a guy who has been nominated to be a circuit  court judge calling a World Net Daily article fact.   So during his confirmation hearing, I asked Mr. Bush--and I asked him  over and over again--how he decided which sources to rely upon in his  writings and how he determined a particular source was credible. In my  view, whether a nominee is capable of discerning real news from fake  news or blogs that traffic in conspiracy theories from legitimate  journalism directly speaks to the nominee's judgment. Again, the job is  judge. Really now, World Net Daily?   Whether and how a nominee evaluates the credibility of a claim or a  source of information provides a window into how he might approach the  factual record in a case, for example. That is what judges do. But Mr.  Bush couldn't answer my question. Instead, he said: ``As a blogger, I  was finding things that were in the news that were of note, I  thought.'' In response to a written question I posed, Mr. Bush said  that rather than perform original research to support his claims, he  instead ``relied upon readily available sources on the internet.'' That  would be the prestigious internet. Really? Really? From a nominee for  the circuit court?   This begs the question: How did Mr. Bush find these articles? Does  the nominee consume a steady diet of disinformation and conspiracy  theories? I asked him that question in writing. Mr. Bush responded that  he did not remember how he came upon those sources and that, in fact,  aside from the articles he quoted, he did not recall reading any  articles from those sources, despite the fact that he linked to and  quoted liberally from conspiracy-minded websites many, many times in  his writings.   Despite Mr. Bush's claims that he can't remember how it was that  World Net Daily found its way onto his computer screen and despite his  claim that he can't recall how he discovered and then later cited the  writings of a birther conspiracy theorist, I suspect that in Mr. Bush's  case, the simplest explanation is probably the right one. I suspect the  reason Mr. Bush quoted from sources like World Net Daily so frequently  is that Mr. Bush frequented those sources, that he frequently read the  material they published, and I suspect he enjoyed it. That is just a  suspicion based on my judgment.   The fact that a man who anonymously wrote inflammatory and offensive  blog posts and who consumed information from sources that routinely  publish lies and racially insensitive material could be confirmed to a  lifetime appointment on one of the U.S. courts of appeals should shock  the conscience of each and every Member of the Senate, no matter what  your politics are.   I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 8 years, and during that  time I have had the opportunity to evaluate countless judicial  nominees. I understand that each Senator has his or her own way of  determining whether a nominee should be confirmed. Some Senators prefer  nominees who embrace a judicial philosophy of originalism or strict  constructionism, others reject that view. For some Senators, a  nominee's view of the Second Amendment or Roe v. Wade serves as a  litmus test.   Setting aside the usual yardsticks by which we measure judicial  nominees, Mr. Bush should strike each and every  [[Page S4073]]  Member of this body as manifestly unqualified, by any measure. Through  his writings alone--and I urge all of my colleagues simply to look at  his writings on his blog or on his wife's blog that he wrote with a  pseudonym. They are awful. They are disgraceful.   Please, I beg my colleagues, read these and say to yourself: Are  these writings the writings of a man--no matter what his leanings are  in terms of how constitutional law should be decided, what his  philosophy is, whether conservative, progressive, or liberal--how we  can confirm someone to the circuit court, to a Federal judgeship for  life, who writes anonymously these awful, incendiary things, relying on  sources that are known for spreading hatred and linking to them. I  don't think we have been here before. I don't think we have been here  before.   I would beg my colleagues, before you cast this vote--I believe you  could not justify to your constituents, that you could not justify to  your family--please read these blog posts by this nominee and check  your conscience--not at the door, check it. This is one of those  incredibly unusual circumstances where somebody comes before us who, I  believe, is uniquely unqualified for the job.   Thank you.                            ____________________
