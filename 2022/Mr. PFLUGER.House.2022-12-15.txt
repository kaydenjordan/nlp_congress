 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom Green  County Judge Steve Floyd, a faithful leader of our community who is  retiring from elected office at the end of this year.   Judge Floyd has dedicated his life to our community with more than 30  years of service as justice of the peace, county commissioner, and now  as county judge.   Whether he was leading the county, handing down justice, or just  mowing the courthouse lawn, he led with wisdom and kindness.   Judge Floyd had a monumental impact on the partnership between San  Angelo and Goodfellow Air Force Base, where his community leadership  and visionary ideas strengthened the bond and paved the way for San  Angelo to receive three unprecedented Altus Award trophies for  exceptional community partnership, more than any other base has  received.   Judge Floyd's retirement is bittersweet today. If you are watching  this morning, Judge, please know that we are not just saying farewell  to a good friend and a good leader but someone who has been an  incredible public servant for over 30 years.   We are grateful for the decades of service to our community, and we  wish you the very best in your upcoming retirement. Congratulations on  a job well done, Judge Floyd.                            ____________________
