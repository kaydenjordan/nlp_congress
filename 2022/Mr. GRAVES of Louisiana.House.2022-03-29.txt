 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank  Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Sam Graves, Subcommittee Chair  Carbajal, and Ranking Member Gibbs for their bipartisan efforts on this  legislation. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi), my friend, for working with us to ensure that American  mariners are given a level playing field, and I want to thank all  Members involved for the efforts to help to bolster the Coast Guard.   Mr. Speaker, the Coast Guard is often described as a Swiss Army  knife. You take all the laws that are enforced on terrestrial grounds,  and we effectively put all of those on the Coast Guard men and women to  be carried out or enforced on America's oceans, on our seas, and our  near-shore waters. This is an incredible task. Everything from maritime  safety, maritime security, counter drug, alien interdiction and many,  many other missions.   We have got to make sure if we are going to ask them to do such a  challenging task that we give them the equipment. This bill authorizes  the twelfth National Security Cutter. It authorizes six of the Fast  Response Cutter, the Sentinel-class vessels that are going to bring  better interoperability, better offensive capabilities, faster transit  speed, the ability to operate in much more adverse conditions in regard  to sea state, many, many other things.   This also includes a provision that Don Young included that prohibits  Russian vessels from being in Alaskan waters, and I think that is very  important, especially considering what we are going through right now.  I think that is absolutely critical.   It also includes a provision that Congressman Huffman and I worked on  on a bipartisan basis to ensure that AIS, the automatic identification  system, requirements for fishing vessels of certain sizes are being  applied to prevent illegal fishing or fishing that is beyond catch  limits in our waters, so very, very important legislation being  advanced today.   I want to thank everybody for working on it and, most importantly, I  want to thank the fact that this bill is being named after Congressman  Don Young. This is much deserved. I had the chance to work for him  under John Rayfield when he was chair and absolutely very much deserve.  I support the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and submit extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).                                time  1845     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from  California.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber) that  served on both the National Resources Committee and the House  Transportation Committee with Congressman Young.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    I thank my friend from Louisiana for his  heartfelt message.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).  [[Page H3958]]         I thank my friend from Florida.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman), the ranking member of the House Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Speaker, it is an honor to yield to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority  leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Maryland for his remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Don Young served in this Chamber for nearly five  decades, for nearly 50 years. Prior to that, he was a teacher, a  trapper, a gold miner, a boat captain, a legislator--an incredible  background for somebody to serve in this Chamber, such a diverse  background and diverse experiences.   I was in a meeting with him last year at the White House, and he  stood up and said to President Biden: I need a picture with you. I have  had a picture with nine other Presidents, and I need one with you.   I mean, just think about that, with nine other Presidents that he  worked with, that he served with. The history there is unbelievable.   Everybody in this Chamber has a Don Young story. Everybody has an  interaction that is incredibly memorable.   One of them that I won't forget is when we were at the White House  and a bill was being signed into law that opened up the energy  production in Alaska in an area--I think he told me he had been working  on this for 30 years. He was so excited about it, and he turned around,  looks back, and says: What I lack in intelligence, I make up for in  perseverance.   Thirty years to get something done, but he wasn't going to stop.   There are so many stories about Don Young and that famous knife. That  knife has been pulled out and involved in so many stories across that  50 years. I will bet that everybody in this Chamber has a story about  that knife.   I believe there have been over 2,170 Members of the House who served  with Don Young, and I think that all of them have a story of the knife.   I was standing in the back of the Cannon Caucus Room during a  Conference meeting where there was a heated discussion about changes in  indirect spending, and Don Young took it to the back of the room with  the then-Speaker of the House, John Boehner. Don is right up in Speaker  Boehner's face. I think that this is covered in Speaker Boehner's book.  He got right up in his face, and he is yelling at him. Don takes that  knife out--and to be clear, it was not open--but he had that knife  right at the Speaker's neck. The Speaker's security detail starts  walking in, and Boehner looks at them, and he is like, no, he is  harmless.   There are so many stories, and they are all true--so many more. But I  also want to say that while many people view this and believe this is  the Don Young, the Don Young with the scowl that is portrayed in the  media, I think this is the Don Young that so many of us actually know.   Don Young would swear. He would scream. He would yell. He would have  his growls and his scowl. But this is the Don Young that we knew. He  was a grizzly bear on the outside, but Don Young was a teddy bear on  the inside.   I have been subjected to the yelling and the screaming and cursing  and everything else, and I finally realized after years that I could  just go to him and say, ``Don, shut up,'' and he would just make that  face and start chuckling, the biggest teddy bear of a man.   There is a lot more to Don Young.   This is Don Young and Congressman George Miller, who was the ranking  member of the House Natural Resources Committee. This was in the late  nineties.   Don Young actually enacted 123 pieces of legislation, one of the most  successful legislators to ever serve in this body.   This picture was taken after years of negotiation among these folks.  This is Congressman Chris John of Louisiana, as well as the famous  Congressman John Dingell of Michigan and Congressman Billy Tauzin of  Louisiana. This was landmark conservation legislation that these guys  worked on.   Don recognized the art of the deal. He recognized when you could  actually get something done working together with other people. I will  say it again, with 123 bills signed into law, Don was an amazing  legislator.   He was also tough as nails. Something that people don't know, and I  will go ahead and violate his HIPAA privacy here: Don Young was  scheduled to have back surgery this week. He goes to the doctor, ``I  have been having back pain,'' and folks will remember him walking  around with a cane. He goes and gets a back X-ray and an MRI. He had a  broken back. He had a broken back and was walking around, continuing to  do his job fighting for the people of Alaska with a broken back. Don, I  will say it again, was tough as nails.   Madam Speaker, to the citizens of Alaska, I would like to tell you  that Don Young absolutely bled for your State. He fought for it; he  defended it; and he bled for the State of Alaska. I will tell you that  I know this because I worked for him. I had the honor of working for  Chairman Young on the Transportation Committee, and it was always  Alaska first.  [[Page H3960]]    There is a huge alumni class of hundreds and hundreds of people. I  would tease Don all the time that I was the only person that was able  to overcome the stigma of Don Young and make something of myself. I  said that in jest, I want to be clear to the hundreds of Don Young  alumni who are out there that is a phenomenal group of people.   Some people advocate for term limits in this body, and I agree. I  think that term limits should happen. I think that some people when  they are here for 2 weeks it is pretty clear that they should be term- limited.   But I will also tell you that Don Young, after nearly five decades  fighting for the State of Alaska, he shouldn't have been subjected to  term limits. He fought for that State every single day.                                time  1930    On the Wednesday before his death, he and I stood right over on the  side of this Chamber, he was in his wheelchair, and we had a  conversation. He was talking about the House versus the Senate. He was  talking about how in the Senate, his senators had to work together and  figure it out.   He talked about how, for Alaska, he was the people's voice. He was  the only one. He was the people's voice. There was no delegation to  fight with or negotiate with. It was Don--a State that is nearly one- fifth the size of the Continental United States; three times the State  of Texas. Take that, Texas.   Many people believe that the fact that Alaska has one Member of  Congress is because of a pesky little thing called the Census, or  counting population, or the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I submit to this body that the reason the State of  Alaska has just one Member is because all you needed was Don Young.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  distinguished gentlewoman from the State of California (Ms. Pelosi),  the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I want to give tribute to  Don's wife Anne and to his daughters, Joni and Dawn, his sister, but  his family goes well beyond that. I have a number of statements from  former alumni of the Don Young staffer world that submitted statements.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record several statements written by  former staffers of Congressman Don Young: Michael Henry, Pamela Day,  C.J. Zane, Sherrie Slick, Duncan Smith, Zack Brown, Jerry Hood, Jim  Coon, Sophia Varnasidis, Lisa Pittman, Colin Chapman, Holly Lyons,  David Schaffer, Jason Suslavich.                               Michael Henry          Staffer to Dean Donald Edwin Young (R-AK)--Personal Office                         (June 1996-November 1997)                         House Committee on Resources                        (November 1997-January 2000)             House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure                       (January 20001-November 2002)         Since the world lost the Dean of the House of       Representatives, Congressman for all Alaska, husband to Anne,       father to Joni and Dawn, friend and mentor, Don Young, I have       been asked several times to share a story or memory. How do       you sum up a person so impactful to your life, such a big       personality and titan legislator? I have been frozen, unable       to share much to encapsulate the man so important to so many,       including my family.        What keeps returning to my mind is the dichotomy of Don       Young. He was both gruff and held as large a heart as anyone       I have ever met. He was strategic in what he did and said and       will be remembered for what appeared as gaffs. He lived       without bias and will be remembered for straight forward       opinions. And he lived every day on his own terms and was one       of the most selfless people I have ever met. Which is why no       one version of Don Young could ever sum the totality of his       complex personality.        While our society is unlikely to allow another trapper       turned tugboat captain turn into a prolific legislator, we       should cherish the brash honesty that accompanied his sincere       caring and steadfast loyalty. While like all of us, I'm sure       he would choose to handle many situations differently with       the benefit of hindsight, I'm not sure he held any regrets.       And for those who disliked, Don Young for the caricature he       was made into, I will say it is that emotion which has fueled       the love the rest of us hold for the Dean of the North.       Nobody likes to be disliked, but that energy became part of       his lore and so many fiercely loyal to him.        One thing that wasn't complicated about Don Young was his       proficiency as a legislator. The numbers simply do not lie.       And, with his passing, we owe him the reflection of what he       truly was--one of the greatest legislators our country will       ever know. Don Young was the original sponsor of 123 bills       signed into Law by 10 Presidents--8 more bills signed into       law than the ``Lion of the Senate'', Ted Kennedy advanced       during his similar time in the Congress. And while that       statistic makes clear his importance to the legislative       branch of government, it was one I don't recall him ever       boasting about.        Don Young was far prouder of his service to the people's       body, the House of Representatives. Which spanned nearly 50       years. He routinely spoke about the 10 Presidents he worked       with and the 2,178 Members of the House of Representatives he       served with. It was the people and the relationships that       mattered to him, not how many votes he made (or missed),       getting the better of an opponent at a hearing or the       deference that was paid to him everywhere he went. He       appreciated a good deal and a real connection to the people       involved. He loved his colleagues and everyone he met with.       These were the people, as he liked to reflect, who taught him       something new every day. And that's what kept him in Congress       for so long--new issues that accompany each Congress and the       recalibration that comes with an ever-evolving body.        As I try to bring a story to close my reflection on       Congressman Don Young, my Chairman on two full Committees,       House Committee on Resources and Transportation and       Infrastructure, I am drawn to the fact that one of the       greatest negotiations of his career occurred during the time       I worked for him. It was a negotiation that had him to       working, and often arguing, with Republicans as forcefully as       Democrats. And ably navigating the Senate as well as a       formidable President Bill Clinton. At one point, his dutiful       staffer (me) added in a relatively junior Congressman Richard       Pombo (R-CA) to a high-level negotiation. Some of us were       concerned that Chairman Young needed a conservative backstop       so as not to give too much to the Democrats as we pursued a       deal. The result was his getting his way with all the various       factions and the crafting the most significant conservation       legislation of the time. Unfortunately, this bill was not one       of the 123 Don Young sponsored that became law, but       nonetheless, one of his greatest legislative achievements.       Even though the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA) was       controversial on the left and right, he won a vote of 315 in       the House. That is legislating and that is what Don Young did       best.        The speed in how fast legislators are forgotten is off       putting, but Don Young's legacy is secure. He was the best       boss hundreds of staff could have dreamed to have. He       empowered us to be creative. He was mostly supportive, even       after a blunder. He always took the time to help us get       better and never begrudged any the opportunity to grow       outside his office with a career move. He spent every day       with a servant's heart. He worked to make the institution of       Congress better and came to work each day seeking       opportunities for Alaskans. We are all a less with his loss.                                   ____                                  Pamela Day                                   Team DY                                (2003-2020)                                Chief of Staff                                (2009-2020)         When I was hired by Congressman Don Young back in 2003, I       had no idea that I would call him ``Boss'' for the next 17       years. I also didn't know that when you joined ``Team DY,''       you instantly inherited dozens, if not hundreds, of new       family members. Because when you worked for Congressman       Young, you were indeed treated like family, and even after       you left the office and moved on to your next job       opportunity, you never truly left. The Don Young alumni       network is vast and full of great people who have gone on to       do impressive things, but we all know that we owe a       tremendous debt of gratitude to Congressman Young for taking       a chance on us and giving us the opportunity of our lives to       do something important--work with him and represent Alaskans.        I was his only female Chief of Staff and the longest to       serve in that position, 12 years. When I would tell people       who didn't know him that I was his Chief, they would look at       me and wonder how I could stay in that position for so long.       It was a tough job, but the truth is, he was a great boss. He       was loyal to a fault. He trusted staff to do the jobs they       were hired to do. He believed that he always had the best       staff on the Hill and was always gracious when one of us       would tell him it was time to move on. He never held anyone       back and was genuinely happy for staffers who left because he       knew that we would always be there for him. And in the days       since his passing, that is exactly what has happened. We've       all been there for each other. Once a DY staffer, always a DY       staffer.        The Congressman had wonderful press staff over the years,       but he was his own best public relations department. There       has been much written about his gruff exterior and, at times,       cantankerous demeanor, but if you actually had the chance to       meet him in person then you know that wasn't who he truly  [[Page H3962]]       was. I can't count the number of times constituents who had       never met him came to DC for a meeting, nervous about sitting       across from this giant personality and asking for his help.       If you were an Alaskan in DC, you met with him; he always       made time for them. They would be taken aback when he       jovially swung open his door and bellowed, ``Who do we have       here?'' followed by a big smile, handshake, and photo       opportunity in front of the giant Alaska map. During       meetings, he would share stories, compare notes about who was       related to who and if he knew their relatives (most times he       did), and then turn the floor over to them to make their       presentation. He loved learning something new every day. He       listened intently and asked thoughtful questions before       signing copies of that picture that was taken just moments       before and thanking them for corning in to see him. But my       favorite memory of working for him is what would happen after       the meeting. Almost inevitably, as they left the office and       headed down the hall, someone would say, ``wow--he's so       different in real life!''        Alaskans will vote to send someone new to Washington to       represent them, but no one will ever replace Congressman       Young. He was one of a kind in every way possible.        I want Alaskans to know that he loved Alaska. He loved       fighting for Alaska. And he never forgot what a truly awesome       gift and responsibility it was to be the Congressman for All       Alaska.                                 C.J. Zane                              DY Chief of Staff                                (1980-1992)                             Former State staffer         Many people who know and love Don Young know that he was       obsessively ``on time'' for meetings and following the       ``schedule'' whether in DC or traveling around Alaska. I was       once traveling in Alaska with Mr. Young and his wife Lu as we       did a series of stops in remote communities via small       aircraft (flown by long-time Young friend Paul Hagland),       which is the way a lot of Alaskans get from place to place.       We were on a tight schedule and Don was getting really       impatient because Lu and are were not plane-side ready to go.       We were each using the restroom in a small building near the       runway. When we emerged and approached the plane Don growled       about our being late. Lu said forcefully (as she could do),       ``Damn it Young, you just relax, we Have To Have Time To Take       Care Of Our Bodily Functions!!'' Needless to say, Mr. Young       knew when he was bested in an argument and needless to say       the rest of community visits went well and we're more or less       on time, but everyone had time to go to the bathroom and       there were no ``accidents'' on the plane. Even Don's vaunted       punctuality had to yield to the reality of the situation and       to the strength of his beloved wife Lu.                               Sherrie Slick     Special Staff Assistant, Ketchikan, Alaska Congressional Office (25                                   Years)    Senators Stevens, Frank Murkowski, Lisa Murkowski, and Congressman                                   Young         C.J. Zane and Congressman Don Young interviewed me and with       the support of Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Frank       Murkowski, hired me in 1987 to work in the Ketchikan       Congressional Office. Subsequently working for Senator Lisa       Murkowski. I retired after 25 years of service to the       delegation. Congressional Record Volume 158 (2012) Part 7.        I have forgotten exactly what bill Congressman Young was       addressing in Congress which had to do with the fishing in       Alaska, but as he encouraged his vote, it was being televised       and I had it on TV in the office. All of a sudden Congressman       Young pounded loudly with his palm on the podium and raised       his voice with some strong language to emphasis the       importance of support for this bill which would support our       fishing industry and the economy of Alaska.        Immediately my 2 phone lines began to light up in the       office. Calls from people who had been watching the       proceedings:        The first call I caught was an elderly lady. In a very soft       and polite voice she asked me to thank Mr. Young for his work       for Alaska but please convey to the Congressman her wishes       that he return his manner of little more decorum in his       passion introducing his bills. The second call was from a       gruff, deep, loud voice: ``I just watched Congressman Young       fighting for fishermen and the industry . . . . thank him and       tell him to continue to give them ``hell'' and keep up his       passion in the good fight for the people and success       Alaska.''        Illustrating that Congressman Don Young could be could       brash and boisterous or gentle and kind . . . . but he was       recognized as always being a strong, dependable ambassador       for Alaska.                                Duncan Smith                                   Team DY                                 (10 years)         I was one of the few lawyers Congressman Young ever hired.       I was his committee counsel on the Merchant Marine and       Fisheries Committee when he was Ranking Member on the Coast       Guard Subcommittee. We had a good laugh when he received a       Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Alaska. It was       my pleasure to serve with him. May he rest in peace.                                 Zack Brown                          DY Communications Director                                (2019-2022)         In the days since his passing, we have rightfully       celebrated Congressman Young's incredible accomplishments and       recalled his larger-than-life personality. Specifically, much       has been said about the gruff demeanor he was known for in       the press. I came on to run Congressman Young's press       operations over three years ago. Back then, all I knew about       the Congressman was his reputation for being cantankerous and       eccentric. Admittedly, he himself was responsible for some       parts of this reputation, but the full picture has never been       understood.        Here is the truth: Don Young did indeed run hot, but not       because of anger or mean-spiritedness. No, Don Young ran hot       because of his warmth, generosity, love of his staff, and       relentless passion for Alaska. ``Team DY'' was and always       will be a family, no matter what era of his career we served       in. Growing up, I never knew my grandfathers. It is       appropriate then that at the helm of this family was       Congressman Young--a man of great maturity, wisdom, and grit       who always had your back. Through him, I learned how to take       on life with his independent spirit and unyielding       authenticity. Team DY laughed, celebrated, and stood together       on behalf of Alaska. Congressman Young was with us every step       of the way, working just as hard as we did. The frequent       downtime in between votes, meetings, and travels across the       state gave us treasured time with the boss we loved. Over the       years, this bond between the Congressman and his staff only       grew stronger, and his loyalty to us underscored just how       much our team meant to him.        Like so many others, the Congressman took a chance on me       and changed my life. He empowered me to always improve myself       and be there for those around me. He truly meant the world to       me, and I will never let anyone forget the work he did for       those around him. I was with him at the end, and it has been       difficult to process everything that happened. In the hours       and days after he passed, I felt enormous grief and anger       over my chance presence on-site as he left this earth. But as       I have had time to reflect, I now see this as a blessing. The       Congressman always trusted us to do the jobs we were hired to       do. On his final day on this earth, it was a tremendous honor       to support this incredible man at the end of his life, and to       put the skills he taught me to use by being there for Anne       and getting him back to the institution he loved. That was my       final assignment from the Congressman, and I hope I made him       proud. I'll miss this irreplaceable man dearly. I take       comfort knowing that his indomitable spirit and unrelenting       optimism will always be my North Star.                                 Jerry Hood                          Director of State Affairs                                (2006-2009)         Our friendship spanned more than four decades. He was truly       a legend in his own time. He accomplished much. You can       travel the entire State of Alaska and everywhere you look you       will see his accomplishments. Don's fingerprints are in every       nook and cranny of the state. He loved Alaska but I will let       others tell you of all he did, and there is much to tell.        If I could describe Don Young in one word it would be:       LOYAL. Yes, LOYAL in all caps. He was LOYAL to a fault. Once       he gave you his loyalty it was forever. He never gave up on       you even though you may have let him down. And sometimes that       loyalty didn't serve him well. However, Don Young didn't       expect loyalty in return for his. You see, that's the kind of       guy he was. He was LOYAL to his state. He was LOYAL to       Alaskans, he was LOYAL to his friends and he was LOYAL to his       family. I can assure you that every decision he ever made was       first and foremost made in the best interests of Alaska and       its citizens. Alaska is a much better place because of       Congressman Don Young.        He spoke his mind. He told you what he thought. He never       broke with his values. He was true to himself from the first       day he took the oath until the day he died. Some say that       Washington changed Don but I can tell you that up until       Friday, March 18th, he was the same man as the guy I first       met in 1976. There aren't many politicians over the course of       history you can say that about. But then, he was one of a       kind.        He went out the way he wanted. In the saddle.        My fondest memories of Don were the times when we were able       to steal an hour or two fishing on the Naknek River. Just the       two of us. Our favorite cigars, fishing poles in hand and for       a few moments in time--just relaxing. We were fishing. We       certainly weren't catching. But we didn't care. Farewell my       old friend. I will miss you terribly.                                  Jim Coon          Staff Director, Aviation Subcommittee, Transportation and                          Infrastructure Committee                                (2004-2012)         A former Transportation & Infrastructure Aviation       Subcommittee Staff Director under Chairman Young, I recall       several mornings when he would call me from his office. I       knew he had someone with him because he always had you on the       speaker phone--and when he did this he almost always had       constituents from Alaska with him.        He would call and start out very nice, how's your morning,       did you get your beauty sleep, etc., and then on the turn of       a dime in his most powerful and loud voice he would  [[Page H3963]]       say--``that bill you are working on for me, I don't want to       see the word _ in that bill, not on _ time, do you hear me!!!       And if I see it, there will be hell to pay. Have a nice       day!'' It was poetic.                            Sophia A. Varnasidis                          Resources Committee Staff                                (2004-2017)         I had stopped by Rep. Young's office to DY's Chief of       Staff, Pamela Day, as I would often do at the end of the work       day early in 2009. Rep. Doc Hastings had just taken over as       Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Committee,       which DY held the previous Congress. DY came into Pam's       office, sat down next to me and said ``how you doing' young       lady? They taking care of you over there?'' To which I       answered, ``yes, of course'' and thanked him for asking. He       then chatted with us for a bit, and left for the evening.        I still makes me tear-up thinking about the kindness he       showed me in that moment. He lost his Ranking Membership, and       yet was concerned his staff that was held over under new       leadership were taken care of. I went through 4 changes of       leadership in my 13 years at Natural Resources, but DY was       singular in his love for his staff. Invited us over to his       home for Kentucky Derby viewing, threw the biggest Christmas       parties, and stayed to hold court and tell stories in his       office for hours. His personality was bigger than life, but       so was his heart. The media loved to cover him in his more       animated moments, but his real friends and those who worked       for him knew him to be fiercely loyal, and a caring and kind       soul. The true King in the North. May his memory be eternal.                                Lisa Pittman                 Deputy Chief Counsel, Committee on Resources                                (1995-2001)                                Chief Counsel                                (2001-2020)         DY's first wife, Mrs. Lu Young, attended the first       Committee on Resources markup chaired by DY and sat in the       back row. Halfway through, she sent a note up to the       Chairman. We were a little nervous about what she might say.       Mrs. Young may have been petite, but she was fierce and       thoroughly had the big gruff Don Young wrapped around her       little finger. The note, which he opened in front of me (I       sat to his immediate left during markups) said ``Smile       more.'' And he did.        Don Young was also instrumental in the House rules change       that allowed certain votes to be postponed and then voted in       series in committee. Like many other nonexclusive committees,       the Committee on Resources' members served on multiple       committees and given scheduling demands often had to be in       two places at once. Maintaining quorums and vote margins was       increasing difficult. DY successfully argued to the       Parliamentarian, House leadership and the Rules Committee       that if the Speaker could allow such action on the Floor, the       practice should be allowed in committee. As one of the most       active committees in the House, the Committee on Resources       certainly took advantage of the rule to produce more       substantive bills for the floor than just about any other       committee. And staff had fewer heart attacks.        Finally, DY taught me to always bring at least three copies       of any remarks/talking points staff had prepared for him to       the House Floor. I'd usually hand him one when he first       reached the chamber and settled back in the unofficial Don       Young seat on the aisle in the last row of the right rear of       the chamber. Somehow he inevitably managed to misplace it       before our bill was called up (no doubt distracted by the       many Members who stopped by to talk to him). He'd often       signal me to give me another copy before we began. I keep the       third in the front of my Floor notebook for when he ambled       down the aisle to take his place at the manager's table,       sometimes with the talking points out of order or missing a       page. It didn't really matter much anyway--he rarely followed       the script and often spoke more eloquently from the heart       than any words typed out by staff.                               Colin Chapman                                Chief of Staff                                (1997-2002)         A story from my tenure as Chief of Staff, 1997-2002 on the       mischievous side of Chairman Young: In the late nineties and       early 2000's, the Alaska delegation was at one of its highest       points as far as seniority and power was concerned. The House       and the Senate were controlled by the Republicans. All three       members of the delegation, Rep. Young, Sen. Stevens, and Sen.       Frank Murkowski, had 20 or more years of seniority. They were       each Chairman of powerful committees. They were each, in       their own right, a powerful Member of Congress that liked to       control legislation and have things done THEIR WAY! And they       each had the strong, sometimes combustible, personality you       might expect of a Senior Member of Congress with Alaskan       heritage.        In public, the Alaska delegation created and performed as a       united front. But the delegation meetings- That was a       different story . . . In the late 90's, the delegation was       working on opening Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), an       ongoing battle that replayed Congress after Congress. I       remember one delegation meeting where ANWR was the primary       discussion topic. The delegation was trying to decide how to       best move the legislation, and as always, the Senate side       strategy was the sticking point. Sen. Murkowski wanted to       move the legislation via the committee of jurisdiction,       Energy & Natural Resources, which he just happened to Chair.       Sen Stevens wanted to move it via an Appropriations and       Reconciliation process, a route that he controlled as       Chairman of Appropriations. Don Young's position was for the       Senate to pull their heads out of the . . . sand, pass the       bill in whichever way they could, and he would get it done on       the House side.        At one particular meeting, held on Sen Stevens' turf in his       Capitol hideaway office, Chairman Young and Chairman       Murkowski were present at the appointed time with their       Chiefs of Staff. Stevens was late. After about 15 minutes of       waiting, the Junior Senator was getting antsy. He had       explained his plan for the ENR Committee while waiting and       why his committee was the best option. After about 20 minutes       of waiting, Sen. Stevens waltzed into the room. Effusively       apologizing for being late and launching into his plan of why       the Appropriation route was so much better than the ENR       route. Having just listened to the 15 minute ENR pitch,       Chairman Young knew that nothing would get accomplished at       this meeting because the Senate delegation's path forward was       still unclear.        Mr. Young, who was standing in between the two Senators,       popped off a comment about how the one Senator thought the       other Senator didn't have a clue what he was talking about.       This launched the two Senators into a heated personal       argument. DY looked at me, chuckled, and said, ``Let's go       Colin, my work here is done . . .'' As we left, DY was still       chuckling to himself and commented about how much fun it was       to light the fuse and walk out of the room.        As always, the delegation circled the wagons and pushed       forward with a united front. The ANWR fight wasn't successful       that year, but Chairman Young did eventually see it through!                            Holly Woodruff Lyons         My favorite memory of Chairman Young was during my first       year-and-a-half as a Committee staffer. I have to admit I was       initially a bit intimidated by Chairman Young. However, that       all changed in 2003. In October of that year, a toy gun was       brought to the House Offices by a staffer as part of a       Halloween costume. It set off a security scare and the       Capitol was locked down for several hours as the police       looked for the ``gun''.        I happened to be on the Floor with a few other T&I Members       and staff as we had a bill on the schedule. Chairman Young       was with us. There was quite a bit of confusion that day and       things were already tense in the post-9/11 world. I will       never forget how Chairman Young chose to come over and sit       with his staff. He spent the time entertaining us while       providing a calm, steady and unflappable example. He regaled       us with one story after another of his time on the Hill.       These stories, as you can imagine, were both funny and       amazing, but I will not repeat them here. He also shared with       us his knowledge of the House Floor by pointing out things in       the Chamber and sharing interesting historical facts. He       literally had a captive audience, but we did not feel like       hostages. After that day, I was no longer intimidated by the       Chairman. He always commanded respect, but I had seen his fun       and friendly side. (The soft side of the grizzly bear, so to       speak.)                               David Schaffer             Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Staffer                                (1984-2004)         A passage from the book ``After: How America Confronted the       September 12 Era) by Steven Brill, which illustrates Chairman       Young's no-nonsense approach to his position as       Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair, in the       wake of 9/11:        ``But he (Staff Director Schaffer) was also a stickler for       legislative procedure, which means hearings and debate, and       more hearings and more debate, and drafts and redrafts before       anything important is allowed to pass. So he was shocked on       Monday when is boss, Congressman Don Young, the burly Alaska       Republican who chaired the Transportation Committee, told him       that they had to pass a bill within a day or two. When he       protested that something this important and unprecedented,       not to mention expensive, never moved that fast, Young       thundered, ``We're at war, we have to do this now.''                              Jason Suslavich                       DY-Congressional Office Staffer                                (2008-2015)         While Don Young focused on transportation and resource       development, he was also a diehard champion of missile       defense. In fact, what many do not know the leading role that       Don played in locating our homeland missile defenses in       Alaska. In 1995, the Clinton Administration adopted a       national intelligence estimate (NIE) which made one very       startling conclusion--namely that U.S. homeland would not       face the threat of a missile attack until at least 2010.       Absurdly, the NIE arrived at this conclusion by excluding       threats to Alaska and Hawaii, as if only the contiguous       forty-eight states needed protection.        Learning of this critical policy failure, Don jumped into       action and introduced the ``The All-American Resolution.''       This important legislation expressed Congress' view that       ``any missile defense system deployed to protect the United       States against the threat  [[Page H3964]]       of ballistic missile attack should include protection for       Alaska, Hawaii, the territories and the commonwealths of the       United States on the same basis as the contiguous States.''       Language from this resolution was soon adopted into National       Defense Authorization (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1999 and enacted       into law. This language helped to set the stage for the U.S.       to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)       Treaty, thereby allowing us to build our nation's first       homeland missile defense system at Fort Greely, Alaska--a       location which would protect ALL fifty states.        From that point on, Don continued to strongly support       missile defense. He fought for defense budgets that were       driven by strategy, not defense strategies that were driven       budgets. For decades, he ensured critical military       construction for our missile defense systems--located at Fort       Greely, Clear Air Force Station, and Eareckson Air Station--      expeditiously passed the House and were fully funded.        Then in 2017, amidst a resurgent North Korean threat, Don       Young again championed our cause. He--along with Senator Dan       Sullivan (the bill's original author)--sponsored the       ``Advancing America's Missile Defense Act of 2017'' and led       the charge to include it into the House's FY 2018 NDAA.       Critically, this bill authorized an increase to our nation's       Ground-based Interceptor capacity by 50% and it laid the       groundwork for the construction of a new missile field at       Fort Greely--Missile Field 4--to house that added capacity.       During the debate on his amendment, the Congressman stated,        ``I believe this reckless and calculated behavior by the       North Korean regime speaks volumes to the importance of the       strategically placed U.S. missile defense capabilities,       including the Ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, AK       and other elements of the nation's ballistic missile defense       system. These forces guard this nation and are the first       responders against weapons of mass destruction.''        He was right then and his words ring even more true today.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.
