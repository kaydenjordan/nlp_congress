 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of  Delaware's congressional delegation in honor of the 100th anniversary  of Delaware's first radio station, WDEL. The station was born on July  22, 1922, when amateur radio operator and shop owner Willard Wilson  aired the first news reports and music out of his home in Wilmington,  DE, on what was then WHAV. Over the years, the station changed its call  letters to WDEL and moved out of Wilson's home to various spaces in  downtown Wilmington, where listeners could tune in to hear many famous  ``big bands'' live from the Gold Ballroom of the Hotel Du Pont. Today,  the station has a home on Shipley Road and has grown to provide local  news, talk and traffic reports, with thousands of listeners from  Delaware and our surrounding States tuning in daily to hear from WDEL's  recognizable voices on the airwaves.   Just like our home State's motto, WDEL has been ``first'' many times  when it comes to broadcasting. In 1933, WDEL became one of the first  radio affiliates for Major League Baseball, airing the Philadelphia A's  games. Today, you can still catch the crack of the bat on its signals  101.7 FM or 1150 AM during the Philadelphia Phillies season. WDEL was  also the first in Delaware to provide real-time, locally produced  traffic reports, filling a need when other stations weren't covering  the busy roads in the Delaware region. The station also was one of the  first stations to hire women for on-air positions when it wasn't  popular to do so.   Over the years, WDEL has covered many historic moments in Delaware,  including Presidential visits from Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Lyndon  Johnson, Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and, of course,  Delaware's own Joe Biden. WDEL has also covered the moments that  capture the cultural fabric of Delaware, including broadcasts from the  Greek, Italian, and Polish festivals, as well as the Wilmington Flower  Market, and has a long history of giving back to the community by  supporting Nemours Children's Hospital, Ronald McDonald House, Sunday  Breakfast Mission, and many other children's charities, shelters, and  soup kitchens.   WDEL's dedication to its listeners was awarded numerous times over  the years. WDEL was named Medium Market Station of the Year by the  National Association of Broadcasters--NAB--named News Operation of the  Year by the Chesapeake AP Broadcasters Association several times, and  was honored with the Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence  twice, and the NAB's prestigious Crystal Award for public service.   On behalf of both U.S. Senator Chris Coons and U.S. Representative  Lisa Blunt Rochester, I rise today to honor WDEL radio on a century of  hard work and dedication to serving the community. The station that  started as just one among 100 in the country has withstood a century of  change and innovation and has been recognized as among the best in the  Nation. We wish its employees and listeners many more years of this  incredible news service on the airwaves.                            ____________________
