 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pete Reed, an  alum  [[Page H802]]  of the Community College of Rhode Island and former U.S. Marine who was  killed while on a humanitarian mission delivering aid to evacuees in  Bakhmut, a besieged city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.   Pete dedicated his life to the service of others. He deployed twice  to the Helmand Province in Afghanistan, joined Team Rubicon after  Hurricane Sandy, and helped to train medical teams in both Haiti and  Iraq.   Pete and fellow veteran Derek Coleman decided to form Global Response  Medicine, an NGO dedicated to serving the world's most vulnerable  people in the midst of conflict, war, or disaster after seeing the need  for such an organization during the battle of Mosul in Iraq.   His work brought him to Global Outreach Doctors, which he joined in  January, to lead its efforts in Ukraine.   A remarkable man, Pete Reed was not only a veteran and a humanitarian  but also a mentor to CCRI students and veterans. It is impossible to  know how many lives he touched.   My thoughts and prayers are with Pete's entire family and all those  who loved him and called him a friend.                            ____________________
