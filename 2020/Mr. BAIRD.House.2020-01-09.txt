 Mr. Speaker, I have just got a couple of words I would  like to remind this body about. I have heard a lot of talk about  patriotism, and I gave this arm in Vietnam.   I have got a lot of good friends whose names are on the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial Wall, so don't talk to me about patriotism, and how  much I love this country when we are standing here debating an issue  that we all know is not going anywhere.   The last thing I would say to you is, while I was serving in Vietnam,  there were many occasions when I didn't have the ability to do what I  thought was necessary. I just say to you that this body couldn't make  up their mind whether they wanted to be in that war or not, and I  suggest we get with the right program and do it now.
