 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to honor the life  of a family man, a entrepreneur, a community member, and a friend.   Don Camerino Gonzalez Valle, who passed away last week, embodied the  American Dream. Camerino and his dad came to the U.S. to work in the  Bracero program, just like my father had.   Camerino didn't fear hard work. He worked in the field, at  meatpacking plants, as a taxi driver, and a bartender. But he found  success by appealing to our community's cravings for food that reminded  them of home. He founded Taqueria Los Comales in 1973, in our  neighborhood of Little Village, serving delicious tacos al pastor, just  like the ones you find in Mexico.   His strong work ethic and good eye for business soon turned into a  restaurant with a chain of over 25 taquerias that went as far as  Houston and Wisconsin. But Don Camerino was more than a businessman; he  was, in a way, a father figure for many recently arrived immigrants who  could find a plate of food and a job at his restaurants.   On holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, he would keep the  restaurant open so that the immigrants, who were far from home, could  feel closer to their country of birth. Our common respect and  admiration for our immigrant community is what brought us together as  friends. He was also adamant about preserving important traditions,  like la charreria, the Mexican-style rodeo, which he practiced with  great discipline and honor.   When I decided to run for office, he supported me. My wife, Evelyn,  and I send our thoughts to Don Camerino's family during this time. He  will be sorely missed in our community.                            ____________________
