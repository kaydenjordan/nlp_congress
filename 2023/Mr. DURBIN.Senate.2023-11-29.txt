Mr. Smith attended Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and Harvard  Law School before completing two prestigious clerkships--first, for  Judge Guido Calabresi on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and,  later, for Justice David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court.   He then entered private practice and focused on complex civil  litigation, including intellectual property, labor law, product  liability, and the False Claims Act. In 2012, Mr. Smith joined the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York as an assistant  U.S. attorney in the office's criminal division. As a line prosecutor,  he handled cases including racketeering, murder-for-hire, drug  trafficking, tax fraud, and money laundering. For 2 years, he also  supervised 20 line prosecutors in the office's violent and organized  crime unit. Mr. Smith is now a Federal prosecutor in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the District of Hawaii and currently serves as  the deputy chief of the office's criminal division, as the criminal  civil rights coordinator, and as the chief of appeals and legal  strategy. Throughout the course of his career, he has tried 10 cases to  verdict.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Smith ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court. Senators Schatz and Hirono  recommended him to the White House and strongly support his nomination.   Mr. Smith is a seasoned practitioner with significant litigation  experience in federal court, and he will be an asset to the District of  Hawaii. I will be supporting this outstanding nominee, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Jamel Semper to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.   Mr. Semper attended Hampton University and Rutgers Law School before  clerking for Judge Harold Fullilove on the Essex County Superior Court  of New Jersey. He then spent 10 years as a state prosecutor in both the  Union County Prosecutor's Office and the Essex County Prosecutor's  Office, where he prosecuted a range of criminal offenses, including  sexual assault, firearms offenses, fraud, and murder. During this time,  he was also the lead prosecutor in a domestic terrorism and murder case  that involved the first prosecution of a homicide under New Jersey's  domestic terrorism statute. In 2018, Mr. Semper joined the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey. He now serves as  deputy chief of the office's criminal division and is responsible for  implementation of the office's violent crime reduction strategy. Mr.  Semper is a highly experienced litigator, having tried at least 40  cases to verdict, including both jury and bench trials.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Semper ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court, and the New Jersey Senators  strongly support his nomination.   Mr. Semper's deep ties to New Jersey and proven dedication to equal  justice will make him an asset to the district court. I will vote in  favor of his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.
