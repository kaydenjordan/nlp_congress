 Mr. Speaker, too many students are being overlooked by  our education system. These students are emergent bilinguals, a group  that makes up 10 percent of the K-12 student population.   In the law, we refer to them as English learners, students whose  native language is one other than English and who are not yet English  proficient. But when we call students ELs day to day, we ignore the  important fact that they are already proficient in another language,  whether it is Spanish, Chinese, or Arabic.   As these students learn English, they become bilingual, and  bilingualism is an incredible asset in our global society. We benefit,  and we need to shift our view of emergent bilinguals and recognize  their great potential. We must recognize that by investing in their  success, we all benefit.   Sarah Hesson, a Rhode Island educator, introduced me to the term  ``emergent bilinguals,'' and I encourage my colleagues to use it as  well and to celebrate students' emerging bilingualism.  [[Page H10174]]  After all, it is a gift that will empower students to become more  successful later in life.                            ____________________
