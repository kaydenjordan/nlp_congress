 Madam President, yesterday I discussed how the  Senate's serious, fact-based approach to the coronavirus crisis has cut  a sharp contrast with House Democrats' political theater.   Back in March, as the economic fallout from this crisis was just  beginning, it fell to the Senate to write, negotiate, and pass the  CARES Act. With the House absent from Washington, Senate Republicans  turned a blank sheet of paper into an outline for the largest rescue  package in American history. We negotiated with our Democratic  colleagues, and we made a law.   House Democrats tried to insert unrelated wish-list items at the  eleventh hour--things like tax credits for solar panels--but the  Republican Senate stood strong, and because we did, for 3 months now,  the unanimous bipartisan CARES Act has been the cornerstone of the  Federal Government's response to this crisis   Doctors, nurses, and hospitals have received historic Federal funding  to supplement their efforts. Households received direct checks. Tens of  millions of Americans have kept getting paychecks and not pink slips  because of our small-business-saving Paycheck Protection Program. These  are the historic programs that the Senate has spent weeks overseeing  and adjusting where necessary.   A few weeks ago, House Democrats jetted into town for a day or two-- just long enough to make another unserious contribution, to again use  this crisis for partisan wish-listing. You don't have to take my word  for it. The media completely panned it. NPR called it ``a long wish  list for Democrats.'' Another journalist wrote, ``Neither this bill nor  anything resembling it will ever become law.'' And listen to this  reporting: ``Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest  bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal  members of the caucus.'' This is the proposal that our Senate  Democratic colleagues keep thundering that we should take up and pass  here--something so unserious that it had House Democrats themselves  rolling their eyes.   Remember, among other things, this bill would give taxpayer-funded  checks to illegal immigrants, and it would change tax law to provide  massively expensive gifts to wealthy people in high-tax blue States.  These are their coronavirus priorities? This political theater is the  opposite of the serious Senate approach that built the CARES Act.   Any further recovery effort should focus intently on three things:  kids, jobs, and healthcare--kids, jobs, and healthcare.   To step back toward normalcy, our country will need K-12 and college  students to resume their schooling, we will need to reenergize hiring  to get workers their jobs back, and we will need continued progress on  the  [[Page S3980]]  healthcare fight to get ready for the fall and winter and speed the  search for a vaccine.   One helpful policy would be strong legal protection for schools,  colleges, nonprofits, and employers who are putting their necks on the  line to reopen. So long as institutions follow the best available  guidelines, they should not have to live in fear of a second epidemic  of frivolous lawsuits. Believe me, the virus is worry enough.   These are the kinds of smart solutions Washington must continue  discussing as we evaluate what further steps may be necessary. Partisan  theater and politicized wish-lists are not what the country needs.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, as I have said  for weeks, our domestic challenges cannot take Congress's eye off the  ball of world affairs. So, as the Senate passed other major bills and  the Senate Republicans tried to advance police reform until Democrats  blocked us, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have worked  hard to assemble the next National Defense Authorization Act.   Every year, the NDAA allows us to speak clearly about the Senate's  priorities on matters of national defense. As China continues to treat  maritime arteries like its own backyard sandbox, the men and women of  the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the entire Indo-Pacific Command remain on  call to maintain order. As Russia doubles down on its support of brutal  dictators and attacks democratic regimes from dark corners of the web,  U.S. Cyber Command remains vigilant and our NATO relationships remain  vital. As tyrants, from Tehran to Pyongyang, pave over their citizens  in pursuit of power, we need our sharpest minds and best tools watching  their every move.   Our Armed Forces stand watch over our homeland, and they stand watch  over an entire international order that shares our peaceful values and  benefits our Nation.   Now our military has also risen to the unique task of helping respond  to the pandemic. Military medical facilities have added critical  capacity during the first surge of COVID-19, from Navy hospital ships  to soldiers from the 531st Hospital Center at Fort Campbell. National  Guard personnel have established and manned temporary testing  facilities across the country. DOD research facilities have joined the  race to develop treatments.   As our servicemembers confront challenges new and familiar, our job  is to advance an NDAA that supports them and their families. Chairman  Inhofe and Senator Reed led a productive, bipartisan process in  committee. I hope we will see a bipartisan amendment process out here  on the floor as well.   But already the bill will make major steps forward. It supports  servicemembers not only while they are at their duty stations but also  on the homefront.   This year's bill encourages expanded telemedicine capabilities in the  military healthcare system, and it will help retain highly trained  providers. It implements new quality standards for acquisitions of  military family housing and increases impact aid to school districts  that support large numbers of military children. It revises sexual  assault-prevention policies to destroy barriers to victims seeking  justice.   It includes further steps to ensure all these efforts are supported  by a more efficient and transparent administrative structure over at  the Pentagon. That means changes to compensation to attract top talent,  expanded access to cutting-edge software, and new checks on the  Department's planning process to increase accountability.   The U.S. military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever  seen. Our work in the coming days is meant to ensure that this remains  the case. Supporting servicemembers and their families is a critical  piece of this year's NDAA. Our men and women in uniform are simply the  best, and they deserve the best                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I thank my friend from Utah. I will  be brief.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 718.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
