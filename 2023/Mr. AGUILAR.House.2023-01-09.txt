 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rules package which  was written behind closed doors.   What we are voting on this evening is nothing short of a complete  surrender to the demands of the most extreme Republicans on the other  side of the aisle.   Rather than taking this opportunity to bring us together, the  adoption of this rules package sets us on a path of division and  default. The extremists plan to use these rules to hold the economy  hostage in order to enact more cuts to Social Security and Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation saw the lowest unemployment in 50  years, a testament to the leadership of President Biden and House  Democrats. Yet, it is clear that the new majority is determined to  undermine that economic recovery at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
