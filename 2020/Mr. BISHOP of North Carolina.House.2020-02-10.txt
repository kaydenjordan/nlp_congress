 Mr. Speaker, North Carolina State  Senator Tom McInnis of Rockingham has been named ``Citizen of the  Year'' by the Richmond Community College Foundation, and I rise to  comment on this well-deserved honor for my friend. Tom is an alumnus of  RCC, and I know this distinction is meaningful to him.   I was privileged to serve with Tom in the North Carolina Senate and  have worked closely with him to learn and serve the needs of Richmond  County in the time leading to and since my election in the House. That  experience deepened my appreciation for Tom's love for Rockingham and  Hamlet and the rest of Richmond County and his personal force in  advocating for the needs and advancement of his people--and I mean  everybody.   The citizenship award specifically recognizes Tom's effort and  success in promoting workforce training for rural North Carolina. And  Tom has devoted much of his adult life to improving educational  opportunity, especially.   Tom grew up on a Richmond County farm. He put himself through school  and started multiple businesses. In 1983, he founded Iron Horse Auction  Company, which, in 2013, was named one of the top 10 auction companies  in the United States. He was elected to the North Carolina Auctioneers  Association Hall of Fame in 1994.   Tom's public life began with 8 years' service on the Richmond County  Board of Education. Tom is now in his third term in the Senate, where  he serves as chairman of the Transportation Committee.   Tom played a key role in securing funding for workforce training at  Richmond Community College, including programs for truck driver  training and electrical linemen. Since just the fall of 2016, the  trucking program has graduated 50 new drivers into the workforce with  highly marketable skills. The lineman program started last fall and  already has a waitlist.   Tom will never forget his rural roots, and his people will never  forgot his hard work and service on their behalf. I am proud to call  him a colleague, mentor, and friend.                            ____________________
