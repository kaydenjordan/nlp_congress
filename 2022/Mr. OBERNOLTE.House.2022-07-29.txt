 Madam Chair, last year, my home State of California  experienced the worst year for wildfires in the entire history of the  State.   As of this morning, the Oak Fire is burning just outside my district.  It has consumed over 100 homes and displaced tens of thousands of  people.   Science tells us that the only way to reduce the intensity of these  wildfires is to reduce the density of the fuels through either  mechanical thinning or prescribed burns. But unfortunately, this bill  makes the situation even worse by locking up over 58 million new acres  of forest with a wilderness designation that would prevent the use of  mechanical thinning or prescribed burns to reduce the density of the  fuels.   This bill is called the Wildfire Response Act, but, Madam Chair, our  response to wildfires cannot be to take actions that make future  wildfires even more destructive.   I urge a ``no'' vote.
