 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 200, which,  unfortunately, I believe, joining my colleagues, would undermine our  ability to responsibly manage our fisheries and would ultimately harm  our fishing industry in the United States.   Because of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and diligent science-based  fisheries management, the United States is viewed as an international  leader in the industry.   In my district, since 2000, more than 40 overfished stocks have  bounced back not by luck, Mr. Chairman, but because of commonsense  regulations that were put in place by the MSA.   The industry has put an emphasis on setting catch limits and  rehabilitating these stocks to ensure that the industry can continue to  thrive for generations to come. Since 2010, when just 28 of those 40  stocks had been rebuilt, we saw a 54 percent increase in commercial  gross revenues, which is income that goes directly back into our  communities.   In 2015, commercial fishing in my home State of Washington brought in  $1.7 billion, which was lower than some previous years because of those  very ongoing overfishing challenges in our oceans, especially in the  Pacific Northwest. These rollbacks that are proposed in this bill would  make things worse.   Locally, we are focused on increasing revenues by maintaining healthy  stocks and healthy oceans. We can grow opportunities for future  generations while also protecting our environment and strengthening our  economy.   I am so proud to be from the State of Washington, the State that  elected Warren Magnuson to this body, and of the fact that the  Magnuson-Stevens Act has demonstrated broad bipartisan support as well  as support, as my colleagues said, from the fishing industry,  environmentalists, scientists, chefs, and business owners. It is our  responsibility, Mr. Chairman, to continue to build on those successes,  and we can do that today by voting ``no'' on H.R. 200.
