 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, around here, it is Members of Congress who  typically get the spotlight. When we talk about a bill getting passed,  for example, you usually hear about the  [[Page S5794]]  Members who introduced and pushed for the bill. You don't usually hear  about the staffers.   But none of us in Congress works alone. We are supported by dedicated  staffers who spend long days and oftentimes nights and weekends working  to serve our constituents and our country.   Today, I want to talk about one of those staffers, my whip office  chief of staff who is leaving the Hill after 26 years of government  service.   Nick Rossi has been with me since 2013, when I became the ranking  member of the Commerce Committee. He came on as deputy staff director  and took over as staff director 2 years later.   There isn't one thing that we did in my years as Commerce ranking  member and chair that wasn't at least partially owing to Nick Rossi:  the 2018 FAA reauthorization; the FAST Act; Coast Guard legislation;  FCC bills; broadband legislation; spectrum legislation; section 230  reform legislation, known as SESTA-FOSTA; legislation to reduce the  number of annoying robocalls; other consumer protection legislation  like the FTC Consumer Fairness Review Act; legislation to advance 5G;  and the list goes on.    Nick came to my staff after an already illustrious career on the  Hill. He had served as chief counsel at the Senate Judiciary Committee,  as chief counsel and chief investigator on the Commerce Committee, and  as staff director on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee.   But his career in government started much earlier. He actually  started his government service in the FBI, applying on a whim when he  couldn't join the U.S. Attorney's Office because of a hiring freeze.   As is typical for Nick, he graduated first in his class at the FBI  Academy and then went on to spend 11 years in the FBI as a special  agent, a supervisory special agent, unit chief, associate legal  counsel, and media spokesperson.   That sounds like a lot for 11 years but not so much when you know  Nick.   I mentioned that he graduated first in his class at the FBI Academy.  He also graduated with honors from Notre Dame and from Harvard Law  School, where he was in the drama society with our colleague Ted Cruz.   I don't think I have ever asked Nick about any issue and gotten  anything less than a thoroughly informed answer, whether the subject  was technically in his area of expertise or not.   I will never forget when he accompanied me and former Senator Bill  Nelson to the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, SD. This  is a lab where scientists are conducting research in particle physics  and the expansion of the universe. So it is pretty complicated stuff.   Well, apparently not to Nick. He was in the car with us, and he was  throwing out technical formulas and the finer points of physics and  cosmology with the ease he might use when discussing the lunch menu in  the Dirksen cafeteria.   When asked how he knew all this stuff--he definitely didn't major in  physics, and space wasn't his issue area--he just said it was a hobby.  Trust Nick to be flirting with particle physics as a hobby.   But while Nick may often be the smartest person in the room, he is  also the most humble. He is often the last to speak. He listens. He  asks questions, sometimes maybe when he doesn't really need to. And he  gives thoughtful, wise counsel.   It has been clear over the last few days as staffers across the  Senate learned that Nick was leaving just how respected his voice is in  the Senate.   I have had more than one committee staff director talk to me about  how he or she learned to run a committee from Nick.   And I know a lot of senior staffers--inside my office but outside of  it as well--who will tell you that when they are facing a challenge,  the first person that they go to to provide a sounding board is Nick.   And Nick always makes himself available. He is uniformly generous  with his time and knowledge, and he treats everyone the same, whether  the individual in question is a staff assistant or a chief of staff.   He has brought out the best in every team I have seen him work with,  whether at the Commerce Committee or in the whip office.   Nick has been chief of staff in my whip office for 2 years--2 very  eventful years. Through it all, Nick has been a steady presence in the  whip office and in the Senate. No matter the crisis, Nick is calm and  collected, and he inspires that calm in others, although I do hear that  it is a different story when he is watching Notre Dame football. The  word is that there is a lot of ranting, pacing, and yelling at the TV,  but I have not observed that.   Above all, Nick is a character guy, which matters a lot to me. He is  a man of honor, integrity, and principle.   I never have to worry that Nick is going to cut corners or bend the  rules. He is always going to do things the right way, and there is  nothing more important than that.   I can't talk about Nick without also mentioning his commitment to his  family. His pride in his kids always shines through, and just as he is  never too busy to talk to a staffer who is having a problem, he is  always ready to take a break from his work to help his daughter Elena  with her math homework--another subject Nick didn't major in but is, of  course, really good at--or to build swords and helmets and bows and  arrows with his son Johnny.   I am very grateful to his wife Katherine and to Elena and Johnny for  sharing him with us for all these years.   And I am very happy that there are fewer late nights in his future so  that he can get in some more time with his family.   I realize that Nick may be starting to sound a little superhuman  here, so let me just say that while he is a man of many talents who has  not only not successfully repaired the family's microwave and  dishwasher but is also known for building a balloon arch in the shape  of a shark for his kids' school, I am reliably informed that he is not  a good cook.   And I am pretty sure that ``not'' was bold and underlined.   But, seriously, Nick is one in a million, and it has been my  privilege to have him lead the team in the whip office.   His absence will be sorely felt by me, by my staff, and throughout  Capitol Hill, and I hope he won't mind the occasional phone call to  pick his brain on some of the issues that are facing the Senate.   Nick, thank you for your service, and God bless you in all your  future undertakings. Wherever you land next, they will be lucky to have  you.   I yield the floor.
