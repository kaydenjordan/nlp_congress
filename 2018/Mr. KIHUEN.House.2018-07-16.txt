 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Derrick  ``Bo'' Taylor, who attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Bo was devoted to his two sons, Gregory and Kyle, and his girlfriend,  Denise Cohen.   Bo worked for the California Department of Corrections and  Rehabilitation for 29 years, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant.   Bo and Denise dated for several years and attended the Route 91  festival together, where, tragically, they both died.   Bo is remembered by his friends and family as being very well liked  and respected, and a leader. He was dedicated to everyone in his life  and was known as a true friend.   I would like to extend my condolences to Bo Taylor's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
