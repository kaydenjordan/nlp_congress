 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney) for introducing this important bipartisan legislation.   My amendment to H.R. 1309 is a clarifying amendment to ensure that  nothing in this act shall be construed to limit or diminish any  existing protections in relevant Federal, State, or local law related  to domestic violence, stalking, dating violence, or sexual assault.   According to a 2016 OSHA report, approximately 75 percent of the  nearly 25,000 workplace assaults reported each year occur in healthcare  and social service settings, and workers in healthcare settings are  four times more likely to be assaulted at work than workers in other  sectors.   These cases have led to psychological trauma, not only for the  victim, but also for those who have witnessed these attacks, as well as  serious injury and even death.                                time  1115    With workplace violence on the rise, it is vital that Congress  address this issue to ensure the safety of workers, and that is why  this bill is so important.   While most incidents of workplace violence fit the definition of  simple assault, a study by the Joint Commission showed that sexual  assault, rape, and stalking are not uncommon. Approximately 38 States  include rape, sexual assault, and stalking in their definition of  domestic violence.   My amendment makes it clear that nothing in the underlying  legislation preempts or diminishes these protections in any way.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less than 30 percent of  U.S. workplaces have a formal program or policy that addresses  workplace violence, and 7 out of 10 workplaces do not have formal  domestic violence programs or policy. That means that more than 70  percent of U.S. workplaces have inadequate protections against  workplace violence.   Innova Health Systems, one of the major healthcare providers in  Northern Virginia, recently conducted a survey at their hospital in my  district on the incidence and cost of nurse workplace violence  perpetrated by hospital patients or patient visitors. The results  showed that 75 percent of nurses experienced violence within the past  year, with emergency nurses experiencing significantly greater number  of incidents. Nurses reported many barriers to reporting these  incidents, including unclear reporting policies, fear of retaliation,  and the disheartening perception that violence just comes with the job.   These statistics show that the current voluntary efforts to prevent  workplace violence are not working. The results of the Innova survey  highlight a real need for effective training and clear, convenient  reporting programs and environments that support workers who are  experiencing violence. This bill seeks to address this need.   As a former domestic violence prosecutor, I have seen firsthand how  laws protect and provide valuable resources to the more than 12 million  individuals who are survivors of violent crime. I offer this amendment  to ensure that it is abundantly clear that workplace violence  prevention plans developed under this bill complement existing legal  protections against domestic violence and sexual assault and in no way  diminishes or limit those protections.   It is crucial that our laws at the State, Federal, and local levels  continue to help and support victims of domestic violence, stalking,  dating violence, and sexual assault, which is precisely what my  amendment does.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I simply request that my colleagues support  this underlying amendment and the underlying bill. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
