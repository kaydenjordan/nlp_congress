 Mr. Speaker, workforce development is key to sustaining  [[Page H1964]]  jobs and economic growth. Manufacturers, small businesses, trade  unions, and industry groups are concerned about the increasing skilled  labor shortage. Unfortunately, current law limits the use of eligible  savings accounts to help reduce the costs of obtaining advanced  technical certifications.   My legislation, the American Workforce Empowerment Act, would allow  529 savings accounts to be used for non-degree technical training  certificate programs, tools, and any tests that are required to  maintain certifications.   As the American workforce rebounds, we will see increased need for  skilled workers to meet rising manufacturing, shipping, and  construction demand. These skilled labor positions are good-paying jobs  that help provide economic stability for hardworking Americans and are  essential to the expansion of our Nation's economy.                            ____________________
