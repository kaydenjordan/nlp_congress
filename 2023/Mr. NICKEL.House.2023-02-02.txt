 Mr. Speaker, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day,  seven Jewish worshippers were murdered in cold blood outside a  synagogue in Jerusalem.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this was no random act of violence.  This was a heinous and cowardly attack rooted in hate, bigotry, and  anti-Semitism.   In the face of such evil, it is imperative that we come together not  as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans committed to fighting  against anti-Semitism and defending the sacred relationship between the  United States and Israel.   ``Never again'' is more than a mere hashtag for social media. It is a  solemn oath.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to act against anti-Semitism wherever it is or whomever it comes  from.                            ____________________
