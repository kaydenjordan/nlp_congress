The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to bring two important bills to the  floor today that strengthen the government's ability to effectively  leverage cutting-edge cyber technologies. Last year, the House passed  both of these provisions as part of Majority Leader McCarthy's  Innovation Initiative, and I am excited that we are able to bring them  to the floor here so early in the 115th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, my colleagues and I have been  working diligently with technology innovators and tech startups to find  solutions that will spur innovation and break down the bureaucratic  barriers that prevent the government from effectively leveraging the  private sector's emerging technologies.   H.R. 239, the Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017, addresses  this problem by requiring the science and technology directorate, or  S&T, to more effectively coordinate with industry and academia to  support the research and development of cybersecurity technologies.   H.R. 239 does so because it requires S&T to support the full life  cycle of cyber research and development projects and identify mature  technologies to address cybersecurity gaps. In doing so, S&T will be  required to target federally funded cybersecurity research that  demonstrates a high probability of successful transition to the  commercial market within 2 years.   This bill will also extend the use of other transactional authority,  or OTA, until the year 2021, a move that will improve DHS's ability to  engage with tech startups that are developing these cutting-edge  technologies. H.R. 239 also includes additional accountability  requirements to ensure that there is proper oversight of the authority.   Mr. Speaker, our digital borders are constantly being barraged by  cybercriminals, by nation-states, and by terrorists seeking to exploit  and harm innocent Americans. Almost daily, we read news stories on how  these hackers are intruding into our networks and doing so with  increased sophistication. One thing is for certain, we have seen that  cyber intrusions and their impact on victims quickly morph and increase  both in frequency and in their severity.   In 2017, these hackers will unfortunately continue to pose a great  threat to the U.S. homeland and to our critical infrastructure. The  Federal Government, therefore, needs to keep pace with these evolving  threats by more actively working with the private sector to find  effective solutions.   DHS's Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary research  and development arm of the Department. The directorate manages basic  and applied research and development, including cybersecurity R&D, for  the Department's operational components and for our first responders.   Ensuring there are mechanisms in place, like S&T's cybersecurity R&D  programs and the OTA, to support the dynamic nature of cybersecurity  research and development is essential for addressing homeland security  capability gaps.   Thank you again, Mr. Speaker, for calling up this important bill  today. I believe it will have an incredibly positive impact on  encouraging technology innovation across the Nation to address our  vital homeland security needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this very  important bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Hon.

Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 239, the ``Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not       seek a sequential referral on the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this       bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the       future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those       provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 239, the Support for Rapid  Innovation Act.   Mr. Speaker, this timely legislation authorizes the Department of  Homeland Security to support cybersecurity research and development and  to help innovators with promising cybersecurity technologies to help  commercialize their products.   Government and private sector networks are under constant attack by  increasingly sophisticated cyber hackers. The cyber hacking campaign  carried out by the Russian Government against U.S. political and  business institutions, during the 2016 election, is a recent, high- profile example.   Concern has also been growing about the threat of cybercriminals  carrying out attacks by exploiting unprotected Internet-enabled  consumer products. This threat was brought into sharp focus last  October with the denial of service attack against Dyn. During that  attack, malware was used to direct tens of thousands of Internet- connected cameras, DVRs, and other consumer products to carry out  successive, highly sophisticated attacks.   Our adversaries are constantly innovating. It is imperative that the  Federal Government--and specifically DHS--innovate, too. To that end,  H.R. 239 directs DHS to invest in innovative cybersecurity technologies  and provide DHS with flexibility to overcome bureaucratic obstacles  that sometimes  [[Page H277]]  discourage smaller companies, like tech startups, from working with the  Federal Government.   H.R. 239 directs DHS to pursue cybersecurity projects that will  improve detection, mitigation, and recovery from attacks and bolster  the security and resilience of our networks, particularly for critical  infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation to ensure that DHS does its part to advance cybersecurity  research and development.   Cybersecurity threats to our Nation are growing in diversity and  sophistication. We cannot afford to let promising technologies  languish.   The Department of Homeland Security should work with the private  sector in support of innovative cybersecurity research, development,  testing, and evaluation. We have seen that public-private collaboration  can give these technologies the boost they need to enter the market.  Just last month, DHS announced the commercialization of an eight  cybersecurity product launched with the help of the Department's  Transition to Practice program.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 239.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thompson for his  leadership on the committee, and I want to thank the Cybersecurity,  Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies Subcommittee staff  for their hard work.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 239.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 240) to encourage engagement between the Department of  Homeland Security and technology innovators, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 240         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Leveraging Emerging       Technologies Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INNOVATION ENGAGEMENT.         (a) Innovation Engagement.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security--        (A) shall engage with innovative and emerging technology       developers and firms, including technology-based small       businesses and startup ventures, to address homeland security       needs; and        (B) may identify geographic areas in the United States with       high concentrations of such innovative and emerging       technology developers and firms, and may establish personnel       and office space in such areas, as appropriate.

(4) Oversight.--Not later than 30 days after establishing       personnel and office space in a specific geographic area in       the United States pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary       of Homeland Security shall inform Congress about the       rationale for such establishment, the anticipated costs       associated with such establishment, and the specific goals       for such establishment.        (b) Strategic Plan.--Not later than six months after the       date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall develop, implement, and submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a Department of Homeland       Security-wide strategy to proactively engage with innovative       and emerging technology developers and firms, including       technology-based small businesses and startup ventures, in       accordance with subsection (a). Such strategy shall--        (1) focus on sustainable methods and guidance to build       relationships, including with such innovative and emerging       technology developers and firms in geographic areas in the       United States with high concentrations of such innovative and       emerging technology developers and firms, and in geographic       areas outside such areas, to establish, develop, and enhance       departmental capabilities to address homeland security needs;        (2) include efforts to--        (A) ensure proven innovative and emerging technologies can       be included in existing and future acquisition contracts;        (B) coordinate with organizations that provide venture       capital to businesses, particularly small businesses and       startup ventures, as appropriate, to assist the       commercialization of innovative and emerging technologies       that are expected to be ready for commercialization in the       near term and within 36 months; and        (C) address barriers to the utilization of innovative and       emerging technologies and the engagement of small businesses       and startup ventures in the acquisition process;        (3) include a description of how the Department plans to       leverage proven innovative and emerging technologies to       address homeland security needs; and        (4) include the criteria the Secretary plans to use to       determine an innovation or technology is proven.        (c) No Additional Funds Authorized.--No additional funds       are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act.       Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.  [[Page H278]]         Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.  [[Page H278]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I am pleased that the House is today considering  H.R. 240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017.   H.R. 240 encourages engagement between the Department of Homeland  Security and technology innovators, including startups. This bill  requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to proactively engage with  innovative and emerging technology developers and firms to address our  vital Homeland Security needs.   Additionally, H.R. 240 provides the Secretary with the authority to  identify geographic areas in the United States where high  concentrations of these innovative and emerging technology developers  and firms exist and to establish personnel and office space in these  areas to more effectively collaborate with these technology hubs. The  Federal Government certainly needs to do a better job working with the  private sector, and H.R. 240 will help to address that.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also requires the Secretary to develop and to  implement a targeted strategy to proactively engage innovative and  emerging technology developers and firms.                                time  1630    Under this bill, the Secretary must use the strategic plan to address  existing barriers to leveraging innovative and emerging technologies,  and the small businesses and startup ventures that create those  technologies, and to incorporate them into the Department's acquisition  process.   For example, in order to keep pace, the Department of Homeland  Security has established an office in Silicon Valley to encourage  engagement and communication with the innovative technology developers  in that area. Although it is a vital technology hub, Silicon Valley  certainly is not the only technology hub in the United States. The  Department should not be limited to a single geographic area from which  to identify these emerging and innovative technologies.   Mr. Speaker, all Americans are learning that cybersecurity is  national security. The impacts of cyber intrusions are being felt  everywhere, from boardroom tables to kitchen tables. We have seen them  undermine consumer confidence and damage a company's hard-earned  reputation in just a couple of seconds. Cybersecurity is a complex and  serious issue that our Nation will have to address for decades to come.  So it only makes sense for us to require the Department to consider  strategically just how it will engage these technology developers to  strengthen the Department's ability to access innovative and emerging  technologies to better combat evolving cyber threats.   I am happy to support this measure today because I believe it will  move us forward, further addressing our homeland security needs by  supporting technology innovation. I urge Members to join me in  supporting this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this measure, as I was for its  predecessor last Congress. Last June, the House approved this measure  by a 347-8 vote. This bipartisan bill directs the Department of  Homeland Security to engage small businesses, startup companies, and  other developers of innovative and emerging technologies to tackle some  of our most vexing, persistent homeland security challenges.   It is no secret that navigating the Federal procurement process is  difficult, especially for small startups. Meanwhile, small companies  continue to develop some of the most innovative technological solutions  in use today. They are a huge source of untapped potential, capable of  bringing forward-thinking, groundbreaking ideas to the homeland  security enterprise.   To build these relationships, H.R. 240 allows DHS to establish  personnel and office space in areas around the U.S. where technology  innovators are concentrated. Having a physical presence in these tech  hubs will make it easier for DHS to grow and maintain connections with  local startups, innovators, and incubators. The Department has already  taken action in this regard.   In 2015, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate established a  Silicon Valley office and announced its first-ever procurement focused  on working with nontraditional contractors and tech startups. The DHS  innovation ``other transaction'' solution sought technologies to  address security challenges in aviation, border, and cybersecurity.   To date, under this program, DHS has funded awards to 13 small  businesses in California, Texas, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Washington  State. Additionally, DHS has reached out to technology innovators at  regional events in Boston, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, New Orleans,  Chicago, Louisville and Austin, raising awareness with more than 1,500  startups, accelerators, and venture capitalists through industry days,  panels, conferences, and startup meetups. The feedback has been very  positive, but it has also validated the need to educate the community  about who DHS is and what the challenges are.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation.   H.R. 240 recognizes that DHS depends on technology to carry out its  missions, and must nurture and maintain robust and direct relationships  with talented technology developers, even those that do not fit the  mold of the typical Federal contractor.   DHS could improve the productivity and sustainability of these  outreach efforts by developing a strategy to proactively engage with  innovators in a way that supports long-term relationships. H.R. 240  calls for such a strategy to be delivered to Congress and implemented  within 6 months.   Two features of that strategy required under this bill that I would  like to highlight are provisions that I sponsored. One requires the  strategy to give attention to fostering engagement with developers that  may be located outside a recognized regional technology hub. The other  directs the strategy to include coordination with venture capital  organizations, like the In-Q-Tel nonprofit, to help emerging technology  developers, including small businesses and startup ventures,  commercialize technologies that address a rapidly growing list of  homeland security needs.   Mr. Speaker, for all of the reasons discussed, I urge support of H.R.  240.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Thompson) for his support of this bill and for his leadership in  keeping this issue at the forefront of our cybersecurity discussion.  This is an incredibly important bill, and I, once again, urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 240.   I yield back the balance of my time.
