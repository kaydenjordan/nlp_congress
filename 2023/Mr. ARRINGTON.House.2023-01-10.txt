 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate one of west  Texas' best, Ron Butler, on his induction into the 2023 Texas Bankers  Hall of Fame. On April 27, Ron will be recognized for his outstanding  leadership and service in the banking community.   After graduating from Texas Tech University, Mr. Butler went on to  join the First Financial Bank family, where he remained for 30 years,  and now serves as vice president and chief administrative officer.   Ron is a dedicated family man. He is passionate about serving his  community there in Abilene and is not an avid but a rabid Red Raider  fan.   I know his wife, Lorilei, and his two children, Trey and Sydney, are  very proud of him, and so am I.   God Bless, guns up, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
