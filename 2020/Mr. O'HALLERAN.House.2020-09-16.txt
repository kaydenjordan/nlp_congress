 Mr. Speaker, on September 16, 2020, I did not have a  chance to cast my vote for two bills on the floor of the House of  Representatives. I would like the record to reflect that I would have  voted in favor of H.R. 7909, the Ensuring Children and Child Care  Workers Are Safe Act, legislation that I have cosponsored.  Additionally, I would have voted against the motion to recommit and in  favor of final passage for H.R. 2574, the Equity and Inclusion  Enforcement Act.
