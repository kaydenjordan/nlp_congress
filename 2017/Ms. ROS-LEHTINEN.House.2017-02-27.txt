 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the members of  my south Florida community who came out last Saturday to the Live Like  Bella Superhero 5K Run/Walk at Zoo Miami.   Live Like Bella works every day to fight pediatric cancer through  medical research while offering much-needed support for families and  caregivers.   I would also like to recognize the Run, Walk and Stroll 2K for  Cerebral Palsy that took place in the Village of Palmetto Bay, located  in my congressional district, also on Saturday. This walk brought  together patients, families, friends, and volunteers to shed light on  how cerebral palsy can impact those afflicted and to provide much- needed assistance for therapy programs and special needs equipment.   Live Like Bella and the Cerebral Palsy Walk are just two of the  latest examples of south Floridians banding together to help others.                            ____________________
