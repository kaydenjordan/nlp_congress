 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an  individual and honor an individual who was a Member of this body for  many, many years from the State of Georgia, and he just ended his term  as Governor for the last 8 years, Nathan Deal.   I saw yesterday, as I was looking through some pictures on social  media, there was a picture that showed, as it should properly show when  you think of Nathan Deal, him leaving the capitol for the last time,  arm in arm with his beloved Sandra. That is the way they have governed  for the last 8 years.   Nathan Deal has brought a sense of accomplishment; he has brought a  sense of pride. Not only did he do that up here in the Halls of  Congress where he served us ably and was on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and took the interests of Georgia to heart in everything that  he did, when he went back to Georgia, though, and became our Governor,  I believe he hit his stride that has brought Georgia so far in the last  8 years.   When he first got there, I was in the State legislature, and I was  honored that I was part of his team as the Governor's floor leader.   At that time, our rainy day fund was basically nonexistent. It is now  over $2 billion.   At that time, we had a fledgling beginning industry in films and  motion pictures that has now become the envy, literally, of the world  and one of the top places in all of the world to make blockbuster  films.   He has taken an aging infrastructure and transportation plan and,  now, has given hope to that transportation plan in Georgia.   But also, when I came here to Congress, and last Congress, we were  able to work on criminal justice reform with this President and this  administration. But in many ways, it would not have happened up here if  it had not been for Governor Nathan Deal.   When he went to Georgia, he began to look at our criminal justice  system. He began to look at how we were treating those who needed a  second chance, who needed the hope that was provided in a system that  was not providing what it needed to.   Nathan Deal took a stand, and Georgia has become an international  leader in how we deal with our criminal justice system and how we take  care of those individuals. We have seen crime rates decrease; we have  seen families put back together; we have seen a better Georgia.   Personally, I have known Governor Deal for almost 35, 40 years. I  played basketball with his son. He and Sandra and my mom and dad would  actually work in the concession stands together at North Hall High  School many years ago.   That is Nathan Deal. He has never been afraid to do the hard work, to  not take the claim or the glory, but he just got the job done. As  Governor, he raised civil discourse in Georgia. He made people think,  and he made our State better.   So, yesterday, as I saw the picture of Governor Deal and Sandra arm  in arm, I could not help but think how this man has touched so many  lives, including my own, with phone calls, with encouragement to be a  better person, and also, in our case, to be a better State.   Georgia has been honored to have Nathan Deal as Governor for the last  8 years. We are looking forward to a new administration with Brian  Kemp, but I will have to say, those are big shoes to fill.   Governor Deal, you did us proud.            Recognizing Carol Martin, Gainesville Chief of Police     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Carol Martin, Chief of Police of the City of Gainesville. Chief Martin  is retiring on January 31, 2019, after protecting and serving our city  for over 32 years.   First joining the Gainesville Police Department in January 1987 as a  patrol officer, Chief Martin has dedicated her life to public safety.  She has advanced through the ranks of investigator, sergeant,  lieutenant, captain, and major, until August of 2014, when she made  history as the very first female chief of police for the city of  Gainesville.   Chief Martin's career in law enforcement has been marked with  excellence. In 1997, she was recognized by the Gainesville Elks Lodge  as Police Chief of the Year; and in 2003 and 2007, the Gainesville  Kiwanis Club presented her with the John W. Jacobs, Sr., Memorial Award  for her excellence in law enforcement.   She is an active member of the International and Georgia Associations  of Chiefs of Police and serves as a board member on the Gainesville  Rape Response and the Georgia Law Enforcement State Certification  Program.   Her resume is superseded only by her character. For over three  decades, Chief Martin has made great sacrifices to serve and protect  our communities. As the son of a Georgia State trooper, I understand  firsthand the dangers that our law enforcement officers face each and  every day. Chief Martin has continually put her life on the line so  that the people of Gainesville do not have to fear for their own.    I want to congratulate Chief Carol Martin on her retirement. But most  of all, I want to thank her for her dedicated life of service to the  rule of law and protecting the people of northeast Georgia and for  being a dear friend of mine.                            ____________________
