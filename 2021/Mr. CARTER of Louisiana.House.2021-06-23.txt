 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman  Scott for the time that he has put in on this incredible piece of  legislation, and thank Representative Davis for the work done to put  together this important work.   As my colleagues today have said, this is a bipartisan, commonsense  bill. It is exactly the type of work and things that Congress should be  doing. This is our system at work.   The facts are very simple: Right now, because of a court decision,  the standards for age discrimination are higher than that of any other  type of discrimination. This bill fixes that and returns the country to  what it was intended to be; that all forms of discrimination are  illegal and must be stopped; that no form of discrimination is less  wrong than another form of discrimination.   This is the right thing to do and this is the right time to do it.  That higher standard has made it harder to prove cases and leaves older  workers exposed to discrimination.   Age discrimination is wrong, plain and simple. It is also costly.  According to a study by AARP, we lose out on $850 million of GDP each  year because of it.   The cost is not just in abstract dollars. It comes from Americans who  were skipped over for promotions they deserved. It comes from  constituents who want to switch jobs but don't get a call back. It  comes from your neighbor who lost their job and can still work but  can't get anyone to even look at their resume.   The standard for proving age discrimination must be fair, it must be  level, and it must be treated as other forms of discrimination.   Americans of all ages deserve the chance to work and to provide for  their families, and the law should recognize their ability to work.   There is no place for ageism in the workforce, and this must stop.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  letter of support from The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights dated June 22, 2021, asking for a yes vote on the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, H.R. 2062.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2021.    vote Yes on the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act                            (POWADA), H.R. 2062         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse       membership of more than 220 national organizations to promote       and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the       United States, we urge you to vote yes on H.R. 2062, the       Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA),       without amendments that would limit the bill's scope or       undermine its protections. POWADA is a priority of The       Leadership Conference, and we will include your vote in our       voting record for the 117th Congress.        Despite longstanding federal prohibitions against workplace       discrimination based on age, pervasive age discrimination in       the United States continues to harm older workers--denying       working people dignity on the job and threatening their       economic security. In 2020, 78 percent of older workers       reported  [[Page H3057]]       having seen or experienced age discrimination in the       workplace, with Hispanic workers perceiving slightly more age       discrimination at 82 percent. These numbers reflect an       increase in age discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic       for all workers, across race and gender. Previous research on       age discrimination before the pandemic reflects that women       workers and workers of color, especially Black workers, have       been more likely to experience age discrimination, and       unemployment rates suggest that workers of color may continue       to be more vulnerable. For example, although the unemployment       rate in May 2021 for White workers ages 45-59 was 4.2       percent, for Black workers, the rate was 10.6 percent.        The ability to enjoy employment opportunities, free from       unlawful discrimination, is key to promoting economic       security for marginalized and multi-marginalized communities.       Systemic racism and decades of structural inequality in       almost every area of life, including education, health care,       housing, and employment, have resulted in economic disparties       that have severely threatened the lives and well-being of far       too many people in the United States. Women, for example, are       nearly two-thirds of all individuals aged 65 and over living       in poverty, with women of color struggling at increased       rates. LGBTQ older adults are also at increased risk of       poverty compared to non-LGBTQ older adults, and people with       disabilities are twice as likely to live in poverty than       people without disabilities. Congress must ensure that our       federal laws are able to protect all persons in the United       States from unlawful discrimination. A key step toward that       goal is to ensure that unlawful discrimination plays no role       in employment practices,        POWADA is critically needed legislation that would restore       fairness by reinstating well-established legal protections       against workplace discrimination that were undermined by the       2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial       Services, Inc, which imposed a higher burden of proof on       working people in age discrimination cases. After Gross,       working people must prove not only that age discrimination       influenced an employer's conduct but that age played a       decisive role in the employer's conduct. The burden of proof       for age discrimination is now higher than the standard of       proof for allegations of discrimination based on sex, race,       religion, or national origin, sending the signal that some       amount of age discrimination in the workplace is acceptable.       Just as troubling, though, is that the Gross decision paved       the way for the same unreasonably difficult burden of proof       in cases in which an employer retaliates against workers who       challenge workplace discrimination based on race, sex, or       other grounds. POWADA is necessary to return the law to what       it was before the Gross decision.        Simply put, no amount of unlawful discrimination in the       workplace is acceptable. We therefore urge you to vote yes on       H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against       Discrimination Act. If you have any questions or would like       to discuss this matter further, please contact Gaylynn       Burroughs, senior policy counsel.            Sincerely,      Wade Henderson,        Interim President & CEO.      Jesselyn McCurdy,        Managing Director and Interim Executive Vice President for       Government Affairs.
