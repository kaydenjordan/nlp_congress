 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this massive  legislation. We are here supposedly for COVID relief, but the vast  majority of this bill, as you have already heard, has nothing to do  with defeating this disease.   Real COVID relief would prioritize vaccine distribution, reopening  small businesses, and getting our children back in classrooms. This  bill does not do that.   This bill is a litany of longstanding proposals which are detrimental  to our small businesses and will actually hurt our efforts to reconnect  the unemployed.   The extension of the child tax credit and EITC were first introduced  long before the pandemic and will disincentivize returning to work.  Likewise, the proposed bailout for mismanaged multiemployer pensions  predates COVID-19. And now we have learned that bringing this bill to  the floor was actually delayed because Democrats were adding a new cash  grab, drastically lowering the threshold at which gig workers receive a  1099-K.  [[Page H844]]    It is like the majority learned nothing from the debacle they created  when they shoehorned new 1099 rules into ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I am appalled that we are here tonight continuing to try  to address this in such a manner when we owe the American people better  than what this legislation delivers. I urge its defeat.
