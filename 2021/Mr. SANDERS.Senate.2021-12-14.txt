 Madam President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included a reserve fund in section  3003 to allow the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to revise  budget aggregates and committee allocations for legislation that would  not increase the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031.   The Senate will soon consider S. 1605, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, as amended by the House, which  meets the condition of not increasing the deficit over the relevant 10- year period. As such, I am filing a revision to the aggregates and  committee allocations under the budget resolution, which were last  revised on December 9. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office  estimates that the anti-fraud provisions in the bill would increase  both direct spending and revenues by $23 million over 5 years and $72  million over 10 years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                       REVISIONS TO BUDGET REVENUE AGGREGATES    [Pursuant to Section 3003 of S.
