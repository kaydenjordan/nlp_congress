 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Madam President.   Ten years ago today, at breakfast tables all around the country,  Americans read a shocking headline: ``Fed assumes the role of lender of  last resort.'' The biggest investment banks on Wall Street were getting  their first taxpayer bailout, but some of the banks were so addicted to  poisonous scam mortgages that even that bailout wasn't enough. Within a  week, Bear Stearns--an 85-year-old fixture on Wall Street--would fall,  and the financial crisis would begin.   Within a year, American workers' retirement accounts had lost $2.7  trillion, almost one-third of their value. No one bailed them out.  Within 2 years, 8.8 million Americans had lost their jobs. No one  bailed them out. Within 3 years, more than 4 million homes had been  lost to foreclosures, and millions more were in danger. No one bailed  the homeowners out. Now, to mark the 10th anniversary of that  devastating crisis, the Senate is on the verge of rolling back the  rules on the big banks again.    Last week I talked about how this bill guts important consumer  protections, how it weakens the oversight of banks with up to a quarter  of a trillion dollars in assets, and how it could set the stage for  another financial crisis, just like past bipartisan bills to roll back  the financial rules. But the bill will also roll back the rules on the  very biggest banks in the country, the true Wall Street banks,  including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and the rest--banks that taxpayers  spent $180 billion bailing out in 2008. And no matter what the  supporters of this bill say, there are three glaring parts of this bill  that without question help the very biggest Wall Street banks.   First, this bill opens the door to easing up on big banks' stress  tests. Right now, about 40 of the biggest banks go through stress tests  every year, simulating a financial crisis and making sure that if it  happened, they could survive. This bill says that 25 of them can just  skip the hard test from now on, and the remaining 15 or so--well, they  don't necessarily have to do those tests every single year. For the  banks that are still going to be doing stress tests, they can now be  done, under this bill, ``periodically.'' Who decides what  ``periodically'' means--the former investment bankers Donald Trump has  nominated to lead the Fed and to head up the Fed's supervisory work?  Does that make you feel safe?   Second, the bill gives the biggest banks a new legal tool to fight  for weaker rules. Right now, the law says that the Fed ``may'' tailor  capital and other rules for the biggest banks. This bill says the Fed  ``shall'' tailor the rules for the banks with more than $250 billion in  assets--the very biggest banks in this country. That one word--the  switch from ``may'' to ``shall''--may not seem like much, but it means  everything to the high-priced lawyers who represent these banks.   Here is what Jeffrey Gordon, a professor at Columbia Law School, had  to say about that one-word change:         This apparently minor change is likely to produce       significant degradation of financial stability, especially       over the long run. The change would expose the Fed to       litigation challenges to its enhanced standards, in       particular whether they are already adequately tailored. . .       . The statute thus empowers the largest firms which pose the       biggest risks to bargain with the Fed for laxer standards       with the threat of a well-resourced litigation challenge in       the background. Over time this bargaining for laxity will       produce a race-to-the-bottom dynamic that will dramatically       increase the chance of another financial crisis.    Professor Gordon of Columbia Law School says that will dramatically  increase the chance of another financial crisis.   If you think the one-word change from ``may'' to ``shall'' won't  change much, consider this: Opponents to the bill have been pointing  out this problem loudly and publicly, but the bill's sponsors won't  change it. They won't change that one word. Why? Because the giant  banks want the change.   The third bank giveaway in this bill undercuts capital requirements  for the biggest banks. The best way to stop another taxpayer bailout of  the big banks is to make sure they have enough capital on hand to  withstand a crisis. That is why Congress and the regulators established  tougher capital requirements for the big banks after the last financial  crisis. This bill reverses direction, opening the door to big banks  like JPMorgan and Citigroup facing much lower capital requirements than  they do now. In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office says  there is a 50-percent chance that JPMorgan and Citigroup can take  advantage of a provision in the bill to reduce their capital  requirements.   The Wall Street Journal editorial board--no fan of tough regulation-- wrote that the change proposed in the banking bill is dangerous and  ``will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic.'' The  Bloomberg editorial board says the bill ``chip[s] away at the bedrock  of financial resilience--the equity capital that allows  [[Page S1622]]  banks to absorb losses and keep on lending in bad times.'' And the  consequences could be huge. According to the FDIC, this provision could  lower capital requirements for JPMorgan by $21.4 billion and for  Citigroup by $8.6 billion.   At the end of last week, the supporters of the bill introduced a new  amendment that they claimed would address the problems in this bill,  but that amendment did nothing to address these three glaring big-bank  giveaways: The stress test provision is unchanged, the litigation  provision is unchanged, and the capital requirements provision is  unchanged. Victories for the big banks have been preserved 100 percent.   But it is not just the big-bank giveaways that remain unaddressed in  this new amendment. Over the last week, we have heard a lot of  criticism about this bill from experts and from civil rights groups and  from consumer advocates and from former regulators, and, most  importantly, from our constituents back home. They don't like it. This  banking bill undermines civil rights laws. It weakens consumers  protections on mortgages and mobile home purchases. It rolls back rules  on 25 of the 40 largest banks in the country. It does almost nothing to  protect consumers. Let me be perfectly clear about this. The new  amendment does not address a single one of these legitimate criticisms.  It is a bunch of fig leaves designed to let supporters of the bill  pretend that they have addressed those criticisms without actually  addressing them. In some cases, these little fig leaves actually make  things worse.   Let's start with the fake fixes--first, mortgage discrimination.  Mortgage discrimination is real in America. Some banks charge African  Americans more for loans than they charge Whites with similar credit.  Some deny loans to Latinos or to single women. How do we know that?  Because banks have to disclose information about the loans they provide  under something called the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA. Using  HMDA data, a new report shows that in 61 different cities around the  country, minority borrowers were more likely to be denied a mortgage  than White borrowers with the same income. But this bill--the bill that  is pending on the floor of the Senate--now exempts 85 percent of banks  from reporting any HMDA data, making it much harder to discover and  stamp out discrimination.   Senator Cortez Masto had a great idea for fixing this: Take the HMDA  provision out of the pending bill. Leave HMDA alone. If the authors of  this bill really wanted to fix this problem, they would support her  amendment and insist that without that amendment, they would withdraw  their support for the bill. But now the bill's supporters have a fig  leaf. They say that of the 85 percent of banks that no longer will have  to report information about discrimination, if one of those banks  flunks two consecutive examinations under the Community Reinvestment  Act, those banks will have to start reporting discrimination data. If  that looks like a tiny little fig leaf, consider this: Banks get tested  at most every 3 years, which means it would take 6 years of  discrimination to flunk twice. This fig leaf is so small, it is  basically invisible.   Now, for some of these so-called consumer protection fig leaves--the  problems are real; it is just the solutions that are fake. For example,  there is a provision to deal with private student loans from banks. It  says that if a student loan borrower dies, then the bank can't go after  the cosigner of the loan for the full balance. That sounds really  good--at least until you read the fine print. It turns out that spouses  don't count. So the bank will still be free to hound widows and  widowers for the balances of their deceased spouses. And the loan isn't  actually forgiven. That means the bank can still go after the dead  borrower's estate for the loan, maybe take half of the house or take  whatever is in the checking account or savings account. It is a  nightmare for a grieving family--and it is also perfectly OK under this  fig leaf amendment.   In some places, it isn't even a fig leaf that pretends to address  problems with the bill; it is just new provisions to create new  problems--like a section that blows a hole in regulators' ability to  require banks to hold capital for commercial real estate. Does anyone  remember that risky commercial real estate investments were a factor in  Bear Stearns' failure 10 years ago this week? Does anyone remember that  6 months later, commercial real estate losses would help blow up Lehman  Brothers? I guess not--at least not right here in Congress, because 10  years later--right now, this week--Congress wants to let banks take one  more commercial real estate fix with less oversight.   Banks of all sizes are making record profits. Only in Washington  would people think it is time to scrap the protections that have kept  us safe for a decade, all so that these same profitable banks can make  even more money. It is the same mindset that set the stage for the  savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and the financial crisis of  2008.   America's working families will pay the price if we make the same  mistakes again. It isn't too late. We should stop this bill from  becoming law.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.
