 I thank the Delegate and the Congresswoman from the Virgin  Islands and her counterpart, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), for  really supporting this Congressional Black Caucus hour so that we can  discuss the pledges and proposals that President Trump has made as the  new deal within the Black community.   Mr. Speaker and Madam Chairwoman of this Special Order, I would like  to engage in a kind of colloquy with the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), who has been a State appropriator before he joined this  body for some 25 years. I hate to date him. He has been a member of the  prestigious appropriations committee. So, therefore, he was tasked with  taking Federal funds and making those appropriations and those  decisions at the State level. I wanted him to help evaluate some of the  proposals that now President Trump has made regarding his new deal for  Black America.   One of the proposals that President Trump has made is to allow the  conversion of funds for poverty programs to be converted from those  programs into microloans that he would then provide to the poor. I am  feeling a little confused and perplexed as to how this would work. I  fear that this is part of kind of the double speak or alternative facts  about the roots of and the solutions to poverty.   As the gentleman now serves on the Committee on Small Business here  in the House, and he has been an appropriator, I am wondering, number  one, if converting funds from, say, the Temporary Assistance to Needy  Families Act, which is comprised of mostly poor women and children or  Social Security disability insurance, which is set aside for those  folks with significant disabilities, or perhaps SNAP and food stamps,  those people who are temporarily out of the workforce waiting to go  back, find another job, but need to sort of eat that month--I am  wondering how, in his experience, converting programs set aside for  poor people would a poor person use a microloan.   I have two questions. I want the gentleman to sort of respond to what  poor people would do. Presumably they would create their own jobs with  these microloans. How big, perhaps, would these microloans have to be  in order for them to establish their own businesses so that they would  be off welfare?   In fact, on any given day, there are 3 million children who live in  extreme poverty, off of less than $3 a day. So I guess I would wonder  how converting those funds--what those children who are not capable and  eligible to work would do with such a proposal.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    I thank the gentleman for that because I thought maybe it  was just me who thought that. Here we are, we live in a country with  the largest economy, with arguably the strongest, greatest  technological economy, and I wonder what these poor women who are on  welfare would do?   He says he wants to get them off of welfare. Would they sell fruit on  the street? How would that work in Detroit or Milwaukee?   We are not talking about women who live in countries where microloans  may work very well in those limited economies.                                time  2100    I am also wondering how those people who are structurally unemployed  would benefit from these microloans.   What this does, Madam Chairperson of this initiative, is that what  this really is saying is that this is really perpetuating the  persistent myth of people who are poor as the shiftless, lazy welfare  queens of poverty pimps, and that the solution is to take away the  safety net and force them to do some kind of work, whether that work is  sustainable enough for them.   And so I would say, as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus,  that we ought to have welfare reform that really honors our commitment  as Americans to make sure that we provide some kind of safety net for  the majority of the poor who are, in fact, children. There are, in  fact, people who are not capable, or should not be responsible, for  providing for themselves through our very sophisticated economy.   I would say, Mr. Speaker, that if we really want to help get people  off welfare, we should not start the debate by taking away reproductive  freedom from women. One of the major reasons that women fall into  poverty is the lack of access to birth control, health care, that would  enable them to plan their families, plan their pregnancies. And to say  that you are going to help people get off welfare and to snatch away  funds from Planned Parenthood or their ability to control their  reproduction is a nonstarter in truly helping the truly poor.   I think that President Trump's quest to help those who are truly poor  will only come if the President and his team will actually listen to  the voices of the poor, actually listen to solutions that have been  tried and tested, like providing educational opportunity and upward  mobility to poor people; by respecting women's reproductive rights to  choose; by really creating a sense of Congress that any goal of welfare  reform ought to be to protect children; that any welfare reform ought  to make sure that women are free from domestic violence, sex  trafficking, and human trafficking, and that they be protected; and  that during these periods they not be cut off from public support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Plaskett for this opportunity to speak to  the American people.
