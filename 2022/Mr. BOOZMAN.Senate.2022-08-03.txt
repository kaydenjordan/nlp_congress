 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize U.S.  Marshal Greg Tabor whose dedication to law enforcement and community  service will be deeply missed following his retirement.   Marshal Tabor's devotion to public safety is grounded in his years of  serving and protecting the people of Arkansas.   Greg Tabor earned his police officer certificate from the Arkansas  Law Enforcement Training Academy. He began his career as a firefighter  and emergency medical technician in Eureka Springs. He worked for a  local company before launching his law enforcement career with the  Washington County Sheriff's Office. He joined the Fayetteville Police  Department in 1985 and honorably served for 34 years, with 13 years as  chief of police. In addition, he served as chairman of the board for  the Fourth Judicial District Drug Task Force.   He continued his public service as chief of police at the Northwest  Arkansas National Airport. In 2020, I was honored to support his  confirmation to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of  Arkansas.   Given his long and distinguished career in law enforcement, it is no  surprise he excelled in the position.   As U.S. Marshal, Tabor helped direct law enforcement responses to  local, regional, and Federal investigations and preserve public safety.  His career prepared and served him well during his tenure leading the  service's Western District of Arkansas branch and carrying on its  storied legacy in The Natural State.   His dedication serves as an inspiration for all Arkansans. I applaud  his leadership, perseverance and commitment to serving our State and  upholding law and order. His guidance and experience have helped us  build a better Arkansas.   We can be proud of Marshal Greg Tabor's lifelong service. He has  embodied what it means to serve and protect and deserves our thanks for  bettering communities in our State.   He is a true public servant whose impact will be felt for years to  come. It has been an honor to work with him during his service, and I  wish him all the best in his next endeavor.                            ____________________
