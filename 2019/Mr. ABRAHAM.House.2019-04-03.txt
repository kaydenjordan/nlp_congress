 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April as National  Donate Life Month and the awareness one Louisiana family has brought to  organ donation through the tragic loss of their son.   On May 5, 2015, the Perry family, from Monroe, welcomed twin babies,  John Clarke and Ella, to the world. All was fine and well for the twins  until John Clarke was given the fatal diagnosis of a brain bleed  shortly after their 6-month checkup. On November 29, 2015, John Clarke  passed away at only 6 months old.   Before his death, his parents, Jonathan and Holley, were approached  about donating John Clarke's organs, to which they agreed.   Meanwhile, 400 miles away in Auburn, Alabama, the Boswell family  faced a similarly heartbreaking situation. Their son Davis, who was  born in June 2015, had been diagnosed with enterovirus, an infection  that attacked his heart. His only chance at survival was an improbable  heart transplant.   On a Sunday night in November, Davis' parents, Amanda and Tucker,  received a call saying that a match had been found and that Davis would  receive a heart. On November 29, 2015, Davis underwent a successful  heart transplant.   A few days later, Amanda and Holley were connected by a mutual friend  on Facebook and realized that Davis had probably received John Clarke's  heart, a fact confirmed by the hospital.   In April 2016, the Boswells and the Perrys met at an event raising  awareness for organ donation. The two families have continued to meet  over the years at the annual Auburn-LSU football game, turning the  rivalry game into an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for organ  donation across the country.   While this sequence of events could have only been handcrafted by  God, organ donations save lives across the country on a daily basis.   In 2018, 36,528 organ transplants were performed, a record high for  the sixth consecutive year. On average, one organ donor can save up to  eight lives. Through organ donation, John Clarke saved two children's  lives.   Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize the unspeakable tragedy that the  Perrys faced and their incredibly brave decision to donate John  Clarke's organs. Through this heartbreaking decision, John Clarke  became a hero.   Today, John Clarke is remembered by his family for his big blue eyes  and sweet smile, a smile his parents say grew wider every time the LSU  Tigers and New Orleans Saints were on TV.   Like so many donors, John Clarke is no longer with us, but his legacy  lives on in the bodies of those who received his organs. Throughout the  month of April, I will be thinking of John Clarke, the entire Perry  family, and all those who have given the gift of organ donation as a  final act of compassion.                            Honoring Mason Andrews     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Mason  Andrews, an 18-year-old from Monroe, Louisiana, who was recently  recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest pilot  to circumnavigate the globe.   Mason is a junior at Louisiana Tech University who set off on his  trip around the world on July 22 and returned October 6 of 2018. He  flew for 76 days in the spirit of Louisiana, a 1976 Piper Lance PA-32  single-engine aircraft. Mason made over 20 stops around the world,  including Dubai, Paris, and Taiwan. His longest leg of the journey was  the 14-hour, 2,150-mile stretch from Japan to Alaska.   Mason flew not only to break a world record, but to raise awareness  and funds for MedCamps of Louisiana. MedCamps of Louisiana is a free  summer camp for children with varying disabilities or illnesses, such  as autism, spina bifida, and Down syndrome.   Mason has served as a camp counselor for 3 years with MedCamps of  Louisiana and raised over $30,000 for the camp during his flight. To  raise these funds and to break the world record, Mason overcame all  obstacles he faced, including a sandstorm over Saudi Arabia and two  Category 5 typhoons that kept him grounded for the better part of  September.   I am proud of what Mason was able to accomplish and how he has  represented the great State of Louisiana. From one pilot to another, I  congratulate Mason on his incredible achievement and look forward to  what he will accomplish next.                        Born-Alive Survivor Protection     Mr. Speaker, I rise today about something that has  really been weighing on my mind, and that is the disturbing push for  late-term abortions we have been seeing around the country.   I am a doctor by trade. I have delivered many babies myself. I have  seen babies in the womb on ultrasound wince in pain, and I have seen  them comforted by their mother's voice. That baby is every bit as alive  then as he or she is when a mother gets to hold her or him for the  first time.   I believe that life begins at conception. I believe adoption is  always better than abortion. And I certainly believe that delivering a  baby in the third trimester is far better for both the mother and the  baby than a late-term abortion, which brings me back to why I wanted to  speak tonight.   The disturbing trend of codifying protections for late-term abortions  must stop, and it will take Federal action to ban it across the entire  country.   We see what is happening at the State level:   New York has passed a law that allows abortions at any time--at any  time. That is outrageous, especially considering that many babies can  live outside the womb around 20 weeks.   Virginia tried to pass a similar law. Virginia Governor Ralph  Northam, a Democrat, who argued that babies could be killed after birth  if the mother had preferred to abort it rather than to birth it, said:    ``The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept  comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother  and family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the  physicians and the mother.''   That is disgusting. That is an endorsement of a murder of a helpless  child, and we cannot stand for that.   I am a proud cosponsor of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act,  which requires that babies who survive abortions be given the same  standard of care as any person in medical need.   This is a commonsense approach because a baby is a person. Doctors  are sworn to help those in need, and I cannot fathom how any medical  provider could watch a helpless baby struggling outside the womb after  she survives an abortion.   Even still, Democrats are standing in the way of ending this heinous  practice. Republicans have tried nearly 30 times to bring to the floor  a vote on the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, and Democrats have  blocked it every single time.   Thankfully, my colleagues,   Steve Scalise from my great State of  Louisiana and Ann Wagner, have introduced a discharge petition to go  around the Democratic leadership and force a vote on this important  bill.   I have signed the petition, and my prayer is that the Chamber can  come together in a bipartisan way to state firmly that the United  States of America does not believe in killing babies, especially after  they are born.   Critics say that it is a woman's choice and that politicians are  interfering. If a baby is crying and he is crying out for help in an  operating room, that is a person, an individual who is entitled to the  same life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that every American is  entitled to. Only the individual can decide that path forward for  themselves; it is not the choice of anyone else; and a living,  breathing baby deserves a chance to live.   They say this bill is unnecessary because it is already law, pointing  to the 2002 Born-Alive Infants Protection Act which codified into law  that any person born alive in any stage of development is a legal  person. Since that time, however, there have been cases where abortion  providers do not consider a baby born if it survives an abortion.   The Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act ends all debate and further  protects babies who survive abortions. The Born-Alive Survivors  Protection Act is a literal matter of life and death. It is about the  core values of what we as  [[Page H3066]]  Americans and every single politician in State and Federal Government  should clearly and definitely know: where we stand on this important  bill.   My position is clear: I stand with the babies. I stand with life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, April 4, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
