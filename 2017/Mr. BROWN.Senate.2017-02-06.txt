Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, it is pretty clear. It is pretty simple.  There never has been a nominee for Secretary of Education as  unqualified as Betsy DeVos. That is clear to pretty much every Member  of this body--not that every Member of this body is going to stand up  and vote the way that probably their conscience suggests they do.  Whether they like her ideology or not, whether they like the hundreds  of millions of dollars they have contributed to all kinds of political  campaigns or not, they clearly understand that this nominee, from her  performance and her lack of depth of knowledge of education, is simply  not qualified.   As many have said on this floor, based on her confirmation hearing,  it appears she has a complete lack of knowledge as to what the  Department of Education actually does. She didn't seem to understand  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires public  schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with  disabilities.   I think that when I first ran for Congress some years ago--I assume  it was the same for the Presiding Officer; I know it was the same for  the ranking member from Washington State who sits here in this Chamber  and who has led the opposition to Betsy DeVos--from my first days in  Congress, every time I met with school boards, every time I met with  teachers, every time I met with school administrators, with principals,  they would talk to me about IDEA. They would talk to me about school  districts and the costs and their obligation and duty and desire to  serve these students. Yet the designee for Secretary of Education put  her hands up when there were discussions in the committee on the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.   It is astonishing that a nominee for Secretary of Education would  demonstrate complete ignorance on something as crucial and important to  public school education--to education as a whole--on this. It isn't her  hearing performance alone that should disqualify her; it is her record.  She has no experience with public schools at all.   The President of the United States has nominated for Secretary of  Education someone with no experience in public schools at all--not as a  teacher, not as an administrator, not as a student, not even as a  parent. Nothing. Her only experience in education is as  [[Page S813]]  a wealthy donor inheriting tens of millions of dollars herself. Her  only experience in education is as a wealthy donor who spent millions  of dollars advocating for for-profit--not charter schools like KIPP and  Breakthrough in my State but for-profit charters in her State, the same  policy that has ripped off taxpayers and failed students in Ohio. It  betrays students, and it undermines and fleeces taxpayers.   It is obvious that if she and her family hadn't donated $200 million  to Republicans and to conservative causes, there is no chance someone  this unqualified would ever have been nominated for a position as  exalted, as crucial, as important as Secretary of Education. Two  hundred million dollars apparently is the price for the Cabinet slot.   So much for the President's campaign promise of draining the swamp.  We see nominee after nominee, appointee after appointee coming from  Wall Street. Now we see a $200 million contributor has also earned a  Cabinet slot.   Because of her crusade, more than 80 percent of Michigan's charter  schools are operated for profit. She helped design one of the least  effective charter school systems in the country in Detroit. This  matters to me because I know a lot about what has happened with for- profit charter schools in Ohio. For-profit charters have failed in  Ohio. They have led to a charter school sector. Again, taking out KIPP  and Breakthrough and the good charters that we have seen in Ohio, we  have seen a charter school sector that has wasted taxpayers' money,  that has funneled it to unaccountable for-profit companies, and that  have been plagued by scandal after scandal.   I take that personally in Ohio because I know how students have been  betrayed by this for-profit sector, I know how taxpayers have been  fleeced in my State in this for-profit sector, and I know the  devastation it leaves behind in less money, fewer dollars for public  schools.   People call my State, regrettably, the ``Wild Wild West of charter  schools.'' What a name to earn--Ohio is the ``Wild Wild West'' of for- profit charter schools. Students suffer as a result. Students in public  schools, students in for-profit charter schools, and students in not- for-profit charter schools suffer as a result. The last thing we need  to do is take the Wild Wild West model in Ohio or, even worse, the for- profit charter school structure and model in Michigan and replicate it  at a national level.   This is important to remember: Of all the K-12 students in the  country, public schools educate 90 percent of them, 90 percent of the  students in this country. Betsy DeVos called traditional public  education a ``dead end.'' Dead end for whom? She called traditional  public education a ``dead end.''   Think of what we have done in this country. From 1789, when George  Washington took the oath of office, up until now, public education has  built this country. It has given all kinds of people opportunity, given  all kinds of people a chance to get ahead. It has educated our  children. We should be proud of our public school system.   We may confirm in the vote today a nominee who called a traditional  public education a ``dead end,'' someone who has never worked in a  public school, never gone to a public school, never been a parent of  somebody in a public school.   She said she doesn't think that all schools that receive taxpayer  dollars--whether they are public or for-profit charter--should be held  to the same standards of accountability.   To me, one of the most telling moments of the committee hearing was  when she would not commit to the same accountability standards for for- profit charters as she did for public schools. Do you know why? Because  she knows her for-profit charters that she is so proud of don't live up  to the same standards and that they are simply not as good. That is why  she doesn't want accountability measures applied equally to for-profit  charters and public education.   In Michigan, she fought a rescue plan for Detroit Public Schools that  would have finally provided accountability for charters schools. No.  She is against that. Why have lower standards for for-profit charters  schools? Maybe that is because--I don't know about her investments. I  don't think she has disclosed everything to the committee, but neither  did Secretary-Designee Mnuchin. Neither did Secretary-Designee Price. I  can go on and on. She doesn't want the same accountability for profit  charters because it might hurt some of her investor friends.   She funneled $25,000--mostly inherited money--every day to  legislators of Michigan until this accountability proposal was  defeated. It was probably not $25,000 every day, but over time it  averaged $25,000 a day to legislators in Michigan so she could have her  way. Talk about draining the swamp. Yet she can't seem to come up  with--this I take personally too--the $5 million she owes to Ohio  taxpayers for violating State election laws. What is that about? She  came into Ohio with a political action committee that she mostly funded  and that she was involved in in a number of ways.   The Ohio Elections Commission and Ohio officials in a nonpartisan way  found her guilty of campaign finance law violation. This committee was  assessed a $5 million fine. Guess what. She quit putting money in this  committee because she didn't want it to be subject to the fine. Our  attorney general has not gone after her. He wants to be Governor, and  he is a member of her party. I don't know their relationship or much  care, but she is depriving our State of $5 million that she owes  through this committee. Legally, she has found a way, with very  expensive lawyers, to weasel out of it, to navigate her way through it.   The fact is, by any standards of decency, she owes my State $5  million. That could be 60 or 70 or 80 teachers. She cares about  education. Paying a $5 million fine is probably like me paying 50  bucks. She is a billionaire, and $5 million won't break her. She will  hardly notice it. But she is going to be in charge of the Department of  Education, which collects student loan debt from people coming out of  school making $30 or $40 or $50,000 a year, burdened with tens of  thousands in student loan debt and struggling every month to make those  payments. Yet she owes $5 million, and she just says: Sorry, I am not  going to pay it.   Through this confirmation process, she will not even pay the debt of  $5 million. Are my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle  saying it is OK to nominate her and confirm her even though she owes  this money to my State? She sent us a letter finally last week because  I asked her to explain herself in the promise to repay taxpayers in my  State.   She sent us a letter last week again refusing to take any personal  responsibility for the legal action of this political action committee  she founded. She chaired it at the time it broke the law, she paid the  legal bills for it, but she wouldn't pay the fine that this committee  owes, saying: I don't owe it.   Is that who you want? Is that the kind of person you want in terms of  personal integrity, personal responsibility? I don't know how many  times I have been preached at in this body by my colleagues on personal  responsibility. But she will not pay her $5 million debt. Again, she  founded a political action committee. She chaired it at the time she  broke the law. She paid the legal fees for it, but she will not pay the  money she owes that could hire 60, 70, 80 teachers in my State.   She spent millions pushing the same for-profit education model agenda  that has ripped off Ohio taxpayers and shortchanged our students.   Most people in this country used to think that billionaires are not  above the law. In fact, some people--3 million fewer than voted for the  other candidate--some people voted for this President because he said  he would drain the swamp. If billionaires are, in fact, above the law-- if we are not holding Betsy DeVos accountable, it is hard to argue that  billionaires are not above the law.   She is opposed by the disability community. She is opposed by the  civil rights community. She is opposed by a number of people in the  more legitimate charter school community. She is opposed by teachers.  Even the National Association of Principals has come out against her  nomination. If Senator Murray's words are correct about this--and I  know they are because we have talked to them--this is the first time in  history that the National Association of Principals has come out  against a Secretary of Education.  [[Page S814]]    I can't support Betsy DeVos because I can't look Ohio's parents in  the eye and tell them she will not put profits ahead of their  children's education. Our children deserve better than that.   In closing, I will come back to my comments about the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act, about which she knew nothing or knew  little. I think how could a Secretary of Education-designate, who  prides herself on knowing a lot about education, how could she not know  much about IDEA? And then it occurred to me. If you are running a for- profit charter school, you don't want disabled kids coming to your  school. Why? Because it costs more to educate a disabled child than it  does a child without any disabilities. It costs more because you might  need more use of a nurse, a student aide, wheelchair accessibility, you  might need special tutors. It costs more to educate a disabled child. A  for-profit charter school doesn't want children with disabilities to  walk through their doors or come in through a wheelchair through their  doors. They can't make as much money.    This is how we do privatization in this country: Let the public  schools take care of the disabled, the child with disabilities, because  we are in this for profit. It is a little bit like Medicare. The  private for-profit insurance companies want the youngest, healthiest  people in Medicare, the 65- and 70-year-olds who are active, who take  walks, do all that. They don't really want the sickest and the oldest.  Let taxpayers pay for them. That is exactly what her model of education  is all about. Let the for-profit charters skim the cream, if you will;  take the children who cost the least and are easiest to educate, but  the public schools take care of the children with disabilities.   Let the public schools take care of the children who maybe didn't  have as much advantage in life as Betsy DeVos growing up. Let the  public schools worry about the kids who might be a little more  difficult because of discipline and other issues and what is going on  in their homes. That is pretty clear how she looks at the world and  looks at this job and, most importantly, how she looks at education in  our country.   That is what disturbs me. That is fundamentally why I oppose Betsy  DeVos and plan to vote emphatically today, no.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the job of the Attorney General of the  United States is to enforce laws that protect the rights of each and  every American. More than ever--more than ever--we need leaders who can  bring Americans together to improve police-community relations, to  ensure that all Americans have access to the ballot, and to reform our  criminal justice system.   In the city in which I live, in Cleveland, we are under a consent  decree today which already is improving relations between the police  and the community. We saw it more than a decade ago in Cincinnati,  where Mayor Cranley--then a member of the council and now the mayor-- has worked with the community, as have others. We see more people of  color in the police department, and we see better training for police.  We see improved relations in that community, in large part because the  community came together--police, community leaders, citizens--to make  [[Page S905]]  for better relationships and better relations inside the community. The  consent decree there made a huge difference in that city. The consent  decree in Cleveland is making a difference there. That is partly the  job of the Attorney General--to make sure the Department of Justice  stays on course to do that.   When we think of leaders whom we need to improve police-community  relations, to ensure Americans have access to the ballot, and to reform  our criminal justice system, Senator Sessions is simply not that  leader. It is not personal. I have worked with Senator Sessions on  issues like trade. I actually told him that, if he had been nominated  as the Trade Representative, I would have happily voted for him. But we  have strong policy differences on the issues that directly fall under  the role of the Attorney General.   I examined his nearly 40-year record as a U.S. attorney, the attorney  general of Alabama, and as U.S. Senator. Based on that record, I was  the first in the Senate to say I cannot support his nomination. I told  Senator Sessions on the floor of the Senate after I made that decision,  before I announced it.   I have serious concerns that Senator Sessions' record on civil rights  is at direct odds with the task of promoting justice and equality for  all. What is more important in an Attorney General than that?   Senator Sessions has a history of racial insensitivity, bias against  immigrants, disregard for the rule of law, hostility to the protection  of civil rights--exactly what we don't need in the Attorney General of  the United States of America.   He condemned the Department of Justice's investigation of law  enforcement agencies accused of violating civil rights. He voted  against the Violence Against Women Act. One issue after another after  another disqualifies him from being the Attorney General of the United  States.   Senator Sessions is wrong on voting rights. I served as Secretary of  State of Ohio in the 1980s. I take voting rights very seriously. I  believe we should be doing everything we can to make it easier for  Americans to vote. In those days, in the 1980s, during the Reagan years  in Washington, in Ohio we had voter registration, voter outreach,  aggressive enrollment of new people to vote, of young people, of people  regardless of political affiliation, regardless of ideology, regardless  of age and race and income. We encouraged people to vote. We had good  cooperation from Republicans and Democrats alike in the legislature.   I even approached the McDonald's corporation and asked them to print  tray liners. They put tray liners on every tray. You go to McDonald's  and order food. So I asked them to print the voter registration form on  tray liners. They printed a million registration-form tray liners,  resulting in thousands and thousands of voter registrations--some  perhaps with ketchup stains or mustard stains on them, but nonetheless  voter registration forms that were accepted by local boards of  elections.   Utility companies included voter registration forms in their bills.  Newspapers printed them in their daily papers so people could tear them  out, fill them out, and send them in.   That was what we did for aggressive voter outreach, supported by  people across the political spectrum.   But Senator Sessions doesn't seem to agree with that kind of voter  outreach. He has a history of supporting voter ID laws that make it  harder to vote. He refused to disavow President Trump's false  statement--provably false. Lots of people may believe it because  President Trump said it, but it is a provably false statement that  there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes in this past election--no  evidence, just demagoguery, just lies. But Senator Sessions was  unwilling to disavow his perhaps future boss's comments.   Do we want an Attorney General, chief law enforcement official that  is going to let the President go out and make statements like that that  are provably false? Call them what they are--lies from the President of  the United States. Do we want an Attorney General who is simply going  to brush those away and pay no attention?   Senator Sessions called Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a key  part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, good news for the South, even  though, overwhelmingly, Senators in both parties had voted to renew and  reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. He called it good news for the South  to weaken protections for people of color and others in voting rights.   Since that misguided decision, States across the country have passed  new voting restrictions that would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands  of Americans. As Senator Sessions apparently was celebrating by saying  ``good news for the South,'' Texas moved within 2 hours of the  decision. Alabama, taking their cue from people like Senator Sessions,  acted the next day to restrict voting rights. As soon as the Court  moved in a way the Court hadn't moved in five decades, State after  State began to restrict voting rights because they had license to,  because they had a green light, because they now had legal authority-- something they had not had in 50 years.   At least 17 States have passed new voting restrictions since the  Shelby County decision, although my State wasn't covered by it. My  State, shamefully, is one of those that has restricted voting rights,  even though from the 1980s into the 1990s, people of both parties  joined me in wanting to expand voting rights and make sure that  everybody--regardless of disability, age, gender, race, nationality, or  income--was able to vote.   We know who is hurt most by these laws, and there is political reason  for it. We know who is hurt most--it is African Americans, Latinos,  young people, and seniors. It just happens to be the voters who  potentially might vote against the far right, which has lobbied hard  after the decision to scale back voting rights.   Senator Sessions called the Voting Rights Act intrusive. Tell that to  Congressman Lewis, who was beat up walking across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge in Selma, in Senator Sessions' State, who risked his life  numbers of times, who was injured more, probably, than anybody in the  civil rights movement, including in his home State of Alabama-- Congressman Lewis' and Senator Sessions' home State of Alabama.   Senator Sessions knows what happened to secure those voting rights  for African Americans in his State. He was a young man at the time and  saw what happened in the 1950s, and Rosa Parks and John Lewis in the  1950s and 1960s, and still he calls the Voting Rights Act intrusive.   I remember in my State, in 2004, people had to wait 6 hours in Greene  County to vote, in Knox County people had to wait 9 hours to vote. The  people who are penalized the most are not people of higher income, who  tend to have a little more flexibility in their schedule and who can  leave work during lunch, go vote, and go back to work. If they have to  wait more than 30, 40, 50 minutes or an hour, they often can't do it.  They have to pick up their kids where daycare is expensive, and we know  that many of them give up and don't vote, which might just be the  purpose of people behind the Shelby County vs. Holder decision.    In 1981, when signing an extension to the Voting Rights Act,  President Reagan called the right to vote the crown jewel of American  liberties. President Reagan said it is the crown jewel of American  liberties. Senator Sessions called the Voting Rights Act intrusive.   A couple of extensions later, the Court pulled back with Shelby  County vs. Holder. Keep this in mind. Sometimes these pass the Congress  unanimously. President Reagan said it was the crown jewel of American  liberties. The Attorney General-designee calls the Voting Rights Act  intrusive.   We need an Attorney General who will use the full extent of his  powers to protect the right to vote, not stand by as State after State  attempts to suppress it. The Attorney General as a Senator has stood by  while the President of the United States has simply lied about 3 to 5  million illegal voters.   The Attorney General-designee stood by and said nothing and was  unwilling to criticize the President of the United States. I am  concerned that when State after State attempts to suppress the vote and  roll back voting rights, he will stand by and do nothing because he  called the Voting Rights Act intrusive.   As to criminal justice reform, we need to reform our criminal justice  [[Page S906]]  system and stop ruining the lives of far too many young Black men over  nonviolent offenses. Senator Sessions has opposed bipartisan efforts,  and there have been a number of them and a number of courageous leaders  in this body who have sometimes taken politically unpopular positions  on criminal justice reform and done the right thing. Senator Sessions,  however, has opposed bipartisan efforts in the criminal justice reform.  At the outset of my speech, I mentioned Cleveland and Cincinnati, where  it is a decade and a half later, and it has proven to be a success. In  Cleveland, it is shaping up to be a success. He has called consent  decrees that mandate reform of law enforcement agencies ``an end run  around the democratic process.''   Reform of law enforcement agencies in many ways means better police  training, with real dollars and real effort put into that police  training. Again, he calls all of this ``an end run around the  democratic process.'' Senator Sessions blocked bipartisan efforts to  reduce sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses.   There is surely a need for an independent Attorney General, and that  is my third macro concern about my colleague Senator Sessions being  elevated to be the Attorney General of the United States of America. In  light of President Trump's cruel and foolish and badly executed  Executive order on immigrants and refugees, we need an Attorney General  who will be an independent voice beholden to the Constitution and the  American people, not to the President. We have seen this order wreak  havoc on Ohio students and families.   A Cleveland father who had waited 4 years to reunite with his 14- year-old son was forced to wait even longer when his refugee son was  banned.   We are a nation that embraces refugees. My son-in-law, at the age of  10, was living in El Salvador with his family. His mother was a  journalist. His mother was the target of threats to her life because of  political violence in El Salvador. My son-in-law's family came to the  United States and was welcomed in this country. We welcome refugees who  were victims, potential victims, or about to be victims of political  violence or violence of any kind. That is what we are as a nation.   My son-in-law is married to our daughter. They now have a son who is  not much more than 1 year old. He has been a terrific citizen of this  country. He has contributed a lot. We know that when a great majority  of refugees come here they build lives, they make a difference in the  world, and they can live in a free, prosperous nation with opportunity.   I mentioned the Cleveland father. I mentioned my son-in-law. A doctor  on her way to the Cleveland Clinic to help treat Ohioans was sent back.  She now has returned to the United States, finally, after expensive  legal issues, trauma, and all the things that happen when somebody is  pushed around by a system like that with an arrogant White House  inflicting that kind of pain on her family.   The Iraqis who risked their lives to help American troops have been  told: There is no place for you here.   Think about that. The first night after the Executive order, a  translator from Iraq, an Iraqi, who had helped American troops and  whose own life was threatened, knew he had to leave his country because  a number of people targeted people who helped the Americans. He came  here. He was handcuffed for hour after hour in a New York airport.   What message does that send to people who help Americans, who help  the American Armed Forces around the world?   Students are prevented from coming to our State to learn and  contribute in our great Ohio universities. We saw that in Ohio State.  We are seeing that in other places. Judges across the country,  appointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents, are striking down  this order because it is not constitutional. It does not represent  American values. It makes us less, not more, safe.   In 2015, Senator Sessions questioned Sally Yates in her confirmation  to be Deputy Attorney General, asking her this question: ``Do you think  the Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President  if he asks for something that is improper?''   Senator Sessions is asking an Obama nominee: ``Do you think the  Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if  he asks for something that is improper?''   He went on to say: ``If the views the President wants to execute are  unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General  say no?''   That was a Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Deputy  Attorney Sally Yates in 2015.   Ms. Yates responded: ``Senator, I believe the Attorney General or the  Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the  Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the  President.''   Senator Sessions, to his credit, was right to ask that question.  Sally Yates, to her credit, gave the right answer, and when she was  tested just last week, she stood by her word.   Senator Sessions has failed to assure the American people he will  follow the law and uphold the Constitution--not simply follow the  President of the United States, not blindly follow the President of the  United States just because he is his boss. That is not the kind of  Attorney General we want. That is not the kind of Attorney General we  should vote to confirm today.   There is one last point. I watched the confirmation yesterday of the  Secretary of Education. It was so clear to me, so clear to so many of  my colleagues, and so clear to the American public that confirming this  Secretary of Education was an unprecedented historical move. The Vice  President came in and broke the tie, 51 to 50. Two Republicans stood up  and voted against the Secretary of Education-designee, showing great  courage.   What was so evident was the overwhelming opposition to her. Our mail,  phone calls, and emails were 200 to 1 against her confirmation. It was  that way everywhere in the country. In Senator's office after Senator's  office, we were all hearing much, much more opposition to her than  support.   I sensed the fear among my Republican colleagues that voting against  a Trump nominee put their political lives at risk; that they all knew  that President Trump would tweet about their vote, would call them  names, would attack them, would sic his political allies on them. A  number of my colleagues were scared, and they knew that voting against  her confirmation--even though I know a number of colleagues wanted to  vote no on Betsy DeVos because she was singularly unqualified, one of  the worst performances ever in a confirmation hearing. She knew so  little about the issue of education and so little about the Department  which she was charged to run. Nonetheless, they voted for her. Some  voted for her for legitimate reasons in their mind: They like her  ideology; they like her for-profit charter schools; they are anti- public education--all those things.   A number of colleagues, I am convinced, voted for her because they  were afraid of what the President of the United States would do. You  can't run a country by being fearful of the President of the United  States. I am afraid that in this Attorney General vote we are seeing  some of the same fear from some of my Republican colleagues--about  standing up to this President, which they will eventually do but they  are unwilling to do it now. That is why we only have seen two  Republican Senators--Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins--vote no on  any of these nominations.   I voted for about half of them. I voted against about half of them. I  plan to vote against Congressman Price because he wants to raise the  eligibility age of Medicare.   I think about the barber in Warren, the factory worker in Mansfield,  the waitress in a diner in Findlay, and the manufacturing worker in  Huber Heights. I know they shouldn't be expected to work until they are  67 or even 70 to be eligible for Medicare. I will vote against him.   I will vote against Mr. Mnuchin, who lied to the committee, first  about a $100 million investment he had, which he forgot about. It is an  understandable problem. Of course, people forget about $100 million  investments they have. And he lied to the committee about some of the  things he did at OneWest.   A whole host of these nominees simply aren't qualified, and their  ethics  [[Page S907]]  are questionable. Other than Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins, I  have not seen any of my Republican colleagues--out of fear of this  President, fear of this President personally attacking them, publicly  and personally--I have seen them shrink back from doing their  constitutional duty and voting their conscience.   I hope maybe today, maybe in Senator Sessions' vote, which I believe  will be tonight, some of my Republican colleagues will realize they  need to do their jobs. They need to stand up for what they believe when  they realize this Attorney General-designee, Senator Sessions--a  colleague I like personally, but a colleague that simply is not  prepared--is not independent. He has not had a record of support for  voting rights, for criminal justice reform--all the things that we want  in the Attorney General of the United States of America. I plan to vote  no today. I ask my colleagues to join me.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, it is a sad day for our democracy when the  words of Coretta Scott King are not allowed on the floor of the U.S.  Senate. I wish to share those words with you today in their entirety.         Dear Senator Thurmond:        I write to express my sincere opposition to the       confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a federal court       judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My professional       and personal roots in Alabama are deep and lasting. Anyone       who has used the power of his office as United States       Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the       ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts. Mr.       Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a       shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black       voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be       rewarded with the federal judgeship.        I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from       appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,       I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions'       confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this       be made a part of the hearing record.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.        Sincerely,        Coretta Scott King.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
