 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On  Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour  and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no  later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider two measures from the Financial  Services Committee: first, H.R. 2954, the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Adjustment Act, sponsored by Representative Tom Emmer. This bill would  provide targeted regulatory relief to our local community banks and  credit unions; second, H.R. 3326, the World Bank Accountability Act,  sponsored by Representative Andy Barr.   Mr. Speaker, next week, our Nation's Capital will also welcome tens  of thousands of Americans to Washington for the annual March for Life.  In conjunction, the House will vote on H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Marsha  Blackburn. This bill simply states that doctors must provide medical  care to any child born alive after a failed abortion.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are expected,  including legislation to address government funding and other expiring  priorities. I will be sure to inform all Members as soon as any  additional items are added to our schedule.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As the gentleman knows, we have been in discussions to try to get a  budget agreement. We have hopes we can get that done this time. If we  are able to get that budget agreement, we will need some time for the  appropriators to do their work, so we would have a continuing  resolution.  [[Page H162]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am hoping he is asking this question so he will return and start  voting for this. But in the past, that has been what we have done, the  last two, and I don't see any change in what we are moving forward with  now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the negotiations have been progressing further, as they  have for the last month or so. I believe, as we both know, in the need  of this funding for our military. I believe that the military should  not be held hostage for any other issue.   So I believe we can get to a solution here, and I am hopeful that  those who have been negotiating can find common ground in the next day  or two so that we can move forward.
