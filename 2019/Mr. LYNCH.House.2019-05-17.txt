 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to rise in support of  H.R. 5, Mr. Cicilline's bill, the Equality Act.   I rise today as a Christian. Mr. Speaker, this bill will extend the  legal protections provided by the Equal Protection Clause of the United  States Constitution as well as the Civil Rights Act against  discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.   And may I say that it is about time.   This groundbreaking legislation specifically bans wrongful, hurtful  discrimination in housing, employment, education, and other business  and government sectors based on sexual orientation and gender identity.   Individuals from the LGBTQ community are our fellow Americans. Many  of them are Christians. They are our brothers and sisters. And it is,  indeed, shameful that it has taken this very long to provide them with  equal protection under the law.   The Declaration of Independence is, again, a guide. It is instructive  as it reminds us: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all  men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with  certain unalienable rights.''   In closing, none of that can happen without equal treatment under the  law.   ``All'' means all. ``Equal'' means equal. Let's vote for equality.
