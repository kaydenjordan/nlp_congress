 Mr. President I rise today to honor my  constituent, Jonathan Stone.   Save The Bay is a nonprofit organization in Rhode Island that has,  for 50 years, been dedicated to protecting and improving Narragansett  Bay and all the waters that flow into it. Jonathan served as executive  director of Save The Bay for 15 of those years, from 2008 to June of  2023.   During this time, Jonathan challenged everyone at Save The Bay to  think creatively and tackle the most challenging issues facing Rhode  Island's beautiful Narragansett Bay. His leadership strengthened the  legal, advocacy, restoration, and education capacity of the  organization, and built a strong foundation for its next 50 years. The  Narragansett Bay watershed includes 400 miles of coastline and  [[Page S5597]]  stretches 1,705 square miles inland, covering most of Rhode Island and  much of Massachusetts. Its 3,500 miles of streams and rivers carry  water into the bay from over a hundred towns and cities. This  extraordinary natural resource needs constant care and stewardship.   Under Jonathan's leadership, Save The Bay successfully challenged  proposals that threatened the bay, like the construction of an LNG  terminal in Mount Hope Bay and a proposal to fill 33 acres of the  Providence River. Save The Bay also championed several environmental  legislative victories in Rhode Island, including landmark legislation  to phase out cesspools, provide new wetlands protections, and create  and fund a large-scale climate and resilience effort. With Jonathan at  the helm, the organization expanded its reach by establishing a  statewide coordinator for the International Coastal Cleanup and  creating the Narragansett Bay Riverkeeper Program.   Jonathan led Save The Bay through the development and successful  implementation of two strategic plans and created a third that set  ambitious goals for water quality and habitat restoration, marine  science education programs, diversity/equity/inclusion, and climate  change advocacy. During his tenure, Save The Bay launched two new  vessels, MV Elizabeth Morris and MV Rosemary Quinn to grow its marine  science education programs, along with its public education programs:  nature, seal watch, and lighthouse tours. Jonathan also led the  organization's vision for building a new, state-of-the-art aquarium in  downtown Newport, which is set to open in early 2024.   Through this all, he has been a kind and honorable friend. I applaud  Jonathan for his steadfast leadership in protecting and working towards  a fully swimmable, fishable, healthy Narragansett Bay, accessible to  all. I wish him joy and success in his next endeavors.                            ____________________
