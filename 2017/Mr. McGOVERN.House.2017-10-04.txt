 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I obviously rise in strong opposition to  this rule. This can be a frustrating place. So frustrating, that  sometimes I want to tear the remaining two strands of hair I have on my  head out, because what we do here, in my opinion, is not to advance  anything that is good for the American people. This is a frustrating  place, because what happens on this House floor is either nothing or  you guys make things worse.   On Sunday, we once again witnessed a massacre, the worst mass  shooting in American history. People across this country are demanding  action, but the response of the Republican leadership in this Congress  is nothing. We had a moment of silence, but it means nothing because  that is all we do. There are no hearings, no debate, no votes, just  absolutely nothing.   It is obvious that too many Republicans have been intimidated and  have been frightened or have been bought off by the National Rifle  Association. It is shameful and, quite frankly, it is disgusting.   If the Republican leadership of this House is not willing to lead,  then move aside. Allow us to bring measures to the floor so we can have  a vote, so we can have a debate, so we can enact measures that might  save some lives.   Mr. Speaker, what we are considering today, this Republican budget,  is an example of the majority making things worse for the American  people.   Budgets are moral documents. They show what we value and what we care  about. And if this budget reflects Republican values, then shame on  Republicans. When you look at the specific programs House Republicans  target, it becomes clear just how cruel this budget really is.   Last night, in the Rules Committee, I complained loudly to the  distinguished chairwoman of the Budget Committee about the cuts to the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program known as SNAP, basically a  program that provides poor people food. It helps prevent hunger in this  country. In this budget, they call for $164 billion in cuts to this  program.   The chairwoman said: Well, I believe that people who get this benefit  ought to work.   I pointed out to her last night, and I am going to point out to my  colleagues here today, that the majority of people on this program--67  percent of the people who are on this program are not expected to work.  Why? Because they are children, because they are senior citizens,  because they are disabled.   Of those who can work, the majority work. But you have individuals  who are working, who are on SNAP because they earn so little that they  still qualify for this program.   So why aren't we demanding that work pay more in this country? Why  aren't we coming together to demand an increase in the minimum wage so  it is a livable wage, so that people who work don't have to be on  public assistance?   Instead, we have yet another attack on poor people in the form of  these cuts.   The gentlewoman said: Well, I want to narrow it down to just able- bodied adults without dependents. They all ought to work.                                time  1245    Well, many of these people do work, Mr. Speaker, but many of them  don't work, for a number of reasons. Many have limited educational  experience, with 80 percent having no more than a high school education  or a GED. Some are aging out of foster care. Some have underlying  mental health issues, difficult histories of substance abuse, or are  ex-offenders with nowhere else to turn.   As many as 60,000 of these able-bodied adults without dependents who  have qualified for SNAP initially are veterans. These are brave,  courageous men and women who have served our country, who have returned  home and are having difficulty reintegrating into the community,  getting on their feet. Our gratitude for their service is, we  [[Page H7766]]  are going to throw you off the food benefit? I don't know what people  are thinking who drafted this in the budget.   The chairwoman of the Budget Committee said: Well, it is important  that we constantly review programs to see if they are working, if they  are living up to our expectations. I agree. I am a liberal Democrat. I  want to make sure that whatever programs are in existence are working,  are effective. Nobody is for ineffective government.   I happen to sit on the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Speaker. We have  already held 23 oversight hearings on this program--23 on SNAP alone.  We have had Republican witnesses, and we have had Democratic witnesses.  As my friend from Georgia knows, his party is in control, so  Republicans get to have more witnesses than Democrats do. We have had  23 hearings, and not one witness, not one, recommended a $164 billion  cut in this program.   In fact, what they recommended, Democrats and Republicans, was that  we ought to strengthen wraparound services. That means like you ought  to fund fully job training programs so that States can guarantee people  a slot in a job training program.   Many argue, Democratic and Republican witnesses, that the benefit is  too inadequate, that we need to expand the benefit, because contrary to  what you hear oftentimes on this floor about SNAP and about how  generous the benefit is and that it is like a gravy train, if you will,  the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal. That is it. That  is the benefit.   That is why when you talk to the heads of food banks all across the  country, in every State in this country, they tell you the same thing,  that they experience an uptick in people who need to utilize their  services in the middle and toward the end of the month because,  basically, the benefit is not enough to carry them through the month so  they can put enough food on the table for them and their families.   We have 42 million people in the United States of America, the  richest country in the history of the world, who are hungry. I am  ashamed of that, and I am ashamed because hunger is a political  condition.   What I mean by that is we can solve it, but we don't, because for  some reason, this population, these people struggling in poverty, never  quite rise to the level as the very wealthy in this country.   We have a budget here that not only cuts SNAP but basically cuts a  whole bunch of other programs aimed at helping people get out of  poverty and helping struggling middle class families.   Basically, this budget, just so everybody is clear, is kind of a  blueprint to help pave the way for the Republican tax cut bill that  they are going to produce on this floor in the not-too-distant future.   It was interesting last night in the Rules Committee, we heard people  talk about, well, we have to make tough choices because we don't want  to saddle our children and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren  with debt. Well, if, in fact, my Republican friends get their wish and  pass this tax cut, we are told that it will add about $2.4 trillion to  our debt.   The deal is this, Mr. Speaker. One of the faults in their budget is  they have these assumptions that we all know are not true. Like, for  example, the Affordable Care Act is going to kind of mysteriously just  disappear, and they are going to be able to cut Medicaid by close to $1  trillion to help offset the cost of their tax cut. But the last time I  checked, their repeal barely passed this House, and it can't seem to  get anywhere in the United States Senate. Their assumptions are  fantasy. They are not based on reality.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just food assistance that this budget  dismantles. It cuts half a trillion dollars in Medicare and ends the  Medicare guarantee. It rips apart the Affordable Care Act, drastically  raising healthcare costs for older and low-income adults, and kicks  another 20 million people off their health insurance if they get their  wish here. It makes higher education more expensive. It cuts veterans'  benefits. It reduces our commitment to ensuring that our neighbors have  access to affordable housing. It even sticks the American taxpayer with  a $1.6 billion bill to begin constructing a costly and stupid and  ineffective wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.   In case people are scratching their heads, during the campaign,  Donald Trump said that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. I guess he  didn't mean it because a downpayment was put into their budget.   I could go on and on and on, but you might ask yourself, Mr. Speaker:  Who wins? The answer is simple. If this budget goes through, and they  pave the way for their tax cut, it is clear who the winners are: Donald  Trump, the Trump family, and all of his wealthy friends. While all  these cuts in the budget come from our safety net programs,  infrastructure investments, and programs that help middle and working  class families, none of the savings in this budget--that is right, not  one penny--come from closing tax loopholes that benefit big  corporations or the wealthy.   As I said before, the drastic cuts are all being used to try to  finance this massive tax cut that disproportionately benefits the  wealthiest in this country. Give me a break.   Mr. Speaker, it is galling how indifferent that so many in this House  seem to be to those who are struggling in poverty. America's most  vulnerable, granted they don't have super PACs, they don't have big  lobbyists, their voice in Washington is supposed to be us. The whole  purpose of government, in my view, is to make sure that everybody gets  a fair shake, and the people who need government the most are the  people who are struggling in poverty.    But to listen to my colleagues and to look at this budget that they  put together, it is clear that the poorest Americans in this country  are being treated as if they don't exist, as if they are invisible, as  if they don't matter. I just find that deeply offensive.   President Kennedy said it this way. He said: ``If a free society  cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are  rich.'' It is frustrating. It is just frustrating that here we are with  this budget which devastates so much of what I think is important.   If we implemented what this budget asks us to do, this country would  become a tale of two cities, and it is already getting to that point.  It would truly become a tale of two cities. It would create a  government without a conscience, and I think we need to push back and  we need to reject that.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't some Ayn Rand fantasy where we can just mess  with the numbers and see what happens. We are talking about real people  here--people who are counting on us; people who need help. This budget  fails by any measure, in my opinion, to be a budget even for  Republicans to support.   I think America's hardworking middle class families and all those  working to struggle to get in the middle class deserve a heck of a lot  better than this.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and  certainly vote against this cruel Republican budget, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the United States  Conference of Catholic Bishops in opposition to the Republican budget.                                         United States Conference of                                                Catholic Bishops,                                    Washington, DC, August 31, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: As Congress proceeds with the 2018       budget process, the United States Conference of Catholic       Bishops (USCCB) reaffirms that the federal budget is a moral       document with profound implications for the common good of       our nation and world. The budget requires difficult decisions       that ought to be guided by moral criteria that protect human       life and dignity, give central importance to ``the least of       these'' (Matthew 25), and promote the welfare of workers and       families who struggle to live in dignity.        The Catholic Church teaches that it is the role of the       state to promote the three pillars  [[Page H7768]]       of the common good. In May 2017, we outlined these three       pillars: respect for the fundamental and inalienable rights       of the human person, promotion of human development, and       defense of peace. Our Conference has long supported the goal       of reducing future unsustainable deficits that would harm all       citizens, especially those who are poor. However, a just       framework for sound fiscal policy cannot rely almost       exclusively on disproportionate cuts in essential services to       poor and vulnerable persons.        Sharp increases in defense and immigration enforcement       spending, coupled with simultaneous and severe reductions to       non-defense discretionary spending, particularly to many       domestic and international programs that assist the most       vulnerable, are profoundly troubling. The House Budget       Committee's H. Con. Res. 71 proposes increasing defense       spending by $929 billion over the next decade, which is $72       billion above sequester levels. This is coupled with a       proposal to cut $4.4 trillion over the same period from       domestic and international programs that assist the most       vulnerable, potentially impacting health care safety net       programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP, as well as food       security programs like SNAP. The proposal would also reduce       current funding levels for environmental stewardship by $824       million.        Such deep cuts would harm people facing dire circumstances,       and would place the environment and natural resources at       risk. When the impact of other potential legislative       proposals, including the proposed reduction of spending on       health care by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next       decade and implementation of tax policies that would offer       trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy over the same       period are considered, the prospects for vulnerable people       become even bleaker.        Our nation should elevate diplomacy, along with       humanitarian and international development assistance, as       primary tools for promoting lasting peace, regional stability       and human rights. The USCCB urges Congress to reject H. Con.       Res. 71's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget authority level of       $41.521 billion for the International Affairs functions of       government. This would represent a $10 billion cut from this       year's appropriations for those functions. Although the USCCB       does not support every individual International Affairs       account, it has repeatedly called for robust diplomatic       efforts to end longstanding conflicts in a range of       countries, including Syria and Iraq, as well as for robust       funding for refugee and humanitarian assistance. It is hard       to reconcile the need for diplomacy, political solutions, and       life-saving humanitarian and development assistance with cuts       to the State Department budget of the magnitude proposed by       H. Con. Res. 71.        At the same time, H. Con. Res. 71 anticipates dramatic       increases in immigration enforcement spending. We fear that       such increases could pave the way for enactment of many of       the destructive proposals contained in recently released       budget plans, including increases in immigrant detention       beds, the construction of a wall along the entire border       between the United States and Mexico, and the expansion of       agreements with state and local governments that threaten       local law enforcement's ability to foster trusting       relationships with immigrants in their jurisdictions. Any       changes to the tax code called for through reconciliation       should include a provision to empower the educational choices       of families. The reconciliation process should not be used to       achieve savings through cutting health care, nutrition,       income security, or other anti-poverty programs. This budget       attempts to use the reconciliation process to fast-track over       $200 billion in cuts to anti-poverty programs over the next       ten years, including Medicaid and Medicare. The bishops have       devoted their efforts to addressing the morally problematic       features of health care reform while insuring that all people       have access to health care coverage.        The human consequences of budget choices are clear to us as       pastors. Our Catholic community defends the unborn and the       undocumented, feeds the hungry, shelters the homeless,       educates the young, and cares for the sick, both at home and       abroad. We help mothers facing challenging situations of       pregnancy, poor families rising above crushing poverty,       refugees fleeing conflict and persecution, and communities       devastated by wars, natural disasters and famines. In much of       this work, we are partners with government. Our combined       resources allow us to reach further and help more. Our       institutions are present in every state and throughout the       world, serving some of the most marginalized communities and       enjoying the trust of local populations.        The moral measure of the federal budget is how well it       promotes the common good of all, especially the most       vulnerable whose voices are too often missing in these       debates. The Catholic Bishops of the United States stand       ready to work with leaders of both parties for a federal       budget that reduces future deficits, protects poor and       vulnerable people, and advances peace and the common good.            Sincerely yours,      His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan,        Archbishop of New York, Chairman, Committee on Pro-Life       Activities.      Most Rev. Oscar Cantu,        Bishop of Las Cruces, Chairman, Committee on International       Justice and Peace.      Most Rev. Christopher J. Coyne,        Bishop of Burlington, Chairman, Committee on       Communications.      Most Rev. Frank J.

Murry, SJ,        Bishop of Youngstown, Chairman, Committee on Catholic       Education.      Most Rev. Joe S. Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, Committee on Migration.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Coalition on Human Needs against the Republican budget.                                       Coalition on Human Needs,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Coalition on Human       Needs, I strongly urge you to vote no on H. Con. Res. 71, the       proposed FY 2018 Budget Resolution, and to vote for the       substitute budgets advanced by the Congressional Progressive       Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic       alternative budget resolution.        The Coalition on Human Needs is an alliance made up of       human service providers, faith organizations, policy experts,       labor, civil rights, and other advocates for meeting the       needs of low-income and vulnerable people. Our members       understand that the economic security of millions of American       families depends on building on the progress we've made in       health coverage, jobs, basic living standards, and ensuring       that our children are well-prepared for productive lives. But       the majority's proposed budget does not build--it breaks       apart our engines of progress. It will make our nation weaker       for decades to come.        The most recent survey data on poverty in the U.S. shows       the biggest two-year decline since the late 1960's.       Refundable tax credits for working families, SNAP/food stamps       and housing subsidies have lifted multi-millions of people       out of poverty. The decline in the proportion of our       population without health insurance continued its decline in       2016, down to 8.8 percent. More people are working, and in       general, low- and moderate-income households have finally       started to make income gains.        The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be       a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars       from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security       and opportunity. Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax       credits, nutrition assistance, education and housing       assistance: these are just some of the services the budget       would massively cut. The budget takes trillions in funding       that supports economic security and progress and hands it to       the wealthy and corporations in the form of enormous tax       cuts.        The primary goal of H. Con. Res. 71 is to allow huge tax       cuts to be enacted with only a simple majority in the Senate.       These tax cuts are claimed to be a critical element in       increasing economic growth enough to make the tax cuts       deficit neutral. Reputable economists are skeptical that the       proposed tax cuts would boost the economy to the 2.6 percent       average growth projected in the budget and acknowledge that       tax cuts to corporations and the rich deepen the deficit.       History supports this: the economy grew and unemployment       declined more during the Clinton tax increase years than       during the Bush era tax cuts. And the Kansas experience with       tax cuts is cautionary: revenues plummeted, with the tax take       in 2016 $570 million lower than in 2013, even after counting       increases enacted in sales and cigarette taxes. The economic       growth that did occur from cutting taxes was estimated to       bring in about $30 million, leaving the state very deeply in       the hole. The state legislature has recently reversed course,       unwilling to slash education budgets as much as the revenue       hole would have forced. They saw that they were weakening       their state. Congress should not inflict the same dangerous       lesson on the entire nation.        We urge you to reject H. Con. Res. 71 because of its       central choice: paying for tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor       the rich and corporations with cuts to essential services.       Our nation faces major challenges: reducing disproportionate       poverty among children and helping children and young adults       to advance in education so they can meet the challenges in       our economic future, protecting seniors in their retirement,       and rebuilding communities. Both the emergency needs of       communities devastated by natural disasters and the similarly       urgent threats from opioids and other epidemics, decaying       infrastructure and inadequate public health and consumer       protections demand a vigorous federal response. Instead of       making these investments, the House budget would cripple the       federal capacity to respond by slashing domestic       appropriations by 44 percent compared with FY 2010 levels       over the next decade and making similarly extreme cuts in  [[Page H7769]]       health care, nutrition, income assistance for seniors, people       with disabilities, and working families. In addition to       trillions of dollars in cuts and structural constraints to       basic mandatory programs, the budget would fast-track $203       billion in cuts to domestic programs over the next ten years       through reconciliation rules. Cuts like these would       recklessly weaken us; they are self-inflicted wounds.        The proposed tax cuts will worsen inequality and reward       businesses that park their income offshore. Instead, Congress       should insist that corporations and the rich pay their fair       share. Please vote against weakening America, and instead       protect and expand investments as called for in the budgets       proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus,       Congressional Black Caucus, and the House Budget Committee       Democrats' substitute. These three constructive alternatives       deserve your yes vote.            Sincerely yours,                                                 Deborah Weinstein,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to all  Members of Congress from the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda  against this Republican budget.                                                   National Hispanic                                               Leadership Agenda,                                                      July 26, 2017.      Re NHLA opposition to House Budget Resolution.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Hispanic       Leadership Agenda (NHLA), the coalition of the nation's 45       preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, we are writing to       express our deep concerns with the budget resolution that       recently passed out of the House Budget Committee and urge       you to vote against passage of the resolution if it comes to       the House floor. The resolution threatens the basic living       standards of tens of millions of Americans in order to       subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy. From education and       scientific research to basic assistance and health programs,       the House budget would cut $4.4 trillion from entitlement       programs and $1.3 trillion from non-defense discretionary       programs over the next decade, crippling the most important       drivers of our nation's economic engine--working families.       For these reasons, and those detailed further below, NHLA       will consider any votes on the budget resolution for       inclusion in future NHLA scorecards evaluating the support of       Members of Congress for the Latino community.        Budget resolutions serve as fiscal blueprints that signal       the priorities of government spending to support all       Americans in their attainment of the American Dream. However,       rather than seek to bolster opportunities for American       working families, the House budget places the burden of       reducing our deficit squarely on the backs of families       struggling to make ends meet in order to give tax breaks to       wealthy corporations and individuals. Rather than investing       in America's future homebuyers, workers, and students, both       the House budget and President Trump's budget undermine the       progress our country has made and prioritize corporate       interests over those of hardworking American families.        The trillions of dollars of cuts in the House budget would       have a catastrophic impact on the millions of Latinos who       struggle to put food on their tables and a roof over their       heads. Recent research by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) provides       evidence of the strong impact of federal assistance programs       on lifting millions of Latinos, especially children, out of       poverty. In 2015, for example:        Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted about 2 7 million       Latinos out of poverty, including 1.4 million children.        Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted an estimated 981,000 Latinos       out of poverty, including 560,000 children.        Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) lifted an       estimated 1.3 million Latinos out of poverty, including       640,000 children.        Rental assistance lifted about 720,000 Latinos out of       poverty, including 270,000 children.        Supplemental Security Income (SSI) lifted an estimated       630,000 Latinos out of poverty, including 140,000 children.        The House budget resolution would threaten the       effectiveness of many of these programs. The budget plan also       calls for cuts to Medicaid and other health programs more       severe than the House-passed bill to repeal the Affordable       Care Act.        Further, the House budget resolution dismantles consumer       and worker protections, jeopardizing the ability of Latino       and all working families to build and maintain wealth. The       budget plan not only guts the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau--the only agency whose sole mission is to protect       Americans from predatory practices in the financial       marketplace--but also undermines our nation's workforce,       cutting funding for the Wage and House Division in the       Department of Labor more deeply than proposed in the Trump       budget. Additionally, Latino workers cannot afford cuts to       the Environmental Protection Agency, which protects our human       health and environment from toxic chemicals. Working families       need more and better enforcement of consumer financial and       labor protection laws to protect Americans from abuse, and       also ensure law-abiding financial service providers, as well       as employers, are not harmed by unfair competition by       unscrupulous actors.        Simply put, the House budget resolution would harm American       families and workers, especially Latinos, making our nation       more inequitable and less prepared for economic challenges.       We strongly urge Members of Congress to oppose the House       budget plan and instead support a budget that defends the       interests of the American public and prudently spends       taxpayer dollars.            Sincerely,      Hector Sanchez Barba,        Chair, NHLA, Executive Director, Labor Council for Latin       American Advancement (LCLAA).

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  AARP, the Main Street Alliance, and the League of Conservation Voters,  all in strong opposition to the Republican budget.                                                           AARP,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of over 38 million       members and other Americans who are age 50 and older, AARP is       writing to communicate our views as you consider H. Con. Res.       71, the House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal       Year 2018. As the process moves forward, AARP urges you to       support Social Security, Medicare, and other key programs       that millions of Americans depend upon for their health and       financial security and oppose proposals that would hurt older       Americans.                         Medicare and Social Security         Our members count on Social Security and Medicare and       believe they should be protected and strengthened for today's       seniors and future generations. Proposals creating a defined       contribution premium-support program; restricting access by       raising the age of eligibility; or allowing hospitals and       providers to arbitrarily charge consumers higher prices than       Medicare can make health care unaffordable for older       Americans. These proposals do little to actually lower the       cost of health care, but simply shift costs from Medicare       onto individuals--many of whom cannot afford to pay more for       their care. We urge you not to include attempts to cut       Medicare benefits or increase beneficiary costs in the       upcoming budget proposal.        The typical senior, with an annual income of around $25,000       and already spending one out of every six dollars on health       care, counts on Social Security for the majority of their       income, and on Medicare for access to affordable health       coverage. We will continue to oppose changes to current law       that cut benefits, increase costs, or reduce the ability of       these critical programs to deliver on their benefit promises.       We urge you to continue to do so as well.              Medicaid, Long-Term Services and Supports and SNAP         Medicaid serves as a critical safety net for millions of       people in every state, including over 17 million poor elderly       and children and adults with disabilities, who rely on vital       Medicaid health and long-term care services. Efforts to       reduce or cap Medicaid funding could endanger the health,       safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the       essential services provided through this program.       Furthermore, caps could result in significant cost-shifts to       state governments unable to shoulder the costs of care       without sufficient federal support. Instead of arbitrary       caps, proposals should focus on efforts to improve Medicaid,       such as encouraging more individuals to receive services in       their homes and communities rather than costly institutional       care.        SNAP plays a vital role in feeding millions of hungry       Americans, including over four million older Americans.       Proposals to block grant the program, or impose work       requirements will make SNAP less responsive and accessible in       times of need; and without clear work requirement exemptions       for the elderly and disabled, would bar these individuals       from receiving SNAP benefits.        We ask you to reject the cuts proposed in H. Con. Res. 71.       We stand ready to work with you to develop proposals that       protect and improve Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and       SNAP.            Sincerely,      Jo Ann C. Jenkins,        Chief Executive Officer.      Joyce A. Rogers,        SVP Government Affairs, AARP.                                   ____                                             Main Street Alliance,                                    Washington, DC, October 2, 2017.      Re H. Con. Res. 71, Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Resolution.       Members of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives: Main Street Alliance, a network of       small business owners  [[Page H7770]]       throughout the country, strongly urges you to oppose H. Con.       Res. 71, the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Resolution. This budget,       if enacted into law, would cut $3.4 trillion from Medicaid,       Medicare, Social Security, education, employment and       training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure       spending over the next 10 years. This will significantly harm       small business owners and their employees, damage local       economies, and decimate state budgets.        Millions of small business owners, their employees, and       their families rely on Medicaid and Medicare for access to       healthcare critical to their survival. The House Budget       Resolution would strip them of their health coverage. The       proposed budget would slash $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and       other health programs, and gut Medicare by $500 billion,       transforming both from systems in which beneficiaries are       guaranteed certain levels of coverage, to a capped amount per       enrollee. Work requirements would also be imposed on       Medicaid. This puts 69 million Medicaid recipients and 57       million Medicare beneficiaries at risk for a loss in       services, including millions of small business owners and       their employees.        Healthcare, education, food, and housing costs would       skyrocket under the House Budget, devastating local economies       and small businesses that depend on consumer demand from       customers in their communities. In addition to the deep cuts       to healthcare, the budget would cut $150 billion from the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which enables       nearly 22 million families to put food on the table, and       eliminate $90 billion from education, training, employment,       and social services programs, significantly scaling back Pell       Grants, which help nearly 8 million students afford college.       These draconian spending cuts would force vulnerable and       working families to pay more for vital programs, resulting in       a reduction in their disposal income and the amount of money       they can spend on goods and services. Small business owners       would see a decline in customers.        The House budget cuts would siphon trillions of dollars out       of state economies from 2018 to 2027. Because the block grant       funding scheme provides a fixed amount of Medicaid and       Medicare funding for states each year, the proposal would       also leave states on the hook for any and all unexpected       healthcare costs from recessions, natural disasters, public       health emergencies, or prescription drug price spikes, and       unaccounted costs like the aging of the population. The deep       reductions in federal healthcare, education, employment and       training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure       spending would force states to make up the difference,       drastically cutting the quality of services offered. As state       budgets contract, employment would decrease and small       businesses would decline.        The impact of the House Budget Resolution on small       businesses will be felt in the loss of vital services,       reduced business, and contracted state budgets. We urge you       to protect Main Street small businesses owners, working       families, communities, and economies, and oppose the House       Budget Resolution. Reject any budget that enables tax cuts       for the very wealthy and large profitable corporations to       lose revenue, since it will force deep cuts in vital programs       that harm small business.            Signed,                                                 Amanda Ballantyne,      National Director, Main Street Alliance.                                   ____                                    League of Conservation Voters,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.      Re Oppose FY18 House Budget Resolution.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters       (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        LCV urges you to vote NO on H. Con. Res. 71. This budget       resolution includes a huge giveaway to oil and gas companies       by paving the way for drilling in the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge, one of America's most iconic landscapes. It       threatens environmental and public health safeguards,       provides tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and       slashes programs and protections that benefit communities       across the country, among other harmful provisions.        The House budget resolution puts some of our most iconic       landscapes at risk. It contains reconciliation instructions       that aim to open up the pristine Arctic National Wildlife       Refuge and possibly other public lands and waters to       drilling. The Arctic Refuge is one of the largest remaining       intact ecosystems in the world. It has sustained the Gwich'in       people for centuries and is home to an incredible array of       wildlife, including caribou, wolves, polar bears, and nearly       200 species of migratory birds. We have a moral obligation to       protect this natural treasure and to transition to a clean       energy future.        Following in the footsteps of the Trump administration's       unconscionable budget proposal, the House Republican       leadership's budget resolution would make dangerous cuts to       programs that benefit the most vulnerable in our society       while benefitting polluters. Included in the resolution are       provisions that will lead to trillions of dollars of cuts to       health care and programs that provide basic living standards       for struggling families, as well as other substantial cuts.       Meanwhile, it would account for $1.6 billion of federal funds       to pay for a xenophobic and environmentally harmful border       wall. Rather than investing in safeguards for clean air and       water, protections for our national parks and other public       lands that drive our outdoor recreation economy, and growing       clean energy industries, this budget sells out those       priorities to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and       billionaires and for gifts to corporate special interests.        We urge you to REJECT H. Con. Res. 71 and will strongly       consider including the vote on this bill in the 2017       Scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I just want to make sure that it is clear  that, certainly on the Democratic side, we are very much dedicated to  trying to lift people out of poverty. That is one of the reasons why we  oppose this Republican budget that cuts $211 million from financial aid  programs to help people be able to get additional higher education.  That is one of the reasons why we have complained loudly about the  inadequate funding for job training. You want people to train for  employment, you need to make sure that those slots are available so  that people can get the training and the assistance they need.   The gentleman says: Don't worry about the debt because the  reconciliation instructions will instruct the Ways and Means Committee  to do a deficit neutral tax plan.   Well, I mean, there is lots of stuff in here that are assumptions  that aren't true, like, you repealed the Affordable Care Act. That  didn't happen and it is not going to happen.   And what we are told from the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for  a Responsible Federal Budget, according to their analysis, is that what  the Republicans are proposing in terms of their tax plan will basically  cost well over $2 trillion, and that will be added to our debt.   So I don't--we can debate fantasyland if we want, but the reality is  the reality, and this budget is a bad deal for everybody.   Mr. Speaker, this week, our Nation witnessed the deadliest mass  shooting in history. We have endured horrific mass killings in Newtown,  San Bernardino, Orlando, and now Las Vegas, among many others, all  without any congressional action. The killings happen every single day  on our streets, at public events, and even in our homes.   Mr. Speaker, my heart broke when the children of Sandy Hook were  killed, and I remain absolutely stunned that this Congress has done  nothing about it, nothing.   Now 59 people lost their lives in Las Vegas during what was supposed  to be a celebratory event, a concert, and this is only 16 months after  the last deadly mass shooting in Orlando. Gun violence in this country  is out of control, and all we have done is cater to the gun lobby.   The United States Congress is a legislative body, Mr. Speaker. We are  not a think tank or a church or a synagogue. Thoughts and prayers are  not what this country expects from us, and it is not what it needs from  us. The people of this country need us to act, to pass laws that  protect their lives and their children's lives.   As my colleague in the Senate, Senator Chris Murphy, has said: ``This  must stop. It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress  are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend that there aren't  any public policy responses to this epidemic. There are. And the  thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are  paired with legislative indifference.''   For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Mr. Thompson's bill, H. Res. 367,  which I am a cosponsor of, which would establish the Select Committee  on Gun Violence Prevention.   Mr. Speaker, let me explain what I mean when I say ``defeat the  previous question.'' We are here debating which bills will come to the  House floor this week, the agenda for the House of Representatives. The  majority chose to consider their misguided budget. Fine. We can do  that.  [[Page H7771]]    But what I am saying is that we should also take the first step in at  least setting up a committee to look at gun violence in America. So if  we say no to ending debate on this rule, by defeating the previous  question, we can then debate whether or not to create this committee.  This is the least we can do.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I include in the Record letters from the UAW, the SEIU, The  National Treasury Employees Union, AFSCME, the American Federation of  Government Employees, and NARFE.           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &             Agricultural Implement Workers of America-UAW,                                   Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.        Dear Representative:  On behalf of the International Union,       United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement       Workers of America (UAW), I am writing to strongly urge you       to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the House Fiscal Year (FY) 2018       budget resolution. The federal budget is a moral document as       well as a fiscal blueprint, and H. Con. Res. 71 fails       spectacularly on both fronts. This draconian budget would be       a disaster for our economy, the middle class and our most       vulnerable citizens.        The proposed budget forces working people and retirees to       pay for enormous tax cuts to the wealthy. Despite claims to       the contrary, by 2027, roughly 30 percent of households       earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would see an increase in       their taxes. H. Con. Res. 71 cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicare       and Medicaid and ends the programs as we know them. Medicaid       and Medicare are literal lifelines for many of our most       vulnerable citizens--especially children and the elderly.       Medicaid is the largest provider of nursing home and long-      term care.        This radical piece of legislation creates fast-track       procedures to implement the tax cuts that will overwhelmingly       benefit the wealthy and multinational corporations. The       average tax cut for millionaires would be $230,000 a year by       2027. It eliminates the estate tax, which currently only       applies to the top two tenths of one percent of estates,       giving the ultrawealthy $239 billion in tax cuts. By 2027,       80% of tax cuts will go to the top one percent.        It also uses these procedures to make at least $203 billion       in cuts to mandatory programs that are important for working       families and our most vulnerable citizens. In  [[Page H7772]]       total, this budget assumes $5.4 trillion in spending cuts.       Cuts of this magnitude would almost certainly lead to       slashing funding for Legal Services Corporation, federal       employee pensions, nutritional assistance infrastructure, and       unemployment compensation, to name a few. It also repeals the       Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and the Affordable Care Act.        This budget resolution takes America in the wrong       direction. We have tried ``trickle down'' economics several       times in the past; it did not work then and it will not work       now. These tax cuts will not pay for themselves. Instead,       they will come at the expense of hardworking every day       Americans--many of whom have trouble affording basic       necessities today.        We strongly urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 71 and instead       work on a federal budget that invests in our country and       works for ALL Americans.            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                           SEIU Stronger Together,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), I write       to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the FY18 House budget resolution.       This budget would further rig the system against working       Americans by slashing resources that help families afford       basic needs like healthcare, food, and education--all to pave       the way for tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. SEIU       believes The People's Budget is a better way forward for       working families. While the House Republican budget would       continue to leave working families behind, The People's       Budget makes American workers its first priority through       critical investments in health care, education, and       infrastructure.        The first goal of any elected representative should be to       improve the lives of their constituents. H. Con. Res. 71       fails to meet this standard. To pay for tax giveaways for the       wealthy and corporations, the budget resolution includes       reconciliation instructions that would significantly       undermine basic living standards for families. For example,       under the reconciliation instructions, committees are       directed to make cuts of $203 billion dollars over ten years       to programs that could include Medicaid, Medicare,       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and programs       for people with disabilities, which provide critical support       for millions of Americans.        By threatening Medicaid, this budget ignores the tens of       thousands of people who mobilized month after month to       soundly reject efforts to dismantle healthcare and cut       Medicaid. Efforts to reduce or cap Medicaid funding put at       risk healthcare for 74 million Americans--including children,       people with disabilities, and seniors. Hospitals could be       forced to close or cut services, further reducing access to       care, especially in underserved areas. States--which must       balance budgets and already face fiscal pressures--would not       be able to make up the lost federal Medicaid dollars and       would likely be forced to deny coverage. Furthermore, the       cuts would lead to significant job loss in the healthcare       industry, one of the fastest growing sectors in our economy.        In contrast, The People's Budget would focus on reforms to       increase access, affordability. and quality of health care by       building on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act       (``ACA''). In its entirety, it would move the nation's health       care system closer to achieving universal coverage, while       ensuring that working families would have affordable care. At       the same time, it would invest in developing innovative care       delivery models that control costs and increase quality. The       People's Budget would put America's health care system on the       right path forward.        The House Republican budget, however, would compound the       proposed Medicaid cuts with potential cuts to Medicare,       Social Security Disability Insurance, and nutrition       assistance. The budget doubles down on its harm to seniors       and people with disabilities and further shift costs to       states. The cumulative impact of the deep cuts proposed in       this budget would force states to make drastic spending and       job cuts, raise taxes, or both. This budget pressure would       likely also trickle down to local governments in the form of       decreased funding to cities and counties, creating a fiscal       crisis in communities across the nation.        While H. Con. Res. 71 would force Americans to make a false       choice between programs that are essential to their       communities and tax giveaways for the wealthy, The People's       Budget invests in American communities through a robust       infrastructure program and makes debt free college a reality       for all students--without sacrificing health care for       millions of Americans. The House Republican budget makes no       such commitment to education, and its steep cuts create the       potential for state budget crises that put education programs       and working families' futures in jeopardy. Trickle-down       economics have left America's middle class behind for       decades. It is time we turn the page towards an economy that       is designed for working families and aimed at improving their       lives.        The proposed FY18 House Budget Resolution is a disaster for       America's working families. By decimating programs that       provide healthcare, food, housing, and education to set the       stage for massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations,       this budget is an attack on our communities' quality of life.       We respectfully urge you to reject the proposed budget       resolution, and instead support The People's Budget which       would prioritize working families in building an economy that       works for everyone. We will add votes on H. Con. Res. 71 to       our legislative scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.        Dear Representative: As National President of the National       Treasury Employees Union, I represent over 150,000 dedicated       federal employees at 31 agencies. I am writing to ask you to       VOTE NO on the House Budget Resolution, H. Con Res 71.        The House Budget Resolution instructs the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform to produce at least $32       billion in cuts to programs under its jurisdiction, which are       federal employee benefit programs. While the Budget Committee       recommended sizable cuts to federal employee retirement, it       is important to highlight that this program has been utilized       in recent years to help pay for both infrastructure and       unemployment insurance. This was twice accomplished by       increasing the amount federal employees contribute toward       their retirement benefits, and occurred against a backdrop of       a multi-year pay freeze, further squeezing employee       paychecks. In recent years, federal employees have endured       compensation losses of close to $200 billion for deficit       reduction, from the above retirement changes and from reduced       pay increases in 2014, 2015, 2016, and in 2017. At a time       when private sector raises are averaging 3%, federal wage       increases continue to trail behind.        Federal employees play a vital role for taxpayers--ensuring       air, water and food safety, border and national security,       consumer protections, and preserving our national parks, to       name just a few of their functions and missions. Like all       Americans, federal employees face ever-increasing food,       utility, health care, and college bills, and have rent and       mortgage obligations. Families will fall further behind if       their take-home pay is slashed or if cost-of-living       adjustments, similar to those made to Social Security,       military retirement and to veterans' benefits to keep these       payments whole, are removed in retirement. These further cuts       will also degrade morale, make it difficult for agencies to       recruit and retain quality employees, and will erode income       security for retirees.        Additionally, I ask you to strongly oppose Representatives       McClintock and Walker's Amendment in the Nature of a       Substitute that places a severe financial burden on federal       employees by eviscerating federal employee compensation, and       further unfairly attacks worker protections and labor       organizations.        On behalf of our nation's federal employees--who live and       work in every state and congressional district across the       country--serving as scientists, accountants, statisticians,       park rangers, and law enforcement officers, I ask you to       reject the cuts contemplated in the Budget Resolution, and       VOTE NO.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,      National President.                                   ____           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                   Washington, DC, October 2, 2017.      Member of the House of Representatives,       Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the       fiscal year (FY) 2018 budget resolution approved by the House       Budget Committee and scheduled to be considered by the full       House. This budget plan would impose considerable hardship on       many Americans in order to slash taxes for the wealthy and       corporations and to boost defense spending.        The budget decisions made by Congress each year are vital       to ensuring that the economy is strong and that our       communities are safe and prosperous. Yet, this budget       completely undercuts responsibility for shared prosperity by       applying the same misguided priorities proposed by President       Trump. It sets woefully inadequate spending levels for       critical public services and cuts over a trillion dollars       from non-defense discretionary spending (NDD), in order to       significantly boost defense spending and provide massive tax       giveaways to wealthy individuals and large corporations.        The budget slashes $5.7 trillion over 10 years including       $1.3 trillion from NDD programs that have already been       compromised by austere budget caps. FY 2018 statutory caps       lower funding for NDD programs by 17 percent adjusted for       inflation below FY 2010, and the House budget cuts this by an       additional $5 billion. The additional cuts proposed in the       House budget would weaken public services that all Americans       rely on, create massive budget problems for states, and lead       to enormous job losses. It would force dramatic cuts in,       education, job training, federal employee pensions, and       nutritional assistance. Over 10 years, the budget cuts $4.4       trillion from entitlement programs, such as, Medicare and       Medicaid, including at least $203 billion in entitlement cuts       to be  [[Page H7773]]       made through the ``fast track'' reconciliation process. As a       result, safety-net programs that millions rely upon are once       again a target, further shifting enormous and unsustainable       costs to the elderly, disabled, students and states.        Rather than increasing revenues for investment that creates       jobs and spurs economic growth, the proposed budget creates a       fast-track process for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit       corporations and the wealthy. In fact, according to the       nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the Trump/GOP tax cut would       largely benefit the richest 1 percent. The budget also relies       on the gimmicks of dynamic scoring and sham accounting,       hiding the true cost of unnecessary and harmful tax cuts.        The budget approved by the House Budget Committee would       hurt families, kill job growth and send the economy into a       downward tailspin. I strongly urge you to oppose. H. Con.       Res. 71, the proposed 2018 concurrent budget resolution.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, September 29, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, which represents over       700,000 federal employees across the country, I strongly urge       you to oppose any FY 2018 budget resolution proposal that       includes reconciliation instructions to the Oversight and       Government Reform Committee (OGR) requiring cuts within its       jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by $32 billion for the FY       2018-2027 period, when the House considers various FY 2018       budget proposals during the week of October 2, 2017. These       cuts would target federal employee retirement benefits, as       that is the only substantial mandatory spending within OGR's       jurisdiction.        Such an approach would be consistent with the Senate Budget       Committee's FY 2018 budget resolution proposal that excludes       reconciliation instructions that would result in cutting       federal employee retirement benefits. Indeed, the Senate       version only includes reconciliation instructions to two       committees: the $1.5 trillion allowance for net tax cuts       under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction and a $1 billion,       10-year deficit cut instruction to the Energy and Natural       Resources Committee which could open up a portion of Alaska's       Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.        AFGE opposes the House Budget Committee's FY 2018 budget       resolution's reconciliation instructions to the Oversight and       Government Reform Committee to cut federal employee       retirement benefits by $32 billion for the FY 2018-2027       period. We believe this budget reconciliation instruction       would help rip away any sense of financial security that       federal employees currently have.        As you know, the House Budget Committee budget report       included recommendations that would:        Require federal employees, including Members of Congress       and their staffs, to make greater contributions to their own       defined benefit retirement plans.        Eliminate the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)       supplemental annuity payments to federal employees who retire       before age 62, such as law enforcement officers and federal       firefighters.        Transition new federal employees to a defined contribution       retirement system. (The existing Thrift Savings Plan under       FERS is a defined contribution retirement plan.)        These proposed federal retirement cuts of S32 billion over       ten years would be on top of the $182 billion in cuts to pay       and benefits that federal employees have experienced since       2011. Those pay and benefit cuts included: a three-year pay       freeze (2011, 2012, 2013), three years of reduced pay       increases (2014, 2015, 2016), unpaid furlough days because of       the 2013 sequestration, and two increases in retirement       contributions for new hires (2012 and 2013).        It is important to view the House Budget Committee's FY       2018 budget proposal to cut federal employee retirement       benefits in the proper context. The federal employee       retirement systems (FERS and CSRS) have played no role       whatsoever in the creation of the federal budget deficit. In       addition, increasing federal employees' contributions to       their defined benefit retirement plans would decrease       consumer demand and thereby adversely impact the American       economy.        Thank you for your consideration of our request.            Sincerely,                                                    Thomas S. Kahn,      Director, Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                         National Active and Retired                                   Federal Employees Association,                                    Alexandria, VA, October 3, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Active and       Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), I write to ask       you to oppose the inclusion of reconciliation instructions in       any budget resolution that target federal retirement and/or       health benefits considered by the full House of       Representatives.        The House Budget Committee passed, and the House is       expected to consider, a budget resolution containing       reconciliation instructions calling for at least $32 billion       in cuts to mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of the       House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR).       Such instructions directly target the hard-earned retirement       and health benefits of federal and postal workers and       retirees, as these benefits constitute the only substantial       mandatory spending under OGR's jurisdiction.        Proposals to meet the $32 billion in savings range from bad       to worse--from imposing a ``retirement tax'' on current       federal and postal employees by raising payroll contributions       towards retirement without any benefit increase to various       proposals that would dramatically reduce the value of federal       pensions for those nearing--or even in--retirement. These are       neither fair nor prudent policies, yet any budget resolution       containing reconciliation instructions for OGR endorses them       prior to any significant evaluation.        The upcoming budget resolution is being used to set the       stage for advancing tax reform that proponents argue provides       a break to hard-working, middle-class Americans.       Reconciliation instructions that target hard-working, middle       class federal and postal workers are diametrically opposed to       that goal and undermine a key argument as the basis of       comprehensive tax reform.        For these reasons, I ask you to oppose any budget       resolution that contains substantial reconciliation       instructions to the House Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard Thissen,                                                 National President     Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my colleague from  Georgia, thanks for reminding us that the Republicans have been working  on the budget for 10 months; but according to your own Republican  Budget Committee website, the budget was supposed to be presented and  finished by April 15, so you are a little late.   In any event, I also want to remind the gentleman, because I know he  is on the Rules Committee, so I know he knows this, that the rule sets  the agenda for the House. Yes, if one of the things that the  Republicans want to bring up is their terrible budget, that is fine.  You can do that. But the rule can also be an opportunity for us to  bring up the bill that Mr. Thompson has offered, to set up this  commission to deal with gun violence. We can do both.   You can walk and you can chew gum at the same time. This is not a  radical idea. But this is our only way to be able to bring something to  the floor, because the leadership of this House has said no to  everything. They have said no to everything. We can't get hearings. We  can't get votes. We can't get debates. We get nothing.   Don't be startled by us trying to defeat the previous question. It is  a perfectly legitimate way to try to expand the agenda, and I hope that  some of our Republican friends will vote with us to defeat the previous  question. We can still do the budget, but we can also do the Thompson  bill as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms.  Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   I just want to tell my colleague from Georgia, if he hasn't read what  we are trying to propose here, we are suggesting that they bring up the  Thompson bill to the floor under an open rule, and even get a motion to  recommit, but under an open rule. Take us up on this offer because we  have had no open rules in this Congress. Try it; you might like it. It  might be contagious. We might see more open rules where Democrats,  Republicans, liberals, and conservatives can offer their ideas. We  suggest they bring it up under an open rule.   I would urge all of my colleagues to think about that before they  cast their vote on defeating the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I began by saying the frustration I have with this place  is that we either do nothing or we make things worse for people. Going  back to this issue on creating a commission to deal with gun violence,  there are a lot of things I would like to do, but maybe this is a way  to get some bipartisan buy-in to actually try and figure out how to  respond to this epidemic of gun violence.   There have been 26 bills on gun safety introduced in this Congress  sponsored by Democrats and Republicans. I include that list in the  Record.                   Gun Safety Bills in the 115th Congress         1. H. Res. 367 Establishing the Select Committee on Gun       Violence Prevention.        2. H.R. 2841 Title: Disarm Hate Act        3. H.

H.R. 1832 To authorize the appropriation of funds to       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for conducting       or supporting research on firearms safety or gun violence       prevention.        22.

King-Thompson Background Check Bill (closes gun show       and Charleston loopholes, not yet reintroduced)        26. No Fly No Buy (not yet reintroduced)     Mr. Speaker, people have their ideas. Some of them are  maybe not so good ideas; some of them may be very good ideas. But let's  begin to talk about what our response should be. That is at least doing  something. That is better than a moment of silence or offering your  thoughts and prayers to people who were victims in this terrible latest  massacre.   We have got to do something, and nothing is no longer sufficient. We  can't keep on doing that. People are horrified that Congress seems  indifferent. We can't even have a hearing on this issue, never mind a  debate on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring up the Thompson bill, and maybe we can start coming  together and coming up with some ideas that might save some lives. That  is the least we can do.   Mr. Speaker, to my other point that we either do nothing or you guys  do things that make life worse for people, it brings us to the budget.  This budget basically, in my opinion, is a cruel budget that targets,  disproportionately, those who are poor and those who are in the middle  class.   It is astounding to me where some of the savings are sought. The idea  that you would cut SNAP by $164 billion, a program that provides food  to people; a program where 67 percent of the people on the benefit are  children, are senior citizens, or people who are disabled; a program  where those who can work, the majority of them work, but they earn so  little in the workforce that they still qualify for that program. You  want to take that benefit away, a benefit that is $1.40 per person per  meal.   Come on. What are people thinking when they make those kinds of  suggestions?   By the way, we all know what this is. It is basically a pretext to  move forward on your tax cut plan, which benefits Donald Trump, Donald  Trump's family, and Donald Trump's friends.   This idea that somehow this would be deficit neutral is laughable.  The OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, stated: ``If we simply look at this as  being deficit neutral, you're never going to get the type of tax reform  and tax reductions'' that you guys are looking for. That is the former  colleague and the OMB Director.   So we all know what is going on here. But people ought to think long  and hard before they cast their vote for this Republican budget.  Budgets basically indicate what we value, what we think is important.   I have got to tell you, I just don't believe that if people read this  budget, that a majority of my friends, we have disagreements on lots of  issues, but I just don't believe that deep in your heart you actually  believe this stuff. I mean, this is offensive.   We ought to be talking about lifting people up and not putting them  down. We ought to be talking about all of the citizens of this country  with respect and treating them with dignity. We ought not treat people  who are in poverty as if somehow they are invisible, and that is what  this budget does.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote down this Republican  budget. I urge them to defeat the previous question so we can bring up,  under an open rule--under and open rule, which nobody in this Congress  has seen--a bill that would allow us to create a commission, a  bipartisan commission to examine gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
