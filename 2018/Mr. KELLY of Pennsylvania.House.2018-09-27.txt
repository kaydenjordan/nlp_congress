 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1084, I call up the bill (H.R. 6757) to amend the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986 to encourage retirement and family savings, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6757, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume and thank leadership for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family  Savings Act, which will make it easier for American families and  individuals to save for their future, whether it is retirement,  education, or healthcare, helping them to make sure that they are  keeping more of their hard-earned income, more of their own money, and  planning for their future.   This bill will also help local businesses provide retirement plans to  their workers and help workers participate more in all those plans.   Now, according to the Department of Labor and the Federal Reserve,  about 69 million American workers have formal retirement plans, which,  together, have almost $14 trillion in savings for them.   This bill will incentivize hardworking American taxpayers to continue  to put away more of their own money for their future.   One of the things I remember so clearly from growing up is my parents  talking to us all the time and saying: The one thing we never want to  be for you kids is a burden. We never want to be a hardship for you as  we go into our senior years.   I thought to myself at that time: How could anybody look across the  table at people who had worked so hard, had come through the Great  Depression, had come through World War II, had come through the Korean  war, had gone through all kinds of difficulties and had always provided  for us and think that? How in the world could they ever think that they  would be a burden to me or to my brothers and sisters?   It was unimaginable for me, but that is what they thought. That is  what they worried about. They never wanted to be a burden to anybody.   Just think about that for a minute. That generation, often described  as the Greatest Generation, was telling us, the next generation, that  they never wanted to be a burden.   What we are talking about today is relieving the burden on the next  generation by making it easier for people to go into their retirement  feeling that they have enough income to actually enjoy their golden  years.   H.R. 6757 would allow for every American worker, at all income  levels, to save money in universal savings accounts, in which those  earnings would be tax-free and could be taken out at any time without a  penalty. How unique to be able to take your own money out and use it  without being penalized by the Federal Government.   It would also allow Americans to use their 529 plans to pay for costs  associated with home schooling, apprenticeships, just like they now can  for primary and secondary schools thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   And if one sibling has more money in a 529 account than he or she  needs, another sibling can use some of that money to help pay down  their student loans.   This bill would allow younger taxpayers to take out some of their own  money in their retirement account without penalty when they have a new  baby or have an opportunity to adopt a child. This way, younger  Americans will feel secure in starting to save for their retirement,  knowing that the money could still be there for them at one of the most  expensive times in their lives.   H.R. 6757 would also make it easier for small employers to pull  together and offer retirement plans to their team, to the folks they  work with, their associates. This would help bridge that divide between  what benefits large employers might be able to offer to their employees  but smaller employers may only wish to be able to do but really can't.   The bill also allows for older Americans to continue saving in their  IRAs if they choose to continue working in their later years, and it  allows them to keep their own money in their IRAs if those accounts are  relatively modest.   For those workers who want their savings accounts to be in  conservative investments, such as annuities, this bill reduces the cost  of doing that.   Finally, this bill would also help our brave men and women in the  Reserves put away more of their retirement by letting them contribute  the maximum amount to their military retirement accounts while also  contributing to a retirement account from the private sector.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you why we are really here today. We are  really here today because of the overwhelming success of the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act. It has worked. It is incredible, the growth in our  economy.   The number one priority from the beginning of everything we did was  about pro-growth legislation that actually made it easier on  hardworking American families. You know what, despite what you may hear  and the rattle from the other side, it worked, and it is working every  day. We can see it in every measurable event of what is happening in  America.   Thanks to tax reform, middle-income families in western Pennsylvania  and across America are seeing bigger paychecks, more take-home money.  How  [[Page H9127]]  odd that we allow them to keep more of their own money. That is just  who we are as Americans.   Democrats have chosen to distort this success. Republicans are  choosing to secure the success by making the tax cuts for middle-income  families permanent. We keep hearing: Yeah, yeah, but you are not really  taking care of them.   The idea that we use identity politics every day in every way in this  House is absolutely deplorable. Tax reform 2.0 is all about that. The  truth of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is its success.   The saddest part of it all is not one of our Democratic colleagues  voted for it. For that, they will continue to distort the future and  use identity politics.   Mr. Speaker, I think we have other people who want to talk on this,  but for now, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my friends on the other side that a rising tide  lifts all boats. There happens to be 6.9 million jobs now looking for  somebody to fill them.   And when we talk about going into retirement, could we please stop  trying to divide, divide, divide America? Could we please start being  the United States of America instead of the divided States of America?   Every single American benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That  is the fact. I am sorry you didn't sign on for it. We are going to give  you a second chance today to show your true colors, which needs to red,  white, and blue, not just blue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Renacci).  [[Page H9128]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Mr. Speaker, I share my colleague's  concerns over the debt. In fact, I started to really become alarmed  with it under the Obama administration when we went from being $10.6  trillion in debt to nearly $20 trillion in debt. I just wonder, where  were you when this was going on? And why was there not any alarm  sounding then?   But again, it is just politics masquerading as fiscal discipline.  [[Page H9130]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Estes), a good friend of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee, the hero of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to engage in a colloquy with the chairman.   Mr. Speaker, one topic that has been discussed in the context of the  savings and retirement bill is the level of premiums paid to the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the PBGC, by rural electric co- ops and by charitable organizations.   I know the Ways and Means Committee included a study that was  intended to provide information relevant to the proper level of PBGC  premiums. That study was removed by the manager's amendment.   Could the chairman provide some insights about how this issue will be  resolved as we move forward?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, as  always, for his insights and his clarity, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I include in the Record a letter from AARP in strong support of H.R.  6757.                                                           AARP,                                                 September 27, 2018.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: AARP writes to support       H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018 that will promote a       more secure retirement. AARP, with its nearly 38 million       members in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the       U.S. territories, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide       organization that helps empower people to choose how they       live as they age, strengthens communities, and fights for the       issues that matter most to families, such as healthcare,       employment and income security, retirement planning,       affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.        Notably, the Family Savings Act seeks to encourage more       employers, especially small employers, to provide retirement       savings opportunities for American families, a goal AARP       shares. Small employers have lagged in offering retirement       plans to their employees. The U.S. private employer-based       retirement system, which supplements Social Security, has not       significantly expanded coverage for decades. Only half of all       employers, primarily large employers, offer retirement plans       to their workers, and only half of all employees are saving       for retirement. In recent years, new industry practices and       technology have made the savings process simpler. AARP       encourages Congress to adopt tested ideas to make       supplemental savings easy and affordable for both employers       and employees.        The Family Savings Act includes a promising retirement       savings initiative, known as a multiple employer or pooled       provider plan--a single plan operated by a group provider who       will act as a fiduciary, making it easier for small employers       to offer a plan and providing workers with prudently selected       retirement investments. AARP is hopeful that qualified firms       will be willing to create pooled arrangements that enroll and       assist interested employers and employees. Small employers       are not retirement experts and need an impartial advisor to       take responsibility for automatic payroll contributions and       negotiating with and monitoring investment firms.        In addition, the bill contains several other helpful       retirement savings improvements for the military, graduate       students and older investors. We also are pleased that the       bill preserves ready access to paper documentation of       important retirement plan documents.        We appreciate your efforts to encourage improvements in our       retirement system, and look forward to working with Committee       members on further bill refinements and enhancements as the       bill moves forward to conference. If you have any questions       or need additional information, please feel free to contact       me.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to be here  in the people's House on the floor hearing two differing views of  America. I really appreciate about putting the jam on the lower shelf.  We have actually put it on the table with the lid off so that every  single American has benefited.   I know that sometimes we look at things, and people are entitled to  their own opinion, but what they are not entitled to are their own  facts. The fact is that, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, every single  American has benefited.   This is not just about Democrats and Republicans; this is about  Americans. I am hoping that Americans are watching what is going on  here right now, where the game plan is always: If we can divide them,  we can win. If we don't have any facts, let's just come up with  anything and throw it out there and think that maybe the way we use the  Gruber effect in the healthcare plan, we are going to rely on Americans  not to really look beyond what is going on.   Well, I will tell you what. In every segment of our society right  now, we are seeing the lowest unemployment in  [[Page H9133]]  history. It doesn't matter if these are hyphenated Americans--I don't  know why we have to be this way, because I look at people as being red,  white, and blue Americans, not White, not Black, not tan, not yellow. I  am talking about red, white, and blue Americans, the same people who  provide every single penny to run this marvelous government of ours.   And now what we are proposing today is to allow these same  hardworking people the opportunity not to have to rely on a government  program, but to be able to rely on their own hard-earned savings. What  an incredible, unusual idea to come out of this House.   Look, we know that it is absolutely crucial that, as more and more  Americans enter their golden years, they have the security and peace of  mind to enjoy those years and not have to worry about whether they have  saved enough money. We should be doing everything we can to help them  save more of their hard-earned money--it is their own money, by the  way--for themselves and for their families. H.R. 6757 does that by  giving every single American the tools that he or she needs to help  them save for their future and to save for their retirement.   I have heard today the tax sham. I have heard today about growing  deficits. I have heard today about the rich, the elite, the people who  have private boats, and the people who have jets. But what I haven't  heard today is how this incredible piece of legislation, the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, has increased and how our economy has taken off.   Now, you can say anything you want, and I understand why you are  upset. Not one of you could vote for this. So if you couldn't vote for  it and you couldn't be part of the team that won, what you have to be  now is the team that says: Do you know what? We could have done it  better.   My question is: Where the heck were you in the previous  administration? Where were you in all those years when the debt grew  from $10 trillion to $20 trillion?   Now, all of a sudden, the light comes on: Oh, my God, the debt is  increasing. It is these doggone Republicans. Do you know what they are  trying to do? They want hardworking American taxpayers to be able to  keep more of their own money. That is just not the way Washington  works.   I thank God every day that I didn't start off as a local politician,  then move into a county position, then move into a State position, and  then wander into D.C. using that same philosophy that we are going to  put this on the backs of our taxpayers. We never tell these people that  the hand they feel in their back pocket is the government taking their  wallet out. Then we decry this fact that: Oh, my goodness, how could we  ignore the debt?   Thanks for waking up. Where were you when it was $10 trillion? Why  did you let it get to $20 trillion before the bells went off?   Look, there is so much in this bill that just makes sense. This bill  was not crafted for Democrats. It wasn't crafted for Republicans. It  was crafted for Americans, hardworking Americans, who put all their  life into a job, who look forward to retirement. We are giving them  that opportunity not to rely on some government program that may or may  not be there when they reach retirement.   We are telling them: Do you know what? You get to keep more of your  own money now. You get to put it away in a lot of pretax opportunities.  You get to know that you can draw down on some of that money without  being heavily taxed for needing it.   And while we decry all these inequities, and when we continue to  divide Americans and say, ``It is always about the rich; it is always  about the elite; it is all about those who have more than you do,''  that is not what it is about. It is about helping every American get to  retirement.   Good Lord, how did we get to this position? How did we get to this  point in America's history that we will pick and choose and we will  decry anybody who has been successful and always label them as the  rich, the elite, these horrible, horrible people who have done so much  with their life. They just don't deserve that.   Well, do you know what? This is America. There are more stories in  this country and throughout our history of people who started with  absolutely nothing but an opportunity, an equal opportunity, not  guaranteed an equal outcome, but guaranteed an equal opportunity.   What we are doing today is guaranteeing for every hardworking  American out there that they can put more of their own hard-earned  money into a retirement plan that serves them.   Now, every time we come on this floor, I hear this: divide, divide,  divide. We can't possibly be the America that 1.4 million of our fellow  citizens died to protect. No, no, no. This is not about America's  future. This is about midterm elections. We are more worried about  getting reelected than changing the direction of this country.    I would ask my colleagues on the other side, look, I know you are  sorry you didn't vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That is why you  throw it down all the time and say this is horrible. What did happen is  that we are giving you another chance to hop on this train.   I have only been here 8 years, but I will tell you what. I have heard  enough in 8 years, coming from the private sector where you have to  make it on your own every single day. You have to make payroll. You  have to put food on the table and a roof over the heads of your  children.   I don't want a government program that does that for me. I want a  government program that allows me to save my own money, take less of my  hard-earned money and allow me to save for my wife, for my kids, for my  grandchildren, and for my great-grandchildren.   That is what this is all about today, Mr. Speaker. It is plain and  simple.   One group thinks that the whole idea of government is to make each  and every citizen rely on them and depend on them for their very  existence. We are offering a chance for every single American--I don't  care where they are from, I don't care the color of their skin, the  shape of their eyes, or how they vote. What I do care about is that  they can go into their retirement knowing that their hard-earned money  over the years is going to be accessible to them.   That is what this is all about. I am hoping America is watching.   I will go back to what I said in the beginning. I remember very  clearly my mom and my dad sitting there and saying: The one thing we  pray for is that we are never a burden for you and your brothers and  your sisters.   And I will repeat what I said today. I could not believe that the  people who raised me, who fed me, who clothed me, who gave me a future,  thought that somehow they would ever be a burden to me, my brothers, or  my sisters. The one thing I know that they were sure of: They could  save on their own, and they could get ready for their future and for  their retirement years.   That is all we are trying to do today. We are trying to make sure  that every single hardworking American gets to keep more of his or her  money for their own retirement without the government taking advantage  of them.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I do still have the  passion to bring this forward, and I have the passion and I have the  belief that, if you can get beyond politics and talk about people, that  you can come to a conclusion that this is a solid bill that helps our  fellow Americans go into their retirement.   I know that is in your heart. I know you can't speak it sometimes  because we are so polarized. Isn't that a shame?   But I will say this. Today we have the opportunity, and what you can  show it on--there will be a big screen up there. It will have  everybody's name. And you can put a green ``yes'' on there, which says:  I am voting for America's future. I am voting for America's retirees. I  am voting to make people have peace of mind. Or you can put a red up  there and say: Do you know what? I would have voted for it, but it  wasn't our bill. And if it is not my bill, if it is not my party's  bill, I can't vote for that because there is an election coming up and  we have got to polarize this.   Mr. Speaker, I know I am out of time, but I am not out of breath, and  I will tell you what, I am sure as hell not out of passion. I know what  this country means for everybody, and we are making it possible for  them every day in every way.  [[Page H9134]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time
