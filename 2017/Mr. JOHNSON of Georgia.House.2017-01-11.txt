 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and  the chairman.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of  2017. I have a number of concerns with many provisions of this  voluminous page, this 82-page bill. It has not gone through regular  order, not one committee meeting. Congress just came into session last  week. So we have got 50-plus new Members in this body who have not had  one single day of an opportunity to pay any attention to learn what is  in this bill. Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  going to force their folks to vote ``yes'' on this bill. I urge them to  vote ``no'' and think about it. The reason they should think about it  is because H.R. 5 is a destructive revision of the Administrative  Procedure Act which fiendishly convolutes the agency rulemaking process  through numerous analytical requirements. We call that gumming up the  works.   These requirements, which are largely opposed by the Nation's leading  administrative law experts, would cause years of delays in the  rulemaking process and deregulate entire industries through rulemaking  avoidance by agencies.   In addition to imposing over 60 new procedural requirements on  regulatory protections, title I of H.R. 5 imposes a new super-mandate  requiring that agencies adopt the least costly rule considered during  the rulemaking that meets relevant statutory objectives and permits  agencies to choose a more expensive option only if the additional  benefits justify its additional costs.   The AFL-CIO has observed that this provision would make protecting  workers and the public secondary. Limiting costs and impacts on  business and corporations is the prime purpose of this legislation.  There is little doubt that this proposal will compromise public health,  workplace safety, and environmental protections. Agencies will be  forced to make penny-wise and pound-foolish decisions. It costs more to  remedy an environmental or financial calamity than it would be to  protect the public from the calamity occurring in the first place,  which the underlying regulation would do, but they don't want  regulations. This is unbelievable.   Title II of the bill abolishes judicial deference to agencies'  reasoned statutory interpretations, which has been a hallmark of  judicial review for more than three decades. Talk about judicial  restraint and not legislating from the bench. That is what the Supreme  Court in its Chevron rule has emphasized over the last three decades.   In addition to incentivizing judicial activism by generalist courts,  which could engage in rulemaking from the bench by making policy  decisions rather than strictly interpreting the law, this provision  will also make the regulatory system more costly and time-consuming  because it would require agencies to take even more time to promulgate  critical protections that the court ultimately decides on its own  through its ability to legislate from the bench that it doesn't like.  This is nonsense. It is hypocritical.   Title III of the bill further paralyzes agency rulemaking through  unworkable, complex requirements, while endowing the hallowed Small  Business Administration's Office of Advocacy with broad authority to  act as the gatekeeper of our Nation's entire regulatory system. As the  Center for Progressive Reform reported in a 2013 report, this entity,  this Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, exists in an  unchecked capacity to funnel ``special interest pressure into agency  rulemakings, even though such interests have already had ample  opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.''   So in other words, the Small Business Administration's Office of  Advocacy is a back door wide open to corporate interests seeking to  come in and undermine the regulatory authority of an agency.   At a time when there has been much talking and tweeting about  draining the swamp, this measure would function as a green light to  special interests to manipulate the regulatory system in their favor.   Moreover, my Republican colleagues' repeated claims that this measure  will create regulation by representation, or clawback authority from  the executive branch, that argument is fundamentally undermined by the  fact that this bill consolidates the role of a subagency, the Small  Business Administration, in such an opaque and reckless manner.    Have Members ever heard of any legislation  that purports to take power back from unelected bureaucrats and then  places it right back in the hands of a bureaucrat in the same piece of  legislation? This is ridiculous.   Title IV of H.R. 5 would automatically delay the effective date of  any rule exceeding $1 billion in costs that is challenged in court,  regardless of whether the party challenging the rule has any likelihood  of success on the merits, is actually harmed by the rule, or whether  staying the rule would be contrary to public interest.                                time  1500    So while they sit here and take the rights of regular, ordinary  working people to sue corporations under the guise of so-called tort  reform, they turn around in this legislation, open the courthouse door  wide to corporations to come in and file frivolous complaints against a  regulation and automatically stall it. This is ridiculous.   This legislation is rife with corporate protections at the expense of  the people, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, to say that this amendment stops  judicial activism is stretching things a little bit, I believe. This  opens the floodgates to judicial activism, the Goodlatte amendment, so  that is why I oppose the amendment. It revises title II of the bill to  eliminate agencies' ``gap-filling'' authority when interpreting  ambiguous statutes.   Judicial review of final agency action is a hallmark of  administrative law and is critical to ensuring that agency action does  not harm or adversely affect the public. But as the Supreme Court held,  in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council in 1984, reviewing  courts may only invalidate an agency action when it violates a  constitutional provision or when an agency exceeds its statutory  authority as clearly expressed by Congress.   That is a clear rule that has worked fine for America for the last 30  years. Over that time, this seminal decision has required deference to  the substantive expertise and political accountability of Federal  agencies because, after all, judges don't have political accountability  because they are appointed for life. They are not elected by the  people.   So this legislation is turning around this very fair and balanced  court decision and, instead, imposing a new setup, one that invites  judges--whom they appoint, by the way. They are the ones who have  refused, for the last year, to appoint or to consider the appointment  of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice so that they could get a Republican in  the White House.   They did not want anybody other than somebody made to order, and this  is what this legislation lays the groundwork for is that new Supreme  Court Justice who has yet to be named by a Republican incoming  President. But you can bet it will be one who has corporate interests  at heart instead of that of middle class and working people and  regular, ordinary people. You can bet that that Supreme Court  representative will be ready to do away with the Chevron doctrine and  comply with this legislative mandate, which is open season on  regulations, allowing the Federal judiciary to impose its political  beliefs on regulations.   So that is going to be bad for America. Generalist courts, which are  constitutionally insulated from political accountability, should not  have the power to second-guess agency experts concerning the  appropriateness of highly technical regulations crucial to protecting  the health and safety of millions of Americans.   Moreover, this doctrine promotes predictability for businesses and  the public. Professor Levin notes that ``because citizens can put some  confidence in the expectation that decisions by a centralized agency  will not be readily overturned by a variety of courts in different  parts of the country,'' that contributes to predictability.                                time  1515    Title II of H.R. 5, however, would upend this longstanding precedent  by abolishing the Chevron doctrine.   This amendment further puts the thumb on the scale against lifesaving  protections by ensuring that practically any statutory ambiguity will  be resolved in favor of a regulated entity and against agency action,  no matter how important.   This amendment is also a solution in search of a problem. As  Professor Levin has testified, ``the field of administrative law has  worked out a variety of political and judicial oversight mechanisms to  maintain a delicate balance of power among the branches of  government.''   Any administrative action based on an ambiguous statute could be  challenged by an affected party, and these checks already apply to  judicial review.   Finally, this measure would apply equally to regulatory and  deregulatory actions. John Walke, the clean air director and senior  attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council warns that if an  ``administration more ideologically opposed to regulation wishes to  take advantage of the inevitable vagueness, conflicts, and gaps in  federal statutes, it may adopt the least protective regulation  permissible under a federal law.''   Mr. Chair, because this is a bad amendment, I ask that it be opposed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  Chaffetz amendment. This amendment establishes a deadline of 270 days-- a magical number of days--for some reason. There is no reason given for  that being the number of days, but that is what they give to the Office  of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, to issue guidelines  pursuant to title I of this bill.   Why 270 days?   Well, I think I can answer that question. They know that OIRA is not  equipped to sufficiently deal with regulations within that same amount  of time period. We have had all this budget cutting going on. We have  been attacking the Federal Government regulatory authorities throughout  the entire 6 years that Republicans have been in control of this House.  They have done 6 years' worth of hobbling OIRA, and now they are going  to come forward and impose a 270-day requirement. That is like asking  someone who you have handicapped to run in a relay race that you know  they can't win.   To begin with, I would note that OIRA, which typically has fewer than  50 employees, often serves as a bottleneck for the promulgation of  economically significant rules, as reported last year by Public  Citizen.   Moreover, as a group of the Nation's leading administrative law  scholars have noted that the Regulatory Accountability Act is  ``unusually ambitious and crammed with details that are impossible to  summarize,'' that will ``further ossify the rulemaking process with  little offsetting benefits in the form of better rules.''   Many of these new procedures task OIRA with making numerous new  determinations and expanded review of formal rulemaking. In addition,  to hobbling over the last 6 years, and then imposing a deadline of an  arbitrary and capricious number of days, you are going to heap  additional requirements upon them without increasing their staff that  you have already cut.   Given the sheer breadth of these requirement, it may be difficult or  impossible for OIRA to comply with the deadline imposed by this  amendment, absent additional congressional appropriations, which, of  course, they are not interested in.   Accordingly, I rise to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think what I gather is that  we need better regulations. Therefore, we have to provide more  requirements on OIRA with respect to the regulations it issues, while  at the same time claiming that regulations are bad and we have  unelected bureaucrats and all of this kind of stuff like that.    So we need better laws to allow them to regulate better. Then we are  going to give them 270 days, which is a little more than we give the  average agency. Well, I thank you for that, but you have not increased  the manpower of the agency to deal with the new requirements that you  are stacking on them. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.   The real reason for this amendment is to help foster the gumming up  of the Federal regulatory system. That is what it is all about. There  are a lot of little small ways of doing that, heaping it on top of the  larger measure, which is itself just inimical to good rulemaking. This  is a game, and the American people are the big losers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require  agencies to provide a detailed economic assessment prior to certifying  that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a  substantial number of small business entities.   I oppose this bill for a number of reasons. Number one, it forces  agencies to prove a negative. The negative being that it will not have  a significant--bookmark that for a second--a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small entities.   I mean, proving a negative is always very difficult to do, that it  won't do this. Certainly very difficult. But then when you give the  decisionmaker a vague and ambiguous frame of reference like  ``significant,'' what does significant economic impact mean?   It means different things to different people. So that is vague and  ambiguous. It allows for unbridled discretion by an unelected  bureaucrat, to use that term that my friends like to use, but in this  instance I am using it with respect to a newly appointed plutocratic  bureaucrat like, say, Linda McMahon at the Small Business  Administration, a billionaire. Give that to, you know, a bureaucrat  such as that and let them decide whether or not it has a significant  economic impact. They are going to say, yes, it has a significant  economic impact. They are going to do it every time because that is  their agenda. They support a pro-big-business agenda. That is what they  represent, and so that is how they would rule.   When you add that it has to be a substantial number of small  businesses, well, what is a substantial number? Is it 10 percent, 20  percent, 50 percent?   That is up to whoever the decisionmaker is, the unelected bureaucrat.  We see the setup. I think the American people understand what this  amendment seeks to do. It requires agencies to provide a detailed  economic assessment of the economic impacts of a proposed or final rule  prior to certifying that the rule will not have a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small businesses.   Title III of H.R. 5 substantially increases agencies'  responsibilities with respect to rulemaking, including a requirement to  supply a detailed statement that includes the factual and legal basis  of the reasons why an agency has determined that a proposed or final  rule will not have a significant economic impact on small businesses.  Boy, you can just chase your tail all around for days trying to meet  that standard.   This onerous measure will force agencies to expend already strained  resources and incur considerable costs to implement the bill. Also,  giving corporations an opportunity to contest these arbitrary decisions  if they go the right way in court.   Unsurprisingly, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that an  identical version of this legislation considered last Congress would  cost $55 million over the 2015-2020 period, assuming appropriation of  the necessary funds.   By requiring agencies to quantify the economic effects that a  rulemaking will have on small businesses, which may be unknowable in  some cases, this amendment may task agencies with providing an economic  report on a counterfactual hypothetical basis. This requirement would  do little to ease compliance costs or promote small business  development or growth, and more likely it will lead to regulatory  avoidance and ossification and less small business activity because the  big businesses are going to be allowed to crowd them out. Accordingly,  I oppose  [[Page H349]]  this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is already covered in  current law, so why do we need this amendment?   Well, it is a messaging piece to be able to say to the listening  audience that we support small business. Well, gosh, I think we have  answered that question here on this side whether or not they really do  support small business. It is clear they support big business, and that  is what this amendment is going to help facilitate without adding to  the overall bill. For that reason, I ask that we oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respectfully claim the time  in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which  would prohibit Federal agencies from making any public communications  that would promote a pending regulatory action.   We can all agree that the rulemaking process should be transparent,  flexible, and accountable to the public. But rather than achieve this  goal, my colleagues' amendment would decrease transparency in the  rulemaking process and burden agency rulemaking with little  corresponding benefits to the public.   A variety of statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act and  agency specific statutes, already prescribe the method that agencies  may communicate to the public with regard to proposed rules. Agencies  should, and indeed are required by law to, communicate why rules are  beneficial to the public. For example, in 2014, the Department of  Defense proposed a rule to protect servicemembers and their families  from predatory lending schemes. In a press release discussing the rule,  the Defense Department highlighted the benefits of the rule such as  ``this proposed rule would better protect Active Duty servicemembers  and their families from excessive debt.''   This plain language explanation of the proposed rule would be flatly  prohibited by this amendment. Indeed, there is little that an agency  could discuss about a pending rule that would not be considered to be  promoting the rule within the meaning of this amendment.   In the context of the proposed deregulation actions, in 2003, Bush  administration officials posed with chainsaws and scissors next to a  stack of papers to promote efforts to cut red tape. It is doubtful that  this form of public communication would be permissible under this  amendment. By the way, to see the Bush administration officials with a  chainsaw and scissors going at regulations reminds me of what we are  doing here today.   In the context of a veto threat of a similar antiregulatory proposal  last Congress, the Obama administration stated that similar  requirements would prevent agencies from efficiently performing their  statutory responsibilities and potentially lead to a less informed  public.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  so as well.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, Congressman Gerald Connolly  wanted it to be known for the record that agency employees are already  barred under appropriations bills from engaging in publicity or  propaganda. Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in  substantial grass-roots lobbying campaigns when those campaigns are  aimed at encouraging members of the public to pressure Members of  Congress to support  [[Page H352]]  administration or department legislative or appropriations proposals.   Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, any time I hear the name  ``Mercatus Center'' I think of pro-big business, antiregulation. This  amendment imposes even more paralyzing rulemaking requirements to the  more than 60 analytical and procedural requirements that are already  mandated by title I of this bill. You are giving them more homework on  top of homework--busywork, red tape. Gum up the works--that is what  this is all about.   The amendment would require agencies to assess the economic impacts  of major rules every 5 years, including a cost-benefit analysis of the  rule every 5 years, an estimate of the rule's cost on regulated  entities, and whether these costs exceed an agency's initial estimates,  among other requirements. Worse yet, once this information is compiled,  the amendment would also require the agency to reopen the public docket  on the rule for 60 days to consider modifications to the underlying  rule.   Under current law, Federal agencies already conduct an extensive  retrospective review process of existing rules and have already saved  taxpayers billions in cost savings. This is yet another attempt to  derail the rulemaking process by paralysis through analysis.   Since 2011, the Obama administration has made a durable commitment to  ensuring the retrospective review of existing regulatory protections.  Pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 13563 and 13610, agencies are already  required to conduct a periodic review of existing rules to protect  public health while reducing paperwork burdens.   Furthermore, as the Obama administration stated in the context of a  veto threat of a similarly draconian antiregulatory proposal, ``it is  important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain  an agency's ability to provide a timely response to critical public  health or safety issues or constrain its ability to implement new  statutory provisions.''   This amendment would do just that by requiring agencies to conduct a  perpetual notice-and-comment process for major rules that have been  adopted long ago. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is that my  friends on the other side of the aisle, in their quest to satisfy the  big businesses that fund these campaigns, don't like regulations that  protect the health, safety, and well-being of Americans, including  children, including the elderly, the weak, the sick. They are trying to  get rid of the Affordable Care Act; trying to kill those regulations;  trying to kill regulations on Dodd-Frank, which is protecting people  from financial ruin by Wall Street barons.   This is an incessant march toward a deregulatory environment. We  can't let it continue unabated. We must protest. We must speak out. We  must do the right thing to protect the people of this  [[Page H354]]  country. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend Mr. Young's  amendment which establishes a 90-day compliance period for guidance  documents when, in the underlying legislation, it makes clear that  during any compliance period for guidance it is nonbinding. So I rise  in opposition to this amendment which imposes an unnecessary and  burdensome 90-day waiting period for agencies to issue guidance  documents.   Importantly, as a form of nonlegislative rule, guidance documents do  not have the force of law and are not subject to the Administrative  Procedure Act's notice and comment requirements. Section 104 of H.R. 5  already clarifies that these documents are not legally binding and may  not be relied upon by an agency as legal grounds for agency action.   This provision additionally requires agencies to make this document  available to the public and provide a plain and prominent statement  that the document is not legally binding. Given the requirements that  already exist in current law and the additional requirements imposed by  title I of this bill, it is difficult to ascertain why an additional  90-day compliance period for guidance that is not legally binding is  warranted.   Furthermore, in all cases, regulated entities have ample opportunity  to challenge rules, including guidance, as ``arbitrary or capricious''  under the Administrative Procedure Act where an agency lacks statutory  authority to issue the guidance or the guidance is otherwise legally  unsound.   Indeed, as Justice Elena Kagan noted in 2015 in Paralyzed Veterans v.  Mortgage Bankers, the APA contains a variety of constraints on agency  decisionmaking, the arbitrary and capricious standard being among the  most notable.   Accordingly, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my  amendment to H.R. 5 which would exempt from the bill rules that improve  the employment retention and wages of workforce participants,  especially those with significant barriers to employment.   When President Obama took office in 2009, he inherited the worse  economic depression since the Great Depression. Since then, President  Obama's ``North Star'' on domestic policy has long been to make the  economy work for the middle class and for those fighting to join it.  Notwithstanding historic austerity levels and a Republican Congress  more interested in winning elections than putting Americans back to  work or increasing wages, President Obama has largely achieved this  goal, while rescuing the auto industry and signing tax cuts for middle  class persons, as opposed to just simply big business.   According to the leading economic data, private sector businesses  have created more than 15 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has  dropped well below 5 percent to the lowest point in nearly a decade,  wages are rising, and the poverty rate has dropped to the lowest point  since 1968. And more people have health insurance than ever before.   This has all occurred during an administration that is pro  environment, pro clean energy, pro workplace safety, pro medical care,  pro Medicare, pro Medicaid, pro Social Security. In fact, during this  time, our Nation has doubled its production of clean energy and reduced  carbon emissions faster than any other advanced nation.   Notwithstanding this progress, there is still much work to be done  for millions of Americans in every part of our country who are out of  work, underemployed, or have not seen significant wage growth  postrecession. But they should understand it was the Republicans who  caused that to happen by not wanting to work with the President and  members of the Democratic Party to make things better for working  people in this country.   Congress should be working tirelessly now across party lines to find  solutions to persistent unemployment and stagnant wages, such as a  public infrastructure investment agenda that will increase productivity  and domestic output while turning the page on our historic  underinvestment in our Nation's roads, bridges, and educational  institutions.   Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 5, is not one of those solutions. The  Regulatory Accountability Act is nothing short of a train wreck for  critical public health and safety protections that ensure that our air  is clean, our water is pure, and that our workplace, vehicles, homes,  and consumer products are safe.   Freeing corporations from the costs of protecting Americans against  harmful activity is not the right path forward to increasing employment  and wages for all. It is a giveaway to the corporate sector that  supports them. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
