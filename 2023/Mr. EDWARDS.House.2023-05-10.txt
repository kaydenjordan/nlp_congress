 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 47 courageous  law enforcement officers who have fallen since 1906 in North Carolina's  11th District. It saddens me to say that in the past 3 years, we have  lost Ryan Phillip Hendrix from the Henderson County Sheriff's Office,  Donald William Ramey from the Transylvania County Sheriff's Office, and  John Horton from the North Carolina Highway Patrol.   In towns and cities across our Nation, citizens are traveling to  Washington, D.C., this week to participate in National Police Week to  honor and to remember our law enforcement officers past and present.   President John F. Kennedy, from the other side of the aisle,  announced the first Police Week in 1962 to honor police officers for  their faithful and loyal devotion to their responsibilities, and for  their courage and dedication to their communities.    It is a distinct honor to represent the numerous brave men and women  in law enforcement in western North Carolina, and I rise today to thank  all of our law enforcement officers in cities and towns across the Blue  Ridge, across the entire State of North Carolina, and across our  Nation.   We need them now more than ever, and we must never stop backing the  men and women in blue who protect us, our loved ones, and our  communities. May God continue to bless our Nation's law enforcement  officers.
