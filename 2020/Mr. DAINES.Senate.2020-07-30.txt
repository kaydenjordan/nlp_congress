 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Roundup Fire Chief Keith Salthe of Musselshell County for  his bravery and decisive action that stopped the spread of a fire in  downtown Roundup.   On the morning of May 20, 2020, Fire Chief Salthe and his team of 20  volunteer firefighters, as well as firefighters from Hawk Creek, Dean  Creek, and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and  Conservation, responded to a fire that broke out at the Vintage Cafe in  Roundup.   Five hours after the fire ignited, Salthe and his team were forced to  knock down the building to ensure that the fire didn't spread to the  remaining businesses on the block.   For his decisive action, Musselshell County sheriff called Chief  Salthe the real hero of the day and said that if it weren't for Chief  Salthe and his team, the entire block would have been lost.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Fire Chief Salthe today. His  leadership during this fire emergency stopped the spread of the fire  towards other businesses, saving lives and preventing what could have  been a tragedy for the community of Roundup. Roundup is fortunate to  have brave men like Keith Salthe and his team of volunteer firefighters  who were ready to jump into harm's way at a moment's notice for the  safety of their fellow Montanans.

A graduate of the Helena College of Technology, Terry's first job out  of college was at St. John's Hospital in Helena.   From then on, Terry went on to work at Crest Nursing Home in Butte,  holding various roles over 18 years as a medical nurse, physical  therapy aide, and assistant director of nursing and social services  representative.   In 1980, Terry continued her service and joined the Army Reserves,  deploying to the United Arab Emirates during the first gulf war as part  of Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s.   As a fellow veteran herself and a dedicated health care hero, Terry  spent the last 10 years of her nursing career in Great Falls, providing  care at the Great Falls VA clinic in the Neurology and Pain Department  as a nurse.   Terry's commitment to helping others is exemplary of the rich legacy  of service we have in Montana. I know that all of Terry's patients over  the years are thankful for her lifetime of service to the community,  the State of Montana, and our country.                            ____________________
