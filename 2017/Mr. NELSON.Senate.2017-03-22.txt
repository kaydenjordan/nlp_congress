 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                               Opioid Epidemic     Madam President, there has been a lot of conversation  from so many of our fellow Senators about the opioid crisis that has  been devastating individuals and families across the country. We heard  this particularly in New Hampshire as it was a topic of discussion last  fall during the election. It was an opportunity to bring to the  Nation's attention--because of the eyes being focused first on the New  Hampshire primary--of a real opioid crisis.   What we also then discussed was that it was not just affecting a few  States, it was affecting most of the States. That is the case with my  State of Florida. Addiction to opioids has reached staggering levels,  and the situation is only getting worse. In 2015, more than 33,000  Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses. That is 15 percent  more people than had died just the previous year. I don't have the  figures for last year, 2016.   So Florida is right there in that national trend. What Florida saw  between 2014 and 2015 was a 22.7-percent increase. It is staggering  because in that year, Florida suffered over 2,000 deaths from opioid  overdoses. Earlier this month, our office interviewed a woman from  Florida for yesterday's Committee on Aging's hearing.   She is caring for her 7-year-old grandson because his mother lost  custody, was later incarcerated due to her drug addiction. Sadly, this  story is all too familiar. The number of grandparents serving as the  primary caretakers for their grandchildren is increasing, as was the  case with the lady from Florida who testified at the Committee on Aging  hearing this week. They are primary caretakers for their grandchildren.  It is, in large part, because of the opioid epidemic.   In addition to the devastating loss of life and the challenges for  the new caregivers, opioid abuse is straining local and State budgets.  Just last month, the vice mayor of Palm Beach County sent a letter to  the Governor urging him to declare a public health  [[Page S1908]]  emergency in Florida citing the loss of life and financial impact--in  this case to Palm Beach County.   Yesterday, several of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the  majority leader of the Senate highlighting some of our concerns with  the House of Representative's healthcare bill that I call TrumpCare and  how it is going to impact those with substance abuse disorders because  one of the things we are most concerned about is how the proposed  changes in Medicaid that they are going to vote on at the other end of  the hall--right down here tomorrow, they are going to vote on the House  of Representative's healthcare TrumpCare bill.   The changes they make to Medicaid would prevent States from being  able to respond to the opioid crisis because Medicaid plays a critical  role in the fight against opioids, but changing the Medicaid Program to  a block grant or a cap is going to shift costs to the States. The  States are not going to pick up that additional cost. It is going to  eliminate also some of the Federal protections, and it is only going to  hurt our people who rely on Medicaid to help them as we are combating  this opioid crisis because with less Federal funding, how are States  like mine going to provide the necessary services to help individuals  with substance abuse disorders?   Congress ought to be doing more to help with this crisis, not less.  How many times have you heard a Senator, like this Senator, come to the  floor and talk about the opioid epidemic? Yet we are just about to do  it to ourselves if we pass this TrumpCare bill. Remember, last year,  while so many of us, including this Senator, were early supporters of  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016--it was signed  into law last year. The law takes a comprehensive approach to this  opioid problem.   A few months ago, a lot of us, including this Senator, voted to  provide additional funding to start implementing this crucial new law  to fight opioid addiction. Despite this progress, the House tomorrow-- probably, tomorrow night--is about to pass legislation that would  completely undermine last year's bipartisan efforts to respond to the  epidemic and to undercut healthcare for millions of people in this  country.   Opioid abuse is a deadly, serious problem, and we cannot ignore it.  We should be investing more resources into helping these people and  their families, not cutting them at the time we need them the most.   Again, I make a plea. We made progress last year with the law. We  passed the new law. We made progress, giving some additional funding.  The crisis hasn't gone away. We still need to respond.   But at the very same time, what we see happening to the Medicaid  Program--eliminating Medicaid as we know it, healthcare for the people  who are the least fortunate among us--is that we are about to cut back  on all that progress we have made on this opioid crisis. I hope that we  will think better of this and not do it to ourselves.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, we are talking about taking privacy rights  away from individuals if we suddenly eliminate this rule. Do you want a  large company that is an internet provider, that has all the personal,  sensitive information because of what you have been doing on the  internet--do you want that company to be able to use that for  commercial purposes without your consent? That is the issue.   If you want to protect people's privacy, I would think you would want  to require that an individual who has paid money for the internet  provider to provide them with the internet--you go on the internet, and  you go to whatever site you want. You do business. You do personal  business. You do banking. You go on the internet and you buy things.  You talk about your children's school, about when you are going to pick  up your children, maybe what your children want to wear to school. You  want to talk on the internet about anything that is personal. Do you  want that internet provider to have access to  [[Page S1926]]  that information to be used for commercial purposes without your  consent? If you ask that question to the American people, they are  going to give you a big, resounding no.   Should the internet provider use that information if you give your  consent? Then that is fair game. If you give your consent so that they  can alert you before a certain day--you might want to give a certain  gift to your wife on her birthday, and they might have all that  information, but maybe you don't want them to have the information  about where your children go to school.   Personal, sensitive information is what we are talking about;  therefore, the whole issue here is, do you want the internet provider  to be able to use that information without the person's consent, or do  you want the person to have to actually effectively opt-in in order to  give the internet provider that consent? To me, this is a clear-cut  case of privacy.   You can fancy it up, talking about FCC rules and so forth--and we  have the author of the Telecom Act, Senator Markey, here, and he is  going to talk about this and protections that were put in for  telephones. But back then, remember, it was just you call from this  number to this number on such and such a day for such and such a period  of time. Even that was protected. But now--just think about this--we  are talking about all the personal transactions that you do every day  through the internet.   So I rise today in opposition to this resolution brought under the  Congressional Review Act to disapprove the Federal Communications  Commission's broadband consumer privacy rules. I would think that the  distinguished Senator sitting in the Chair, who values privacy as he  does--that this is going to be something he would be concerned about,  as well as every other Senator in this Chamber, because you know that  if you ask your constituents ``Do you want your privacy invaded without  your consent?'' you know what the answer is going to be.   Americans care about their online privacy. They want to have control  over how their personal information is exploited by third parties. In  fact, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 91 percent  of adults feel they have lost control of how their personal information  is collected and then used. That same study found that 74 percent of  Americans believe it is very important that they be in control of who  can get information about them, and a majority believe that their  travels around the internet--the sites they visit and how long they  spend in that location--are sensitive information that should be  protected. I hope the Senators are going to pay attention to this  because we are talking about sensitive, personal information.   Do you know that your geolocation is something that you are  transmitting over the internet? Do you want your location and where you  have been to be in the hands of somebody who could use that for  commercial purposes? I don't think so. That is why this past October  the FCC provided broadband subscribers with tools to allow them to have  greater control over how their personal online information is used,  shared, and then sold.   The FCC has been protecting telephone customers' privacy for decades,  and it updated its longstanding privacy protections to protect the  privacy of broadband customers. In fact, it is safe to say that what  the FCC did last October was the most comprehensive update to its  consumer privacy and data protection rules in decades.   The FCC put in place clear rules that require broadband providers to  seek their subscribers' specific and informed consent before using or  sharing sensitive personal information and give broadband customers the  right to opt out of having their nonsensitive information used and  shared if they chose to do so. The FCC also gave broadband subscribers  additional confidence in the protection and security of their data by  putting in place reasonable data security and breach notification  requirements for broadband providers.   Simply put, the FCC decided to put American consumers--each one of us  who pays these monthly fees for our broadband service--in the driver's  seat of how their personal online data is used and shared by the  broadband provider to which they have been paying a monthly fee to use  their service. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.   Please understand that broadband providers know a lot about every one  of us. In fact, it may be startling, the picture that your broadband  provider can develop about your daily habits and then sell to the  highest bidder.   Your home broadband provider can know when you wake up every day  either by knowing the time each morning that you log on to the internet  to check the weather and news of the morning or through a connected  device in your home.   That provider may know immediately that you are not feeling well,  that you kind of feel sick, assuming you peruse the internet, like most  of us do, to get a quick check on your symptoms. In fact, your  broadband provider may know more about your health and your reaction to  illness than you are willing to share with your doctor. Think about  that.   Personal privacy? If you let this go to the highest bidder, personal  privacy of sensitive information is going to be out the window.   Your home broadband provider can build a profile about your listening  and viewing habits given that today most of us access music, news, and  video programming over broadband.   Your broadband provider may have a better financial picture of you  than even your bank or your brokerage firm or your financial adviser  because they see every website you visit across every device in your  home and can build a thorough profile about you through these habits.   If you live in a connected home, the home of the future--and the  future is now, by the way--they may know even more details about how  you go about your day-to-day activities. Your mobile broadband provider  knows how you move about through the day, your geolocation. They know  through information about that geolocation and the internet activity.  All of that is through--guess what--this mobile device. Don't you think  this is connected to the internet? And that is not to mention the sort  of profile a broadband provider can start to build about our children  from their birth. It is a gold mine of data, the holy grail, so to  speak.   It is no wonder that broadband providers want to be able to sell this  information to the highest bidder without the consumer's knowledge or  consent. And they want to collect and use this information without  providing transparency or being held accountable. Is this what you want  to inflict upon your constituents in your State by changing this rule  about their personal, sensitive privacy? I don't think so. You better  know what you are doing when you vote tomorrow. This vote is coming  about noon tomorrow. You better know.    As a country, we have not stood for this in the past, this kind of  free utilization of information by entities that may want to have a  unique look at who we are. We place stringent limits on the use of  information by our doctors. We place stringent limits on our banks.  When it comes to our children, I mean, that ought to be off-limits.   Broadband providers can build similar profiles about us and in fact  may be able to provide more detail about someone than any one of those  entities can. Passing this Senate resolution will take consumers out of  the driver's seat and place the collection and use of their information  behind a veil of secrecy, despite the rhetoric surrounding our debate  today suggesting that eliminating these commonsense rules will better  protect consumers' privacy online or will eliminate consumer confusion.   Don't fall for that argument, Senators. In fact, the resolution will  wipe out thoughtful rules that were the product of months of hard work  by the experts at the agency on regulating communications networks of  all kinds. Those rules were crafted based upon a thorough record  developed through an extensive multimonth rulemaking proceeding. The  FCC received more than one-quarter of a million filings during this  proceeding. They listened to the American people.   The agency received extensive input from stakeholders in all quarters  of the debate, from the broadband providers and telephone companies to  the public interest groups and from academics to individual consumers.  We are going to wipe all of this away at noon tomorrow  [[Page S1927]]  with a vote that you can do it by 50 votes in this Chamber? I don't  think this is what the people want.   On top of this, the rules are based on longstanding privacy  protections maintained by the FCC for telephone companies, as well as  the work of and the principles advocated by the Federal Trade  Commission and advocated by State attorneys general and others in  protecting consumer privacy. The FCC rules put in place basic  safeguards for consumers' privacy based on three concepts that are  widely accepted as the basis for privacy regulation in the United  States and around the world: notice, choice--individual choice,  consumer choice--and security, those three. They are not the radical  proposals that some would have you believe they are.   First, the rules require broadband providers to notify their  customers about what types of information it collects about the  individual customers, when they disclose or permit access to that  information, and how customers can provide consent to that collection  and disclosure.   Second, the rules give consumers choice by requiring broadband  providers to obtain a customer's affirmative opt in; in other words, I  give you my consent before you can use or share my sensitive personal  information.   As I mentioned earlier, sensitive information includes a customer's  precise geographic location--I don't think you want some people to know  exactly where you are--your personal information, health, financial,  information about your children, your Social Security number--how many  laws do we have protecting Social Security numbers--the content you  have accumulated on the web, web browsing, and application usage  information.   For information considered nonsensitive, broadband providers must  allow customers to opt out of use and sharing of such information.  Broadband providers must provide a simple, persistently available means  for customers to exercise their privacy choices.   Third, broadband providers are required to take reasonable measures  to protect customers' information from unauthorized use, disclosure, or  access. They must also comply with specific breach notifications. In  other words, if somebody has busted the internet and stolen all of this  information from the site, don't you think you ought to be notified  that your personal information was hacked? Well, that is one of the  requirements.   So then I ask my colleagues: What in the world is wrong with  requiring broadband providers to give their paying customers clear,  understandable, and accurate information about what confidential and  potentially highly personal information those companies collect? What  is wrong with getting their consent to collect that information from  their subscribers?   What is wrong with telling customers how their information is  collected when they use their broadband service? What is wrong with  telling customers with whom they share this sensitive information? What  is wrong with letting customers have a say in how their information is  used? What is wrong with recognizing that information about a  consumer's browsing history and ap usage, sensitive and personal  information, should be held to a higher standard before it is shared  with others? What is wrong with all of that?    What is wrong with seeking a parent's consent before information  about their children's activities or location is sold to the highest  bidder? Do we as parents not go out of our way to protect our  children's well-being and their privacy? Trying to overturn this rule  is what is wrong.   What is wrong with protecting consumers from being forced to sign  away their privacy rights in order to subscribe to a broadband service?  I want your internet service. Do I have to sign away the rights to my  private information--private, sensitive information? What is wrong with  making companies take reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of  consumers' data?   What is wrong with making companies notify their subscribers when  they have had a breach? Again, I ask my colleagues: What in the world  is wrong with giving consumers increased choice, transparency, and  security online?   Supporters of the joint resolution fail to acknowledge the negative  impact this resolution is going to have on the American people. This  regulation is going to wipe away a set of reasonable, commonsense  protections. I want to emphasize that. Is it common sense to protect  our personal, sensitive, private information? Of course it is. But we  are just about--in a vote at noon tomorrow, with a majority vote, not a  60-vote threshold, a majority vote here--we are just about to wipe all  of that out. It will open our internet browsing histories and  application usage patterns up to exploitation for commercial purposes  by broadband providers and third parties who will line up to buy your  information.   It will create a privacy-free zone for broadband companies, with no  Federal regulator having effective tools to set rules of the road for  collection, use, and sale of that uniquely personal information of  yours. It will tie the hands of the FCC because they cannot go back.  Once this rule is overturned, they cannot go back and redo this rule.  It will tie the hands of the Federal Communications Commission and  eliminate the future ability to adopt clear, effective privacy and data  security protections for you as a subscriber, in some cases even for  telephone subscribers.   To be sure, there are those who disagree with the FCC's broadband  consumer privacy rules. There is an avenue for those complaints. These  same companies that are pushing the joint resolution have filed for  reconsideration of the rule at the FCC, and there is a judicial system.  That is the appropriate way. Go back and get the FCC to amend--if you  all are so concerned--or let the judicial system work its will, but do  not do it in one fell swoop in a majority rule in this body tomorrow at  noon.   In fact, the critics of the FCC's rules have an open proceeding at  the FCC in which they can argue on the record with an opportunity for  full public participation to change and alter these rules.   If the FCC did it--you have a new FCC, a new Chairman, a new majority  on the FCC--let them be the ones to amend the rules after all the  safeguards of the open hearings, of the comment period, all of that. By  contrast, what we are using here to invade our privacy is a blunt  congressional instrument called the Congressional Review Act. It means  that all aspects of the rules adopted by the FCC must be overturned at  once, including changes to the FCC's telephone privacy rules.   It would deny the agency the power to protect consumers' privacy  online, and it would prevent the FCC--get this--prevent them, the FCC,  the regulatory body that now has a new chairman and a new majority--it  would prevent the FCC from ever adopting even similar rules. I don't  think that is what we want to do because it does not make sense. That  is exactly what we are about to do.   I also want to address the argument that the FCC rules are unfair to  broadband providers because the same rules do not apply to other  companies in the internet ecosystem. Supporters of this resolution will  argue that the other entities in the internet ecosystem have access to  the same personal information that the broadband providers do.   They argue that everyone in the data collection business should be on  a level playing field. Well, I ask my colleagues whether they have  asked their constituents that question directly. Do Americans really  believe that all persons who hold data about them should be treated the  same? I venture to guess that most Americans would agree with the FCC  that companies that are able to build detailed particulars about you  and build those particular pictures about your lives through unique  insights because of what you do every day in their internet usage-- shouldn't those companies be held to a higher standard?    In addition, the FCC's rules still allow broadband providers to  collect and use their subscribers' information. The providers merely  need to obtain consent from those activities when it comes to their  subscribers' highly sensitive information.   The FCC also found that broadband providers, unlike any other  companies in the internet ecosystem, are uniquely able to see every  packet of information that a subscriber sends and receives--every  packet of information that you  [[Page S1928]]  send or receive over the internet while on their networks. So if you  have a provider, they are on your iPhone, and you are using them, they  are seeing everything. That is not the case if you go to Google because  Google sees only what you do while you are on Google. But the internet  provider, the pipe that is carrying your information--they see  everything that you do.   Supporters of the joint resolution also hold out the superiority of  the Federal Trade Commission's efforts on protecting privacy. They  argue that there should be only one privacy cop on the beat. But,  folks, that ignores reality. The FTC doesn't do everything. There are a  number of privacy cops on the beat. Congress has given the FCC, the  FTC, the FDA, and NHTSA regulatory authority to protect consumers'  privacy.   You had better get this clear because the FCC is the only agency to  which Congress has given statutory authority to adopt rules to protect  broadband customers' privacy. The FTC, the Federal Trade Commission,  does not have the rulemaking authority in data security, even though  commissioners at the FTC have asked Congress for such authority in the  past. Given recent court cases, the FTC now faces even more  insurmountable legal obstacles to taking action, protecting broadband  consumers' privacy.   So don't be fooled by this argument that folks are telling you over  here that it ought to be the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission. As many  have pointed out, elimination of the FCC's rules will result in a very  wide chasm, where broadband and cable companies have no discernible  regulation while internet ``edge'' companies abide by the FTC  enforcement efforts.   Without clear rules of the road, broadband subscribers will have no  certainty of choice about how their private information can be used and  no protection against its abuse--no protection, my fellow Americans, of  your personal, sensitive, private data. That is why this Senator  supports the FCC's broadband consumer privacy rules.   I want to encourage my fellow Senators: You had better examine what  you are about to do to people's personal privacy before you vote to  overturn this rule tomorrow.   I urge my colleagues to vote against the joint resolution.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from South Dakota.                     Orders for Thursday, March 23, 2017     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a detailee,  Randolph Clark, and a fellow, Stacey Stern Albert, who have worked on  this issue for the Commerce Committee, be granted floor privileges for  the remainder of this session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
