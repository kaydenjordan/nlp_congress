 Mr. Speaker, since the implementation of the ACA, over  3.9 million women age 18 to 64 have gained health coverage through  Medicaid. The ACA ended gender rating, meaning that the insurance  companies cannot charge women more than they charge men for the same  coverage. TrumpCare also eliminates Medicaid funding for Planned  Parenthood, reducing access to health care for women. Millions of women  rely on Planned Parenthood for both routine and lifesaving care, such  as preventative services, family planning, and preventing unwanted  pregnancies. When the GPO strips Planned Parenthood funding, health  care of women will suffer.   TrumpCare and its Medicare cuts also hurts seniors. Older Americans  account for over 60 percent of Medicare spending. Insurance companies  will now be able to charge more based on their age, which will increase  premiums by thousands.   Mr. Speaker, watching Republicans sell this bill is like buying a  used car from a guy with a crooked smile, even they don't believe in  it. I ask my Republican colleagues to withdraw this horrible bill and  work with Democrats to improve the ACA instead of trying to sell this  atrocity.
