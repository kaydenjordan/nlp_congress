 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for yielding to me to speak about my friend  and colleague, Congressman John Lewis, a man that I loved.   I will miss dearly him saying, ``I love you too, brother.''   There is no telling how many times John Lewis told the people of this  House, ``I love you too, brother.'' He looked at everybody, no matter  who you were, as a brother.   I selfishly thought about how much I was going to miss him and seeing  him and Michael Collins on a Delta ready to fly up here. I always got a  kick out of the fact that people from my district would sit down next  to me and say: Did you see John Lewis on the plane? And, by the way,  what do you do?   That was just the way people loved John Lewis.   There is not a person walking in this country today who didn't  benefit from John Lewis and what he did for mankind, and I would  venture to say that the majority of the people in the world benefited  from his love and what he did.   I thought about a few passages. We have talked about him preaching to  the chickens, and maybe we are the chickens he was preaching to his  whole life.   I remembered the Beatitudes:         Blessed are the peacemakers, for they should be called the       children of God.    If there was ever a peacemaker that I met, it was John Lewis.   Following from there:         Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'       sake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.    A little further into the book of Matthew:         Let your light shine before men that they may see your good       works and glorify your Father, which is in Heaven.    There is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that John Lewis was a special man. He  was a special man of God. And while his bones may rest, his legacy will  live on forever in this body.   I, for one, look very forward to the day that a statue of John Lewis  rests in the Halls of this Congress representing not only the great  State of Georgia and the people of the State of Georgia, but all of the  men and women of the United States.
