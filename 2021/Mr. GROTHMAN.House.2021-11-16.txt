 Madam Speaker, I would like to use this time to speak  for a half hour on a variety of issues, primarily the Build Back Better  bill.   But first, I would like to address today National Apprenticeship  Week. Apprenticeships are a very good way to begin your working career.  Rather than working your way into debt as you go to school, you are  making money while you go to school, and there is no better preparation  for a job than doing the job itself.   Be it in construction, be it in manufacturing, be it in healthcare,  there is a strong need in America for skills, and apprenticeship is a  way to get those skills and ensure that you hit the ground running and  get a good-paying job immediately.   I strongly encourage all Americans, particularly young Americans, who  are looking for a job to look at apprenticeship and encourage  administrators of secondary schools to present apprenticeships as  options for young people.   Now I would like to address the Build Back Better bill. A lot has  been written and talked about the Build Back Better bill from this very  microphone, and a lot has been focused on the additional taxes that  will be needed to pay for it and the overall level of spending  resulting in more inflation.   All that is true, but I think the most dangerous thing about the bill  is what the money is being spent for. I am going to address five areas  in general tonight for the American public to remember.   Right now, I think the biggest problem in America deals with illegal  immigration. The numbers are well known. In July, a year ago, 8,000  people came into this country. This July it was 105,000 people. This  October we hit  [[Page H6314]]  the all-time high number of people processed for any October at the  southern border.   The drug gangs are making lots of money down there. Some people tell  me the drug gangs are making more money bringing people in the country  than they did selling drugs. Seven years ago, when I first got this  job, 45,000 Americans a year were dying of illegal drug overdoses. We  are now at 93,000, more than double.   When I first got here, we talked about the number of people dying of  illegal drug overdoses approaching the number of soldiers who died in  Vietnam. Now we are approaching twice the number of soldiers who died  in Vietnam.    We talk about the humanitarian mess down there. In July, 15,000  minors were left alone and coming into the country. Last year we hit  another all-time record, 557 deaths of people trying to get in the  country, be it from dehydrating in the desert, drowning in the Rio  Grande, or falling off the wall.   What are we doing with this crisis in this bill? What vision do they  have for America? First of all, they are going to take about 7 million  people who have snuck into the country illegally in the past and give  them amnesty. In addition to the unfairness of having some people skip  ahead of other people, that is an invitation to bring still more people  into the country.   Secondly, they are going to make it more difficult to kick people out  of the country. More parole for people with sex offenses, people with  firearm offenses, and this parole is mandatory. It is not something  that can be revoked at the discretion of DHS.   In this bill, as a further inducement to come here, we are going to  give away free Pell grants, which is to say free college scholarships  to people coming here illegally. Hard as it is to believe, while  Americans are spending $20 thousand, $30 thousand, $40 thousand,  $50,000 in debt for a college diploma, in the Build Back Better bill,  we are going to give away free college to people who are here  illegally.   Furthermore, in this bill, a bill spending trillions of dollars,  about the only thing they are not spending more money on is the Border  Patrol. We all know that as more children come here, the Border Patrol  has to spend more time on paperwork caring for children, so they need  more people at the border. But as the border is left open, the one  thing the Democrat Party sadly feels is not a priority is more Border  Patrol agents.   So again, to repeat, in the Build Back Better bill, 7 million more  people given amnesty, requiring more parole for people who have  committed serious crimes so that they are not kicked out of the  country, and free Pell grants, which fits nicely with the free  healthcare we give away as well.   I want to mention that free healthcare. The average American is  sitting there worrying about their deductible, should we go to the  doctor, should we not? What does the majority party want to do? Well,  we have got to give illegals free healthcare. It is the only fair thing  to do.                                time  1830    The second big problem I think in this country is what I will call a  growing number of Americans adapting to the welfare lifestyle.   Beginning in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson--in my opinion, the worst  President in this country until this time--started a massive welfare  state, the result of which was causing people to work less and to make  sure they didn't get married because it was hard to take advantage of  the welfare system if you were married. In other words, the goal was to  discourage marriage, discourage work.   Since that time, the number of people with particularly a father in  the family has decreased considerably since the early sixties in  response to the Great Society, which discouraged--gave financial  inducements not to have a male in the family.   How does the Build Back Better bill deal with the American crisis of  the breakdown of the family? Wherever you look, they are putting more  money into these programs, the programs that in the past were created  for people who didn't make much money and were created for people who  weren't married to somebody making money: food share; low-income  housing; Medicaid; daycare; earned income tax credit that you had to  earn something to get, but if you began to make over $15,000 or  $20,000, they took that away from you; TANF funds, cash to people also  adopting that lifestyle.   So how does the majority party respond to the crisis of a welfare  system that discourages work and discourages marriage? We have a larger  earned income tax credit, which goes up, again, if you are not married  to somebody making a decent income. We are building a lot more low- income housing.   Low-income housing sounds all very good, but I talked to a woman who  administers low-income housing. I asked her where people are coming  from when they get off the waiting list for low-income housing. Well, a  lot of them were living with their parents. Okay. So we are going to  take a parent and the child and give them their own apartment, as  opposed to having them live with grandparents. Is that a good thing, to  move out of mom's house? I don't think so.   We are increasing, or the Biden administration itself, before we get  to the bill, increased the amount of food stamps you are getting. We  are adding more money in Pell grants, which is, again, a situation if  you are a middle-class family and you are working, you aren't eligible  for Pell grants. But if you are adopting a certain lifestyle, you are  eligible for free college.   So it seems wherever you look, this program is encouraging that  lifestyle, which I think is unfortunate for America.   There are wonderful people who are parents in all sorts of  situations, but undeniably in this country we are right now penalizing  what I will call the old-fashioned family. And I will point out that it  is something, as we started this session and Black Lives Matter weighed  in strongly in the last election to who would win, Black Lives Matter  itself, their founders, quoted Karl Marx, the fact that they did not  believe in the traditional family.   When I look here, it seems that that is a motivating factor behind  putting this bill together, and we are going to penalize the  traditional family.   The third ideal that flows through the Build Back Better Act is to  identify people by racial background. Whether you are talking about  money for small businesses, money for teacher preparation, money for  community restoration, faculty of colleges of medicine, equity in the  Department of Agriculture, or behavioral health, wherever you look, it  is not like the programs are for all Americans. The programs are  designed for certain Americans.   I was reading some statements by Yuri Bezmenov, who was a Russian  defector in the 1960s. At the time, he talked about how the Marxists  planned to take over America. He said the majority of money spent in  the United States was not spent on subversive or covert activities. It  was spent openly to try to demoralize Americans to think that America  was not a great country. A quote from him is that ``racial and ethnic  interrelations is one of the most vulnerable areas for demoralization''  of Americans.   Now, one would think his observation as someone who had been around  the world is that there is no better place to live than America. But  right now, it seems as though the majority party is doing the work that  the Soviets wanted to accomplish in the twenties. They want to tell  everybody that we ought to have racial animus, that we ought to pit one  group against another group.   When you look around the world, one of the reasons nations fail,  nations based on elections, is that those elections become contests  between ethnic groups.   I never felt Canada was quite as successful as America because, to a  degree, their elections pitted the French speakers against the English  speakers. You look at elections in the Middle East, and it is the  Sunnis against the Shiites. You look at elections in Africa, and it is  one tribe against another tribe.   In other words, when they go to the polls, they don't say what is the  appropriate money to spend on national defense or what is our roads  policy or what should be appropriate criminal justice policy or the  length of jail sentences. No, in these countries that fail, the  elections are a contest of one ethnic group against another.   Not surprisingly, therefore, the people who want America to fail  would set  [[Page H6315]]  up programs designed to benefit one group against the other.   We have seen this earlier this session when we had a program  forgiving agriculture debts only for so-called people of color. We also  saw it earlier this session when we had a program that ran out of money  for restauranteurs, and the people at the bottom of the list were  people who happened to be White.   A guy came up to me in my district who would have gotten, he claims,  tens of thousands of dollars if he were of a different ethnic  background. He wondered why he was left behind. Well, it is because we  have a party here that likes to set one group against another group.    That is the third way or the third vision that the majority party has  for America. They want to pit one group against the other. They want  people to always view themselves rather than as an American. They want  to view themselves as a Hispanic American or an Asian American or an  African American.   The fourth way they want to change America in this bill, which also  has not been talked about enough, is they want to provide universal  preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. Not only that, they want to make sure  that the preschools not be run by religious entities--kind of letting  the cat out of the bag. They want to make sure that, insofar as the 3-  and 4-year-olds were taught anything, it not be any religious values.   Again, in America, the raising of the children is supposed to be  something done by the parents. The family is supposed to be preeminent  in raising the children. Even in my lifetime, the kindergartners have  gone from, at least in Wisconsin, half-day 5-year-old kindergarten to  all-day 5-year-old kindergarten to half-day 4-year-old kindergarten.   We now are, in one fell swoop, having the Federal Government, which  under the Constitution should have nothing to do with this whatsoever  anyway, going all the way down to the government raising the 3- and 4- year-olds.   It is a fundamental change in how much influence the parents have on  their children and should be resisted, not resisted for the cost,  although the cost is a good reason to resist it, but resisted because  it is contrary to the profamily values that our ancestors felt we would  have.   The fifth thing that I would like to talk about in this bill is it is  apparent the authors want a lot more government surveillance of what  people are doing.   President Biden on his own recently proposed monitoring every $600  transfer. Eventually, he had to back off under public criticism. He is  now at $10,000. But you know if he could get back down to 600 bucks, he  would do it in a heartbeat.   Why would the government care if I cashed a $600 check? I can imagine  in today's world why they would care. Maybe they want to monitor me.  Maybe they want to see what type of church I am contributing money to.  Maybe they want to see if I am purchasing a firearm. Maybe they want to  see if I am giving money to a magazine or giving money to a political  party, maybe a magazine espousing politically incorrect beliefs. Maybe  they want to look at whether I give any money to a political party that  may be out of favor in a few years.   I think it is appalling that anybody would think that it is up to the  government to see exactly where I am spending my money. We all know it  is going for only bad purposes.   But in this bill, there is another item that hasn't been talked about  enough, and that is the majority party wants to hire another 85,000 IRS  agents--85,000. I think that is bigger than the average NFL stadium. It  is about one of the big college stadiums. I went to the University of  Wisconsin. It is about the size of filling up Camp Randall, 85,000  agents.   Of course, what is the purpose of those agents? To go around and  monitor people's tax returns, to poke around, look for receipts, make  adjustments, make guesses to what your income actually should be. It is  clearly a different sort of country if you have 85,000. I wouldn't  bring this up if it was 1,000 new agents, but 85,000 new IRS agents.   It sounds like proportionately we are headed, again, toward more of a  surveillance state, toward less of a free state. It is the vision,  sadly, of the majority party.   I want to review them one more time. I hope the American public, when  they look at this bill, does pay attention to the bottom line. There is  going to be more inflation, higher costs on the heat bill, no question  about it. But regardless of the amount of money, this is a document put  together by people who want to encourage illegal immigration all the  way down to giving free college to people who come here. It is a party  that wants to increase welfare benefits, benefits that are conditioned  upon not working too much and certainly not marrying a person with a  respectable income. It is a party that wants to further entrench in the  American psyche the idea that we have to have different programs based  on sex, different programs based on race, and people ought to ask what  you are going give me because I am from this group or what you are  going to give me because I am a woman, rather than treating all  Americans the same.   It is a bill that is put out with an ideal of the government raising  the children instead of the parents, more responsibility for raising  the children instead of the parents--again, something that I think  would have stunned our forefathers.   Finally, it is a bill put together by people who want to hire a lot  of new government employees to monitor what is going on.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote against the bill, and I  strongly encourage the American public to familiarize themselves with  not only the size of the cost of the bill but the degree to which we  are fundamentally changing the way Americans live.   Now, I am going to speak one more time on an issue which I will try  to highlight later this week or next week. We have a big COVID problem  in this country, and obviously, a lot of money is being spent on  vaccines and a lot of money is going to educating people.   It is my opinion that not enough attention has been paid to what we  can do to cure COVID if you get COVID, be it vaccinated or  unvaccinated.   Months, maybe even a year ago now, some Israeli researchers  discovered that fenofibrate, a generic drug that has been used to treat  high cholesterol, has tremendous potential success in curing COVID.   More recently, they found 15 people who not only had had COVID but  had pneumonia and were on oxygen. I would say if somebody had COVID  with pneumonia and was on oxygen, they were in bad shape. They gave  them this generic drug, which was freely used for over 40 years in this  country for high cholesterol, and 14 of the 15 patients were out of the  hospital in 4 days. The other guy was out in 2 weeks. In other words,  it sounds like a cure.   I have been trying to get the CDC to push--they put a little money  into it--but push more money into this program for research to see  whether or not we would have a cure. I have been told by the  researchers to this day that the CDC would try a little bit harder, and  there is a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania looking into  this. But if you really want to say it is successful, you want to find  at least 700 subjects or patients. It is hard to find that many people  without help from the CDC, particularly if you don't have the big money  of the drug companies behind you.   Right now, our researcher at the University of Pennsylvania has about  350 people. He likes to believe that, by the end of March, he will be  able to make a definitive statement that fenofibrate would be able to  cure COVID for under 50 cents a day.                                time  1845    Wouldn't that be wonderful. And not only does it cure COVID, but if  you get COVID it will be much less serious. And right now, long-term  COVID, even if you are cured, can result in long-term health problems  otherwise.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to encourage the Center for  Disease Control to look at COVID, see what they can do about coming up  with another 300 or 400 people for a definitive study and then rush--if  the study winds up as well as we think it will--rush out and educate  these doctors to prescribe it because it is entirely possible it will  greatly reduce the number of people with long-term COVID and the number  of people dying.   Again, if anybody at the CDC is listening, I hope you take advantage  of  [[Page H6316]]  this tip. And otherwise, me and my colleagues will sign a letter  including a little more action from the CDC, because if we found a cure  for COVID we wouldn't have to worry about all the other controversial  issues that are so damaging to our country and taking away our  freedoms.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
