 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2726, which  simply codifies existing internal policy at Amtrak that prohibits  smoking or use of electronic cigarettes on Amtrak's trains.   Amtrak instituted this policy in 1993 and has since updated it to  address the use of electronic smoking devices. I think this is very  important.   Last year, we addressed a similar gap in the code and included a  provision in the FAA Reauthorization Act to prohibit the use of  electronic cigarettes on airplanes.   This bill once again puts Congress on the record as supporting  protections for the traveling public from the risk of secondhand smoke.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2548) to modify eligibility requirements for certain hazard  mitigation assistance programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2548         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hazard Eligibility and Local       Projects Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF ACQUISITION OR                     RELOCATION PROJECTS.         (a) Eligibility for Assistance for Initiated Projects.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, an entity seeking assistance under a hazard mitigation       assistance program shall be eligible to receive such       assistance for a covered project if the entity--        (A) complies with all other eligibility requirements of the       hazard mitigation assistance program for acquisition or       relocation projects, including extinguishing all incompatible       encumbrances; and        (B) complies with all Federal requirements for the project.        (2) Costs incurred.--An entity seeking assistance under a       hazard mitigation assistance program shall be responsible for       any project costs incurred by the entity for a covered       project if the covered project is not awarded, or is       determined to be ineligible for, assistance.        (b) Definitions.--In this section, the following       definitions apply:        (1) Covered project.--The term ``covered project'' means--        (A) an acquisition or relocation project for which an       entity began implementation prior to grant award under a       hazard mitigation assistance program; and        (B) a project for which an entity initiated planning or       construction before or after requesting assistance for the       project under a hazard mitigation assistance program       qualifying for a categorical exemption under the National       Environmental Policy Act.        (2) Hazard mitigation assistance program.--The term       ``hazard mitigation assistance program'' means--        (A) the predisaster hazard mitigation grant program       authorized under section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       5133);        (B) the hazard mitigation grant program authorized under       section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and       Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c); and        (C) the flood mitigation assistance program authorized       under section 1366 of the National Flood Insurance Act of       1968 (42 U.S.C. 4104c).        (c) Applicability.--This section shall apply to funds       appropriated on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2548, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to bring my bill, H.R. 2548, the Hazard  Eligibility and Local Projects, or HELP, Act to the floor today.   I am proud of the HELP Act and all that it represents. It is  bipartisan, commonsense, meaningful legislation that was born out of  conversations and a partnership with local officials in my home  district that will benefit all Americans.   As many in this body will recall, Hurricane Harvey hit my district  and the Texas Gulf Coast in August 2017, causing great devastation. It  dropped nearly 60 inches of rain, it claimed 68 lives, and it caused an  estimated $125 billion in damage. It was the second most expensive  hurricane in United States history.   Members of this body responded to Harvey's devastation with the speed  and purpose needed for recovery, passing three supplemental  appropriations bills, sending billions of dollars in aid to Texas  through different programs, but recovery was and is still slow, slower  than many expected, and slower than any can afford.   Before I was sworn in this year, I met with our local officials at  home to talk about the impediments to recovery: How could we speed up  recovery? Where was recovery delayed? What could the Federal Government  do?   One impediment that had a significant impact on recovery was the  process for the award of mitigation project funding from FEMA.   As my colleagues may know, section 404 of the Stafford Act provides  that FEMA may grant up to 75 percent of funds for cost-effective  mitigation projects through a Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Local  municipalities, States, and Tribes are responsible for meeting the  remaining local match. Their projects must be approved through FEMA.   When States or municipalities apply to the grant program, projects,  regardless of size or scope, require a comprehensive review to make  sure all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA,  and other statutory requirements are met.   Importantly, these Hazard Mitigation Grants do not allow for  reimbursement of costs incurred before a grant is approved. As a  result, many areas recovering from disaster must wait for the FEMA  review to go forward for months or years at a critical time for  decisionmaking and recovery.   In the case of natural disasters, local governments need to move  quickly on projects like land acquisition, for example, buyouts of  homes that have been damaged, and other projects.   The chief recovery officer for the city of Houston has told us that  FEMA's pre-award cost policy, that is, not allowing the reimbursement  of costs incurred before grant approval, is a limiting factor in  recovery, especially in these cases of land acquisition.   Homeowners simply cannot afford to wait months or years for decisions  to make their own decisions about whether to repair their homes or  whether to take a buyout of the homes, and the result is not only  inefficiency, but real hardship.   For example, the Harris County Flood Control District received $25  million from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to conduct buyouts to  reduce flood damages in areas located deep in the floodplain where  structural projects to reduce flooding are not cost effective or  beneficial.   But that was nearly a year after Hurricane Harvey that that grant  money was awarded. It took a year because of the review period required  at FEMA for all applications.   Most homeowners simply do not have the luxury of waiting a year or  more to begin repairs or to decide what to do.   Many would be open to a buyout, but funds aren't available, so  instead, they take out an SBA loan or other loans to begin repairs. And  if you already owe money on loans or repairs to your house, a buyout is  no longer an attractive option or even an option at all.   Once a property owner has repaired their property, the less likely a  buyout is a viable path forward for that individual and for the  community.   It is not just anecdotal evidence. The data shows that, for  acquisition buyouts, the quicker you can make an offer to buy out  property after a flooding event, the more likely the disaster victim is  to accept it and the more it reduces costs overall.   The quicker local governments are able to move, the more people they  can help, and the more resources can be leveraged for recovery.   Having a one-size-fits-all approach to reviewing projects through the  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is not efficient or effective. It  needlessly delays critical mitigation work.   So that is where the idea for the HELP Act came in.   The HELP Act will allow land acquisition projects and simple  construction projects that do not require an Environmental Impact  Statement under  [[Page H10277]]  NEPA to commence immediately without risk of losing potential Federal  matching funds.   This will allow State and local governments to respond more quickly  to the needs of their community and to plan disaster mitigation more  efficiently and effectively.   It is simple, it is straightforward, and it is needed.   At home, I hear a consistent concern that Federal disaster money  moves at a glacial pace.   This bill addresses some of that and will be a real improvement for  communities across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues Mr. Meadows, Mr. Olson, and Mr.  Butterfield, my original cosponsors who worked with me on this bill. I  also want to thank all of the cosponsors of the bill who helped in the  effort, in addition to Chairman DeFazio and Chairwoman Titus, whose  assistance in bringing this bill to the floor was essential.   Disaster mitigation is not and should never be a partisan issue.   I am glad to see the bipartisan consensus in support of this bill and  that we can address these inefficiencies and these real impediments  where they exist.   There is still much work to do when it comes to preparing for future  storms that we know will come, but I am hopeful that the HELP Act will  aid State and local governments when they do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation and help our families, businesses, and communities recover  from disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4719, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4719.   This bill reestablishes a more gracious 75 percent non-Federal match  requirement for grants to support fishing safety training and research  programs to improve the safety of U.S. commercial fishing fleets.   Commercial fishing is one of the United States' most dangerous  occupations, with a fatality rate nearly 30 times higher than the  national average. Workers in the industry can face a wide variety of  hazards, depending on the vessel or fishery.   Research and training to address best practices for a specific fleet  and/or region are critical to ensure U.S. fishermen are receiving the  best possible information and training before they depart the pier.  There have been some recent successes in reducing fatal workplace  injuries within the commercial fishing industry, but targeted safety  research and training remain necessary and essential to maintain that  downward trend.   Over 23,000 commercial fishers work in the Gulf of Mexico. By  providing fishers, NGOs, academia, and businesses with access to  targeted Federal safety research and training grants, we are ensuring  that commercial fishing remains not only a career choice for Texans but  a less risky pursuit, as well.   This bipartisan bill was introduced by Representative Golden and has  attracted bipartisan cosponsors among other Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee members, including Representatives Young,  Pappas, and Pingree.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4719, and I urge my colleagues to join me  in passing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, believe this is commonsense  legislation, and I am pleased to see it brought to the floor today. I  support H.R. 4719, and I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this  important, bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3362) to amend title 49, United State Code, to require small  hub airports to construct areas for nursing mothers, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3362         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Airport Mothers' Rooms       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. MOTHERS' ROOMS.         Section 47107(w) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1) by striking ``In fiscal year 2021''       and all that follows through ``the Secretary of       Transportation'' and inserting ``The Secretary of       Transportation'';        (2) in paragraph (1)(B) by striking ``one men's and one       women's'' and inserting ``at least one men's and at least one       women's'';        (3) by striking paragraph (2)(A) and inserting the       following:        ``(A) Airport size.--The requirements in paragraph (1)       shall only apply to applications submitted by the airport       sponsor of--        ``(i) a medium or large hub airport in fiscal year 2021 and       each fiscal year thereafter; and        ``(ii) a small hub airport in fiscal year 2023 and each       fiscal year thereafter, but only if such airport has been       categorized as a small or medium hub airport for the 3       consecutive fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in which       the application is submitted.'';        (4) in paragraph (2)(B) by striking ``the date of enactment       of this Act complies with the requirement in paragraph (1)''       and inserting ``October 5, 2018, complies with the       requirement in paragraph (1)(A)''; and        (5) in paragraph (2)(C) by striking ``paragraph (1)'' and       inserting ``paragraph (1)(A)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3362, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill introduced by the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).   Few things are more sacred than the ability of parents to care for  their infant children. However, mothers often face challenges, and  potentially public stigma, when attempting to breastfeed, nurse, or  change their children while traveling. In fact, a study of 100 airports  found that, while 62 percent reported being breastfeeding friendly,  only 8 percent met the minimum requirements for a breastfeeding mother:  an electrical outlet, a table, and a chair.   The absence of sufficient designated sanitary spaces during travel  can cause unnecessary stress, wasted time, and even potential health  issues for mothers who are not able to pump.   The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a requirement that  medium and large hub airports maintain nursing rooms and baby changing  tables for the convenience of nursing mothers and parents traveling  with infants. While that was a step in the right direction, there are  still a significant number of commercial service airports--72, to be  exact--that the law did not cover.   This bill enhances that mandate by requiring small hub airports to  also maintain nursing rooms and baby changing tables in their passenger  terminal buildings. Requiring small hub airports to provide private,  clean, accessible, and equipped areas for parents to nurse their  children will help remove some of the barriers parents face while  traveling and provide critical support to families when they need it.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank my colleague, Mrs. Miller,  for introducing this bill. And I thank Chairman DeFazio and the  subcommittee chairman, Mr. Larsen, for moving this bill through the  process. It is important to families across America.   And, once again, we are seeing bipartisan, commonsense legislation  that is important to traveling families. For that reason, I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
