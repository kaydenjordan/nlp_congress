 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed some light on the  total hypocrisy of the Democrats' Save the Internet Act under the guise  of net neutrality.   This bill is nothing short of a Federal Government takeover of the  internet, and the end result would be catastrophic. Democrats want a  panel of unelected bureaucrats to have nearly limitless control over  the internet, including decisions over content moderation and imposing  new taxes and fees for internet services by the FCC.   To be clear, they would like the Federal Government to have nearly  unchecked authority to regulate your internet. That should terrify  those of you sitting at home.   This goes against everything that made the internet such a  transformative engine of the American economy in the first place. In  fact, this type of regulatory approach would cripple smaller ISPs that  can't afford the burdensome regulations, especially in rural  communities.   I believe in a free and open internet that fosters innovation and  takes our economy to new heights, like we have reached already. This  legislation will do the opposite of that.   This isn't ``Save the Internet.'' We must vote ``no'' to save the  internet process and the freedom to access it from legislation like  this.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Dunn  from Florida, for leading us in this Special Order tonight and  providing this opportunity to talk about a very important aspect of our  job together as it affects our different regions and our States across  the country.   This is an important opportunity to highlight, in my own district,  our critical need for disaster funding in California, as well as the  success stories we have had in the past, but, also, the needs of my  colleagues in the Southern States and now, unfortunately, too, in the  Midwest, my colleagues from Nebraska.   Unfortunately, it appears that we will head into a 2-week recess now  without the Senate doing their half of the job in this Congress and  sending a relief package to the House that is so desperately needed--a  real shame.   This comes after the Senate Democrats rejected the latest attempts by  Republicans to reach a compromise. It highlights one common trend I  have seen so far in this Congress that Democrats are not interested in  good faith negotiations with Republicans. They say all or nothing; take  it or leave it.   We have got two different Houses. One has a majority of one and the  other has a majority of the other. We are going to have to come  together a lot if we are going to get anything done in this Congress.  What we have right now is no way to govern.   Disasters take a substantial toll on many areas of the country. In my  own district, 2 years ago was the spillway disaster at Oroville on the  Oroville Dam. Now, with 2 years of good work, that spillway is now back  functioning once again, rebuilt with a heck of a lot of money and a lot  of people coordinating to get it done quickly.   We just saw, in the last few days, 25,000 cfs of water is coming over  that spillway in order for the lake to be regulated safely and  accurately for flood control as well as storing water that we need  through the year.   Unfortunately, that isn't the last disaster in northern California.  We had two more on top of that: near Redding, California, what is known  as the Carr fire--a firenado, they labeled it--doing so much  devastation on the west side there; then, ultimately, in November, 2  days after the election, in Paradise, California--we have all heard  about that--a whole town basically has disappeared in that fire, in  that conflagration, destroying, again, thousands of homes and  buildings, and dozens of people were lost in that.   The Camp fire and the areas around it--Concow, Magalia--they will be  recovering for quite some time. Thankfully, we have had help, and we  are thankful for that. We are thankful for the funding for the Oroville  Dam spillway. We are thankful for the help initially here for the Carr  fire in Redding and for the Camp fire in Paradise.    But, for all the combined diasters we are looking at--Mr. Scott in  Georgia, who still needs help, and my other colleagues--we have to have  a stable flow into the coffers for our disaster relief that is so  desperately needed all over the country.   Why isn't the Senate doing its job? With all that has happened in our  home State of California, why is the junior Senator from California  more worried about, 2 years ahead of the election, spending all the  time in the other 49 States campaigning instead of showing up to vote  on the relief measure when the Senate considered it last week and the  House passed a version of it back in December?   It appears that Senator has more important things to do. I hope  Californians will remember that for a lot of reasons.   The Camp fire in Paradise was the deadliest and most destructive  wildfire in California's history, the deadliest in our country for over  100 years.   It is time for the Senate Democrats to quit fooling around with  political games and get this disaster assistance in place, not just for  me but for all my colleagues around the country who have people they  are responsible for and need to get the work done.   We have done our job in the House. D.C. must do its job overall, the  Senate included.                                time  1800
