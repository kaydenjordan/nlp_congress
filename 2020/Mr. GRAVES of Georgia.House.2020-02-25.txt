 Madam Speaker, let me first thank Chairman  Kilmer for his great work. How he has led this committee has been  remarkable and an example for all committees, so I thank him for that  example.   Madam Speaker, I rise today not only to commend my good friend from  Washington State, but to echo his remarks and also the pride and the  joy that each of us on the committee share in the work that has been  done.   I guess tonight I am representing the six Republican members of this  completely bipartisan committee, and we have all committed to work  together in a great way. So, on behalf of our side, I thank the  chairman for his good work.   In the last year, as Mr. Kilmer shared, we have passed 45  recommendations to make Congress work better for the American people.  Now, he has highlighted the way we have worked together to get that job  done, and I want to commend him for leading us in an environment of  bipartisanship and true collaboration. It is through his commitment to  success and thinking outside of the box that we have been able to break  the mold and to get this job done. This is an opportunity that comes  around about every couple of decades, and to see the work that the  chairman has done and how he has led this committee is really a great  thing to be a part of.   When the select committee first started, we chose to work together  and combine our resources as one team. Instead of separating the staff  and office by party line, we chose to just join together and work to  get the job done as one team.   As Mr. Kilmer often says: We decided to put the committee not in red  jerseys and in blue jerseys but, instead, ``fix Congress'' jerseys.  Thanks to him, this experiment has created a bipartisanship bond of  trust and collaboration unlike anything I have seen in my 10 years here  in Congress.   In fact, our committee was only supposed to last for 1 year, through  2019.  [[Page H1186]]  But thanks to the support of our colleagues throughout the House, from  freshman Members to Republican Study Committee members, to House  leadership in both parties, to the new Democrat members of that Caucus  and many other caucuses, we were able to get our committee extended  through the end of this Congress.    Now, I know I speak for both of us when I say that we are grateful  for the opportunity to build on last year's work and dive a little bit  deeper into the issues affecting the legislative branch. Every  recommendation we make aims to strengthen the capacity of the House so  that we can better serve all Americans.   Our goal is simple. It was something we set out early on in an early  retreat that we had together. The goal is simple, but it is critical,  and that is we are to make Congress work better for the American  people. It is that simple but yet that critical.   So, as the chairman shared, our first round of transparency-focused  recommendations in May aimed to ``open up'' Congress for the American  people. The work we do here in Washington is for our constituents, and  they should be able to easily access information about our votes, about  the bills and who is lobbying Congress.   What happens here should just be a click away, as the chairman said a  minute ago, just one click, one-stop shopping. We want to make sure  that the American people can truly view the inner workings of Congress.   While exploring ways to improve transparency and access, we heard  from many of our colleagues and staff about the need for better  technology and better processes here in the House. This also included  giving offices the flexibility to hire more staff and to meet the needs  of their constituents, as it is individual in each and every office.   We also recommended creating a Congressional Leadership Academy to  offer training for Members, not just any ordinary training, but  professional development training, because each and every Member  deserves that opportunity to better prepare themselves in how to manage  their offices and better represent their districts.   Every day that we are here, we should be asking the questions and  learning about the issues that matter most to our constituents.  Continued learning is an important part and an important piece of our  representation here in Congress.   Another one of our recommendations that I think is incredibly  important is that Members of Congress should receive mandatory  cybersecurity training. Now, this idea came from one of our colleagues  on our Member listening day, Miss Kathleen Rice from New York. She has  a bill that requires this practice, and it is something that we have  pushed forward as a recommendation in the House. Congressional staff  must undergo cybersecurity training, so our thought is that Members of  Congress should do the same.   In September, we held a hearing to discuss improving civility  throughout the Halls of Congress. At times, it felt like we were going  against the grain just a bit on this issue. Recommendations on civility  and bipartisanship are not something that I think the American people  have heard from much here in Congress, but I think that is why this  committee's work matters so much.   Even during times of division, we have to find a path forward. We  recommended creating a bipartisan, Members-only space here in the  Capitol to encourage more collaboration across party lines and  instituting biennial bipartisan retreats for Members and their families  at the start of each Congress so that Members and their families can  begin to get to know each other.   I have often said that the breakdown in civility and bipartisanship  here in Washington is because of the breakdown in relationships; and,  in fact, maybe it is because many relationships haven't even begun yet.  So it is important that we can talk to each other but, most  importantly, that we can listen to one another.   So when it comes to communicating, we recognize the importance of  good, robust communication with the American people as well. That is  why we recommended increasing opportunities for constituents to  communicate with their Representatives and allowing for faster  correspondence between our offices and our constituents.                                time  1745    Now, we aren't finished yet. We have more work to do before the year  is over. And I can think of no better capstone to my legislative career  than to leave Congress in better shape for future Representatives.   Through the partnership of this committee with the Committee on House  Administration, we have crafted legislation that will turn our  bipartisan recommendations into results. This ongoing work is so  important because it is the first time a committee like ours has seen  its work move through the legislative process in this way.   So, as I close, no idea is too big or too small, and we encourage  everyone to continue sharing their ideas with us to reform Congress.  Together, we are giving the House a roadmap for a brighter future, and  it wouldn't be possible without the great leadership of Chairman  Kilmer.
