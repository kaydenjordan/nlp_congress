 Madam Speaker, I rise today to object to this ridiculous,  wasteful spending that my colleagues from across the aisle are trying  to ram through with this proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.   We have real needs in this country, but instead of addressing them,  the Democrats are attempting to spend somewhere around $3.5 trillion on  social programs, Green New Deal mandates, and all kinds of junk that  adds up.   If you were to take and stack up $3.5 trillion in $1 bills, you would  have a total of 250,000 miles of bills. That is how tall it would be.   This is unacceptable. It is totally ridiculous. It is absolutely  absurd to consider spending that much money in an area that we are just  beginning to get involved in, which is green energy.   It would be one thing if money was going to actually improve this  country in a massive way. You might see some support from the  Republican side. You might even see some of your own Democrats coming  back to your own party. But as we all know, there are things in this  bill that are horrible.                                time  2030    I want to just mention three of them very briefly:   One, we are throwing trillions of dollars at this ridiculous Green  New Deal mandate. We are going to mandate things on corporations and on  people they cannot afford. We are going to break the back of small  businesses. It is coming.   Two, we are spending billions of dollars to expand the numbers in the  IRS--88,000 new IRS agents. Those agents aren't going to separate us  from being Democrats and Republicans. All they are looking at is a  dollar figure.   Madam Speaker, I propose to you there is going to be some blowback on  that. You are giving them the right to spy on every American in this  country, and that is wrong. It is wrong. We shouldn't fear our  government. We shouldn't fear the IRS. They should fear us because we  are the taxpayer; we are the people.   Three, it will direct taxpayers' dollars directly to perform and to  promote abortion. Never has that ever been done in this country before.  That is going to be a game changer.   Madam Speaker, I suggest to you there is a tsunami coming up in 2022  because the American people are upset.   This bill will also increase taxes and the cost of living of  everyday, hardworking Americans. Again, this is unacceptable.   We are nearly $30 trillion in debt. Inflation has risen every month  that President Biden has been in office, and Americans across this  country are seeing their cost of living skyrocket. In my small  community I am looking at gas at $1 more a gallon. You can't reach into  a hardworking American's pocket, Madam Speaker, without feeling their  gas money, and when they have to give a dollar more a gallon, they are  going to remember that.   Let me just remind my colleagues from across the aisle, the American  people are fed up with this foolishness. I promise you, Madam Speaker,  they will remember in 2022. That tsunami is coming. I have spent a lot  of time trying to make a lot of friends on the Democratic side. I think  it is extremely important for this House to work together and not  against one another, but if you follow this administration off this  cliff, there is no return. The American people are going to turn on the  people who voted for it. It is time to get serious about fiscal  responsibility and learn to live within our means.   Or is it too late?   Our children and our grandchildren deserve better than this, and I  will not stand by and watch this country mortgage our future.   Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We collect  plenty of money, it is just how we spend it. We have got to learn to  cut back. It is reckless and irresponsible for this body to continue  throwing trillions of dollars around like there is nothing to it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  oppose this terrible $3.5 trillion wreck bill, as I love to call it.
