 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1433) to reauthorize the Helen Keller National  Center for Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1433         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helen Keller National Center       Reauthorization Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER REAUTHORIZED.         The first sentence of section 205(a) of the Helen Keller       National Center Act (29 U.S.C. 1904(a)) is amended by       striking ``1999 through 2003'' and inserting ``2023 through       2027''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1433, the Helen Keller  National Center Reauthorization Act of 2022.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1433, the Helen Keller  National Center Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize the Helen  Keller National Center for 5 years.   The Helen Keller National Center for Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf- Blind was first authorized by Congress in 1967 to assist the deaf-blind  community in America.   To this day, it is the only comprehensive national program that  provides information, referrals, support, and training exclusively to  Americans who have combined vision and hearing loss, while also  supporting families and professionals who work with the deaf-blind  community.   Moreover, the Helen Keller National Center is the only comprehensive  national program that provides for information, referral, support, and  training exclusively to youth and adults who have combined vision and  hearing loss. The center also supports families and professionals who  work with the deaf-blind community.   Thankfully, through our actions today, we will be one step closer to  reauthorizing the center's important work through 2027.   The Helen Keller center performs life-changing work. This work and  the population it serves deserve all of our support.   Lastly, I thank the sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), and the cosponsors, the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi), and the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), for their leadership on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the American  deaf-blind community and support this bipartisan legislation before us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi), a cosponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help members of the deaf-blind  community across the country. I thank the gentleman from New York for  his leadership, along with the sponsors and cosponsors of the  legislation. I am proud that the House is considering this legislation  today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 3157) to require the Secretary of Labor to conduct a  study of the factors affecting employment opportunities for immigrants  and refugees with professional credentials obtained in foreign  countries.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 3157, the Bridging the  Gap for New Americans Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, each year, millions of immigrants and refugees come to  the United States to find a better life and achieve the American Dream.  Many of these new Americans arrive with valuable experiences in  specialized fields and international degrees that could help strengthen  our communities and our economy.   Regrettably, we know that these Americans face barriers that prevent  them from utilizing their skills and credentials to contribute to our  country and pursue their careers. In fact, nearly 2 million highly  skilled immigrants are underemployed or working in low-skilled jobs  instead of their expert fields.   These barriers directly affect our economy, costing tens of billions  of dollars in forgone wages and billions in lost Federal, State, and  local tax payments each year.   In response, the Bridging the Gap for New Americans Act will help us  better understand not only the employment barriers facing immigrants  and refugees but also steps we can take to ensure that new Americans  can join our economic growth and pursue careers in which they can  succeed to their fullest potential.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H7913]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have pointed out, the Bridging the Gap  for New Americans Act is particularly critical as we continue to  recover from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now,  more than ever, we must draw from the skills of our Nation's immigrants  and refugees to accelerate our recovery and strengthen our communities.   In other words, this bill will ensure that the new Americans can re- establish their careers, succeed to their full potential, and join the  effort to build back a brighter future for all Americans.   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sempolinski), the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko), the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), and the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), as well as Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota,  Senator Cornyn of Texas, Senator Coons of Delaware, and Senator  Murkowski from Alaska, for their leadership on this legislative  priority.   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I thank her for her good work.   Madam Speaker, the people, the American people deserve a government  that puts people over politics and protects hardworking families, not  billionaires and special interests. That is why, throughout the 117th  Congress, the House Education and Labor Committee has advanced  legislation that meets the needs of students, families, workers, and  our economy.   Over the last 2 years, Congressional Democrats and the Biden-Harris  administration have made historic progress to rescue the American  economy, create good-paying jobs, get students back on track, fight  child hunger, and boost access to healthcare.   Just in the Education and Labor Committee, there was a lot that was  done. We helped create over 10 million jobs in our economy since  January 2021: the most jobs in history for 20 months. We recovered all  of the jobs lost during the pandemic. We reduced unemployment to  historically low levels.   We saved the pensions of over 1 million workers, and protected  thousands of businesses by saving the multiemployer pension fund.   We delivered the largest one-time Federal investment to K-12  education in the United States history. And we delivered that money and  distributed it according to the Title I formula where poverty is the  main factor, meaning that the districts that need it the most got the  most. Those that are traditionally overlooked got more money than they  have ever gotten before.                                time  2000    We put money into school lunches so that students didn't go hungry  during that period of time. We made sure that, with that money, the  schools could open safely, stay open safely, and make up for lost  learning. During that period of time, during the COVID relief bills, we  had more money for historically Black colleges and universities than we  ever have in history.   Now, we also made sure that the number of Americans without health  insurance, because of the actions that we have taken, is now the lowest  it has ever been. We have made sure that they can get vaccines, and  those vaccines were distributed equitably. That is not always the case.   We made sure that drug prices were down, particularly insulin for  seniors, no more than $35 per month for insulin. A lot of people right  now before this bill were paying a lot more than that.   That is just the kind of legislation that came through the Education  and Labor Committee. But House Democrats and the Congressional Black  Caucus are committed to continuing this historic progress and building  back a stronger economy for all Americans. That is why we passed the  bipartisan infrastructure law, which not only modernized roads,  bridges, and waterways, but will also create millions of good-paying  jobs and will deliver broadband to areas that don't have broadband  today. We will invest in neighborhoods that were destroyed by previous  transportation plans going right down the middle of African-  [[Page H7950]]  American neighborhoods, and we will invest in those neighborhoods to  try to make up for that devastation.   Moving forward, we are committed to committee work, advancing  policies like the Raise the Wage Act, the Protecting the Right to  Organize Act, the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act, the Strength in  Diversity Act, and the Rebuild America's Schools Act to ensure that  every worker, student, and family has the opportunity to succeed.   We have done a lot. We haven't finished.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her leadership  and the opportunity to remind the American public of what we have  already accomplished.
