 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Coach Jim Valvano, known  to basketball fans everywhere as ``Jimmy V.''   Forty years ago this month, the beloved NC State head coach led his  underdog team to the 1983 NCAA championship. Against the odds, the  Wolfpack triumphed over number one seed Houston with a game-winning  dunk in the final seconds.   Coach Valvano's spirit has inspired so many on and off the court. He  is also remembered for his dedication to finding a cure for cancer  after his own diagnosis.   While he lost his battle with the disease, Jimmy V never stopped  fighting for others. Today, his legacy lives on through the V  Foundation for Cancer Research.   This week, as North Carolinians are watching the ACC tournament, we  are reminded of Coach Valvano's inspirational words: ``Don't give up.  Don't ever give up.'' Go, Pack.                            ____________________
