 Mr. President, Americans have been hurting under  ObamaCare. Senators took a big step toward moving beyond its failures  with the motion-to-proceed vote earlier this week. It allowed the  Senate to proceed with this important debate. It allowed the Senate to  work through an open amendment process.   Senators have considered proposals already, including some procedural  motions from across the aisle. Senators will have the opportunity to  consider many, many more amendments tonight. I know that colleagues in  both parties are eager to do so.   I encourage Senators with healthcare ideas--whether Republicans,  Democrats, or Independents--to bring their amendments to the floor. We  have heard many different ideas on healthcare in recent months. Not  every idea, of course, is a good one.   One idea from the Democratic leader is simply to throw money at  insurance companies--no reforms, no changes, just a multimillion-dollar  bandaid.   Another idea from many other Democrats is to quadruple down on  ObamaCare with a government-run single-payer system. It is called  single payer because there is one payer, or insurer, the government.  Nearly every healthcare decision would be directed by a Federal  bureaucrat. Taxes could go up astronomically. The total cost could add  up to $32 trillion, according to an estimate of a leading proposal.   We will vote on single payer this afternoon, and we will find out  what support it enjoys in the Senate--especially on the other side of  the aisle. We all know this is likely to be a very long night. It is  part of a long process that has taken a lot of hard work from a lot of  dedicated colleagues already.   One phase of that process will end when the Senate concludes voting  this week, but it will not signal the end of our work--not yet.  Ultimately, the goal is to send legislation from Congress to the  President--legislation that can finally move us beyond ObamaCare's  years of failures.   The President is ready to sign legislation. Congress will keep  working to pass it because we know the American people deserve better  than ObamaCare. They deserve better than ObamaCare and its skyrocketing  costs. They deserve better than ObamaCare and its plummeting choices.  They deserve better than the job-killing regulations, crushing  mandates, and collapsing markets ObamaCare has given them.   We all know this. We all know that the ObamaCare status quo hasn't  been working for the people we represent. We have known it for  literally years.   Many of us committed to voting for a better way on healthcare. That  is what every Senator who supported the motion to proceed voted for on  Tuesday.   Let's finish our work. Let's not allow this opportunity to slip by.  We have made important progress already. We can build on it now.   The moment before us is one many of us have waited for and talked  about for a very long time. It is a moment that can't come soon enough  for the people we represent. I urge everyone to keep working hard so we  can get this over the finish line. It is what our constituents and our  country deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this is becoming overly complicated.  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I are talking about  what comes next after we finish the healthcare debate. As we discussed  in my office a few moments ago, the chairman would like to turn to NDAA  next. Healthcare, whether our friends on the other side like it or not,  will come to a conclusion here at some point. The issue is what comes  next.   As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has pointed out, this  is a totally separate issue and, as he pointed out, a bill that came  out of his committee 27 to 0. As we all know, he is available to manage  that bill this week.   What I am saying to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle is when  we  [[Page S4355]]  finish healthcare either the way I would like to finish it or the way  our Democratic friends would like to finish it, we are going to try to  turn to NDAA and accommodate the chairman's schedule and give him an  opportunity to finish that bill while he is here. That is the issue.   So I hope we will be able to work our way toward that when we finish  healthcare. I will ask unanimous consent--not now, but I will be asking  for unanimous consent to turn to the National Defense Authorization  Act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 667.    Mr. President, the legislation I just laid down is  called the Health Care Freedom Act, and it restores freedom to  Americans that ObamaCare took away. It does so in a number of ways.   First, the Health Care Freedom Act repeals the core pillars of  ObamaCare. It eliminates the so-called individual mandate that forces  many Americans to buy ObamaCare insurance they don't want, can't  afford, or can't use, and taxes those who don't. It also repeals the  employer mandate that cuts hours, take-home pay, and job opportunities  for workers.   Second, the Health Care Freedom Act provides significant new  flexibility to States. The Health Care Freedom Act gives States just  the kind of flexibility they need to implement reforms that provide  more options for consumers to buy the health insurance they actually  want. These reforms also help make insurance more affordable and  flexible so it is something Americans actually want to buy.   Finally, the Health Care Freedom Act frees Americans from ObamaCare  in several other ways too. It provides 3 years of relief from the  medical device tax, which increases costs, hurts innovation, and has  drawn significant criticism from both sides of the aisle. It expands,  for 3 years, the contribution limits to health savings accounts so  Americans can better manage their health costs and pay down more of  their medical expenses like prescriptions with pretax dollars.   Also, the legislation will prioritize funding for women's health  through community health centers instead of large abortion providers  and political organizations.   The American people have suffered under ObamaCare for too long. It is  time to end the failed status quo. It is time to send legislation to  the President which will finally move our country beyond the failures  of ObamaCare. Passing this legislation will allow us to work with our  colleagues in the House toward a final bill that could go to the  President, repeal ObamaCare, and undo its damage.   I urge everyone to support it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray or her  designee be recognized to offer a motion to commit; further, that the  remaining time be equally divided between the managers or their  designees.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 1628  be returned to the calendar.    Mr. President, this is clearly a disappointing moment.  From skyrocketing costs to plummeting choices and collapsing markets,  our constituents have suffered through an awful lot under ObamaCare. We  thought they deserved better. That is why I and many of my colleagues  did as we promised and voted to repeal this failed law. We told our  constituents we would vote that way, and when the moment came, most of  us did. We kept our commitments. We worked hard, and everybody on this  side can certainly attest to the fact that we worked really hard and  tried to develop a consensus for a better way forward.   I want to thank everybody in this conference for the endless amount  of time they spent trying to achieve a consensus to go forward. I also  want to thank the President and the Vice President, who couldn't have  been more involved and more helpful.   So, yes, this is a disappointment indeed. To our friends over in the  House, we thank them, as well. I regret that our efforts were simply  not enough this time.   I imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are celebrating.  They are pretty happy about all of this, but the American people are  hurting, and they need relief. Our friends on the other side decided  early on they didn't want to engage with us in a serious way to help  those suffering under ObamaCare. They did everything they could to  prevent the Senate from providing a better way forward, including such  things as reading amendments for endless amounts of time, such things  as holding up nominations for key positions in the administration  because they were unhappy that we were trying to find a way to  something better than ObamaCare. So I expect that they are pretty  satisfied tonight. I regret to say that they succeeded in that effort.   Now I think it is appropriate to ask, what are their ideas? It will  be interesting to see what they suggest as the way forward. For myself,  I can say--and I bet I am safe on saying this for most of the people on  this side of the aisle--that bailing out insurance companies with no  thought of any kind of reform is not something I want to be part of.  And I suspect that not many folks over here are interested in that. It  will be interesting to see what they have in mind, like quadrupling  down on the failures of ObamaCare with a single-payer system. We had  that vote a little earlier, thanks to the Senator from Montana. Almost  everybody voted ``present.'' Apparently, they didn't want to make a  decision about whether they were for or against socialized medicine--a  government takeover of everything; European healthcare. Only four of  them weren't afraid to say they didn't think that was a good idea. So  maybe that is what they want to offer. We will be happy to have that  debate with the American people.   It is time for our friends on the other side to tell us what they  have in mind. We will see how the American people feel about their  ideas. So, I regret that we are here, but I want to say, again, I am  proud of the vote I cast tonight. It is consistent with what we told  the American people we would try to accomplish in four straight  elections if they gave us a chance. I thank all of my colleagues on  this side of the aisle for everything they did to try to keep that  commitment.    What we tried to accomplish for the American people was the right  thing for the country, and our only regret tonight--our only regret is  that we didn't achieve what we had hoped to accomplish. I think the  American people are going to regret that we couldn't find a better way  forward, and, as I said, we look forward to our colleagues on the other  side suggesting what they have in mind.   Now, Mr. President, it is time to move on.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m.  on Friday, July 28--that is tomorrow--the Senate proceed to  consideration of Calendar No. 175, H.R. 2810, the House-passed national  defense authorization bill.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I just want to announce to all my  colleagues that the next vote will be at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, on  cloture on Kevin Newsom to be United States Circuit Judge for the  Eleventh Circuit. There will be no more votes tonight.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 172, Kevin Newsom to be United States Circuit  Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 4 p.m., Monday,  July 31; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Newsom nomination; finally, that notwithstanding  the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture vote on the Newsom nomination  occur at 5:30 p.m.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:56 a.m., adjourned until  Monday, July 31, 2017, at 4 p.m.                            ____________________
