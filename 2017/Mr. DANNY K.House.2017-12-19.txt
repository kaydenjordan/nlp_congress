 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, any way you cut it, with  this bill, the rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer, and  middle class families will get shafted. Thirteen million Americans will  lose their health coverage, and people with preexisting conditions can  forget it.   Then the writers of this bill will be coming after entitlement  programs, after Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, SSI. We are down  to the wire, and no matter what is said, this bill raises the debt,  raises taxes on middle-income families, and provides wealthy  individuals and corporations with big tax cuts they don't need.   It is a sad day for my district; it is a sad day for the State of  Illinois; it is a sad day for the United States of America; and I will  vote ``no.''
