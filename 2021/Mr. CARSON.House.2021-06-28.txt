 Madam Speaker, I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for  giving us a leader, a hero, a visionary, a general, and a true public  servant in Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, a fellow Midwesterner.   Madam Speaker, when I see people like Congresswoman Beatty, it  motivates me in the spirit of my grandmother, in the spirit of Fannie  Lou Hamer, in the spirit of Harriet Tubman, in the spirit of Sojourner  Truth. That fearlessness, that boldness, that commitment to liberation  in freeing us from physical shackles along with mental shackles.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my great colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus tonight in support of the INVEST Act, a bill  that we marked up over 18 hours in the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, now this is one of the greenest bills to ever come to  the floor. It provides strong support for sustainable infrastructure,  green infrastructure, and green transit.   The INVEST Act also addresses critical water projects for clean  drinking water and wastewater projects, priorities that are long  overdue after the racial injustices discovered in the Flint water  crisis.                                time  2120    The INVEST Act includes strong job creation provisions for minority  contractors and transportation professionals that will help spur Black  generational success and wealth.   We also know that access to reliable transportation is a civil rights  priority. It is critical to economic and educational opportunities.   This bill makes big investments to cut carbon emissions. For electric  vehicle technologies, it expands EV charging stations and networks  across our country by investing $4 billion in charging infrastructure,  helping the U.S. shift to the next generation of clean vehicles. I am  especially proud of the EV charging stations approved in the bill for  Indianapolis, which has one of the first green bus rapid transit  systems.   This bill also dedicates $8.3 billion for activities targeted to  reduce carbon pollution and provides $6.2 billion for mitigation and  resiliency improvements. It also advances the development and  utilization of green construction materials.   It makes our roads safer with a great boost to smart road  technologies and roadway safety programs, plus record levels of  investment in walking and cycling infrastructure, complete streets  planning and smarter road design, and safe routes to schools.   This bill also strengthens passenger rail service, as Mr. Clyburn  mentioned. At my request, our staff request, there were provisions  included to improve rail safety by addressing highway-rail grade  crossing needs, as well as addressing trespasser and suicide fatalities  and eliminating gaps in railroad safety.   This bill also creates a Federal blocked crossing program to collect  data and enforce a 10-minute blocked crossing limit. This is a huge win  for the problems we have faced in Indianapolis and other places as  well.   Madam Speaker, the INVEST Act is a long-overdue bill, and I urge my  colleagues to help us in passing this monumental piece of legislation.
