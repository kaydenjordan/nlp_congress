 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, President  Richard Nixon designated January as National Blood Donor Month.   The decision to choose January for this occasion was no coincidence.  There is often a shortage of blood in January. In the winter months,  eligible donors don't give blood as frequently because both the  holidays as well as the cold and flu season are quickly approaching.   No matter the time of year, donating blood can help save a life, and  there is always a demand. According to the American Red Cross, someone  in the United States needs blood every 2 seconds, and approximately  36,000 units of red blood cells are needed each and every day.   However, less than 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to  give blood, and only 3 percent of those individuals donate annually.   There are often opportunities to donate blood right here on Capitol  Hill, and the Red Cross is hosting its next blood drive on Wednesday,  February 5, in the Ford Building. I would like to encourage those  eligible to take some time out of their day to make a difference in the  lives of others by donating blood.                            ____________________
