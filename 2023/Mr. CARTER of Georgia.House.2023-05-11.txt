 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  hometown of Port Wentworth, Georgia, and to honor them for celebrating  the 50th anniversary of the Stand Up for America Day Parade.   For 50 years, on the last Saturday in April, residents of Port  Wentworth and the surrounding areas have gathered to pay homage to  members of the Armed Forces, both past and present.   When the parade first started, America was still embroiled in the  controversy of the Vietnam war. It was started by then-Mayor P.B.  Edwards, who was permanently wounded in the Battle of the Bulge during  World War II.   The people of Port Wentworth decided to put on this parade in honor  of those Vietnam veterans and all veterans who served in armed  conflicts abroad.   After a 3-year hiatus, this year's parade drew over 50 entries,  ranging from bands to golf carts, all with one purpose in mind: to  honor those who have served us.   I thoroughly enjoy attending this event every time I am able. It  reminds me of just how great our Nation is and how grateful we are for  our servicemen and--women.   I thank everyone who has helped continue this tradition, from local  officials to the community, and wish them the best of luck for the next  50 parades.                            ____________________
