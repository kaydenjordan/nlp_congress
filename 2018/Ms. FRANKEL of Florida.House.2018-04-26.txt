 Mr. Chairman, I thank the leadership of this  committee for their work.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the en bloc amendment, and I wanted  to specifically mention a provision that is very important to the folks  who are in Palm Beach County and also Bedminster, New Jersey, which is  this constituency of Mr. Lance.   Mr. Chairman, regardless of what your political ideology is, it is  very important for the President to be safe whenever he travels, and  this often results in travel restrictions in the locality he visits.   In terms of my locality, Palm Beach County, Florida, Mr. Trump has  spent 70 days this year at Mar-a-Lago, dubbed as the winter White  House. But here is what happens when he visits a small business  operating airport called Lantana Airport, which is 10 miles from Mar-a- Lago: It is completely shut down, which means basically there is a lot  of lost income. It is estimated almost $1 million a year.    Mr. Chairman, if you translate that out, that  would be $4 million.   As I said, the President's safety is paramount, and the impact to the  local business is a problem. So there is a provision in this amendment  that requires the FAA to study the economic impact of flight  restrictions, which I think is a good thing, and to analyze the  possibilities of some other options.   Mr. Chairman, again, I do support this amendment.
