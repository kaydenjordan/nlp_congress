 Mr. President, I am here on the floor this evening to  talk about China and to talk about how we can have a better  relationship with China, one that is fair and equitable.   I am going to talk specifically about some of the investigations and  reports that we have worked on here in the U.S. Congress over the past  couple of years. I am going to be talking about four specific reports  that came out of what is called the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations. I chair that subcommittee. It is under the Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and it is a committee that  takes these investigations seriously. We do a fair, objective, thorough  job. All of our investigations are bipartisan. I am going to talk a  little about why these investigations that we have done have led me to  the conclusion that we need to do much more here in this country to be  able to respond to China and to be able to have the kind of fair and  equitable relationship that we should all desire.   A lot of China's critics talk about the fact that China needs to do  things differently, and I don't disagree with most of that, but the  reality is there is much we can do right here in this country to create  a situation in which we do not have the issues that I will talk about  tonight--some of the unfair activities that have occurred here in this  country. Frankly, I think we have been naive and not properly prepared.  I will also talk about some legislation that we are proposing tomorrow  morning, which will focus on how to make America more effective at  pushing back against a specific threat to our research and our  intellectual property.   Our goal is not to have China as an enemy. Our goal is to actually  have China as a strategic partner, wherein there is a fair and  equitable and sustainable relationship, but it is going to require some  changes. Again, I am going to focus tonight on some changes we need to  make right here, changes that are within our control.   Our investigations have been thorough--in fact, driven--and our  reports have been objective, bipartisan, and eye-opening, and I  encourage you to go on the PSI website--psi.gov--and check it out.   Our first report was in February of 2019. It detailed a lack of  transparency and reciprocity, among other concerns, with the Confucius  Institutes that China operates here in this country. These Confucius  Institutes are at our colleges and universities. Some people are aware  of that, but some may not be aware that they are also at our elementary  schools, middle schools, and high schools. Our reports show how these  Confucius Institutes have been a tool to stifle academic freedom where  they are located, toeing the Chinese Communist Party line on sensitive  issues like Tibet or Taiwan or the Uighurs or Tiananmen Square.   By the way, when I talk about China tonight, I hope people realize I  am not talking about the Chinese people. I am talking about the Chinese  Government; therefore, I am talking about the Chinese Communist Party.  With regard to the Confucius Institutes, for example, which are spread  around this country, ultimately, they report to a branch of the Chinese  Government that is involved with spreading positive propaganda about  China. Ultimately, it is controlled by whom? The Chinese Communist  Party.   So I hope the comments I make tonight will not be viewed as comments  that are regarding the Chinese people as much as a small group in  China, the Chinese Communist Party, that, with regard to the Confucius  Institutes and other approaches it has taken to the United States, have  led to these issues.   By the way, it is thanks to our report and to the broader scrutiny  that followed that we learned about the lack of academic freedom and  about the fact that history is being taught a certain way at the  Confucius Institutes. By the way, it also pointed out that the Chinese  language is taught. It is a good thing to have this intercultural  dialogue and the opportunity to learn more about China, but there needs  to be, again, an understanding and a history of China that is fair and  honest, which does include discussions of what happened in Tiananmen  Square or what is happening today with regard to the Uighurs--a  minority group in China that is being oppressed.   In the year that followed our scrutiny--so, really, in the last year  and a few months--23 of the, roughly, 100 Confucius Institutes on  college campuses in America have closed, and others have made some  positive changes as to how they operate. So I believe our report made a  significant difference in terms of how we relate to the Confucius  Institutes.   I said earlier that one of my concerns about the Confucius Institutes  was the lack of reciprocity. When our State Department has attempted to  set up something comparable on Chinese university campuses, it has been  unable to do so. In fact, whereas the Confucius Institute employees and  members of the Chinese Government are able to come on our college  campuses, we are told that U.S. Government officials and, for that  matter, private citizens cannot go on Chinese campuses without having a  minder, somebody to be there to monitor what they are doing. Sometimes  they are not permitted to go at all, which goes to the lack of  reciprocity.    Yet my goal, really, is to, again, talk about what we can do here. I  would urge those tonight who are watching and who are connected with a  college or a university that still has a Confucius Institute--or a high  school or a middle school or an elementary school--to check it out.  Check out our report in which we have many instances when the American  students who are learning there are not getting the full story. That  may not be true in the case of all Confucius Institutes, but I would  recommend that you do the research yourself.   Then, in March of 2019, after the Confucius Institute report, our  report into the Equifax data breach here in America showed how China  had targeted private U.S. companies and stolen the information of  millions of Americans. In the Equifax data breach of 2017, which we  studied and which is one of the largest in history, the personal  information of 147 million Americans was stolen by IP addresses that  originated in China. So we should just be aware of that, and we should  take precautions and protections and encryptions and security measures  here to avoid it. Again, this is about our doing more here in this  country to be prepared for the reality of the 21st century.   Then, in November of last year, we released another eye-opening  report, this one detailing the rampant theft of U.S. taxpayer-funded  research and intellectual property by China by way of its so-called  talent recruitment programs--meaning, China systematically finds  promising researchers who are doing work on research that China is  interested in, and China recruits them. These programs have not been  subtle. The Thousand Talents Plan is the most understood of these  programs, although there are a couple hundred others. Yet we showed, in  studying the Thousand Talents Plan, how this problem has been ongoing  for two decades in this country. Through this program, much of what  China has taken from our labs and then taken to China has gone directly  toward fueling the rise of the Chinese economy and the Chinese  military.   Again, this is about China, but it is really about us. How have we  let this happen?   Specifically, we found that the Chinese Government has targeted this  promising, U.S.-based research and its researchers. Often, this  research is funded by U.S. taxpayers. As taxpayers, we spend $115  million a year on research to places like the National Institutes of  Health or to the National Science Foundation or to the Department of  Energy for basic science research. It has been a good investment  because, through some of these investments, we have discovered cures to  particular kinds of cancer and technologies that have helped our  military,  [[Page S3056]]  but it is not good if the U.S. taxpayer is paying for this research and  then China is taking it.   China has not just taken some of this research funded by U.S.  taxpayers but has paid these grant recipients to take their research  over to the Chinese universities in China--again, universities that are  affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. This is not about the  people of China. This is about the Chinese Communist Party, and it has  been very clever. It wants to make sure that China is a stronger  competitor against us, so it literally takes the research from the  United States to a lab in China where it tries to replicate the  research and provide the money to these researchers.   Just last week, we released a fourth PSI report that showed that this  problem of China's not playing by the rules extends to the  telecommunications space as well. Let me explain that situation. Then I  will go back to the Thousand Talents Program.   You may remember that, in May of last year, the FCC prohibited a  company called China Mobile and its U.S. subsidiary from providing  telecom services from the United States on the grounds that doing so  would jeopardize our national security--the first time such a ruling  had been issued. The fact that this was only the first time that a  foreign telecommunications company had been denied approval to operate  in the U.S. on national security grounds prompted us to investigate  other Chinese state-owned carriers that were already authorized to  operate in the United States. We asked an important question: Why was  China Mobile USA any different than these other three Chinese  companies?    We discovered in our report, which again we issued just a month ago,  that it wasn't different. We conducted a yearlong investigation into  the government processes for reviewing, approving, and monitoring  Chinese state-owned telecommunications firms operating here in the  United States, and we found, once again, over the years, the Federal  Government had been lax when it comes to securing our  telecommunications networks against risks posed by Chinese state-owned  carriers. Again, it is what we can do here in this country that we  haven't done.   In fact, three Chinese state-owned carriers have been operating in  the U.S. for nearly 20 years, but it has only been in recent years that  the FCC, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland  Security have focused on the potential risks these firms bring when  they operate in the United States. What we didn't know 20 years ago, we  do know today, and we should use that information to protect ourselves.   We now know that the Chinese Government views telecommunications as a  strategic industry and has expended significant resources to create and  promote new business opportunities for its state-owned carriers. We  also learned in our investigation and said in our report that Chinese  state-owned telecommunications carriers are ``subject to exploitation,  influence, and control by the Chinese government'' and can be used in  the Chinese government's cyber and economic espionage efforts aimed at  the United States.   This isn't a surprise. We have seen this time and time again that the  Chinese Government targets the United States through cyber and economic  espionage activities and enlists its state-owned entities in these  efforts. The Chinese telecommunications firms have been part of our  U.S. telecommunications industry as a result, and, of course, that is  critical to our everyday life. Its services from cellular networks to  broadband internet connections help break down barriers between people,  nations, and continents. That is good. It has helped our economy and  the economies of many other countries grow immensely. We all benefit  when telecommunications are global.   It makes sense then that the Federal Government has tasked the FCC  with ensuring that foreign telecommunications can establish a foothold  in the United States, but only if it is done in a fair and safe manner.  Again, what we have learned is that the FCC and other Federal agencies  have been slow to respond to the national security threats these  telecom companies can pose in terms of cyber security and economic  espionage.   As we detail in our report, the FCC, which lacks the national  security and law enforcement expertise required to assess these risks,  has turned to other executive branch agencies to assess them,  specifically the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland  Security, and the Department of Defense, a group commonly known as the  Team Telecom.   Team Telecom was an informal arrangement and has lacked formal  authority to operate, making it overall an ineffective solution to  assessing these risks. The informality has resulted in protracted  review periods and a process FCC Commissioners have described as broken  and an inextricable black hole that provided ``no clarity for the  future.''   For example, Team Telecom's review of China Mobile USA's application  lasted for 7 years. This points to a troubling trend we have found in  all of these reports--how, frankly, our government and our institutions  over a space of time, the last couple of decades, have permitted China  to take advantage of lax U.S. oversight, be it on our college campuses,  our research labs, or in cyberspace.   At our PSI hearing on the Thousand Talents report, the FBI witness  before us acknowledged as much saying:         With our present day knowledge of the threat from Chinese       talent plans, we wish we had taken more rapid and       comprehensive action in the past. And the time to make up for       that is now.    That is our own Federal Bureau of Investigation. Again: ``We wish we  had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past.'' They don't  say that often, but it is true, and I commend them for saying it at the  hearing and for starting to make up for it now because they have made a  number of arrests just in the past few months with regard to the  Talents program.   It is my hope that PSI's work has opened the eyes of our government  to these systemic problems, and I think that is the case, as what we  have seen in the Trump administration is they have taken a firmer  stance towards the Chinese Government in every one of the four areas I  talked about.    As PSI was nearing the end of its telecom investigation, for example,  the responsible Federal agencies announced that they would review  whether these Chinese state-owned carriers that we were studying should  continue to operate in the U.S., given the national security threats.  The Trump administration also recently issued an Executive order to  establish Team Telecom as a formal committee, which is a good idea, as  well as addressing many of the issues the subcommittee report  identified in Team Telecom's processes.   Again, these are good steps, and I am pleased to say that they were  prompted by the thorough and, again, objective, nonpartisan inquiry  that we made through PSI. These four investigations combined show us  that China, frankly--and, again, the Chinese Government and the Chinese  Communist Party, not the people of China--is not going to play by the  rules unless we require it. Until we start to clean up our own house  and take a firmer stance on foreign influence here in this country, we  are not going to see much improvement. Rather than pointing the finger  at China, we ought to be looking at our own government and our own  institutions and doing a better job here.   Along those lines, I found it interesting that, just last week, 54  NIH-funded researchers nationwide have resigned or have been fired  because they had been found to be hiding their ties to foreign research  institutions as part of an NIH investigation into this problem. Again,  after our PSI investigation talking about how the Thousand Talents  program and other programs work, there are now 54 people just last week  who have been fired or have resigned.   Of the cases NIH has studied, 70 percent of the researchers failed to  disclose foreign grant funding, while more than half failed to disclose  participation in a foreign talent program like Thousand Talents. By the  way, the FBI just recently warned universities across the country that  China may be attempting to steal our research on the coronavirus-- therapies, antiviral therapies, vaccines, other research. This problem  is ongoing.   I think, in a fair and straightforward manner, we have got to insist  that  [[Page S3057]]  there be a level playing field. We have got to insist that there be  fairness and accountability, again, in an objective manner and a  straightforward manner.   At the same time, our law enforcement officials and other Federal  entities that are working to hold China accountable are limited in the  actions they can take. That is part of cleaning up our own house. We  need to make some changes around here, including in our laws, which has  to come through this body.   In the case of the Thousand Talents plan, we have seen first-ever  arrests related to Thousand Talents recently. They followed our  investigation, our report, and our hearings. We even saw it in my home  State of Ohio. All of the arrests in connection with the Thousand  Talents plan, by the way, had been related to peripheral financial  crimes, like wire fraud and tax evasion--not the core issue of a  conflict of commitment, the taking of American taxpayer-paid research.   Why? Because amazingly, it is not currently a crime to fail to  disclose foreign funding of the same research on Federal grant  applications. In other words, if you are doing research and paid by the  taxpayer of the United States in your research and also being paid by  China to do the same research and to have the research go to China, you  don't have to disclose that under law.   These arrests that have been made haven't been about that core issue.  They have been about other things like tax evasion or wire fraud, kind  of like they went after the gangsters in the old days on tax evasion  because they couldn't get them on a RICO statute.   We need to change the laws so that we can give our law enforcement  community the tools they need to be able to do the job that all of us  expect is being done. It is incumbent upon Congress to work in a  bipartisan manner to pass those laws and to put a stop to this  behavior.   This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and it isn't. It is about  defending the interests of the United States, and that is something we  should all agree on. The good news is we are starting to do just that.  Tomorrow, we plan to introduce bipartisan legislation called the  Safeguarding American Innovation Act based on recommendations from our  Thousand Talents report from late last year to protect U.S. taxpayer- funded research.   First and foremost, our bill is going to help the Department of  Justice go after Thousand Talents participants by holding them  accountable for failing to disclose their foreign ties on Federal grant  applications. Again, it is a tool that they desperately need. Our bill  goes directly to the root of the problem. It makes it punishable by law  to knowingly fail to disclose foreign funding on Federal grant  applications   This isn't about more arrests. We should all agree that transparency  and honesty on grant applications are critical to the integrity of U.S.  research and the U.S. research enterprise. These provisions will help  promote those principles as well.   Our bill also makes other important changes from our report. It  requires the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to streamline and  coordinate grant making between the Federal agencies so there is more  continuity and accountability in coordination when it comes to tracking  the billions of dollars of taxpayer-funded grant money that is being  distributed. This kind of transparency is long overdue.   We have worked closely with the National Science Foundation, with the  National Institutes of Health, with the Department of Energy, and  others on this legislation, and they agree this is very important. Our  legislation also allows the State Department to deny visas to foreign  researchers who they know are seeking to steal research and  intellectual property by exploiting exemptions in our current export  control laws.   This may surprise you, but the State Department can't do that now.  Career Foreign Service Officers and employees at the State Department  have asked us to please provide them this authority. They testified  before our hearing, asking us to help them to be able to do what they  know needs to be done.   Our bill also requires research institutions and universities to  provide the State Department basic information about sensitive  technologies that a foreign researcher would have access to. Providing  this information as part of the visa process should help streamline the  process for the State Department and for the research institutions.   This allows for college campuses to rely on the State Department to  do some of the vetting for these applicants and to help keep bad actors  off the campus. This is why many research institutions and universities  will be endorsing our legislation tomorrow because we have worked with  them on this issue and others, including new transparency standards for  universities.   They are now going to be required to report any foreign gift of  $50,000 or more, which is a lower level from the current threshold of  $250,000, but it is also going to empower the Department of Education  to work with these universities and research institutions to ensure  that this can be complied with in a way that doesn't create undue  redtape and expenditures. It also allows DOE to fine universities that  repeatedly fail to disclose these gifts.   I believe this legislation can be a model going forward as to how we  use the lessons we have learned from these, again, objective and  straightforward PSI reports to get to the root causes of these cases.  We have gotten widespread support across my home State of Ohio, from  research leaders, hospitals, colleges and universities, and other  stakeholders who want to see us continue to have an open and  transparent research system and have the United States be the center in  the globe for innovation and research, but to ensure that can continue  to happen, they want to be sure we are holding China accountable.   We are now at work on this legislation to codify into law some of the  steps taken by the Trump administration in response to our new  telecommunications PSI report as well. This legislation we will  introduce tomorrow will be led by myself and Senator Tom Carper, my  colleague from the other side of the aisle from Delaware, who was also  my partner on this report with regard to the Thousand Talents program  and the hearing.   We also have five other Democrats who will be joining us tomorrow,  all of whom have an interest and understanding of this complicated  issue. We will also have about an equal number of Republicans joining  us, probably six to eight Republicans. So, again, this is going to be a  bipartisan effort--I would say even a nonpartisan effort--to ensure  that, in a smart, sensible, practical way, we can respond to the threat  that we are facing, in this case, from China taking our intellectual  property, our innovations, our ideas, and taking them to China and  using them in China, sometimes against the United States.   In addition to the four examples we discussed tonight, the  subcommittee will continue its work to shine a light on other examples  where China and other countries aren't living by the rules, so we can  ensure that, with regard to China and in regard to other foreign  governments, we can create a more durable and a more equitable and a  more sustainable relationship between our countries.   Again, we don't want to be enemies with China, but what we do want is  to have a relationship with mutual respect. When we have the right to  ask them that they treat us with the same respect that we treat them,  at the end of the day, that is what is going to be best for the Chinese  people, best for the American people, and best for all of us moving  forward.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, June 18; further, that following the prayer and the pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to  resume consideration of the Walker nomination; finally, notwithstanding  rule XXII, postcloture time on the Walker nomination expire at 1:30  p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Blumenthal.
