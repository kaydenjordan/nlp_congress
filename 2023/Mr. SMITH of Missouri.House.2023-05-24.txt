 Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Trade of the  Committee on Ways and Means, pending which I yield myself such time as  I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the veto message of H.J.  Res. 39.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding  President Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 39, a Congressional Review Act  resolution disapproving of the rule submitted by the Department of  Commerce relating to Procedures Covering Suspension of Liquidation,  Duties, and Estimated Duties in accord with Presidential Proclamation  10414.   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, the Ways and Means Committee held a hearing  at the Port of Staten Island in New York to listen to working Americans  who are on the front lines of the impact of our trade policies.   Witnesses highlighted for the committee the troubling reality that  the Chinese Communist Party continues to engage in a wide range of  unfair trade practices that rip off American workers, farmers, and  businesses.   Today's resolution highlights one of the most prolific of these  unfair practices--massive subsidies for the CCP's favored industries.   Today's resolution is focused on the solar industry, but make no  mistake, the CCP's industrial policy impacts all sectors of the  American economy.   The United States has had tariffs in place since 2012--during the  Obama administration--to provide a level playing field for American  manufacturers who face unfair competition from unfairly priced and  subsidized solar products coming out of China.   Now, President Biden's own Commerce Department has found that Chinese  companies are shipping products through four Southeast Asian  countries--Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam--to avoid paying  these same tariffs.   China has set up a solar panel export scheme that cheats American  workers and consumers. Instead of standing up for American  manufacturers and workers, the White House rewarded China for  exploiting them by issuing a proclamation that allows the CCP to  continue to avoid paying the tariffs they owe for an additional 2  years.   The sad truth is the solar panel industry in China is historically  one of the most prolific users of forced labor.   This body stood together not too long ago to pass the Uyghur Forced  Labor Prevention Act. We should do the same thing now when it comes to  actually standing firm against products and industries which have a  proven track record of using such terrible practices.   Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber and in the Senate came  together to block implementation of the White House proclamation on  solar panels just a few weeks ago.   In doing, so we also sent a message to President Xi: We will not  allow China to abuse our trade policies and hurt American workers.   Unfortunately, President Biden doubled down on his misguided decision  and vetoed our efforts. America must stand up to China and stand up for  our workers.   Small businesses and U.S. manufacturers already have to deal with  inflation, rising interest rates, and a worker shortage.   The least Washington can do is level the playing field for American  workers competing against Chinese state-subsidized companies.   China's unfair trade practices have left behind a trail of shuttered  factories, lost jobs, and stolen intellectual property all across  America.   When we voted to roll back the White House's misguided decision on  solar panel tariffs, Congress spoke with a bipartisan voice in both  Chambers. I hope today we can do the same.   I urge my colleagues to once again support this effort to turn out  the lights on China's economic exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that the  overall U.S. trade remedy system is retrospective.   Final duties are always calculated after a product enters the United  States upon completion of an investigation or review.   We have hundreds of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in  place to level the playing field for American producers. In all these  cases, the final duties have been calculated at the end of the  investigation.   What is unusual about the solar circumvention case was the action by  the Biden administration to encourage importation of these products  despite the  [[Page H2573]]  fact that China is trading them unfairly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this veto override supports American workers and  manufacturers in the solar sector, but it also helps protect American  workers in every sector that face unfair competition from China or any  other country.   Our trade laws are designed to level the playing field so that  American workers can compete and win. We have hundreds of trade remedy  orders in place to do exactly that for many American industries.   These laws aren't worth the paper they are written on unless they are  enforced. Overriding this veto is an important way for Congress to show  that we will insist on strong trade enforcement for American workers,  farmers, and manufacturers of any product that faces unfair competition  from China or any other country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, there are few times that I would  have yielded time to the gentleman from Michigan, but I would have for  that opportunity to finish.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know  well, the Chinese Communist Party has an egregious human rights record.  There is a clear connection between these human rights abuses and the  CCP's solar industry.   Mr. Speaker, I call attention to the full and complete testimony of  Nury Turkel, a Uyghur human rights lawyer and chair of the U.S.  Commission on International Religious Freedom, which was held before  the Committee on Ways and Means during a field hearing in Staten  Island, New York, on May 9, 2023, titled: ``Trade in America: Securing  Supply Chains and Protecting the American Worker--Staten Island. The  testimony can be found on the Ways and Means Committee website.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Turkel's testimony highlights the ongoing human  rights abuses and religious persecution being perpetrated against  Uyghurs by the Chinese Communist Party.   I am disappointed that President Biden vetoed this important  resolution. This is unacceptable. We must step up to hold China  accountable for its human rights abuses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   For years, China has been engaged in a long list of unfair trade  practices. It is these practices that are harming American workers.  They cost communities their jobs and create an unfair playing field.   We are here today to end the misguided reward that the White House  gave China for one of those unfair practices: shipping solar products  through four Southeast Asian nations to dodge paying U.S. tariffs.   That is simply what we are talking about here. That is it. That is  how you protect American workers.   It is not allowing the Chinese, the CCP, to have a competitive  advantage over our manufacturers and over our American workers. But if  it is for solar panels, wait, it is okay for the Chinese to subsidize  that. It is okay for American workers to lose their jobs unfairly  because we don't want to put a tariff on the CCP.   It is extremely important that even the Department of Commerce,  President Biden's Department of Commerce, is the one that suggested  there should be tariffs on these four countries because they are the  ones that identified these four countries being misused by the CCP.   That is what we are trying to do, is to follow Biden's Department of  Commerce. Unfortunately, Biden himself is not even following his own  Department of Commerce because he is more on the side of his special  interest groups instead of the American workers who are losing their  jobs because this resolution, his veto, basically allows more Chinese  solar panels in without tariffs, and they are not doing anything about  it.   That is why, in a bipartisan measure, both in the House and in the  Senate, we voted to reverse President Biden, including the Finance  Committee chair over on the other side, a Democrat, who voted to  reverse the President's proposal.   The problem is we don't have enough Democrats that will join us. We  have just a few, but I am thankful for the few who want to stand up to  the CCP.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
