 Mr. Speaker, so the national emergency declaration was  on March 13 of 2020, nearly 3 years ago.   This legislation we are talking about today passed the Senate twice  with the votes of nearly two-thirds of the Senators. But the former  Speaker repeatedly blocked the resolution from coming to the floor in  the House.   The President is granted more than 120 special statutory powers-- statutory, which usually means passing a law--through the national  emergency declaration, all of which he continues to wield as long as  this emergency is in place.   The President has extended the emergency twice, which would otherwise  have automatically terminated on the anniversary of the first  declaration.   These powers are meant for the time of actual emergency. President  Biden himself has said the pandemic is over in his ``60 Minutes''  interview in September of 2022.   This administration has continually abused these powers and used the  national emergency to enact liberal policies without the approval of  Congress. These are things that probably wouldn't pass muster in  Congress, because I don't think a lot of my colleagues would want to  vote for them on the record.   Since the emergency was first declared, the Federal Government has  spent over $6 trillion in response to COVID-19. Students have lost  invaluable time learning in school facilities. Countless businesses  closed down that aren't coming back. Families have been separated from  loved ones during holidays and at hospitals, unable to see dying loved  ones and not even able to have a funeral for them. Heartless.                                time  1530    Nurses and docs, at one point called heroes, start to be called goats  because they don't necessarily want to take an experimental vaccine.   We have Jekyll and Hyde ideas coming out of the administration now-- thinking like, well, we are going to sue to make people wear masks  again on planes and trains at the same time he is saying we are going  to end it all in May. It is crazy. We are going in the wrong direction.   Why don't we pass this legislation that the President won't do  himself and put the power back into the hands of the people here that  are elected by the people.    Mr. Speaker, socialism has failed everywhere it has been  tried and has caused millions of deaths over the last century.   In 1932 and 1933, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin engineered a man-made  famine in Ukraine that killed more than 3 million people. In 1938, 1  million people were executed by the Soviet Union's secret police in a  campaign of organized terror.   From 1960 to 1962, over 50 million people died in Communist China  during Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward. Again, from 1966 until 1976,  over 3 million people were killed by Chairman Mao's Cultural  Revolution.   In Cambodia, communist dictator Pol Pot killed 2 million people, 25  percent of his country's population.   Almost 2 million North Koreans have been killed by that country's  communist government.   These are just a few of the examples of socialism leading to mass  death and suffering for innocent people. These deaths are a feature,  not a bug and not an anomaly.   Socialism never works, as its critics must be silenced by force. It  might sound attractive going in, but people who have voted it in  usually have to fight their way out of it.   Let's be on the side of victims of socialism, the tens of millions of  them, and speak out and condemn it in all its forms.                            ____________________
