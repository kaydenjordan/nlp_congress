 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a crisis  facing rural America: the deterioration of water and wastewater  infrastructure in our rural communities.   As the House considers passage of the Water Resources Development  Act, WRDA, millions of Americans in my district and across the country  are facing a health and infrastructure emergency due to failing  wastewater systems.   In Alabama's rural Black Belt, I have toured communities where a  home's only sewage system is a straight pipe that carries untreated  waste directly into their yards and property. Alabama is not alone in  this issue. Reports by the EPA document that the same lack of  wastewater infrastructure is all across rural America where rural and  remote areas are not connected to a city or county water and sewer  line.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced the bipartisan Rural Septic Tank Access Act  with my Alabama Republican colleague, Congressman  Mike Rogers, which  takes a first step towards providing rural Americans with the resources  they need to maintain stable, safe, and efficient water systems.   As the House continues to debate infrastructure investment, I urge  this body to address the wastewater crisis facing our rural  communities.                            ____________________
