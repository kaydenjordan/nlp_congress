 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Central Missouri's women's soccer team on winning the  NCAA Division II national championship. This is the Jennies first NCAA  women's soccer national championship in program history.   The Jennies completed the season with a perfect record of 26 and 0,  making them only the third women's Division II national champion to  finish a  [[Page H9905]]  season with a perfect record. The team's 26 wins set a new single- season NCAA Division II women's record.   In addition to winning the national championship, the Jennies had  five athletes join the Division II Conference Commissioners Association  All-American teams.   The team's outstanding accomplishments mark a great milestone for the  University of Central Missouri's athletics department and its head  coach of 11 years, Lewis Theobald.   Please join me in congratulating the Central Missouri Jennies on this  momentous achievement.                            ____________________
