 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2575, the AI in Government  Act.   Artificial intelligence, or AI, has the potential to improve our  Federal workforce's productivity and to solve complex government  challenges.   By responsibly increasing the utilization of AI in the Federal  Government, we can streamline burdensome administrative tasks and  better allocate finite resources. AI can potentially save the Federal  Government billions of dollars and countless man-hours.   Artificial intelligence tools can also free Federal workers from  mundane tasks, giving them time for more challenging work. In fact, a  Deloitte report from 2017 estimated that the Federal Government could  potentially save 1.2 billion employee labor-hours by automating certain  tasks. That could potentially save the Federal Government up to $41  billion, annually.   AI can also improve Federal policy decisions by presenting new  insights and improving the quality of information available to  decisionmakers.   AI represents a force multiplier benefiting the American people in an  era of soaring Federal deficits and increasing complexity of various  Federal agency missions and programs. The taxpayers should especially  benefit from a smarter, more effective government.   The good news is that the government agencies are well on their way  to realizing the benefits of artificial intelligence technology  solutions. A 2018 survey by IBM found that nearly half of the  responding Federal agencies already incorporated AI solutions.   The Trump administration has already made advancement of AI a  national priority. In February of 2019, President Trump issued the  executive order on ``Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial  Intelligence.''   The executive order promotes national research and development  efforts, workforce training, and technology standards. However, it did  not go as far as to establish the necessary accountability or governing  policies  [[Page H4356]]  for Federal agencies using AI tools. But the AI in Government Act does,  because, along with the potential of AI, there are attending concerns  and considerations regarding its ethical use which must be taken into  account to maintain the trust and confidence of the American people.   H.R. 2575 ensures proper oversight over the government's increasing  use of AI. The bill requires the Office of Management and Budget and  the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue a memorandum to  agencies to inform the development of agency AI policy plans. These  agency plans will provide greater insight into agency AI activities and  will ensure public accountability over how Federal agencies incorporate  AI tools into their mission delivery and decisionmaking.   Mr. Speaker, we must tap into the benefits AI has to offer, and, with  this bill, we can do it with proper oversight and accountability. I  urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, artificial intelligence is leading to  breakthroughs in productivity in industries across the Nation such as  science, transportation, healthcare, and education. The American people  deserve a government that takes full advantage of modern technology in  a responsible manner.   H.R. 2575 will help assure the proper governance and oversight over  the Federal Government's use of a rapidly advancing and promising  technology area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5317 which would name a post  office in my home State of Texas after Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal.   Dhaliwal joined the Harris County Sheriff's Office out of a sense of  duty and a desire to build a bridge between the department and the  Houston area Sikh community. He was also one of the first observant  Sikhs in Texas to receive a policy accommodation allowing him to wear  the turban and beard associated with the Sikh religion during his  service as a police officer.   After being promoted to the rank of patrol deputy, he was assigned to  northwest Harris County.   In September of 2019, Dhaliwal was shot and killed from behind during  a routine traffic stop leaving behind a wife and three daughters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation  honoring a local law enforcement hero, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4672 which would name a  Cupertino, California, post office after Petty Officer 2nd Class  Matthew Axelson, a Navy SEAL.   Petty Officer Axelson was born and raised in Cupertino. After  graduating from college, he joined the U.S. Navy, eventually earning a  spot as an elite Navy SEAL serving on SEAL Team 10.   He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2005 and served as part of a four- man special reconnaissance element that participated in Operation Red  Wings, a mission to counter fundamentalist forces in the Kunar province  of Afghanistan.   On June 28, 2005, Petty Officer Axelson's unit was assigned to kill  or capture Ahmad Shah, a high-ranking Taliban leader in the Hindu Kush  mountains. He and two other team members were killed in action as part  of an ambush by enemy forces, but not until after the four-man group  fought ferociously back against a significantly larger force. Axelson  continued to fight alongside his teammates after being wounded in the  head and chest, but he ultimately succumbed to his wounds. Axelson was  posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest military award  for valor.   The sole remaining survivor of the team wrote a book about the  courageous actions of these men called ``Lone Survivor'' which was  later turned into a movie of the same name.   Mr. Speaker, Petty Officer Axelson's actions are a profile in  courage. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5597, which would name a post  office in Oklahoma after Clara Luper.   Luper believed that Oklahoma and the United States should be a place  where everyone is treated equally with respect.   In 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP youth council students organized one  of the first U.S. sit-ins at a Katz Drug Store in Oklahoma. They tried  to order a hamburger and soda knowing that they would be refused solely  because of the color of their skin.   Though they were assaulted, they stayed with their cause. And within  days, Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters in Oklahoma and  three other States.   This sit-in helped inspire the 1961 sit-ins at the Woolworth's lunch  counter in Greensboro, which was a critical moment during the civil  rights movement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3847, which would designate a  Virginia Postal Service facility as the ``Reverend Curtis West Harris  Post Office Building''.   Reverend Harris was a native Virginian who attended the Carter G.  Woodson High School and Virginia Union University. After college,  Reverend Harris began to work at the Allied Chemical Plant in Hopewell,  Virginia. He successfully sued Allied Chemical after an executive order  that prohibited discrimination at companies that received government  contracts. This began Reverend Harris' lifelong fight for social  justice.   In 1960, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail for staging a sit-in at  a segregated drugstore. He also protested the segregation of Hopewell's  cemetery and swimming pool. He joined the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference's national board and would eventually head up the Virginia  chapter.   During this time at SCLC, Reverend Harris became close to Reverend  Dr. Martin Luther King and joined him on the 54-mile march from Selma  to Montgomery.   Reverend Harris was an influential and well-respected member of the  community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3870, which would name a New  York City post office after Normandia Maldonado.   Normandia Maldonado was born in the Dominican Republic, where she  developed a love for the arts and a passion to serve her community. She  took this love and passion to New York City in 1960, when she came to  the U.S. to star in the Cuban film ``Busquen A Ese Hombre.''   She began to plant roots in the Washington Heights community and  worked to promote Dominican culture in the area. She cofounded Club  Civico y Cultural Juan Pablo Duarte, which is the second oldest  Dominican cultural institution in New York. She also founded what is  now known as the Dominican Day Parade.   Her contributions have impacted countless Dominicans and New Yorkers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5062, which would name a  Florida post office after Officer Robert German.   Robert German, affectionately known as Robbie, moved to central  Florida when he was 5 years old. After graduating with a business  degree, he began working in airport operations, where he coordinated  with security and police departments. These interactions inspired him  to become a law enforcement agent.   Officer German was shot and killed in the line of duty on March 22,  2014.   Officer German's courage, dedication, and passion for his community  are to be commended.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4975, which would name a  Virginia post office for Dorothy Braden Bruce.   Dorothy Bruce served as a cryptanalyst with the U.S. Army Signal  Corps' Signal Intelligence Service during World War II.   Sworn to secrecy, Dorothy's unit worked to disclose the locations of  Japanese ships in the Pacific. Her unit also identified and intercepted  enemy supply movements.   The contributions of Bruce and her unit were crucial in defeating the  Axis Powers in the Pacific.   Her story is featured in the best-selling book ``Code Girls: The  Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.''   Bruce serves as a shining inspiration for women and girls pursuing  careers in STEM fields.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2969, which would designate  the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1401 1st  Street North in Winter Haven, Florida, as the Althea Margaret Daily  Mills Post Office Building.   Althea Margaret Daily Mills had a crucial role in the desegregation  of Florida. When asked about her motivation to challenge the Polk  County Board of Public Instruction, Mills said: ``Our instructors were  just as good, but some of my son's textbooks would go to page 3 and  then skip to page 35. You can't learn like that.'' This lawsuit  eventually led to the public integration of all Polk County public  schools.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4034, which would designate  the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 602 Pacific  Avenue in Bremerton, Washington, as the John Henry Turpin Post Office  Building.   After a distinguished career serving in the Spanish-American War, the  Boxer Rebellion, and World War I, and being disallowed from reenlisting  during World War II because of his age, Mr. Turpin instead volunteered  to tour the Navy training facilities and defense plants to speak to  African-American sailors.   After his retirement from Active Duty in the Navy, Turpin worked as a  master rigger in Bremerton, Washington. His service is to be commended,  and because of that, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2246, which would name a  Mississippi post office after three brave citizens who died in the line  of duty.   Donald William Durr was a deputy in the Lincoln County Sheriff's  Department when he was killed in the line of duty. Just prior to his  passing, he had completed training to become a DARE officer and  educator. He was also a talented musician and ventriloquist who enjoyed  spending time with his family.   James White had only briefly been employed with the Brookhaven Police  Department when he died in 2018. He had previously been employed with  the Lawrence County Sheriff's Department, and before that, he was a  soldier in the Army National Guard and served our country in Operation  Iraqi Freedom, receiving a Purple Heart.   Zach Moak was a patrolman with the Brookhaven Police Department. He  had previously worked for Wesson and the Lincoln County Sheriff's  Department. In his free time, he loved to spend time with his family  and help out in his community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4734, which would name an Indiana Post  Office after Ernest T. Pyle.   Ernie Pyle was born near Dana, Indiana. After graduating from high  school, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve before attending Indiana  University. At Indiana University he studied economics and journalism  and wrote for the student newspaper.   During World War II, Pyle served as a war correspondent. He reported  from the front lines of both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of war.  His accounts from the front helped provide Americans with valuable  unseen perspectives of war.   His reporting helped lead to the creation of combat pay. Near the end  of the war in April 1945, Pyle was reporting on the island of Iejima  when he was killed by a lone Japanese machine gunner. He was awarded  the Pulitzer Prize for journalism, as well as the Medal for Merit and  the Purple Heart.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3275, which would name the United States  Postal Service facility located at 340 Wetmore Avenue in Grand River,  Ohio, as the Lance Corporal Andy `Ace' Nowacki Post Office.   Known as Andy or Ace to his loved ones, he graduated from Brush High  School in 1998 and joined the Marine Corps Reserves shortly after.   He attended the Cleveland Heights Police Academy and became a  patrolman for Grand River in 2001. As a patrolman, he was a dedicated  member of the ready response team, the honor guard, and the bike  patrol.   He was killed by a roadside bomb on his second tour in Iraq on  February 26, 2005, as he served as a gunner on a  [[Page H4366]]  Humvee that was protecting a convoy south of Baghdad.   Andy was always looking to protect and serve his country and those  around him. He served his country and his community bravely, and I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5384 to designate  the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 100 Crosby  Street in Mansfield, Louisiana, as the Dr. C.O. Simpkins, Sr., Post  Office.   Dr. Simpkins joined the U.S. Air Force after school, attaining the  rank of captain before being honorably discharged.   Following his military service, he returned to Shreveport and opened  a dental practice.   He became involved in the civil rights movement, serving with Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. Unfortunately, his involvement drew the  attention of racist organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, tragically  resulting in his home and office being firebombed.   Fearing for his safety, Dr. Simpkins moved to New York, where he  continued to be an advocate for civil rights.   After living in New York for 26 years, Dr. Simpkins returned to  Shreveport, reopened his dental practice, and pursued a career in  politics. He won a seat in the Louisiana State House of  Representatives, where he served for one term before returning to his  dental practice full time. He continued working at his dental practice  until retiring in 2011.   He passed away on December 4, 2019, at the age of 94.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4785, which would name a post  office in Castroville, Texas, after Lance Corporal Rhonald Dain  Rairdan.   Dain, as he was called by his loved ones, was raised in an Air Force  family and lived all over the country.   He considered Castroville to be his adopted home, and it is where his  celebration of life would eventually be held.   Dain grew up wanting to join the Marine Corps because he wanted to  protect his country. Four months after joining the Marines, he was  deployed to the Middle East to join the Marine-led offensive to take  control of Fallujah.   On January 26, 2005, Dain was onboard a helicopter near Rutbah, Iraq,  when it crashed. Twenty-eight marines were killed alongside Dain.   He died serving this Nation and protecting us, a most honorable  calling.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4200, which would name a Colorado post  office after Sergeant David Kinterknecht. Sergeant Kinterknecht was a  law enforcement officer who was killed in 2009 while responding to a  routine domestic violence call.   This bill would repeal and replace a bill passed in Congress that  named a mail processing facility after Sergeant Kinterknecht. This mail  processing facility is not commonly used by those in Montrose.   Instead, to ensure that Sergeant Kinterknecht is remembered as he  deserves, Congressman Tipton wishes to name a more commonly used post  office after the sergeant. This would allow Montrose residents,  including Sergeant Kinterknecht's family and friends, to be able to see  a post office named after him.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4200,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to speak on S. 3105, a bill to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located at 456 North Meridian Street in  Indianapolis, Indiana, as the Richard G. Lugar Post Office.   Senator Lugar left the United States Senate as the longest serving  Member of Congress in Indiana history. During his time in the Senate,  he was internationally recognized. Senator Lugar was awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom. Her Majesty the Queen of England even  bestowed on him the rank of honorary Knight Commander of the Most  Excellent Order of the British Empire in honor of his work to make the  world more secure from weapons of mass destruction.   This House already passed the House version of this bill, H.R. 3152,  last October. I thank Senator Braun for sponsoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
