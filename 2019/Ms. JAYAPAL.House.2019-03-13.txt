 Madam Speaker, let me say how pleased I am to be with  Ms. Tlaib today, leading the Special Order hour, and, Madam Speaker,  how pleased I am to see you at the podium.   This is a fantastic group of individuals who have joined us here in  Congress, and I couldn't be prouder to serve with both of you and with  others who are here as well.   The topic of this Special Order hour is so important. It has been  important to me, of course, but also to Members of Congress in general  and to communities across the country, and that is the topic of  healthcare.   I wanted to break this down a little bit, in terms of where we are on  this issue for people who are watching, because this is one of the  beauties of the Special Order hour, that we get to talk about the  issues that matter; we get to explain things; and we get to put forward  our proposals and our ideas.   I am so proud to say that, on February 27, I and my colleague,  Representative Debbie Dingell, introduced the Medicare for All Act of  2019, and we had 107 original cosponsors. Those are the folks who sign  on right as it is getting introduced.   Of course, a bill gets introduced, and we always add people on after  that. But this is 107 original cosponsors for this act that would build  upon, improve, and expand Medicare so that it covers every single  person in this country--universal healthcare, the idea that healthcare  is a right and not a privilege.   Let me start by saying that we Democrats are absolutely united around  the need to shore up the Affordable Care Act. There is no question that  there is work to do immediately on some of the things that were done to  take away access to those with preexisting conditions, to strip away  the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. We are 100 percent united  around continuing to do that.   However, we have to have a bold vision that addresses the healthcare  crisis in this country that leaves 30 million people uninsured and 40  million people underinsured, without access to healthcare.   We have to understand, in doing that, in the United States today, we  spend, depending on what estimate you look at, about $32 trillion to  $39 trillion on healthcare costs over 10 years. That is going up to  about $50 trillion over the next 10 years on healthcare. That is about  18\1/2\ percent of GDP.   If you look at every other major industrialized country in the world,  what you see is that they provide healthcare, comprehensive care, to  everybody in their country, and they do it at about half the cost, or  less, of what the United States spends.   You might think that you could look at costs of healthcare in this  country and you could say: Well, America has the best healthcare system  in the world, and that is why we spend so much. We have the best  healthcare outcomes.   Well, let's talk about that for a second. In the United States, we  spend 18\1/2\ percent of our GDP on healthcare costs, yet we have the  worst health outcomes of any peer country in the world.   Today in the United States, we have the highest maternal mortality  rate. We know what that is; that is moms dying in childbirth.   We have the highest infant mortality rate. That is kids dying at  young ages.   We have the lowest life expectancy rate of any of our peer countries.  In fact, we are the only industrialized country in the world where life  expectancy is going down and not up.   So we don't even have good health outcomes to show for our healthcare  system.   That is why Representative Dingell and I and our 105 additional  cosponsors of the bill, and Representative Tlaib and many others who  are part of this effort, have introduced the improved Medicare for All  Act of 2019.   What this bill does is it offers, first of all, comprehensive  coverage to everyone in the country. We say that that includes primary  care; it includes vision, dental, hearing; it includes mental health  and substance abuse; it includes long-term services and supports,  maternal healthcare, and more.   Everybody in the country will have access to healthcare when you get  sick, not when you need an emergency room, not when you simply can't  take your illness anymore, but when you actually get sick.   This bill is the first time that we will actually have long-term care  supports and services included in this coverage. This is very, very  important because it covers seniors, obviously, our elderly, as they  get toward the end of their life, and it includes people with  disabilities who have, traditionally, been left out of this entire  sphere.    What we do is we say that, instead of the current system where you  have to get so poor that you have to be on Medicaid--you have to have a  low level of income, be on Medicaid--if you want long-term supports and  services, and the automatic default is institutional care instead of  home care, we flip that on its head and we say you get to stay at home  with the people you love. You get to be in your home as you are dealing  with these incredible challenges that you may have.   Our bill says no premiums, copays, and deductibles. We don't want you  to have to think about that as you go to the doctor.   This is very important, because you will hear this is a government  takeover of healthcare. That is what opponents of my bill are already  trying to tell you.   I want you to hear this really clearly, if you are listening: We use  the same network of doctors and hospitals that is already here.   In fact, I bet, if we had a roomful here and I were to ask people how  many of you have been told, or have a family member or a relative who  has been told, that you can't go to a certain hospital or doctor  because it is out of network, or you only get a certain coverage if you  go, I bet everybody would raise their hands. I see people raising their  hands right now. Good for you. I feel like I have an audience here.   What our plan says is that you can go to any doctor or hospital. The  government isn't taking over those services. It is not going to be a  different government service. It is just the same as what you have  right now.   The only thing that changes is, instead of having to argue with five  insurance companies--because maybe you have Medicare and you have  Medicare Advantage; maybe you don't have anything at all; maybe you  have a combination of things put together. Instead of having to argue  with five insurance companies, you get to just say:  [[Page H2710]]  This is a government insurance program. This is covered by one  insurance program, a single payer.   If you have heard that statement, that is what that means. This is  the way that almost every industrialized country in the world does it.   I think that we have to think about what the problem is here, why  have we not been able to do this. We have, increasingly, seen our  healthcare system, unfortunately, being moved more and more to a for- profit system that puts those profits over patients.   If you look at, for example, the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in our  country today, it is so much more expensive to get insulin treatment or  cancer treatments or even an MRI in the United States. I have clients  and constituents who drive to Canada, who go to other places, because  they can't afford the drugs here, and they can buy the exact same thing  across the border for significantly cheaper.   We are having a crisis, Madam Speaker, where people are going to bed  at night thinking about how they are going to pay their rent and pay  for their cancer treatment, how they are going to afford to get the  insulin treatments that they want. People are foreclosing on homes.   In fact, two-thirds of all the bankruptcies today in the United  States are due to medical issues, medical costs. GoFundMe has become  one of the most popular insurance plans around, where people are just  banking on the goodness of people to take care of their healthcare  costs. That is simply not acceptable.   If we want to take on this question of universal healthcare coverage,  which, by the way, Teddy Roosevelt talked about in 1910, Harry Truman  in 1945, President Johnson--this is not a radical idea. It is actually  something that has been tried and tested.   But here in the United States, the idea that we could provide  universal healthcare for everybody, make sure that people get the  healthcare access that they need, this is the time for it. Seventy  percent of the American people actually agree with us. You might hear  that that support goes down if you say some other things, but let's be  really clear that the fearmongering out there is driven by for-profit  industries that, unfortunately, have a lot to lose if a plan like this  were to pass, because we would actually make sure that we are not only  providing universal coverage but that we also have cost containment  built into our system.   That is what my bill does. We build in cost containment measures so  that we can actually bring down the overall cost of healthcare in this  country to what is standard in other countries around the world.   This is incredibly important to us, and as we think about who gains  and who loses in this, I believe that it is actually a win-win for  everybody who is concerned about putting patients over profits.   It is a win-win for doctors who have been trained to take care of  patients but, instead, spend 25 to 30 percent of their time dealing  with insurance companies and trying to do all the paperwork that needs  to be there, trying to argue for a patient of theirs to be able to get  the care they need.   It is a win for hospitals that want to make sure that they know what  kind of budgets they are going to have and that they can work within  that. We have something built into our plan called global budgeting,  which is actually the standard in other countries but is being tested  in Maryland to great effect, where hospitals get an overall amount of  money, and they get a global budget. We have that built in as well.   It is a win for patients. This is the thing that is so important to  emphasize again and again.   Actually, before I get to the patients, let me say it is also a win  for our businesses, particularly our small- and medium-sized  businesses. I have a lot of business owners who might disagree with me  on a few other issues, many of them are across the aisle--they are  Republicans; they are independents. They come up to me and they say:  Representative, I don't agree with you on this or this or this, but  please, can you get the Medicare for All bill passed, because we  cannot, as small businesses and even medium-sized businesses and, by  the way, even large-sized businesses, deal with the growing cost of  these insurance premiums that we are paying that are really just going  to line the pockets of top CEOs.    The CEO of UnitedHealth took home $82 million, even as people are not  able to afford treatments and are dying. The other CEOs have taken in  $52 million, $29 million.   We have to make sure that the balance of something like healthcare,  which is an essential, I believe, a common good in this country, that  we are able to provide that to people.   There are lots of other places where markets can work, but in this  marketplace where you need to make sure that healthcare is provided to  everybody regardless of whether you are rich or poor, regardless of  where you live, regardless of the color of your skin, this is where the  government comes in to try to help make sure that that is actually  possible.   This is a really important bill for us, and I am absolutely honored  to have so many of my colleagues who are so smart on these issues, not  only in liberal districts like mine but also in frontline districts,  places that were held by Republicans for a very long time.   My Democratic colleagues flipped those districts, and they ran on  this issue. They ran on this issue, and they won on this issue, because  they know, and their constituents know, that it is time to take profit  out of this system and make sure that it once again gets focused on the  healthcare of people.   We also have an incredible coalition of labor unions that have come  on board for the first time ever. Our teachers are on board, our  machinists, our steelworkers. We have so many different unions that are  on board this time.   Our disability rights community is on board.   Our women's organizations are on board, because for the first time,  we make sure that everybody gets the care they need, whether they are a  woman or a man, and we make sure that people have control over their  reproductive choices.   We are absolutely thrilled about this.   I want to be clear about one thing, as I turn this back over to my  incredible colleague from Michigan. This is not a messaging bill. I  want to be clear about that.   For the first time in the House of Representatives, this bill is over  120 pages long. It is a detailed analysis and layout of exactly how  this would work. It ensures that everybody gets healthcare. It keeps  the existing system of delivery that we have. We are not changing the  system of delivery.   It does not in any way say that insurance companies can't continue to  operate. They just can't provide the same benefits that we are  providing through the government insurance plan. That is actually the  way Medicare works right now.                                time  1515    You can't provide the same benefits because we don't want a two- tiered system.   Now, if they want to provide benefits outside of what we provide,  they are welcome to do so. That is how Medicare Advantage originally  came in to being. Medicare Advantage plans, the benefits that are  offered under those, would be included in our plan, so we wouldn't need  those plans. But insurance companies are free to continue to innovate  as they need to; and we have built in 1 percent of the cost of the bill  for the first 5 years actually goes to a fund that ensures transition  and appropriate support for workers in the insurance industries who may  actually end up having to lose their jobs or to eventually transition  into this new system that we have.   We will, for the first time, thanks to Speaker Pelosi's support, and  others' support, we will have hearings on this bill. And whether you  agree or you disagree with the premise, what I would ask is that you  understand how critical it is to address and finally get to universal  healthcare in this country.   This is a debate that should have been had on the House floor and in  our committees a long time ago. We are finally going to have that with  a number of different committees; and I am looking forward to  continuing to help lead with all of my colleagues on ensuring that  healthcare is a right and not a privilege; that you don't have to be  wealthy to get basic healthcare; and  [[Page H2711]]  that we improve the ultimate competitiveness of our businesses, our  families, our communities, and the health, the basic health, the right  to live with dignity and respect for all of our people.
