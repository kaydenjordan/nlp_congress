 Madam President, I stand again in support of  our great ally Israel.   The terror and devastation unleashed on Israel by Iran-backed Hamas  terrorists has rightly horrified the world. What I am about to describe  is difficult to say and uncomfortable to hear, but it has to be said on  the Senate floor. We cannot make this stuff up. The world must know the  atrocities that have occurred in Israel.   On the morning of Saturday, October 7, 2023, as families rose to  start a new day, make breakfast, or slowly wake up in their beds,  terror approached. Innocent families were murdered in their homes.  Babies were killed. Innocent, little babies were murdered, and some  were ruthlessly beheaded. Children were burned alive. Teenage girls  were raped and then burned alive. An elderly, wheelchair-bound woman,  who was later identified as a Holocaust survivor, was brutally dragged  through the streets of Gaza. Children who witnessed the murders of  their parents were kidnapped and are now being held hostage by Hamas.  More than 250 young people were savagely murdered while attending a  music festival in southern Israel--many shot in the back as they tried  to run away.   At least 31 Americans--31 Americans--have been killed. More than  1,400 innocent people were killed in Israel, and we have no idea how  many are being held hostage by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists in Gaza.  The atrocities are too numerous to fully recount, but the images seen  will never leave our memories.   I was sent a photo of Kfar Aza. I visited this kibbutz during a trip  to Israel  [[Page S5073]]  with AIPAC in 2019. At the time, it was full of happy families and  children, but it is now silenced by brutality and death.   This week, I talked to the individual who gave me the tour of the  village, or the kibbutz. It was a beautiful place, with nice people-- happy. I was told she is only alive because she was not there. She told  me the family who lived next door to her on the right was murdered,  that the family on her left was murdered, and that the family down the  street was murdered. I was told that the Hamas terrorists set fires to  force people out of their homes and safe rooms, and they savagely  murdered innocent Israelis--many shot at close range. She told me that  she was talking to her sister, who was in a safe room, and the Hamas  terrorists were trying to break in. Fortunately, they weren't able to.   Children were shot in front of their parents, and some have been  kidnapped to Gaza. Iran-backed Hamas terrorists slaughtered the  innocent babies in their beds. I met so many happy people there just a  few short years ago. Now I fear a lot of them are going to be dead.   We saw FOX News correspondent Trey Yingst report:         Bodies litter the town of Be'eri. You can see here it's       complete and total destruction. All of the houses are       destroyed. It looks like many were blown up with RPGs or       other explosives. People were shot and killed in their beds,       executed at point blank range. This is the most horrific       thing I have ever seen.    Thomas Hand is the father of Emily, an 8-year-old girl who was killed  by Hamas in Be'eri. Thomas had to wait 2 days before he found out that  Emily was killed.   I am the father of two daughters and am the grandfather of seven  grandchildren. Watching this father speak about the murder of his  daughter is heart-wrenching.   He said to CNN:         They just said we found Emily, and she's dead. And I went       ``Yes!'' And I smiled.    This is what he said.   He said:         I smiled because that is the best news of the possibilities       that I knew. . . . She was either dead or in Gaza.    He said:         And, if you know anything about what they do to people in       Gaza, that is worse than death.    Do you know why they murdered Emily and more than 1,400 other  Israelis and 31 Americans that these Iran-backed Hamas killers  slaughtered? Simply because they were Jewish. They killed them because  they hate Jews and want to kill every Jew.   It is unimaginable what these families have suffered. We cannot look  away. Let's remember these were Israeli and American families. The  atrocities are too numerous to fully recount, but these stories and the  images we have all seen will never leave our memories.   Not since the Holocaust has the world witnessed such a brutal attack  on the Jewish people. Sadly, the Jewish people have endured thousands  of years of hate and persecution, but this will not be the end of  Israel or the Jewish people.   Israel is surrounded by terrorist groups that want it wiped off the  face of the Earth. I have seen this firsthand during my five visits to  Israel, which has given me a clear perspective on Israel's proximity to  its enemies Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran.   I want to be clear: Hamas and Hezbollah are not religious groups.  They are not on a noble political quest for liberty or civil justice.  They are terrorist thugs, and they are killers. They are killers who  seek to eradicate the Jewish people from this Earth, and they are  funded and supported by the evil Iranian regime.   In August 2021, the Senate voted 99 to 0 for my amendment to a budget  bill to ensure that U.S. tax dollars do not benefit terrorist  organizations such as Hamas. The vote was 99 to 0. Everyone in this  body agrees American taxpayers should never fund Hamas terrorists.  Unfortunately, the final text of the bill did not include my language,  necessitating further action today.   Here is why we need the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act. In 2021,  Biden's State Department said:         We're going to be working in partnership with the United       Nations and the Palestinian Authority to kind of channel aid       there in a manner that does its best to go to the people of       Gaza.    The official went on to say:         As we've seen in life--as we all know in life--there are no       guarantees, but we're going to do everything that we can to       ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it       the most.    We all know that Hamas controls Gaza. Every dollar that goes to Gaza  comes under the control of Hamas, who decides what it is going to do  with it.   So what I heard from the Biden State Department in 2021 is that the  administration can't guarantee that American taxpayer dollars aren't  going to fund terrorists in Hamas. The Biden administration thinks the  risk of resources going to Hamas terrorists is OK because, in life,  ``there are no guarantees.''   I reject that, and I will not leave anything to chance when it comes  to preventing U.S. taxpayer money from being sent to the brutal  terrorists who have slaughtered so many Israelis and Americans.   And we know for a fact that Hamas uses humanitarian aid to support  its terrorist attacks. Look at this one. This is a humanitarian  package. It is a humanitarian UNICEF bag that was found among the  trucks used to carry Iran-backed Hamas terrorists into Israeli towns  where they brutally murdered innocent families and burned homes to the  ground. I guess there was no guarantee.   I have talked to a lot of rabbis in Florida. We have a lot of  synagogues there. They told me that they have seen lots of pictures on  Israeli TV of humanitarian rice bags and that, when people opened them,  there were bullets in them.   The administration must do better and fully control where American  taxpayer money is going. We can. We can make sure American taxpayers  aren't funding terrorists. That is why I am again asking that we pass  the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act. I am proud to have the support  of Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith, Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer, and Ted Budd on  this bill.   What this bill says--it is common sense--is that no funds will be  authorized for the territory of Gaza until the President certifies to  Congress that these funds can be spent without benefitting terrorist  organizations.   The Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act also ensures that U.S. funds  are not authorized for expenditure in the territory of Gaza through any  United Nations entity or office unless the President can certify that  it is not encouraging or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas  and propaganda. It is pretty basic.   Finally, this bill mandates that the President certify that there are  no hostages--and we know there are hostages in Gaza--being held in Gaza  by any terrorist organization.   Just this morning, President Biden announced $100 million of U.S. aid  for Gaza and the West Bank. While Iran-backed Hamas terrorists continue  attacks against Israel and hold American hostages in Gaza, I cannot  think of a more critical time to pass this bill.   Let me just finish with something that somebody reminded me of today.   I know a family in Florida who lost their sister-in-law and her  husband, and I think there were two 6-years-olds and a 3-year-old. So  here is the way it works. They lost their loved ones, but their  government is going to tax them to give money to the Palestinian  Authority that gives money to the terrorists who died while killing  their family. You can't make this stuff up.   So, I mean, this is a simple bill.   Let me now turn it over to my colleague from Indiana, Senator Braun.    Madam President, I thank my colleagues Senator  Braun and Senator Budd for joining me here on the Senate floor to pass  this important legislation.   You know, the individual who gave me the tour of the kibbutz--she was  telling me that they were just half a mile from Gaza, and before Hamas  took over the Gaza area, she used to be able to walk all the way to the  beach, and it was safe.   I think most people in America--no one is against Gazans, but to take  any chance that our money goes to Hamas before or after this doesn't  make any sense.   I think every single Member of this body can agree that the United  States shouldn't allow a single dollar of taxpayer money to get into  the hands of terrorists--funding that is being used to kill innocent  Israelis and Americans and hold our citizens and others hostage.   I look forward to my colleagues joining me today.   I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be  discharged from further consideration of S. 489 and the Senate proceed  to its immediate consideration. I further ask that the Scott of Florida  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    So I hoped my colleague would change his  position if he just read what I said. The bill doesn't say that money  can't go to Gaza; it says that no funds will be authorized for the  territory of Gaza until the President certifies to Congress that these  funds can be spent without benefiting terrorist organizations. I don't  know how anybody can disagree with that. It says that no funds are  authorized for expenditure in the territory of Gaza through any United  Nations entity or office unless the President can certify that it is  not encouraging or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas and  propaganda.   So this doesn't say money can't go to Gaza and help Gazans. This bill  says the President has to ensure that this isn't happening and rice  bags are not being filled with bullets and we are not having the PLO  give money to terrorists who killed American citizens or their  families. That is all this says, is that the money cannot go for the  benefit of Hamas. So if you disagree with what this says, then you are  saying money can go to Hamas. I don't know how else you can disagree  with it. This is so basic.    Madam President, let us just remember, what we  are talking about is, this is not against sending money to Gaza. It is  saying we have--if we are going to send money, it cannot go for the  benefit of individuals who murdered babies, raped teenage girls, and  shot people in their sleep. I mean, I don't know how anybody can ever  support giving money to Gaza when you know it is going to go to Hamas  if you are not careful. And that is exactly what this administration  said.
