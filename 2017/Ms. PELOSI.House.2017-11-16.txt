 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank  him for his superb leadership as the top Democrat on the Ways and Means  Committee. I commend him, and all of our fellow Democrats on the  committee, for standing up for the middle class in our country and  fighting for the truth and what is in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this vote today is a defining moment for our country.  Our votes today will decide the future of the American middle class and  those who aspire to it, the future of our children and our  grandchildren, and the future of the United States of America as the  land of opportunity.   Today, Republicans have brought forth a bill that is pillaging the  middle class to pad the pockets of the wealthiest and hand tax breaks  to corporations shipping jobs out of America and drastically increasing  the national debt.   The bill Republicans have brought to the floor today is not tax  reform. It is not even a tax cut. It is a tax scam. So many people have  written in about it who are affected by it, and I will submit all of  that for the Record, but I do want to say that this is not only a  defining moment, it is a moment of truth.   With straight faces and with the speed of light--I have to give them  credit; they raced this thing through in the dark of night--they are  trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class that this is in  their interest, that this is a middle-income tax cut.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Republicans are  raising taxes on 36 million middle class families.   I associate myself with the very wonderful comments of our  distinguished House Democratic whip, Mr. Hoyer, especially at the end  when he said: ``Look to your souls, not to your polls.''   I want to speak to Pope Benedict, his encyclical, God is love. It was  his first encyclical as pope, and in that encyclical, Pope Benedict  quoted the wisdom of St. Augustine.   Seventeen centuries ago, St. Augustine said: ``A state which is not  governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves.''   Benedict went on to say: ``The state must inevitably face the  question of how justice can be achieved here and now.'' And he  cautioned against the ``danger of certain ethical blindness caused by  the dazzling effect of power and special interests.''   Interesting, in light of the fact that when this bill is brought  forward, the  [[Page H9409]]  Director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, said: ``The most  excited group out there are the big CEOs, about our tax plan.''   Is that about justice?   Congressman Chris Collins said: ``My donors are basically saying, get  it done or don't ever call me again.''   Senator Lindsey Graham said: ``The financial contributions will  stop'' if this tax scam fails.   Well, he didn't say scam. I am saying scam. That is my word.   Back to the Pope and the Catholic bishops. The U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops wrote: `` . . . this proposal appears to be the first  Federal income tax modification in American history that will raise  income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large  tax cut to the wealthy.''   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops went on to say: ``This is  simply unconscionable.''   We always begin our session with prayer, and many of us attend mass  on the weekend, on Sundays. But we cannot pray and think that that  gives us a lesson to prey on people the rest of the week; and that is  what this bill does. It preys on the middle class and those aspiring to  it. It pillages and loots the middle class. It is a shameful piece of  legislation, and the Republicans should know better.   They say it is going to get better in the Senate. Oh my gosh. In the  Senate, as Mr. Hoyer pointed out, unanimously, the Senate Finance  Committee rejected this proposal already. Was it 26-0? Whatever the  number was, the zero loomed large.   But getting back to values, because that is what we are here to do,  and what we do in our budget, which the tax bill is a part of. It is  supposed to be a statement of values.   In his study of civilization, the great British historian, Arnold  Toynbee, found that, at the beginning of a hopeful country, the  political leadership formed a creative minority that inspired and led  the flowering of civilization. But in some nations, leaders became a  dominant minority of ``exploiters, focused on their own wealth and  power.   Arnold Toynbee, welcome to the Republican side of the aisle and  Congress.   These competing mindsets, he went on, between the dominant minority  of exploiters versus the creative minority that inspired and led the  flowering of civilization, these competing mindsets and motivations  create schisms in the body social and schisms in the soul of the body  politic.   And lo and behold, the Republican Party has written a bill, nearly  half of the benefits go to the top 1 percent--top 1 percent in our  country--and 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 2 percent. This  is a defining moment, but it is also a moment of truth   How can the Republicans, with a straight face, say to the middle  class: Well, we are doubling this or doubling that? Give with one hand,  take with another.   And to hear them cheer, hear them cheer for the provision in here  about the estate tax?   Listen to this. You tell me if you think this is fair.   1,800 families in America--not your family farmer. Everybody is taken  care of in what we have done already with the estate tax.   In this bill, 1,800 of the wealthiest families, the filers in our  country, will, in the life of the bill, get the break of $172 billion;  1,800 families. This is for 1,800 families.   And you know what? The Republicans cheered that; 1,800 families are  going to get $172 billion.   They cheer the fact that up to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts goes to  corporate America, while, at the same time, giving them another tax  break to send jobs overseas; at the same time, absolving them of any  responsibility when it comes to State and local taxes; while insisting  that individuals lose the State and local tax deduction, but  corporations do not.   And listen to all of it. Were they cheering when they are saying to a  teacher--hear their cheering when they say to a teacher: You may bring  supplies to your school because your school and classes need that? God  bless you for that. But we are taking away the tax deduction that goes  with that.   What? Is that something to cheer about?   They are saying to students who get a $2,500 tax deduction on  interest on student loans: Forget about that. Even though it may make  the difference between your attending college or not, forget about  that. We are too busy giving a tax cut to the 1,800 wealthiest families  in America so they can get $172 billion in tax breaks over the next 10  years.   They are saying to families, whether they have a child with a  disability, a senior with Alzheimer's, and everything in between: If  you have extraordinary medical expenses, and, since 1944, you have been  able to deduct them, no more. No more, because we have got to give it  to the high end. So take that away.   Do you have any idea what that means to America's working families,  and what it means for them if they have Alzheimer's?   We had one person come to our event in San Francisco last week from  Barbara Lee's district. She said there was over $170,000 in costs for  her because her husband has Alzheimer's. The tax deduction enabled them  to survive. She said: I can't even imagine the cruelty that decided  that this should happen in this tax bill.   So understand what this means in people's lives, and tell the truth  about it. Tell the truth about it.   Republicans want you to believe that their trickle-down tax break for  the rich will pay for itself. Never has happened.   As Bruce Bartlett, architect of Jack Kemp's supply-side economics  said, ``It is not true,'' that this trickle-down economics pays for  itself. ``It is not true. It is nonsense.'' And he went on to say it  was ``BS,'' in the full extent of those words.   This tax scam won't create jobs. It won't raise wages. It will only  fill the coffers of the donors and the fat cats. The GOP tax scam will  add trillions to the debt and stick our children with a bill that you  cannot pay off.   And none of us will probably be around by the time the full impact of  the hemorrhaging of the debt in the second 10 years of this bill will  require big tax increases. Look to the Kansas example.   As I like to say to the Caucus, Mr. Speaker, maybe I have to use my  mother-of-five voice to be heard. But as a mother of five and a  grandmother of nine, we are supposed to be thinking about our children  and their futures, and our grandchildren and their futures.   God willing, one day some of you will have grandchildren. I always  ask the question: Do they breathe air? Do they drink water?   Why are you messing that up in other areas of our policymaking here?   But getting back to this. The tax scam won't create jobs. It won't  raise wages. As I said: It will only fill the coffers of donors and the  fat cats.   This GOP tax scam will add trillions to the debt. Oh where, oh where  are the deficit hawks? Have you become extinct? Is there not one among  you who understands what this does to the national debt?   And with all due respect to your leader, for him to put at our  doorstep the debt, when it was a creation--President Bush went into  office on a path from President Clinton of deficit reduction. The last  five Clinton budgets were in balance or in surplus. President Bush  turned that around by repealing pay-as-you-go. Tax cuts for the wealthy  didn't trickle down. Two unpaid-for wars, giveaways to PHARMA, the  pharmaceutical industry, taking us to a place--remember September of  2008, when we were in the worst economic downturn since the Great  Depression?   But anyway, back to here. As Republicans know, our Republican friends  have already shown us their playbook. In this bill, corporations will  get a cut of $1.5 trillion--the same $1.5 trillion that Republicans  plan to slash from Medicare and Medicaid in the GOP budget.   In their bones, the American people know they are getting a raw deal  under the Republican bill before us. You know it. You know why you are  here. You know what you are doing.   Democrats believe the American people deserve better, a better deal,  better jobs, better wages, better future. We want to create good-paying  jobs, raise workers' wages, lower the cost of living for families, give  Americans the tools  [[Page H9410]]  they need to succeed in the 21st century. But you can't do that if you  have a budget that does not invest in that future and is hampered by  the cuts.                                time  1315    Let's go back to the drawing board. Let's write a bipartisan bill  that raises wages, creates jobs, promotes growth, and reduces the  deficit. To get to that place, we want to go to the table in a  bipartisan way. What are you afraid of? In a bipartisan way, let's put  together a tax bill that is good for the American people instead of one  that does violence to the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``no'' and to demand a better bill for America's working families.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops' fabulous statement about this tax bill.                                        United States Conference of                                                Catholic Bishops,                                   Washington, DC, November 9, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Decisions about taxation involve       fundamental concerns of ``justice and equity'', with the goal       of taxes and public spending ``becoming an instrument of       development and solidarity'' (Mater et Magistra, 132;       Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, no. 355). On       October 27, the USCCB offered six moral principles to guide       debate on tax reform, centered on care for the poor and       concern for families. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017       contains many fundamental structural flaws that must be       corrected. As currently written, the proposal is       unacceptable.        Care for the Poor. Doubling the standard deduction will       help some of those in poverty to avoid tax liability, and       this is a positive good contained in the bill. However, as       written, this proposal appears to be the first federal income       tax modification in American history that will raise income       taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a       large tax cut to the wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.       The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation       (JCT) indicates that by 2023 this tax plan will raise taxes       on average tax payers making between $20,000 and $40,000 per       year. Taxes for this group will be raised again in 2025, and       again in 2027. Taxes will also increase on average taxpayers       earning between $10,000 and $20,000 in 2025. The federal       poverty line is $12,228 for one person, and $24,339 for a       two-parent family with two children. Nearly one in three       Americans live in a family with income below 200% of the       poverty line. Meanwhile, average taxpayers who make over $1       million experience dramatic tax cuts for the same periods. No       tax reform proposal is acceptable that increases taxes for       those living in poverty to help pay for benefits to wealthy       citizens.        Several other tax provisions that assist the working poor       and others who may struggle economically are also eliminated,       including:        the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which incentivizes hiring       of the disabled, veterans, those who have been unemployed for       long periods, and individuals receiving federal poverty-      related assistance;        the tax deductions to reduce the burdens of tuition and       student loans;        the income tax credit to persons who retire on disability;        the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes,       which may impact people in higher tax states;        the tax deduction for employee business expenses; and        tax incentives to employers and employees to help with       moving expenses for a new job.        Strengthening Families. Society, in Pope Francis' words, is       in ``debt'' to the family. The family is the most important       institution in society because education, formation, and care       for the human person, especially children, take place more in       the family than anywhere else. Expanded access to schools of       choice is a positive step in this legislation, and we would       encourage Congress to go even further by empowering more       parents in directing their child's education. We also       appreciate that the legislation recognizes unborn children as       eligible beneficiaries for parents' 529 education savings       account contributions.        However, this tax plan places new and unreasonable burdens       on families, especially those who welcome life or experience       serious hardships:        It removes the adoption tax credit which provides important       and life-affirming assistance for families to adopt children       desperately in need of love and support.        The plan also repeals the exclusion for adoption assistance       programs, which allows a family to exclude money paid by an       employer for adoption costs up to the amount of the adoption       tax credit as an alternative. This exclusion also allows       those who adopt a child with special needs to receive the       full value of the exclusion regardless of actual adoption       costs.        Eliminating the credit and exclusion sends the wrong       message about our national priorities, which ought to protect       life, strengthen families, and affirm the value of every       human being. The savings to society from children finding       loving homes is well beyond any revenue lost due to the       credit and exclusion.        It eliminates the personal exemption. Even with the       doubling of the standard deduction, some larger families will       pay more, including many two-parent families with more than       three children, and single-parent families with more than one       child. It is laudable that the child tax credit has been       expanded and removes the marriage penalty. However, the       modest increase in the credit does not fully compensate for       the elimination of the personal exemption for some larger       families. Moreover, because the child tax credit only remains       refundable up to $1,000, lower income families will get no       additional benefits from the child tax credit, while       suffering the full loss of the personal exemption.        It eliminates the out-of-pocket medical expenses deduction       for families facing serious or chronic illness.        It eliminates tax incentives to employers to provide       dependent care assistance or child care. The family       flexibility credit, at $300 per taxpayer, is some help, but       is set to expire after five years and does not offset the       greater losses.        It eliminates the qualified tuition reduction for children       of teachers, which will raise taxes on educational       institutions and disrupt family arrangements.        It repeals mortgage tax credit certificates, which are only       available for first-time home buyers under certain income       thresholds.        Other aspects of the plan also have consequences for       families. By creating stricter rules around parents' social       security numbers, the plan makes it more difficult for       immigrant taxpayers to receive the Child Tax Credit or the       Earned Income Tax Credit for their families, or to receive       assistance in seeking advancement through education.        Progressivity of the Tax Code. Pope St. John XXIII wrote       that a progressive tax code is required by ``justice and       equity.'' The ``Unified Framework,'' upon which this tax plan       was based, promised that any new tax code would be ``at       least'' as progressive as the present code. This plan breaks       that promise. It raises taxes on the working poor, while       simultaneously providing large tax breaks to high-income       taxpayers. It also repeals the estate tax (which applies to       the estates of single people valued at more than $5.5 million       and married couples valued greater than $11 million), and       eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which was       designed to prevent high-income earners from avoiding tax       liability through loopholes. In the years that the working       poor suffer a tax increase under this bill, millionaires and       billionaires will see significant tax decreases. This must be       fixed. Those who stand to benefit the most from proposed tax       policies ought to be the ones to bear most of the risk       associated with them, rather than those who are struggling       and in need.        Adequate Revenue for the Common Good and Avoiding Future       Cuts to Poverty Programs. The state has a legitimate role in       promoting the common good, and a legitimate interest in       collecting taxes to do so. This tax plan, by design, will       result in a nearly $1.5 trillion deficit over ten years. Even       with the potential benefits of economic growth from       individual and corporate tax cuts--which cannot be       guaranteed--the poor should not be the ones to finance these       changes. Undoubtedly, the deficit will be used as an argument       to further restrict or end programs that help those in need,       programs which are investments to help pull struggling       families out of poverty. Repeal of the AMT and estate tax       alone comprise a good portion of the deficit that is built       into the plan. Rather than exploring even modest reductions       to these dramatic cuts for the wealthiest, the bill raises       taxes on the vulnerable and creates a strong incentive to cut       the social safety net.        Incentive for Charitable Giving and Development. Doubling       the standard deduction will bring tax relief to many people.       However, for those who give to charity, it will make the       charitable deduction increasingly a benefit only available to       high income families. An ``above-the-line'' deduction would       incentivize and assist charitable giving at all income       levels, and increase the amounts people can give. It would       also guard against a multi-billion-dollar decrease in       charitable giving that this plan would otherwise cause,       shrinking civil society and cutting income to nonprofits that       help the poor, just as government aid to the poor is       jeopardized, as noted above. By and large, money given to       charity helps those in need. The tax code should encourage       voluntary association, mutual aid, and a culture of giving,       helping rather than hurting groups that will be asked to do       more for the poor in the days ahead. Similarly, this plan       will lower the value of affordable housing and community       revitalization incentives. Public-private partnerships that       benefit the poor and the greater community should not be       discouraged.        Because tax policy is far-reaching, Congress must provide       ample time for Americans to discuss the complexities of these       reforms and fully understand their effects. The current       timetable does not provide adequate time for that discussion.       In many ways, this legislation is unacceptable in its present       form and requires amendment. It must be changed for the sake       of families--the bedrock of our country--and for those       struggling on the peripheries of society who have a claim on       our national conscience.            Sincerely,      Most Reverend Frank J. Dewane,        Bishop of Venice, Chairman, Committee on Domestic  [[Page H9411]]       Justice and Human Development.      Most Rev. George V. Murry, S.J.,        Bishop of Youngstown, Chairman, Committee on Catholic       Education.      Most Reverend Oscar Cantu,        Bishop of Las Cruces, Chairman, Committee on International       Justice and Peace.     I return to one of their statements: `` . . . this  proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification in  American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while  simultaneously providing a large tax cut for the wealthy.''   The Senate is not going to make it better. They have already said  they are raising taxes on those making under $75,000 and giving tax  cuts to the wealthy. They have already said they are going to take  affordable care away from 13 million Americans.   I don't know how that is making it better. That might be something  you applaud, but I certainly hope you would not vote for it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind all Members to direct  their remarks to the Chair and not to others in the second person.
