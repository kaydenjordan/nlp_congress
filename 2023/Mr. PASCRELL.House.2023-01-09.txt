 Mr. Speaker, I rise in rigorous opposition to this  shortsighted bill, but thank you for allowing us the opportunity to lay  the facts on the table.   I mean, it is stunning that while you peddled those falsehoods, you  seek at the same time to add $114 million to the deficit. The chairman  said it. Everybody said it.   Republican budget cuts have left the IRS with 2,284 fewer skilled  auditors to keep wealthy taxpayers from cheating than it had in 1954.  That makes no sense. You know it is more complicated. We taxed work  before. Now we tax assets, and we cover them up when we do our taxes.   Who the heck are you kidding? The GOP plan would aid and abet a flood  of tax cheating by Wall Street tycoons. That would be the direct impact  of this bill. Thankfully, it is going to be dead on arrival when it  goes to the other side of the building.   Republicans love that our massive tax gap keeps growing, and they  want to make it worse.  [[Page H86]]
