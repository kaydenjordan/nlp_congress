 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for  his reminding us of the World Civility Day and its importance. I rise  today in the spirit of civility, facts, and bringing people together.   First of all, we are all saddened by the surge of crime across  America, and we are working with our communities, those who intervene,  and those who are responding to the issues of depredation and danger  that permeates many of our communities and many of our young people.   I believe it is important to ensure that the excessive amount of guns  that are trafficked illegally are taken off the street. Soon in my  community we will hold a gun buyback with the Houston Police Department  because they are working with the community.   So I think it is important to state the fact that the Obama  administration, President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris  are strong advocates and have invested much to ensure that crime goes  down. We know that it is a mixture of the toxicity of the COVID-19  pandemic, poverty, and, of course, those who are inclined to do the  crime.   With that in mind, it is very important to factually make the point  that there is nothing in the Biden administration's agenda or its  funding packages or those of Democrats that deal with the defunding of  police. We are reimagining and working with our communities  collectively. As we say: Police community relations will improve and  continue to improve, one, the finding of those who perpetrate the crime  for them to be brought to justice fairly because crime does not look to  the color of one's skin. It is without discrimination and hits all of  America.   So I am very proud to have been an original cosponsor and lead on the  Victims of Crime Act that was signed by the President last week that  ensured that our communities will now have a victims fund that our  States will be able to deal with.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to go home and  interact with the victims of crime. Show them that you care and work  with your communities so that they are compensated in the full.   Let me also indicate that it is appropriate for us to move on H.R.  40. An enormity of Members of Congress have sponsored the commission to  study slavery and develop reparation proposals. In civility, this would  give us an opportunity to have a first federal conversation on race for  a full discussion and analysis of the economy, political,  psychological, scientific, and sociological effects of slavery in the  United States.   The legislation makes no judgment on how to respond to the slavery of  African Americans that began its sinful roots 401 years ago, but it  points us to developing a response and a repair to deal with what is a  continuing stigma of institutional racism. Mr. Speaker, you cannot  ignore the disparities that exist in the community, and we cannot  ignore the opportunity to have that discussion.   I am very grateful for the wide variety of individuals from the East,  the West, the North, and the South of varying political perspectives  who have supported this, the religious organizations that have  supported this, the social justice organizations, or just plain people  who raise their voices--57 percent in a recent poll.   So let us look forward to repairing, being a repair, the repairers.  We know that our beloved pastor and leader who has provided us with the  words that he is the repairer of the breach, and we thank him for that.  And we thank all those who are willing to have a civil discussion to  ensure that we can end the surge of crime and the scourge of crime and  as well be able to discuss race in a manner of civility in a way that  we can come together and repair it.   I know that it is the intent of those who cosponsored the bill and  all of the vast supporters across America. It is certainly my intent as  the lead cosponsor after the Honorable John Conyers, and I know it is  the intent of the Congressional Black Caucus and all those who raise  their voices for a civil discussion on the question of race. I think  America is that good and better than that to be able to say that we can  have that civil discussion. As has been said in our meetings of the  Congressional Black Caucus: our power and our message.                            ____________________
