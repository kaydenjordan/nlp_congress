 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, we are here tonight to talk about  these amazing bills coming up having to do with our investment in the  United States of America, both in the bipartisan infrastructure bill  and the Build Back Better Act.   These two bills taken together will create millions of American jobs  rebuilding our infrastructure and building clean energy technology to  combat climate change. Together, the Build Back Better Act and the  infrastructure package are expected to create 2 million jobs a year on  average. They will reward work by cutting taxes for working families  and lowering costs on the things that keep folks up late at night, like  healthcare, childcare, and home care for aging relatives.  [[Page H6111]]    We are going to pay for that investment and those investments in our  Nation and in working families by making sure that the ultra-wealthy  and the corporations pay their fair share.   The Build Back Better Act will not add to the deficit, and no one  making less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in taxes. That  is the promise that President Joe Biden made, and we intend to keep it.   Now, Madam Speaker, we have here Representative Brian Higgins of  Buffalo. He is a ninth-term Member from western New York, and prior to  serving in Congress, Representative Higgins was a history and economics  instructor at SUNY Buffalo State College. Representative Higgins also  served in local and State elected office. Congressman Higgins has been  a fierce advocate of stronger regional and national economic policies.   Congressman Higgins currently serves on the Ways and Means and Budget  Committees. Congressman Higgins is also the Democratic chair of the  House Northern Border Caucus. Congressman Higgins is the chair of the  House Cancer Caucus, and he is a House lead on the Canada-United States  Inter-Parliamentary Group.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I have been listening to our  colleagues across the aisle complaining about so-called socialist tax  increases that we have in store.   Does the gentleman know what the top marginal tax rate under the  Eisenhower administration was?    I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Ninety-one percent under the Republican Eisenhower  administration during the 1950s.   And what happened to that 91 percent, if the gentleman knows?    We are talking about the top marginal tax rate, which  is in the 30s right now. Am I correct in that?    You can continue.    Madam Speaker, I want to talk about a few things. I  want to talk about jobs, tax cuts, and lower costs for American  families.   First, jobs. Together, under the Biden administration, we have  already created nearly 5 million jobs this year. Growth is up. Wages  are up. And unemployment right now is down below 5 percent.   Together with Build Back Better, the bipartisan infrastructure bill  will create millions more jobs, good-paying jobs, American jobs, union  jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced, cannot be offshored.   This infrastructure package makes the largest Federal investment in  public transit ever. It is the largest Federal investment in passenger  rail since the creation of Amtrak.   In Pennsylvania alone, the State will be opened up to over 3 million  people with access to Amtrak. In northeastern Pennsylvania, Amtrak has  assessed that adding a line to reach northeastern Pennsylvania will add  $87 million a year in additional economic activity in Pennsylvania.   These are amazing, smart investments, investments that we have to  make in our country if we expect to compete with Europe, with China,  with Russian, places that are investing in their infrastructure.   We are talking about the largest investment in clean drinking water  and wastewater infrastructure in American history. This is how we avoid  catastrophes like what happened in Flint, Michigan, where little kids  got brain damage from drinking lead-tainted water from pipes that  hadn't been replaced in over 100 years.   This infrastructure investment will ensure that every American has  access to reliable high-speed internet. This is the kind of investment  that the Federal Government knows how to make. This is the kind of  effort that we have succeeded at before because we have seen it.   Eighty years ago, it was the Rural Electrification Act, which brought  electricity to places in America that did not have it and would not  have it today if the government hadn't brought that into effect. The  Rural Electrification Act did essentially the same thing with  electricity that we intend to do with broadband internet access.   We can't leave people behind. That is what we do if we continue on  the same path we are on.   This infrastructure bill helps us tackle, maybe most importantly, the  climate crisis by making the largest investment in clean energy  transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in history. Build Back  Better will work with the infrastructure package to make even more  investments in electric vehicles and other clean energy technology to  combat climate change while making our economy more competitive.   Rebuilding our infrastructure means rebuilding our middle class. It  means jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs.   Before I move on to tax cuts, I would like to recognize a fellow  Member from Pennsylvania, Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon. Mary Gay  Scanlon is a second-term Member representing Pennsylvania's Fifth  Congressional District. In Congress, Representative Scanlon has  continued her work as a lifelong advocate for children and families.   Representative Scanlon currently serves on the House Judiciary  Committee and the House Rules Committee. She is vice chair of the House  Committee on House Administration.   Congresswoman Scanlon and her husband, Mark, have three adult  children. They currently reside in Swarthmore with a lot of pets.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon).  [[Page H6112]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.  [[Page H6113]]    I appreciate that you mentioned potholes, and you don't have to be  from Pennsylvania to understand the scourge of potholes. I will say  that in my hometown of Scranton, there was a study done about how much  it costs car owners every year to play the pothole slalom every year  and hope that you don't damage your car. They do damage their cars, and  it costs on average $1,400 a year for car owners to drive over these  rough roads.   It is something that only the government can do, fix the roads, pave  the roads, fix the bridges. Thank you for mentioning that.   In fact, I would be remiss if I did not mention, the Susquehanna  River flows through northeastern Pennsylvania and it bisects the two  towns of Pittston and West Pittston. And there are only two bridges  over the Susquehanna at Pittston to West Pittston, and one of them is  out right now. It is out because it is really old; it hasn't been  maintained properly because the money wasn't there, the investment  wasn't made, and we didn't get the job done. This is exactly why we  have to make these investments.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her time this evening.    Madam Speaker, I want to go back on the question of  infrastructure for a moment.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins),  our colleague from Buffalo.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Higgins), for his time here this evening.   Madam Speaker, we have talked about creating jobs, and Build Back  Better is about creating jobs. It is also about helping workers keep  more of their hard-earned paychecks by cutting taxes for the middle  class. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the child tax credit's  monthly tax cuts are already helping parents put gas in the car or pay  for childcare so they can go to work and help fuel our economy.   The latest data analyzed by the JEC found that these tax cuts are  generating more than $19 billion in spending in local economies each  month throughout our Nation. The data are clear: When working families  keep more of their hard-earned money, that is more money pumping into  local businesses and supporting even more jobs. That is why we are  working to continue those tax cuts and more through the Build Back  Better Act.   Democrats passed the child tax credit and the American Rescue Plan  without a single Republican vote. That is right. Every single  Republican voted against more money in the pockets of hardworking  families.   Now, it is Democrats who are working to extend the child tax credit.  This contrast could not be clearer. When Democrats control the  Congress, we cut taxes for working people. When Republicans control the  Congress, they cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires and  corporations. And they leave middle-class families out to dry.   Madam Speaker, we are joined tonight by an esteemed colleague,  Representative Paul Tonko of the Capital District of New York. He is a  six-term Member of Congress from Upstate New York and a lifelong public  servant. Throughout his career, he has been a strong fighter for the  environment and sustainable energy, and he currently serves as the  cochair for the Sustainable Energy and Environmental Coalition Caucus  and a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Representative Tonko is a longstanding champion for the working class  by advancing policies that create jobs, provide economic opportunity,  and ensure that senior citizens are able to retire with dignity.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Madam Speaker, I request a colloquy with the  gentleman from New York.   Is the gentleman trained as an engineer?    Madam Speaker, the gentleman was discussing the  necklace of communities that followed the Erie Canal. Earlier on this  evening I was talking about how Amtrak assessed that restoring  passenger rail in northeastern Pennsylvania would result in about $87  million per year of additional economic activity along the line.    Does that hold water?    It is true, isn't it, that the Build Back Better Act  and the bricks and mortar infrastructure act, they work together, they  dovetail to achieve the visions you are talking about?    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Tonko. We have  an engineer on his toes here this evening who has picked up on a lot of  the points that have been made previously.   For example, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon and Representative Tonko  both brought up the similarity between expanding broadband internet  access to all of the rural places and all the nooks and crannies and  hollers in this country. The similarity between doing that and enacting  the Rural Electrification Act 80 years ago by President Franklin  Roosevelt, if we hadn't done that so many people would have been left  behind, literally, in the dark.   If we don't do this, we are going to leave Americans behind in the  quest for knowledge and keeping up in the modern economy by use of  high-speed broadband internet.   Another thing Representative Tonko just mentioned, Madam Speaker, is  about filling jobs. I represent northeastern Pennsylvania, and I talk  to employers a lot, employers of manufacturing jobs, employers of  retail and restaurant jobs, and the lament has been constant. With  manufacturing jobs, it predated the pandemic, it was that we can't find  people trained-up to do our work. We can't find people who know how to  run CNC machines, the modern version of the lathe, to manufacture parts  in their businesses.   The Build Back Better Act includes a lot of money for workforce  development. It is a big favor being done for employers, for companies  that do manufacturing work; but it goes beyond that. As Representative  Tonko just mentioned, there are so many families, single-parent  families, where either the mom or the dad, probably predominantly the  mom, is home watching kids and doesn't have options for childcare or  for pre-K that would enable them to go out and go back to  [[Page H6115]]  work. That is what we are seeing right now after the pandemic.   In fact, we have Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in my district, and the  chief executive officer of the Greater Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Commerce  did a survey and touched on the very point Representative Tonko just  made. The survey showed that of the people who took themselves out of  the workforce because of the pandemic, in restaurant and retail jobs,  of those people, 54 percent of those who have not gone back have not  gone back because they are watching kids at home because of the  scarcity of options for childcare.   Remember, when you are working in a restaurant or retail, if you are  bussing tables, you are not making enough money to hire a nanny. You  are not making enough money to get the top option in daycare. That is  why the Build Back Better Act comes in handy.   What it does is--above all, remember this--it does a favor for those  small businesses, those employers that are trying to fill those jobs  that are open and are going begging for people to come fill them. The  Build Back Better plan, by establishing universal pre-K and also  beefing up childcare options, gives those parents the ability to go  back to work and fill those jobs and power our economy.   What do you think, Representative Tonko?    I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Tonko. The  gentleman has repeated the word ``competitive'' about three times just  now, and I couldn't think of a more appropriate word because, Madam  Speaker, it is a tough world out there. We Americans may think the  world owes us a living, but it doesn't. We have to get out there and  compete. Our businesses have to compete, and our people have to  compete.   We have to be at the top of our game to win and keep those jobs and  make sure they don't go to Europe or Russia or China. Those countries  are investing in themselves. They are building fast railroads; they are  building their roads and bridges; and they are investing in high-speed  internet--all of these things. As a result, we had better be at the top  of our game.   That is what we do with the Build Back Better Act and these  infrastructure investments.   Now, I have talked about jobs and tax cuts, but cutting costs for  American families has to be covered as well. As Representative Tonko  mentioned, this bill will save most families more than half their  spending on childcare and deliver free pre-K for every 3- and 4-year- old in America, as we talked about. That will free up moms and dads to  go to work. It will also provide money for senior care.   There are a lot of folks at home who can't leave the house because  they are taking care of an elder at home. That is another thing that  these bills help.   Just think about what it means to a working family in northeastern  Pennsylvania or anywhere else in this country that they can be freed up  to go back to work and fill jobs that are going begging right now. It  means parents can go to work and fuel our economy knowing their kids or  their elderly parents are taken care of. That is good for our entire  economy.   Now, we know that eldercare and childcare isn't the only thing  keeping parents up late at night. It is about making ends meet and  making sure they can afford good healthcare coverage. These bills beef  up the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the point where we  almost have universal healthcare in this country. That is so good  because it keeps our hospitals afloat.   Madam Speaker, do you know what happened in Pennsylvania before we  got the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act? We started  losing rural hospitals. Madam Speaker, it is no longer a theoretical  thing. When your hospital isn't there because it went under, your  actual healthcare suffered, not your coverage. Your chances of making  it if you had a heart attack or a stroke go way, way down if the local  hospitals are not financially sound and robust.   This will lower healthcare costs by strengthening the Affordable Care  Act. It is a very important part of this bill.   Madam Speaker, maybe the most important thing that people miss about  these bills that we are working on right now: The Build Back Better Act  is paid for. It is fully paid for by making sure that the ultra-wealthy  and corporations pay their fair share. It will not add to the deficit,  and no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in  taxes. In fact, working families are going to see their taxes cut  because Build Back Better rewards work and not wealth.   This contrast is worth repeating, Madam Speaker. When Democrats  control the Congress, we cut taxes for working people. When Republicans  do, they cut taxes for millionaires and corporations. No more.   As the President often says, for far too long, this economy has  worked great for those at the top while hardworking Americans who built  this country have been cut out of the deal. Democrats are dealing  working people back into the deal by building an economy that gives  them a fair shot. We are going to make sure it is paid for by asking  the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share. It is only right.   Madam Speaker, it is so important that we pass these bills.  Representative Tonko has spent some considerable time talking about the  importance of rebuilding, maintaining, and expanding our bricks-and- mortar infrastructure. That is so important. These are assets that were  passed down to us from the Greatest Generation.   Who are we to think that we don't have to maintain them, take care of  them, expand them, make them better, and make them work for a modern  economy and all the needs that American workers and businesses have to  stay competitive in the world?   I say let's pass these bills, let's get the job done, and let's  fulfill the vision for the American workers, the American people, and  our entire Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Tonko for his  comments.   Madam Speaker, you can tell when you get Congressman Tonko, a guy  from Amsterdam, New York, revved up about the Erie Canal, he is going  to give you a good speech. A good speech is what we need to be doing  right now because we have to have people understand the importance of  passing the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better Act, and  passing them together because they fulfill the vision not only of  President Biden but a vision that we have all been waiting for for the  longest time.   Representative Tonko and I have been serving our entire time in  Congress--for me, 9 years; for the gentleman, 13 years--waiting for  infrastructure to happen.   Representative Mary Gay Scanlon spoke earlier tonight about all the  infrastructure weeks we had under the past administration. We had  infrastructure week after infrastructure week. She said that as a joke  because it never happened. We just labeled weeks ``infrastructure  week,'' and nobody did anything about it under the Republican  administration.   We are here to say President Biden and the current Democratic  majority in the House are going to deliver for the people on the vision  of infrastructure and making our economy and our American people  competitive on the world stage.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
