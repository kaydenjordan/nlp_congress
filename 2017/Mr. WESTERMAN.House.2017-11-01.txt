 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington  State for not only yielding me this time and for his good work on the  Rules Committee, but for his support of my bill, H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak right now not only as a Member of  the United States House of Representatives, but also as a forester,  educated at this country's first forestry school, licensed by my home  State by exam to practice forestry. If there is an issue that I  understand that comes before this Congress, it is our forests.   As I listen to accusations from across the aisle, I trust my  colleagues are not intentionally trying to mislead, but they seem to  know so much about just what isn't so. This is a bipartisan bill with  Democratic cosponsors and it is based on sound scientific management.   Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor today to debate a rule and, as you  know, this rule is part of the process of the House of Representatives  that will conclude later this afternoon with votes not only on this  rule, but eventually on the underlying legislation.   The process of moving this bill through the House began earlier this  year, as I and a number of Members representing multiple committees  talked about and debated different ideas and what we hoped for in a  final piece of legislation. After hundreds of meetings with  stakeholders on all sides of this issue, on both sides of the aisle,  [[Page H8313]]  and countless hours of work by Members and staff alike, I believe that  the House stands ready to vote to improve the condition of our national  forest land.   However, the hard work of everyone involved will be for naught if the  Senate fails to act. For that reason, I encourage our colleagues in the  Senate to take up this legislation, debate it, offer solutions, and act  to make a difference on our national forests and our rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Our national forests are in the poorest  condition this Nation has ever seen, and will continue to degrade if we  fail to act and complete the work that has started here. However, I  believe that we have reason to be encouraged. The Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee recently held a hearing on a discussion  draft that includes similar forest management provisions as H.R. 2936,  and I know the other committees of jurisdiction are working on forest  reform legislation as well.                                time  1300    This is not only a forest health issue; it is a public health issue  that demands action. Shame on us if we continue to stand idly by and  watch our treasured national forests go up in smoke while people suffer  and die. I stand here today to encourage the House to adopt this rule  and pass this bill, therefore allowing the United States Senate to take  up the legislation, or, at the very least, something similar to it.  Pass it and allow us to meet at conference and work out the  differences. Let us present a workable solution to the President for  his signature.   This year, more than 8.8 million acres of wildfire burned, as has  been pointed out, and there is an additional 80 million acres on the  verge of spawning more catastrophic wildfires. How many more acres must  burn? How many more lives must be lost?    Mr. Speaker, how many more dreams will be ruined  before we come together to address this critical issue?   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the rule.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Bishop for his tireless  efforts to see our government do better on our Federal lands.   Mr. Chairman, I recently made a trip out to Montana to visit some of  our National Forests and the rural communities they border. These  forests, much like many areas across our country, have been mismanaged  for decades, and the ones that have not already been destroyed are ripe  to be devastated by insects, disease, or catastrophic wildfire, not  because of some action taken by the Forest Service, but just the  opposite. Because of no actions, our forests are overstocked,  underutilized, and unhealthy.   We have seen nearly 9 million acres of forest, an area larger than  the State of Maryland, go up in flames just this year, spewing tens of  millions of tons of carbon and thick smoke into the atmosphere.   Don't get me wrong. 32,000 full-time Forest Service personnel are  busy and working hard trying to manage the 193 million acres of  timberland across our great country, but they are spinning their wheels  and making very little progress.   Mr. Chairman, that is a forest the size of Texas and South Carolina  combined. According to scientists at the Forest Service, 80 million  acres of that, an area the size of the State of New Mexico, is in a  condition that is subject to catastrophic wildfire.   These fires are not only creating a forest health crisis, they are a  public health crisis. They kill trees, they kill wildlife and  livestock. These fires not only kill livelihoods, they create  unbearable health concerns and living conditions with their thick smoke  and ash. On top of all that, they are killing people.   It shouldn't be this way and it doesn't have to be this way.   This bill simply allows sound, scientifically-based forestry  practices, like the ones I learned at Yale's Forestry School, to be  implemented on our Federal forests. It will result in cleaner air,  cleaner water, better wildlife habitat, better recreational  opportunities, more plant and animal biodiversity, stronger economies,  and fewer fires, resulting in lower fire costs.  [[Page H8339]]    As we traveled through the beautiful countryside of Montana, I saw  the symbol of our Nation perched majestically atop a tree by the bank  of a clear and flowing stream. This bald eagle reminded me of a fable  by Aesop that described our situation today. It goes like this:   An eagle was soaring through the sky, when suddenly it heard the whiz  of an arrow and it felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered  down to the Earth, with its lifeblood pouring out of it. Looking down  upon the arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the haft  of the arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes.         ``Alas!'' it cried, as it died, ``We often give our enemies       the means for our own destruction.''    Mr. Chairman, our enemies aren't our colleagues across the aisle.  Many support this bill and some are cosponsors. Our enemies are not  environmental extremists that are impeding science and causing some  people to love our trees to death. Our enemy is not even the United  States Senate.    Mr. Chairman, our enemy is catastrophic wildfire that destroys our  forests. Our enemies are insects and diseases that kill our trees, and  we are feathering their arrows with inaction. We are feathering their  arrows with bureaucratic red tape. We are feathering their arrows with  poor policy that are killing our forests, killing our communities, and  killing us every day.   How much longer will we stand by and do nothing?   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get behind this  bill, pass it out of the House, and join me in relentlessly encouraging  the Senate to take action.   Our forests, our rural communities, our environment, and all those  areas, urban and rural alike, that are breathing the smoke and ash of  our once magnificent forests need us to act.   Every day that we delay, the problem gets worse and the enemies of  the forest are gaining ground. Please join me in this fight and pass  this bill.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. The first is from  eight groups, including the Archery Trade Association; the second is  from the National Association of State Foresters, both in support of  H.R. 2936.                                                      June 26, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Cong. Grijalva: Our organizations       which represent millions of hunters, anglers, recreational       shooters and other conservationists express our strong       support for H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of       2017. We respectfully urge you to take expeditious Committee       action on H.R. 2936, which if enacted, will improve the       health of our federal forests and reduce costly wildfires.       Our nation's federal lands play a vital role in maintaining       healthy forests that are resilient to threats at a landscape       level from fire, pests, disease and insects. Through       incentives and expedited process, consistent with informed       science, the bill will help ensure that timber harvest and       the creation of young forest habitat for wildlife remains       viable on US Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) lands. Additionally, it remedies the budget       fire-funding problem (borrowing from other line items) that       our country faces when fighting catastrophic wildfires.        Our organizations much appreciate that the fire-funding       problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic       fires occur in the western United States, this is a national       problem because the funds for every national forest and       public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the       USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated       budget line-items (for example, wildfire prevention,       wildlife, recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost       of catastrophic fire suppression, which cost now consumes       over 50% of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the       Committee to further protect the USFS budget by capping the       10-year average of catastrophic fire costs at its current       level. The USFS uses this 10-year average to build their       budget request for the President. The 10-year average       continues to rise and unless it is capped it will continue to       erode other important budget line items such as wildlife,       water quality, fire prevention and recreation as the USFS       constructs its budget request.        All forest management plans are conducted with public       input, and all projects undergo National Environmental Policy       Act (NEPA) analysis. The bill's use of the Categorical       Exclusion (CE) under the NEPA rules from the Council on       Environmental Quality, will allow routine projects with known       effects to be implemented more efficiently and cost-      effectively to achieve the forest's desired future condition,       as outlined in the forest management plan. Certain forest       management treatments previously analyzed under NEPA in order       to deal with issues such as pests and disease, hazardous       fuels, critical habitats for threatened or endangered       species, salvage facilitation, and water quality, do not need       re-analysis on each similar project. These projects are       routine, reoccurring activities with known effects, already       fully analyzed and therefore qualify for CEs from repeated       analysis.        We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the       statutorily endorsed CEs. Early successional stage forest       habitat, for instance, cannot be just incidental to be       effective in providing habitat for deer, ruffed grouse, elk,       wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other       species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an       acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the       desired forest future condition should really determine the       size of the management activity. Additionally, as stated in       the bill, all CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be       consistent with standards and guidelines in approved Forest       Plans.        Our organizations appreciate changes made to make more       prominent in federal statute the states' authority to manage       fish and wildlife on USFS and BLM lands. Nothing in the bill       language is intended to change any existing federal, state or       tribal authority. It simply makes more evident the state-      federal jurisdictional relationship which Congress has       affirmed. Federal-state cooperation in this arena is       compelled because the USFS and BLM own the land and thus the       habitat, and the state fish and wildlife agencies manage the       fish and wildlife. Robust cooperation will provide that both       land/habitat objectives and fish and wildlife population       objectives are met.        Additionally, our groups support the proposed common-sense       amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). First, the       bill overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if       additional critical habitat is designated under an approved       forest plan or resource management plan, a section 7       programmatic re-consultation of the entire forest plan needs       to be done. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the       Obama Administration argued that the section 7 consultation       needs only to be done on the portion of the project covering       the additionally designated acreage of critical habitat. This       remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating process that the       federal court decision directs. Second, the bill affirms that       no ESA section 7 consultation is required if the USFS or BLM       determine during informal consultation that the proposed       action is ``not likely to adversely affect a species or       designated critical habitat'', which is already USFWS policy.       And third, if any consultation on a categorical exclusion       established by the bill is not concluded after 90 days, the       action shall be considered to have not violated section       7(a)(2) of the ESA.        We also support the bill's provisions expediting large       scale restoration after catastrophic wildfires. We likewise       support the prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary       injunctions. It is imperative that we work to restore       wildfire-impacted lands for the ecological health of the       immediate area and surrounding landscape, protection of the       watershed, and economic vitality of the local communities.        Our organizations further appreciate the process relief       provided to National Forest Plans and potentially Resources       Management Plans developed by collaborative deliberation. It       is appropriate that a collaborative-developed plan, which       often takes years to deliberate and conclude, be subject to       only two options under NEPA, proceed or not proceed. It is       very reasonable to assume that the collaboratively       deliberated process has examined and rejected the other       options, and only the action or no action alternatives need       be analyzed.        The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration       process as an alternative to litigation in each Forest       Service Region is certainly welcomed. Not only is the cost of       defending the land management plan a burden on the agencies,       but the planned for management work on the ground is lost,       perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We find much       merit in this improved approach as an alternative to the       proposal in H.R. 2647 from the last Congress, and commend       Cong. Westerman and the Committee for settling on this.       Uninformed litigation has led to federal forest management by       the federal courts; we need to return forest management to       the federal and state professionals with public input as       provided for by the established processes.        H.R. 2936 makes significant improvements to and would       expedite the process that governs approval of the USFS and       BLM management plans. We urge that your Committee       expeditiously report this bill from the Committee to the       House floor. We look forward to continuing to work with you       to move this bill quickly through the legislative process.        Thank you for your consideration of our community's       perspectives.

Chairman Rob Bishop,      House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Raul M. Grijalva,      House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The       National Association of State Foresters (NASF) is pleased to       provide comments on the Resilient Federal Forests Act of       2017. NASF represents the heads of state forestry agencies in       all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the US       Territories. Through the development of comprehensive State       Forest Action Plans our members maintain a broad view of the       full set of forestry ownerships within their authority,       including federally owned forest lands. For citizens of the       United States to realize a full set of forest related       benefits, federal lands need to provide a complete and       balanced set of environmental, economic and social values.        In February of 2016 our organization adopted a formal       position on desired reforms to federal land management       policy. Suggestions are organized around:        Reforms that would allow federal lands to develop a more       balanced set of social, environmental and economic benefits;        Reforms that would lower the costs of agency       administration, planning, regulatory compliance and       litigation, and        Reforms that would enable vegetation management to be       carried out at a scope, scale and pace sufficient to create       more sustainable and resilient landscape conditions.        We feel this bill would indeed create the end results our       members support as our members want to see more active       management of federal forest lands. Expedited planning and       analysis, prompt response to catastrophic events, alternative       dispute resolution, greater collaboration and less costly       litigation are all outcomes that for which we strongly       advocate. In addition, we're encouraged to see some desired       modification to Good Neighbor Authority allowing road repair       to be part of cooperative projects, as well as support for       giving the land management agencies the opportunity to make       their own determinations of endangered species jeopardy or       adverse effects. Finally, NASF appreciates that this       discussion draft recognizes the need to solve the wildfire       suppression funding issue. We look forward to working with       the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands and       Congressman Bruce Westerman to ensure that a solution       addresses both fire borrowing and the erosion of the Forest       Service's budget over-time due to increasing wildfire       suppression costs.        We recently provided comments on federal land management       reform to the House Natural Resources Committee's       Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. One additional       suggestion we made there and would repeat here is to       ``Require that National Forest Management Plans specifically       address how they support State Forest Action Plans. In       addition, encourage regular consultation with State Foresters       by National Forest System leadership to ensure their annual       programs of work are dovetailed where appropriate.''        Thank you for this opportunity to comment. We would be       happy to answer any questions or provide any additional       information that might be of assistance.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Crapser,                                             Wyoming State Forester,          President of the National Association of State Foresters.     Mr. Chairman, I think what we have to realize is that  what is happening now is not working. Forest management plans are not  being implemented. Region 1, alone, of the Forest Service spent $1.23  million on the Equal Access to Justice Act, paying plaintiffs to sue  the Forest Service. That is just since January of 2016.   This is an attempt for the pilot program to do arbitration modeled  after baseball arbitration that keeps the ball moving forward. This  results in some kind of action taking place. It is not the Secretary of  Agriculture making the decision; it is one of a team of arbitrators who  are professionals who come together to work for solutions. That is what  we need in our forests, and that is why we don't need to include this  amendment in the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. As  the gentleman explained, this amendment does direct the Secretary of  Agriculture to study the use of unmanned vehicles, or drones, in the  responsible forest management wildland firefighting and fire  suppression.   Unmanned aerial vehicles are an emerging technology that should be  harnessed to benefit our Nation's forests. As a matter of fact, these  unmanned vehicles are being used extensively by the private sector to  look at their forests, to manage them, to equip them with remote- sensing equipment so that they can cover large areas at a large time  and gather much more accurate data than you could actually do on the  ground.   By ensuring that our land management practices utilize the cutting  edge of available technology, we can ensure the prolonged health of our  managed forests, and we can actually use this as a tool to cut down on  the number of forest fires, and a better way to respond to those fires.   I hope the gentleman will support the full bill after we add this  amendment to it so that he can actually see the implementation of his  amendment in practice.   Mr. Chairman, again, I support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, this amendment is good for the  bill. I am glad that we can work in a bipartisan way to include it in  the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition to the amendment, although, again, I am not opposed  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and  I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon catching this and pointing it  out. It has never been the intent of this bill to affect wilderness  areas, wild and scenic rivers. I believe we do have protections in  place in the bill, but this reemphasizes that.   I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work as we worked through  the process on this bill. We had some good discussions on ideas, we  were able to agree on some of those, and some of them we didn't agree  on. But this is definitely one that we agree on needs to be in there.   Although H.R. 2936 includes the important sideboards that ensure  appropriate land management practices are implemented on federally  protected and sensitive lands, this is just putting some suspenders on  with the belt.   This amendment, offered by my colleague from Oregon, builds upon the  sideboards already included in the bill, and it ensures that special  landscapes within Oregon's O&C lands are treated similarly to other  lands that are contemplated in the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I support this amendment. I,  again, want to say how much I appreciate the gentleman's work and his  passion for the forest, not only in his home State of Oregon, but  across our country.   I also want to add that, as Americans, we are very passionate about  our wilderness areas, about our wild and scenic rivers. I have some of  those in my State. And the last thing we want to do is do anything to  jeopardize those.   I believe, overall, the bill is going to be great for our forests,  but I am glad the gentleman added this amendment. He has still got time  to change his mind and support the full bill, which will be great for  Oregon and great for other States in the West.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Williams) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rothfus, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2936) to  expedite under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and  improve forest management activities on National Forest System lands,  on public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land  Management, and on Tribal lands to return resilience to overgrown,  fire-prone forested lands, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
