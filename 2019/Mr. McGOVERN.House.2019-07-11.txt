 Madam Chair, this bipartisan amendment co-sponsored by  Congresswoman Walorski will authorize $11 million for the Wounded  Warrior Service Dog Program in FY 2020, and I want to thank Chairman  Smith for including this amendment in En Bloc 11. This lifechanging  program will aid our nation's veterans by awarding grants to nonprofit  organizations that stand-up, operate, and provide free assistance dogs  to veterans and service members with physical disabilities, PTSD, or  traumatic brain injuries. Service dogs often become an integral part of  a veteran or servicemember's treatment team because they provide both  physical and emotional support--they can protect a veteran who is  having a seizure, remind them to take medications, or even create a  protective physical barrier in a crowded space.   Madam Chair, this amendment will continue to effectively expand  treatment options for our veterans and service members and I encourage  my colleagues to support it.
