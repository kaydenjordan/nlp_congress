 Mr. Speaker, all of us can agree that the most precious  gift God can give us is our children. I am a parent of four children-- four children--who all attended public education, K-12. As a parent, I  was active and participated in the local school board meetings,  teacher-parent conferences, and I was involved with the local PTA  because it was my responsibility to know what was going on in my  children's life, especially educational life.   All of us here as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, can  agree that protecting our children is one of our most important  responsibilities here in Congress. I agree with my colleagues across  the aisle that we need to protect all students, especially, I would  say, undocumented students, some of the most vulnerable students in our  society.   Last night, I introduced an amendment that would bar any local  educational agency, State agency, elementary school, or secondary  school from requesting or disclosing a student's immigration status.  Schools, I would say, are the one place in our society that students  should feel safe. My amendment would advance this principle. It would  say that our students are safe in their schools.   Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues across the aisle would have voted for  my amendment last night, then they would have voted for safety for all  of our students in school. Yet, they didn't do that. By failing to vote  for my amendment, they left our most vulnerable students hanging.
