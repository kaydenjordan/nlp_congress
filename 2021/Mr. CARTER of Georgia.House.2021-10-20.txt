 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Bobby Zarem of Savannah, Georgia, who, sadly,  passed away on September 26 at the age of 84.   A world-renowned publicist and the creator of many internationally  recognized media campaigns, Bobby's life's work put a smile on many  people's faces. He began his career in New York City, where he actively  promoted some of America's most talented individuals. Notably  recognized for his ``I Love New York'' campaign, Bobby's work touched  countless lives.   While his work took him around the world, Bobby's deep love for  Savannah was undeniable. From contributions to the Savannah Film  Festival to cofounding the Free Southern Theater, Bobby was a  passionate advocate for the arts in the Savannah community.   I am thankful for Bobby's service to Georgia's First Congressional  District, and I know his legacy will remain. My thoughts and prayers  are with his family, friends, and all who knew him during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
