 Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle, thanks for your great  work on this bill. My colleague, Congresswoman Blackburn from  Tennessee, this is an issue she has worked on for a long time--we will  just say a long time--with great passion and great diligence.   We had the subcommittee chair of the Health Subcommittee, Dr.  Burgess, go up to the facility in New Jersey recently and observe  firsthand what happens, what transpires there.   My colleague, Mr. Green, and others have talked about the number of  packages that go through the facility versus the number that are  actually inspected.    Then, I know we have all had pretty good conversations with Dr. Scott  Gottlieb, the now-Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and  he has done marvelous work with the limited tools that he has to really  ramp up their ability to try to stop these shipments of illegal  fentanyl.   For those here in the Chamber, you have to understand illegal  fentanyl. If you took a salt shaker and put, I don't know, half a dozen  grains of salt on  [[Page H5119]]  this podium and put your finger on it, it would likely go through your  skin and you would pass out and die, unless my colleague from Texas or  Tennessee here, or the House Physician, had some naloxone they could  come and revive you. It is that potent; it is that dangerous; it is  that deadly; and that is what is getting cut into heroin.   By the way, you can always trust your local heroin dealer to get the  right mixture. They are good chemists, I am sure. No, not. But that is  what is getting cut in.   That is what we are trying to stop with this legislation, this  illegal fentanyl coming in through the mail system from foreign  countries, mainly China, stop it from getting into our country.   That is why I want to commend Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Green, and others,  everybody who was involved in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I also take the floor because, over the course of this  week and next week, we will deal with more than 57 different opioid- related bills. We have heard from Republicans and Democrats. This is an  epidemic that doesn't check your party registration before it sickens  or kills or addicts somebody in your family or your community.  Throughout all this, we have had terrific support, not only from our  Members, but also from our staff and on both sides of the aisle.   There is somebody I want to single out today on our side of the aisle  who, unfortunately, has decided to pursue other endeavors. Paul Edattel  has served as the chief counsel for our Health Subcommittee since 2016  under then-Chairman Fred Upton.                                time  1415    Prior to that, he served our Health Subcommittee on an abundance of  healthcare issues, as well as being hired to be Speaker Boehner's top  health policy staffer. But timing has a funny way of getting in the way  of things, and following Speaker Boehner's decision to leave the  Congress, we were able to persuade Paul Edattel to come back to the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   In fact, when I became chairman of the committee, I remember meeting  in Speaker Ryan's office when we were just getting started, and I was  choosing the final staff and Speaker Ryan looked at me and said: I  don't care who else you keep or don't keep, but that guy over there is  the brightest guy around on health policy.   I said: I agree, and we have already reached our agreement that he  would continue on.   His service has been our gain and that of the country's. Paul has  helped lead our push on the floor on these issues with his very  talented team; and just as my colleagues and I have made this our top  issue, so has Paul. At the same time, he has ensured other critical  healthcare policy priorities continue to move through our processes.   Paul is one of the best. He is also a machine. He has been guiding  this committee on the Nation's top healthcare issues for many years,  including our comprehensive review of America's mental health laws that  we passed in, I think, a big bipartisan vote last Congress, helped  engineer through the 21st Century Cures Act, our opioids act, and so  many other pieces of legislation.   Paul is also a wonderful family man, a great individual with  tremendous integrity and insight, and we will miss his friendly smile  and unmatched understanding of how this place works. We will even miss  his unwavering support for the Buffalo Bills, if you are a Buffalo  Bills fan. If you are not, you will be glad to see him go, probably. It  has been an honor to work with Paul and call him a trusted adviser and,  moreover, a friend.   So, Paul, as you begin your new chapter in your new career, I join  with all of our Energy and Commerce Committee members and staff, I  think, on both sides of the aisle in wishing you the very best and  thanking you for your service, Paul Edattel.
