 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against  [[Page H3090]]  the latest Republican attempt to vilify and scapegoat immigrants. A few  weeks ago it was H.R. 2, the child deportation act, and now it is H.  Res. 461.   It is Republicans spending time and taxpayer dollars to trot out  stereotypes of migrants as dangerous and dirty and who knows what else.   Republicans are spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric in this resolution to  demonstrate that they are standing up for students. But we know it is  not true. Perhaps they are using this resolution to distract from the  continued attempts to ban books, to take food assistance from needy  families, and to block child tax credits which could help families  across the country.   Let's remember what Republicans are targeting with this language.  They are targeting migrants, many of them asylum seekers, who risked  their lives to come to this country and to our cities seeking safety  and stability.   They are targeting migrants trafficked by GOP Governors as a  political stunt. This resolution is part of the same stunt, designed to  sell fear and hatred, to make prime-time slot pieces on FOX News. It is  dangerous for immigrants like me and the communities that I represent.  I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.
