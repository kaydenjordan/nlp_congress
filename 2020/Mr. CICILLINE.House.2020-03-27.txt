 Mr. Speaker, this is a public health crisis unlike any  other in modern history.   Since day one of this pandemic, House Democrats have been focused on  two things: saving lives and supporting families, workers, and small  businesses. That is why we moved swiftly in recent weeks to pass two  bipartisan relief packages that provided billions of dollars for  medicine, protective gear, and lab tests; low interest loans for small  business; emergency paid leave; and free coronavirus testing.   Yet we understood more needed to be done for working families. Mitch  McConnell still tried to use this third package to put huge  corporations first, but Democrats fought to make this bill about the  folks who really need help.   Thanks to the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and our extraordinary  committee chairs, that is what this bill does for healthcare workers on  the front lines of this fight and the working folks and small business  owners struggling to get by.   That is why this bill provides $130 billion for hospitals to treat  patients and to protect workers, $360 billion in relief for small  businesses, $250 billion  [[Page H1825]]  in direct cash payments to workers and families, and an average of 4  months of full pay for workers who are laid off because of this crisis.   Let's pass this bill now.
