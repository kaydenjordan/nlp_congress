 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1195, the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   Ensuring workplace safety for all American workers, especially our  Nation's caregivers, is an issue of the utmost importance and is  deserving of a serious and thorough solution. I agree with my  colleague; we all appreciate what healthcare workers have done. I do  every day, but particularly since we have had COVID.   H.R. 1195 purports to take a responsible approach to the issue of  workplace violence, but legislation that results in a rushed and overly  prescriptive rule that omits important input from stakeholders and  experts, while driving up compliance costs for already struggling  industries, is far from a sensible solution. Yet, that is what we are  asked to consider today.   Workers in the healthcare and social services industries are at an  increased risk of workplace violence, with the Bureau of Labor  Statistics finding they are five times more likely to experience  violence in the workplace than workers in other industries.   While the threat is real, the response the Democrats are proposing to  address the situation, to further their own partisan agenda, is not  grounded in reality.   Workplace violence is already a well-recognized hazard by employers  and employees in the healthcare and social services industries.  According to a 2018 American Hospital Association survey, 97 percent of  respondents indicated they already have workplace violence policies in  place.   In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA,  is already enforcing workplace violence prevention measures, issuing  citations to employers who fail to provide safe workplaces during both  the Obama and Trump administrations.   The agency is also working on a rule through the standard OSHA  rulemaking process and has announced plans to initiate a Small Business  Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act panel, a key part of the rulemaking  process that allows the agency to gather valuable feedback from small  businesses before a regulation is written.   H.R. 1195 is particularly ill-timed and ill-advised as it forces OSHA  to issue an interim final rule on workplace violence within 1 year,  which will significantly strain healthcare facilities that are  heroically working on the front lines, responding to a once-in-a- century pandemic.   The CBO recently estimated the cost of this bill to private entities  would be at least $1.8 billion in the first 2 years that the rushed  OSHA rule is in effect and $750 million annually after that. The cost  to public facilities will be at least $100 million in the first 2 years  and $55 million annually after that.   Financially struggling healthcare facilities, such as rural hospitals  that are already at risk of closure, cannot afford a rushed and costly  government-imposed mandate from Washington bureaucrats.   The House is considering H.R. 1195 at a time when the Biden  administration is also considering a burdensome, overreaching emergency  temporary standard, ETS, on COVID-19. Though OSHA is weeks behind in  deciding whether to issue the ETS, handing down two expensive, punitive  Federal mandates on an already burdened healthcare industry could be  the straw that breaks the camel's back.   There may be a time and place where a workplace violence regulation  is appropriate, but now is certainly not it.   While I cannot support H.R. 1195, I want to be clear. The safety of  our Nation's healthcare and social service workers is not a partisan  issue. Republicans offered a workable solution at a recent committee  markup and were willing to negotiate with our colleagues across the  aisle on a compromise, one that requires OSHA to analyze a rule  properly, heed appropriate and necessary input from stakeholders, and  launch an educational campaign on workplace violence prevention.   Yet, here we are, considering another Democrat bill being pushed  through with no Republican input.   Healthcare workers are familiar with the Hippocratic oath: ``First,  do no harm.'' In its rush to judgment, H.R. 1195 does great harm. By  short-circuiting the public input process and prescribing a specific  result from the beginning, this bill will not achieve what it aims to  accomplish.   Our healthcare workers and caregivers deserve an evidence-based and  effective solution that protects them in the workplace. H.R. 1195 fails  to deliver this result.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1195 does not allow for a solid, well-researched foundation for  a national workplace violence prevention standard. Input from experts  and stakeholders is vital as OSHA undertakes rulemaking on this issue.   In February 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  CDC, published its research agenda for healthcare and social  assistance. The research agenda identifies the information and actions  most urgently needed to improve safety in the industry.   The CDC identified the following concerns regarding the current state  of research on the issue of healthcare workplace violence:         Many existing studies have evaluated workplace violence       risk factors and prevention measures, but most lack the       comprehensive, facility- and work area-specific perspective       that is needed to effectively prevent workplace violence.       Additionally, many of these studies examine the effects of       training programs, showing little impact on workplace       violence incident and injury rates.    We should heed the words of caution from CDC regarding our current  knowledge base, and we should make sure OSHA receives input from all  perspectives, including smaller healthcare providers, before it enacts  a national standard.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we have discussed today, workplace violence is a very real and  persistent issue for healthcare and social service workers.   The Democrat title of H.R. 1195, the Workplace Violence Prevention  for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, presupposes that the  rushed, overly prescriptive, and complex Federal regulation required by  this bill will somehow prevent workplace violence.   However, a true solution to violence in the workplace will not be in  the form of a Federal regulation. Rather, a broader, bipartisan  approach is needed to address the root causes of this serious and  complicated issue.   According to the American Hospital Association, increases in assaults  in healthcare facilities are being driven, in part, by growing numbers  of behavioral healthcare patients being treated in emergency  departments and other acute-care settings.   The opioid and drug abuse epidemic is another major contributing  factor to workplace violence, as healthcare workers are often tasked  with treating patients that may be under the influence of potent drugs  or experiencing their painful side effects.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1195 does nothing to address these realities.   Ultimately, an OSHA workplace violence regulation that is written  under the standard rulemaking process will be much more informed and  effective because it will require evidence-based input related to  behavioral health and opioid abuse that are responsible for many  workplace violence incidents.   But as I said earlier, we need to roll up our sleeves and develop a  comprehensive, bipartisan response to address the root causes of this  serious and complicated issue.   Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1195, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the American Hospital Association, AHA, is opposed to  H.R. 1195.   In a letter to Education and Labor Committee members prior to the  committee markup last month, AHA stated: ``However, because hospitals  have already implemented specifically tailored policies and programs to  address workplace violence, we do not believe that the OSHA standards  required by H.R. 1195 are warranted, nor do we support an expedited  approach that would deny the public the opportunity to review and  comment on proposed regulations.''   Further, AHA explained:         The prohibitive costs that the mandates in H.R. 1195 would       impose on America's hospitals, particularly on those that       provide care in rural and underserved areas, could strain       scarce resources and jeopardize patient care.        These mandates would burden healthcare providers that are       struggling to maintain services during the most deadly public       health emergency in 100 years.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from the American  Hospital Association.                                  American Hospital Association,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2021.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Courtney: On behalf of our nearly 5,000       member hospitals, health systems and other health care       organizations, and our clinician partners--including more       than 270,000 affiliated physicians, 2 million nurses and       other caregivers--and the 43,000 health care leaders who       belong to our professional membership groups, the American       Hospital Association (AHA) writes regarding the Workplace       Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service       Workers Act (H.R. 1195).        Your bill would direct the Secretary of Labor to issue--on       an expedited timetable--and Occupational Safety and Health       Administration (OSHA) standard requiring employers in health       care and social services to develop and implement a       comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan. America's       hospitals and health systems are committed to a culture of       safety for every worker, patient and family member who enters       our facilities. However, because hospitals have already       implemented specifically tailored policies and programs to       address workplace violence, we do not believe that the OSHA       standards required by H.R. 1195 are warranted, nor do we       support an expedited approach that would deny the public the       opportunity to review and comment on proposed regulations.        Further, the prohibitive costs that the mandates in your       bill would impose on America's hospitals, particularly on       those that provide care in rural and underserved areas, could       strain scarce resources and jeopardize patient care. These       mandates would burden health care providers that are       struggling to maintain services during the most deadly public       health emergency in 100 years. For these reasons, we must       oppose H.R. 1195 and urge the Committee on Education and       Labor not to report it favorably.  [[Page H1860]]          H.R. 1195 Would Impose Burdensome Unfunded Mandates and Prohibitive                             Costs on Hospitals         According to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO)       estimate of your bill in 2019, in the first two years in       which the OSHA final rule would be in effect, the cost to       private entities would be at least $2.7 billion and at least       $1.3 billion each year thereafter.        CBO concluded that ``substantial personnel and capital       costs would be imposed by the requirements for training,       investigation, engineering, and infrastructure changes.''       Such costs are unsustainable. A recent report by Kaufman-Hall       forecasts that total hospital revenue in 2021 could be down       between $53 billion and $122 billion from pre-pandemic       levels. In addition to lost revenue, hospitals must absorb       increases in many expenses due to COVID-19. These losses come       on top of the historic financial crisis that hit the hospital       field last year, with an AHA report estimating total losses       for the nation's hospitals and health systems to be at least       $323 billion through 2020.        HOSPITALS ALREADY STRIVE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE         Hospitals and health systems depend on compassionate,       skilled, trained, and dedicated men and women to support and       carry out their core mission of caring for people. As a       result, they view the safety and well-being of employees as a       top priority and take seriously their responsibilities to       ensure a safe workplace free of all forms of violence--      whether such violence results from encounters between staff       and patients and/or their families, staff-to-staff aggression       and harassment, or the intrusion of community conditions and       community violence into the workplace. Hospitals are focused       on violence prevention within their facilities and in the       communities they serve.        To support hospitals' efforts, the AHA has implemented a       cross-association effort to develop tools and resources to       highlight and share with the field numerous programs and       resources to combat violence within the hospital and the       community. We have encouraged OSHA to support hospitals'       efforts by sponsoring research to identify best practices for       various workplace settings and circumstances and widely       disseminating information about these proven best practices       to the health care field.        Hospitals have established organization-wide initiatives to       address workplace violence. As the most recent Hospital       Security Survey conducted in 2018 by AHA's Society for       Healthcare Engineering and Health Facilities Management       reveals, workplace violence policies are in place for 97% of       respondent facilities and 95% have active-shooter policies.       Further, nearly three-quarters of hospitals responding (72%)       conduct security risk assessments at least annually, with       almost half using a combination of in-house and outside       security experts to conduct these assessments. Moreover, in       response to the increasing challenges of maintaining secure       environments, a majority of hospitals are using aggressive       management training as a proactive way to prevent the       occurrence of security incidents and to be better prepared to       respond effectively when incidents arise.        A majority of hospitals, working in tandem with security       officers and front-line staff, have adopted programs to train       all clinical staff to de-escalate security situations before       they erupt. Hospitals have created these programs in-house       and tailored them to their particular needs. For example,       Boston Medical Center (BMC), a 500-bed, 41-building hospital       located close to a county jail, a homeless shelter and a       methadone clinic, developed its own de-escalation program.       BMC's training focuses on verbal de-escalation and physical       restraint skills. All frontline staff-unit clerk nurses,       intensive care unit staff, social workers, etc.,--along with       security staff receive ongoing training at BMC. Scenario       training uses videos that re-enact possible active-shooter       security incidents; these BMC videos are available for other       hospitals to access as training tools. Another example is       that of Atrium Health, which has created its in-house       training program. Staff members certified in workplace       violence prevention train other staff members, including home       health workers, using a multi-tiered program.        As the association representing hospitals and health       systems nationwide, the AHA is committed to helping our       members prevent and reduce violence. We have established a       specific initiative focused on combatting violence in all its       forms. A critical component of this initiative includes       developing tools and resources to highlight and share with       the hospital field programs, initiatives and other efforts to       help combat violence at hospital facilities as well as in the       communities served by the hospital. We have developed a       dedicated webpage to share information and resources that       address everything from conducting a risk assessment to       emergency response best practices, and we encourage all       hospitals to use these resources to expand and strengthen       their own violence prevention efforts.        On the website, hospitals can find the Healthcare Facility       Workplace Violence Risk Assessment Tool developed by the       AHA's American Society for Healthcare Risk Management to       offer practical guidance for those charged with overseeing       hospital security and facilities management. Also on the       website is Guiding Principles for Mitigating Violence in the       Workplace, a resource created jointly by the American       Organization for Nursing Leadership (an AHA-affiliated       organization) and the Emergency Nurses Association. The       resource outlines guiding principles and priorities to       systematically reduce lateral as well as patient and family       violence in the workplace. In addition, an article from       Health Facilities Management encourages and guides health       care organizations in consulting with security personnel       during design of new facilities to incorporate workplace       safety considerations as a fundamental component of these       construction projects.   FEDERAL POLICYMAKERS SHOULD Focus ON DISSEMINATION OF BEST PRACTICES TO     THE FIELD AND SUPPORT INCREASED FUNDING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE         Hospitals' efforts to curb workplace violence would be       bolstered by robust federal initiatives that would       disseminate health care and social assistance sectors best       practices that have demonstrated effectiveness in violence       prevention. Federal support of research to identify the       effectiveness of best practices for different workplace       settings and circumstances and disseminating information       about such best practices would do more to advance and       promote workplace safety than the adoption of a ``one-size-      fits-all'' standard for compliance and enforcement. The       establishment of a uniform workplace violence standard for       the field may lead to organizations using a narrowly focused       and thereby less effective compliance strategy in addressing       the problem of workplace violence.        We note evidence suggesting that increases in assaults in       the health care workplace are being driven, in part, by       growing numbers of behavioral health care patients reporting       to and being treated in emergency departments and other       settings in acute care, general hospitals. Another security       challenge is the opioid epidemic, which continues to affect       communities nationwide.        Integrating mental health, substance use disorder, and       primary care services has proven to produce the best outcomes       and to be the most effective approach to caring for people       with multiple health care needs. But at the same time,       funding for behavioral health treatment for such patients is       being stripped, and it can be difficult for health care       organizations to find the financial, staffing, and other       resources needed to fully address issues associated with       caring for them.        For these reasons, we believe there are productive actions       Congress can take to help stem workplace violence in       hospitals and health systems. We urge Congress to       significantly increase funding for expanded and improved       delivery of behavioral health care, and to support the       hospital field's efforts to secure necessary funds to share       best practices and approaches, expand educational programs,       and make other investments in safety. We must address the       root causes of the negative workplace safety issues that have       arisen as a result of continued underfunding of treatment and       service delivery for growing numbers of behavioral health       care and opioid-dependent patients in emergency departments       and other acute care hospital settings.        We believe that these approaches would help mitigate       workplace violence and aid hospitals and health systems in       further addressing these incidents through policies and       strategies that are best suited to their needs and the needs       of the communities they serve. We stand ready to work with       you to explore an appropriate congressional response that       would improve hospitals' ability to address workplace       violence.            Sincerely,                                                 Thomas P. Nickels,                                          Executive Vice President.     Madam Speaker, we are hearing from the people who are on  the front lines, and we have said we want to protect the people on the  front lines. Well, let's listen to the people on the front lines.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we grieve for anyone who is killed violently in this  country under any circumstances. Again, that is not a partisan issue.   Madam Speaker, the healthcare industry is currently in the midst of  responding to a once-in-a-century pandemic and has rightly prioritized  significant resources to caring for patients and keeping its employees  safe from COVID-19.   Forcing OSHA to issue an interim final standard on workplace violence  within 1 year, as H.R. 1195 requires, will have a devastating impact on  the healthcare industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The last thing our healthcare providers need during this  unprecedented public health crisis is more costly mandates from  Washington that will strain resources and personnel and jeopardize  patient care.   Moreover, the Biden administration is expected to soon impose new  employer mandates in the form of an OSHA emergency temporary standard  for COVID-19 and, eventually, a permanent infectious disease rule,  which will have a significant impact on the healthcare industry.   At a time when healthcare facilities are experiencing massive revenue  losses and have invested significant resources into responding to  COVID-19, the issuance of two new regulations from Washington,  potentially within months of each other, will be devastating.   Our Nation's healthcare providers have responded admirably to the  pandemic and are doing heroic work to keep Americans safe and healthy.  The House should reject this ill-timed and ill-advised legislation that  will inhibit work and burden the healthcare industry at exactly the  wrong time.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, overbearing regulations burden workers and stifle the  economy. Preventing workplace violence in healthcare and social service  settings is crucial, and we should get this done by allowing OSHA to  issue standards through the normal rulemaking process, which brings all  experts and parties, including small businesses, to the table.   Short-circuiting the process and rushing to a conclusion eliminates  valuable technical and scientific input and will lead to unintended  consequences, which could have a detrimental impact on workplace safety  outcomes.   A bipartisan solution was possible here, but once again, Democrats  have kicked it to the curb. I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1195, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We all agree American workers should be kept out of harm's way on the  job so they can safely and healthily return home to their families.  These caregivers deserve protections, but H.R. 1195 is the wrong  approach to address the important issue of workplace violence.   I am disappointed by the lack of effort to develop a workable  bipartisan solution to combat workplace violence before this flawed  legislation was rushed to the floor by Democrat leaders in Congress.   In fact, committee Democrats chose not to hold a legislative hearing  focused on this bill. Unfortunately, the Democrat amendments only  reinforce that H.R. 1195 is the wrong approach to addressing this  important issue.   Representative Brown's amendment, while well-intentioned, ignores the  fact that there are Federal agencies other than OSHA that would be  better equipped to handle a regulatory requirement for the education of  healthcare and social service workers who work with the victims of  torture, trafficking, or domestic violence.   The question of whether employer education programs governed by OSHA,  the Federal Government's workplace safety agency, are appropriate to  address the objectives of this amendment should be thoroughly vetted  and discussed during the rulemaking process before decisions impacting  healthcare facilities and their patients are made. H.R. 1195 does not  allow for this to occur.   Representative Cohen's amendment is also well-intentioned, but will  unilaterally expand the reach of a flawed regulation to include  numerous small facilities.   This is particularly problematic because H.R. 1195 precludes the  opportunity for OSHA to conduct a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement  and Fairness Act panel prior to a regulation being written, a key  element in the process which considers the impact of proposed  regulatory changes on small businesses. The implications of such a  proposal should be carefully evaluated through the established OSHA  rulemaking process before a decision is made regarding expansion to  additional facilities.   With regard to Representative Delgado's amendment, I agree with his  assessment that employers will need compliance assistance and technical  help from OSHA in order to understand the complex and burdensome new  rule mandated by this bill.   However, this amendment is little more than window dressing. While  technical assistance is always welcome and appropriate for a rule of  this complexity, this amendment places an arbitrary time limit that is  woefully insufficient to cope with a rushed and flawed rule. Moreover,  technical assistance after employers are subject to a rule in which  they had no input is too little, too late.   Rather than amend a flawed bill by allowing the Department of Labor  to help businesses after the fact, we should reject this bill and  instead allow OSHA to pursue its established rulemaking process that  provides ample opportunity for feedback from stakeholders and the  public, which will ensure a better product and eliminate the need for  this type of amendment.  [[Page H1867]]    Representative Jones' amendment puts the cart before the horse.  Consultation with outside experts regarding compliance should occur  while a regulation is being written by OSHA and before it is issued so  the final product takes this expertise into account. This amendment  simply adds yet another costly mandate on employers.   H.R. 1195, which requires OSHA to issue an interim final rule within  1 year, short-circuits the opportunity for the agency to hear from  experts before a rushed rule is issued. This amendment is a feeble  attempt to correct this critical flaw.   I believe, Madam Speaker, that every Member of this Chamber is  committed to ensuring American workers are safe in the workplace. I  appreciate Mr. Courtney's very kind comments about my concern for this  personally, but I can say every Republican feels this way.   Our Nation's caregivers, who have been on the front lines of  responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, are deserving of a responsible,  workable, and thorough response to the serious issue of violence in the  workplace. However, this legislation is a far cry from a sensible or  workable solution.   H.R. 1195 is overly prescriptive and heavy-handed and takes the wrong  approach, prejudging and imposing a rushed regulation without allowing  for necessary stakeholder input. Unfortunately, the Democrat amendments  do nothing to change this fact.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Democrat amendments  en bloc and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to close, and I  apologize for neglecting to say I oppose the amendment at the  beginning.   I believe I have the right to close, therefore, I will reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Courtney for the  comments he has made during this debate today. He has been a very kind  colleague.   However, what we should be doing is more debating of some of the  underlying issues that are creating this increased workplace violence,  and we are not doing that as a Congress.   We need to be looking at why these things that are happening are  happening. And I am sorry that we are not doing that. And I am sorry we  are doing a rushed product here when we could be working together.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the en bloc  amendments and ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
