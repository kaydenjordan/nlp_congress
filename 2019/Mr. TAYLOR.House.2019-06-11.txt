 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate 24 young  women from high schools across Plano, Texas, who were presented with  the Gold Award by the Girls Scouts of Northeast Texas for their  dedication to our community.   The most prestigious accolade to earn, the Gold Award requires each  young woman to work tirelessly on a community project of their choice  for up to 80 hours.   I want to thank each of these Girl Scouts for their exemplary service  within Collin County and for demonstrating that age should never deter  one from leading within their community.   It is with pleasure I ask my colleagues to congratulate these young  ladies on their success.                            ____________________
