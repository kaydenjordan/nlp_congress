 Mr. President, first I would like to associate myself with  the comments of my senior Senator about the necessity of the passage of  the USMCA. The House of Representatives and the Speaker should schedule  that vote immediately. There is clearly overwhelming support in both  bodies for its passage.   I would also like to underscore my senior Senator's comments about  the tragedy of the irrigation tunnel collapse in Nebraska and about the  character of Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. They have dealt with yet  another catastrophe after 81 of our 93 counties went through a state of  emergency earlier this year in a flood.   I would like to just commend my senior Senator for a fine speech on a  really important topic.   (The remarks of Mr. Sasse pertaining to the submission of S.J. Res.  58 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    I yield back.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask each and  every Member of Congress to answer this simple question: Is it right  for the U.S. Federal Government to get into the business of policing  Muslims', Jews', and Christians' religious beliefs, about whether or  not they are acceptable? Is it the business of the Federal Government  of the United States to determine true and false religion?   Last week, a former Member of Congress now running for President,  didn't blink an eye when he announced that he would strip religious  institutions, colleges, churches, and other not-for-profit service  organizations of their tax-exempt status if they don't agree with his  political positions.   That is a pretty major departure from what America is and what we  usually talk about in this body. So we should pause, and we should call  that what it is. That is extreme intolerance, it is extreme bigotry,  and it is profoundly un-American.   The whole point of America is the First Amendment, and the whole  point of the First Amendment is that, no matter who you love and no  matter how you worship, we believe in America that everyone--everyone-- is created with dignity. This is a fundamental American tenet. It is  why this country was founded.   Because we are all created with dignity, none of us has the right to  dictate the conscience commitments of other people. The freedom of  conscience is a fundamental American belief, and, thankfully,  politicians have no business policing that.   At the end of the day, there are really just two kinds of societies.  There are societies that are about force and power, and there are  societies that are about persuasion, about assembly, and about love.   For more than 230 years, we have decided in this country that we are  the latter. We are a community of persuasion, not primarily a community  of power and force.   In America, we don't think the center of life is defined by  government. We think the frame of life is defined by government.   Abraham Lincoln often, sort of apocryphally summarizing George  Washington, used to talk about the silver frame and the golden apple.  In America, the government is just the silver  [[Page S5850]]  frame. It is the structure that defines the framework for the order of  liberty so that the golden apple--the good, the true, and the  beautiful, the things that you love and that you want to build--you go  do by persuading people to join with you in a cause. Government doesn't  define the center.   Washington, DC, is not the center of American life. Washington, DC,  is supposed to be a servant community that exists to maintain a  framework for the order of liberty and guards us against enemies,  foreign and domestic, so that your household and your neighborhood and  your place of worship can be the center of life.   We are not Chinese Communists who take Uighurs and throw them into  camps. We are not Russian oligarchs who tell journalists what they can  and can't write. We are not Venezuelan strongmen who beat the hell out  of protesters. We are Americans. And in America, we disagree about many  things. We disagree profoundly and vigorously, but then we come  together and create a system where we work out our differences not with  fists but with words. We work out our differences with civility and  tolerance and respect and persuasion.   All of this starts with the First Amendment. The five freedoms of the  First Amendment--religion, speech, press, assembly, and protest--define  who we are as a people and what we believe in common. And guess what.  You can't separate these five. These five freedoms are all in the same  amendment for a reason--because if one of them falls, they all fall.  They stand or fall together, and you are a hypocrite if you pat  yourself on the back for defending one of these five freedoms and then  the next day, when another one is unpopular, say: Well, we don't need  that one; we can throw it overboard. The five freedoms are  interconnected and are interdependent, and they are all in that same  amendment, the First Amendment, for a reason.   These are the rights of conscience that belong together, and they  cannot be taken or policed by government. That means that if a Texas  politician pandering for a sound bite decides to make a boldfaced  threat against Muslims and Jews and Christians--all Americans from  every faith and every walk of life--we have an obligation to come  together and defend our freedoms, so we should do that.   That is what I am on the floor here today to do. I am introducing a  simple resolution today that will give every Member of the Congress-- the House and Senate--the opportunity to tell our constituents whether  we still believe in the First Amendment. It is an opportunity to show  the American people that bigotry against religion in the name of  partisan politics is not permitted in our system of government. This  isn't a Republican or a Democratic premise; this is an American idea,  that we condemn politicians who say they are going to police other  people's religious beliefs. Congress doesn't target or punish  organizations that are exercising constitutionally protected rights.   This really shouldn't be complicated. Government doesn't rifle  through your pastor's or your rabbi's sermon notes. Government doesn't  tell your clerics what they can or can't say. Government doesn't tell  your religious leaders how they will perform their services. Government  doesn't tell you where or when you will worship. Government doesn't  teach our kids how they are to pray. Government doesn't lecture you on  Heaven and Hell. Government's job is not to define true and false  religion. That is something much closer to the center of the frame, the  golden apple. The silver frame is the humble job we have to do in  public life, which is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so  that Americans, in their neighborhoods and over dinner tables, can try  to persuade each other how to worship and what to believe by arguments,  not by fists and not by the police.   Government doesn't get to do any of that in this country because we  recognize that government is not God. Americans reject the divine right  of Kings, and we reject the infallibility of politics.   Government doesn't try to make an example of your church or your  synagogue or your mosque because some politician decided your views  were out of favor. Your religious organization doesn't get taxed  differently because a politician running for office decides to disagree  with one of your beliefs. Whatever faith you are from in America,  whatever party you are in, we believe in America that all 225 million  of us are created equal, and we believe that whether your faith is  traditional or progressive, it is yours, and it is between you and your  religious community and your God. It is not the domain of politicians.   Government can't force you out of the public square because of the  faith you hold--at least that is what we have always believed in the  past. It is what we believed for more than 200 years. We are not  perfect, of course. We have fallen short of that idealism time and  again. That doesn't mean the ideas of the American founding in the  First Amendment are wrong; it means that our ideals need to be strived  for yet again and reaffirmed.   I want to give every Member of Congress the opportunity in the coming  weeks to do just that. The resolution I am introducing today ought to  get a vote so House and Senate Members can be on record for our  constituents about whether we affirm the First Amendment and in  particular the free exercise of religion and the free assembly clause.  I am going to read it for everyone's benefit. It is pretty short. This  is the resolution being submitted:         Whereas the settlement of the 13 colonies was driven in       part by those seeking refuge from government-sponsored       religious persecution;        Whereas the Framers of the Constitution of the United       States recognized the centrality of freedom of conscience to       the establishment of the United States, enshrining in the       First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that       ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of       religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or       abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the       right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition       the Government for a redress of grievances'';        Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious       organizations have played a central and invaluable role in       life in the United States; and        Whereas Congress has recognized the importance of religious       institutions by enacting a variety of legal protections for       those institutions, including exemption from income taxes:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled, That--        (1) the protections of freedom of conscience enshrined in       the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States       remain central to the experiment of the United States in       republican self-government under the Constitution of the       United States;        (2) government should not be in the business of dictating       what ``correct'' religious beliefs are; and        (3) any effort by the government to condition the receipt       of the protections of the Constitution of the United States       and the laws of the United States, including an exemption       from taxation, on the public policy positions of an       organization is an affront to the spirit and letter of the       First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.    I don't care what some nitwit said on CNN last week to satisfy his  fringy base and try to get a sound bite in a Presidential debate. The  American people ought to know that this body stands for the historic  First Amendment. That is what we all took an oath to uphold and to  defend, and that is what we ought to vote to affirm again. Let's do it.                                S.J. Res. 58         Whereas the settlement of the 13 colonies was driven in       part by those seeking refuge from government-sponsored       religious persecution;        Whereas the Framers of the Constitution of the United       States recognized the centrality of freedom of conscience to       the establishment of the United States, enshrining in the       First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that       ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of       religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or       abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the       right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition       the Government for a redress of grievances'';        Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious       organizations have played a central and invaluable role in       life in the United States; and        Whereas Congress has recognized the importance of religious       institutions by enacting a variety of legal protections for       those institutions, including exemption from income taxes:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That--        (1) the protections of freedom of conscience enshrined in       the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States       remain central to the experiment of the United States in       republican self-government under the Constitution of the       United States;  [[Page S5851]]         (2) government should not be in the business of dictating       what ``correct'' religious beliefs are; and        (3) any effort by the government to condition the receipt       of the protections of the Constitution of the United States       and the laws of the United States, including an exemption       from taxation, on the public policy positions of an       organization is an affront to the spirit and letter of the       First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask each and  every Member of Congress to answer this simple question: Is it right  for the U.S. Federal Government to get into the business of policing  Muslims', Jews', and Christians' religious beliefs, about whether or  not they are acceptable?
