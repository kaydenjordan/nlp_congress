 Madam Speaker, since January, House Democrats have  gotten to work, passing legislation that brings down healthcare costs  and protects the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   We have gone to court to fight against the Trump administration's  efforts to gut protections for folks with preexisting conditions. We  have already sent a package of legislation to the Senate that will  drive down the price of prescription drugs. We are still waiting on  Mitch McConnell to take up these bills, but we are not stopping there.   In the coming weeks, we will also bring to the floor the Elijah  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, H.R. 3, the single most significant  piece of legislation to reduce drug costs, that empowers patients and  consumers against the powerful pharmaceutical cartels in this country.   This legislation levels the playing field of working people in this  country, a country that pays more for prescription drugs than anyplace  else in the world.   Our constituents want a government that works for the people of this  country. It is time for my Republican colleagues and Leader McConnell  to get the message: Stop standing in the way. Work with us so we can  get the job done and pass this important legislation that will address  this very serious issue, the rising cost of prescription drugs.                            ____________________
