 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn all socialist  autocrats who place power and wealth over their own citizens. Yet this  resolution ignores some of their worst evils, then falls silent while  American leaders mimic their cruel tactics.   For instance, Cubans and Venezuelans suffer from far worse than the  inflation and expropriation this measure describes. Dictators there  destroy human rights; the rule of law, and jail, exile, or kill their  enemies.   Let's condemn socialist abuses, yes, but leaders on this very floor  seek to overturn democratic elections, confiscate long-held rights, and  gut programs our families, veterans, and servicemembers need.   In my home State, an aspiring autocrat daily deploys the socialist  tyrant's playbook. He marginalizes minorities, demonizes the free  press, and criminalizes or bans speech, books, even history.   What we can learn from these failed despots is to respect the rule of  law, free speech, and free elections, and to protect our own citizens  from the grinding poverty tyrants wield as weapons. Socialist dictators  deserve our scorn, but glossing over their crimes and ignoring the  leaders right here who mimic them--that fails those fighting freedom  everywhere.
