 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our  Nation's veterans and the work of those who care for them during  National Salute to Veteran Patients Week. Across the country this week,  VA hospitals are celebrating our veterans and showing appreciation for  those who may not have loved ones with whom to spend Valentine's Day.   During last year's National Salute to Veteran Patients Week, 288,000  valentines were delivered to VA medical centers from schoolchildren and  various organizations across our country. These efforts included more  than 1,400 community groups and 9,000 volunteers. I hope that this year  we can build on that effort and show even more gratitude to our  veterans.   I am proud to see our Nation come together for a week like this one  and all the volunteers who took the time to express their respect and  appreciation.   To all our veteran patients, thank you for your service, and I hope  that you have a wonderful Valentine's Day.                            ____________________
