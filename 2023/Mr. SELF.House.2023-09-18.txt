 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Veterans Benefits  Improvement Act.   This bill will streamline the veterans claims process through several  actions, including adding language from my bill, H.R. 1329, to add two  additional judges to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans  Claims.   For decades, the Board of Veterans' Appeals has been maligned because  they cannot provide timely decisions to veterans who appeal their  cases. To  [[Page H4361]]  make matters worse, the court anticipates the caseload in FY 2023  increasing even more due to the amount of cases generated from the PACT  Act.    Quite simply, more cases before the board will lead to more denials,  and more denials will lead to more appeals. The rapid growth of appeals  will create an even larger backlog and leave veterans waiting longer  periods of time--potentially years--for their cases to be resolved.   Since the court's expansion from five to seven permanent judges in  2011, appeals that have been filed with the court have more than  doubled from just under 4,000 to just under 9,000 in 2020. Increasing  the number of judges will provide the court with an opportunity to  prevent a backlog and provide veterans with decisions in a timely  manner.   The addition of this language to the bill is endorsed by the court  itself.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1530.
