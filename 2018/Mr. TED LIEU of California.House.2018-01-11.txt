 Mr. Speaker, having served on Active Duty  in the United States military, when it comes to foreign terrorists on  foreign soil, we need to track them down and kill them. That is why I  support the FISA Act, as applied to foreigners.   But, unfortunately, this act has now been used to apply to Americans.  If you are going to do that, you need to follow the Constitution, you  need to put in a warrant requirement. Unfortunately, the Nunes FISA  bill does not do that. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS amendment.   At the end of the day, this is not about terrorists or terrorism. It  is about: Can you use warrantless information against Americans in a  domestic court?   That is what this issue is about. Don't let the intelligence agencies  scare you.   Vote ``no'' on the Nunes bill and ``yes'' on the USA RIGHTS  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, let me make this issue  really simple for the American people: spying on foreigners without  following the Constitution, that is okay; spying on Americans without  following the Constitution, that is not okay.   The Fourth Amendment does not have an asterisk that says our  intelligence agencies don't have to follow it. The Constitution applies  to all of government. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS Act.   Support this amendment.
