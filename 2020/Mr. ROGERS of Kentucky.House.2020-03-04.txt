 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, H.R. 6074. This  coronavirus emergency supplemental, as has been said, provides $7.8  billion in additional appropriations for the U.S. response to  coronavirus.   Within the total, more than $2 billion is included for the Centers  for Disease Control, and $1 billion is for State and local  preparedness. The bill also provides more than $4 billion for research  and development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics.    As ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Subcommittee, I would also highlight the $1.25 billion in the  bill for the State Department and the United States Agency for  International Development, AID. These funds will help protect Americans  abroad and support efforts to contain the virus worldwide.  Specifically, it includes:   $264 million to maintain consular operations, pay for evacuation  expenses, and address other emergency preparedness needs at our  embassies and consulates around the world;   $435 million in global health funds, including $200 million for the  emergency reserve fund that we established in 2017 to address emerging  health threats abroad;   $300 million of international disaster assistance funding to respond  to humanitarian needs related to the virus;   $250 million for economic and security needs in countries facing  instability because of the virus; and   $1 million for the USAID inspector general to perform oversight of  coronavirus response activities.   The bill also requires a comprehensive strategy to respond to the  coronavirus overseas and regular reporting on the use of the funds so  that we know how the moneys are being spent.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. The resources are needed  urgently, and I urge our colleagues to vote ``aye.''
