 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Alivea  Cox of Richmond Hill, Georgia, a kindhearted 14-year-old who passed  away on June 4, hours after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.   We can all be inspired by her passion for life, exemplified in her  hobbies and her ability to make everyone around her a little happier  every day.   Alivea was musically talented, playing the French horn, the trumpet,  and the piano. Her middle school band teacher recognized her for both  outstanding musical talent and outstanding character.   Alivea cofounded a weekly prayer club for students modeled after 1  Timothy 4:12.   In a letter to a teacher, she mentioned important life lessons she  learned: to be patient with yourself and others, and that bad days do  not define you.   I offer my deepest sympathy to her parents, her family,  schoolteachers, and her friends.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for  introducing this critical legislation.   Since this committee began tackling the opioid epidemic, I have said  there are three major parts to the crisis: prevention, treatment, and  law enforcement. This legislation touches all three prongs of the  opioid crisis with a number of creative solutions, in addition to  providing offsets to ensure that solving a public health crisis does  not lead to a fiscal one.   I voted for many of these bills when they came before the committee  for mark up, and I want to offer my full support for this legislation.
