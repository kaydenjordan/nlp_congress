 Madam Speaker, the Federal Government is  the Nation's largest purchaser of electricity, yet it buys renewable  energy at a rate that is far less than the rest of the country.   With a climate crisis threatening our planet and our way of life,  this is not acceptable. We can and must leverage the resources of the  Federal Government to accelerate the technological innovation needed to  transition to a green and clean economy.   That is why, earlier this week, I introduced the Green Energy for  Federal Buildings Act. My legislation would require the Federal  Government to increase the share of electricity it gets from renewable  sources.   Under current law, the Federal Government is required to utilize only  7.5 percent renewable energy for its electricity needs. My bill would  up the ante, raising the requirement to 35 percent by 2030, 75 percent  by 2040, and 100 percent by 2050.   This crisis is upon us. We must have the strength and the foresight  to act decisively, creatively, and boldly. There is no time to waste.                            ____________________
