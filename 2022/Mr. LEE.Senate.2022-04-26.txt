 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if the nanny state had a mascot, it would be  the Federal Trade Commission. In fact, back in the 1970s, the FTC  earned the nickname the ``National Nanny''--this, after it went on a  rulemaking binge, one that triggered an unprecedented congressional  response.   In response to that binge, Congress defunded the Agency for several  days. In fact, it refused formally to reauthorize the Commission for  some 14 years after that. Thankfully, the FTC changed approach by  reining in its rulemaking initiatives. Congress, however, did not learn  its lesson and has continued to grant the FTC broad powers over the  years. These grants of power and the lack of congressional will have  helped put the FTC on a trajectory that looks eerily similar to its  ``National Nanny'' era.   Under the leadership of Lina Khan, the FTC has only accelerated into  this trajectory and is now being transformed into a bigger and more  invasive national nanny than ever could have been imagined in the  1970s. Her vision is to transform what is an enforcement Agency into a  broader, largely independent regulatory Agency. This move would reduce  the congressional oversight of key economic regulation and would also  have serious negative implications for countless businesses across the  Nation that could find themselves subject to the whims of an unelected,  arbitrary, capricious, out-of-control Agency. The FTC is on course to  take significant new powers so that it can use its already broad  authorities under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and  elsewhere to regulate huge swaths of the American economy.   We, accordingly, need to be very careful when considering nominees to  the Commission.   As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I took seriously my  consideration of Mr. Bedoya's nomination and spoke with him on multiple  occasions regarding his nomination and regarding his vision for the  Federal Trade Commission. During his nomination hearing, I took careful  note of my questions to Mr. Bedoya and to his responses to ascertain  his vision for the Commission and his view on the scope of the FTC's  power. His answers did little to calm my concerns. In fact, they did  much to add to my worries, not only about his nomination but about the  future of the Commission at large.   During my questioning, Mr. Bedoya signaled that he would use section  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to conduct unfair methods of  competition rulemaking. That, of course, would be a dangerous expansion  of the FTC's rulemaking power, one that would occur without a  congressional grant of authority.   He refused to share his views on the FTC's repeal of its vertical  merger guidelines.   He didn't answer when I asked about his views on Lina Khan's use of  zombie votes, or proxy votes, of ex-commissioners after they had left  the Commission.  [[Page S2142]]    He would not provide a clear answer on whether he supported Lina  Khan's decision to remove key procedural requirements attached to FTC  rulemaking--the very statutory, procedural requirements that were  instituted in direct response to the Agency's flagrant abuses of its  own power in the 1970s.   And he openly supports Lina Khan's decision to close out the voice of  minority commissioners to approve investigations--an action that has  destroyed a bipartisan hallmark of the Commission.   Mr. Bedoya did not earn my confidence in his hearing. His nomination  is not designed to strengthen American business or bolster our economy.  Instead, his nomination will give the Commission the majority it needs  to take American economic regulation out of the hands of elected  lawmakers.    We have to remember that the very first clause of the very first  section of the very first article of the Constitution says that all  legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in the Congress of  the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of  Representatives. In other words, all Federal lawmaking power-- legislative powers or lawmaking powers--the power to make Federal law  as articulated in article I, section I, clause 1--is vested in  Congress, not in an outside Agency.   Article I, section VII puts even more clarity on it in explaining  that, in order to pass a Federal law, you have got to have passage by  the Senate and passage by the House of the same piece of legislation,  followed by presentment to the President, resulting in signature, veto,  or acquiescence. Without that, you cannot make a Federal law.   When we pretend to make Federal lawmakers outside of Congress, we  have got to be very careful because this is subversive of the entire  purpose of the Constitution, putting in the most dangerous power--the  power to make prescriptive laws, the power to make laws adding to,  altering, materially changing the obligations of members of the public.  You have got to go through the branch of government that is most  accountable to the people at the most regular intervals.   That is why this is so concerning that you have in Mr. Bedoya, like  you have in Lina Khan, someone who doesn't fear this type of  unaccountable, de facto lawmaking, not only outside of what the  Constitution can countenance fairly but also outside of basic standards  of accountability and good government.   For all of these reasons, I fear that Mr. Bedoya will not only enable  but will support the blatant attempts made by Lina Khan to return the  FTC to its status as the ``National Nanny'' and, ultimately, the  national enemy.   Under her leadership, the FTC has shown disregard for the input of  minority commissioners and has been frustrated by the legal limits  surrounding the FTC's authority. Lina Khan is not afraid to lead the  Agency on a path that ignores legal, constitutional, and procedural  roadblocks in its way.   I am committed to reversing the dangerous trajectory of the FTC; to  making sure that we don't return to the 1970s era of the FTC's being  the nanny of the nanny state; and to making sure that we restore the  FTC's accountability to Congress and, ultimately, to the people.   We have to remember that true accountability in our system of  government--accountability related to what the law is and how the law  is written--always has to be with Congress. That is why article I is  written the way that it is. It is why this is something that has to be  understood appropriately as a nondelegable duty--that is, the power to  make law.   We have got to restore that accountability, and I fear that Mr.  Bedoya will only further enable the radical takeover of the Federal  Trade Commission. I, therefore, cannot and will not support his  nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Orrin G. Hatch will be remembered for many  things. His 42 years of service in this body are marked by successes;  historic and prolific legislation; and, of course, statesmanship. He  served longer as a U.S. Senator than any other in the history of the  State of Utah or in the history of the Republican Party.   At his retirement, he had passed more bills into law than any other  legislator alive, an astounding 750. While the record of his service is  remarkable and memorable, I invite the Senate and the Nation to  remember Senator Orrin Hatch by the things that he remembered every  day, here in the Senate and in his private life.   Every day upon entering his Senate office, Orrin Hatch would look  upon a prominently hung painting depicting his Utah pioneer grandfather  and great-grandfather as they were fording a stream on horseback. This  image, like so much else in his life, was a reminder of Senator Hatch's  pioneer legacy, his ancestry, and destiny.   In Utah, there is almost no more honorable title than that of  pioneer. In the particular parlance of our State, a pioneer is not  merely someone who goes where others haven't gone before. No, a pioneer  looks toward the future without forgetting who he or she is. A pioneer,  like those who settled the Salt Lake Valley and much of the western  United States, does so not out of conquest or in search of glory; a  pioneer goes and works out of duty and responsibility and faith.   Orrin Hatch always remembered his roots. Raised the son of a  mechanical laborer, he grew up in a family of little means. Orrin was  one of nine children raised in a cramped Depression-era home without  indoor plumbing. Two of Orrin's siblings died young. Another, his older  brother Jesse, gave the ultimate sacrifice as a turret gunner flying  over Austria mere months before the Allied victory in Europe.   Orrin always remembered this example of work and sacrifice from his  parents and from his brother Jesse. The sense of duty to God, family,  and Nation was the primary driver throughout his life.   He served a 2-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints in Ohio. He became the first in his family to graduate from  college, attending Brigham Young University. He met Elaine Hansen, and  the couple married in 1957. They later returned to Pittsburgh, PA, and  Orrin completed law school at the University of Pittsburgh School of  Law, while living in what had previously served as a chicken coop in  his parents' backyard. He worked as a metalworker and as a janitor to  provide for his family while attending law school.   Never one to make much of a fuss about it, Orrin Hatch just did the  work that was expected of him, and he did it remarkably well. He knew  that life was not easy and that he couldn't expect handouts. He  developed the reputation of a fighter, and while a dedicated friend  with an inviting laugh, he would never forget the lessons he had  learned young while in the amateur boxing ring.   After moving back to Utah and running a successful law practice in  Salt Lake City, Orrin ran for the Senate to fight for the moral fiber  and everyday work ethic of Americans that he felt was not being  represented adequately in Washington, DC. He won, and he set out to  defend family values and constitutional principles.   He would remember to do so throughout his career, pioneering the  Hatch  [[Page S2149]]  Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment that sought to correct  the erroneous claim that there is a constitutional right to abortion,  one that prohibits States from protecting unborn human life, and  steadfastly advocating for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.   Orrin Hatch defended life, religious liberty, economic  responsibility, and personal freedom throughout his entire service in  the U.S. Senate. His 750 proposals that became law cover everything  from welfare reform to regulatory restructuring, to laws adjusting the  Federal judiciary, to hallmark tax cuts. Hatch's tenure in the Senate  was marked by his chairmanship of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Finance  Committee, before serving as President Pro Tempore.   Senator Hatch helped rein in activist Federal judges and reformed the  entire Federal judiciary, and has helped restore the true meaning of  the Constitution as applied and interpreted by our courts.   Senator Hatch played a prime role in the nomination of every Supreme  Court Justice for decades. He defended the Court and the honor of  Justices serving and presenting themselves with different judicial  philosophies.   Beyond his countless political accomplishments, Orrin Hatch was a  dedicated father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and man of faith. He  always remembered the most important things in life. He composed  countless songs of praise and of patriotism. He served as a volunteer  leader in his church congregations and in his communities. He founded  the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation to carry on and remember his work and  advocacy for collegiality and bipartisanship after his retirement from  the Senate.   Orrin Hatch always remembered Utah. On weekends, you could find him  at the grocery store, in his church congregation, rubbing elbows with  people he knew and loved. He would talk about the politics of the day  but also the news affecting communities and families he cared for.  Those who knew him felt the care and the interest that he had.   After I had served as his Senate page, as a high school student,  there were just a couple of photos on my wall as a teenager. One was of  Karl Malone in his Utah Jazz jersey and another was a photo of me with  Senator Orrin Hatch, one of my prized possessions.   Later, when I was serving as a missionary along the U.S.-Mexico  border, on the Texas side, Senator Hatch sent me a note, along with a  $10 check, suggesting that I use it to go get a good lunch. I cherished  the note and never could cash the check. You see, the memory and the  memento were worth so much more than the lunch it could buy. I still  have that check. It is a prized possession.   Orrin Hatch also remembered to work. He would come to the Senate  early and stay late. He would think years ahead and persistently,  methodically, pursue his plans. He would take the time to build  coalitions behind ideas and bring about needed reforms. Senator Hatch  knew that the Senate was designed to be the cooling saucer, where ideas  would steep and percolate, often over the course of years and even  decades.   Yet Orrin always remembered the people behind the politics. He was a  mentor and a friend to Senators from both sides of the aisle, and he  built deep friendships with people of all political backgrounds. He  cherished a friendship with Senator Ted Kennedy and called the late  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a dear friend.   He instilled his hallmark good humor and sense of duty on the newer  Members of the Senate. I was one of them. He greeted and accepted me  warmly--mentioning only a few times over the years the fact that I had,  decades previously, served as his Senate page.   He was a force for collegiality and cooperation, and while he  remained dedicated to the principles and people who brought him to the  Senate, he would work with anyone and everyone to get the job done.   Orrin Hatch was a giant of the Senate and a veritable pillar in Utah.  His influence, his hearty laugh, and powerful advice are missed by us  here in the Senate and by millions in Utah. I know I speak for the  entire Senate in sending our deepest condolences and warmest  appreciation to Elaine and to their children--Brent, Marcia, Scott,  Kimberly, Alysa, and Jess, as well as their grandchildren and great- grandchildren.   The gift of Senator Hatch's life of service has made our State and  our Nation better.   As I said, there is perhaps no more noble title in Utah than that of  pioneer. Orrin Hatch was a pioneer, through and through--not just the  descendant of pioneers but a pioneer in his own right. He followed in  the footsteps of his forebearers, and he left a legacy of dedication,  of service, and of truth.    I commend his memory to the history of our Republic, in the words of  a beloved hymn fittingly entitled ``They the Builders of the Nation.''  Here is how it goes:         They, the builders of the nation,        Blazing trails along the way;        Stepping-stones for generations        Were their deeds of every day.        Building new and firm foundations,        Pushing on the wild frontier,        Forging onward, ever onward,        Blessed, honored Pioneer!    I bid my friend Senator Orrin Hatch onward, ever onward. May we as a  nation forever remember his legacy is my prayer.
