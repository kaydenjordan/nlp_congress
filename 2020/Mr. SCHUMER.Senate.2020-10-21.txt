 Mr. President, the closer we get to an election, the  sillier it gets here in Leader McConnell's Senate. All week, the  Republican majority has scheduled stunt votes on supposed COVID relief  bills that are all, in reality, designed to fail.   Yesterday, the leader moved to table his own bill so the Republicans  could vote against tabling it. Let me repeat that because that is what  is happening here. It is hard to believe that this is supposedly the  greatest debate Chamber in the country or in the world. Leader  McConnell moved to table his own bill so the Republicans could then  vote against tabling it. That is what  [[Page S6339]]  the Republican majority thinks passes for a serious attempt at a COVID  relief bill in this Republican Senate when people are suffering so  badly--games, games when people are suffering.   The truth is the Republican leader needed that vote to fail because,  if the Senate actually proceeded to a real bill, it might mess up the  timing of the Republican plan to confirm Judge Barrett to the Supreme  Court. Now, think of that for a moment. The Republican majority sets up  a fake vote on COVID relief because if, God forbid, the Senate actually  considered a real bill to do something real about this overwhelming  COVID crisis, it might delay their Supreme Court nominee they are  rushing through in a process that can only be declared as abusive to  the Senate.   That is all the American people need to know about priorities on the  other side of the aisle--rush through a nominee whose views are way to  the right of the American people's and ignore, avoid, and play games  with getting COVID relief, which is the No. 1 thing the American people  want, not a Supreme Court nominee who is so far away from their views.   While the country is hurting, while millions of Americans are sick  and dying, while workers lose their jobs, and while businesses close  their doors, Republican Senators are playing political stunts with  vitally needed economic relief, and the games continue today. Once  again, the Republican majority will bring up a bill that is designed to  fail--its partisan, emaciated so-called COVID relief bill. The bill we  are voting on today has already failed in the Senate. It didn't get a  Democratic vote.   We already know it lacks the votes, and why? Because it leaves so  many Americans behind. Renters and homeowners are left behind. There is  no relief for them. Americans who have lost jobs through no fault of  their own are left behind. Americans who rely on critical public  services by their State and local governments are left behind. Small  businesses, communities of color, and some of the hardest hit  industries--our restaurants, our concert venues, theaters, nonprofits,  and local news--receive no dedicated assistance. The Republican  proposal on COVID doesn't even devote enough resources to testing and  tracing despite a spike in cases and the harrowing prospect of a second  wave of the virus sweeping across America. It is laden with poison  pills that our Republican colleagues know Democrats would never  support. That is not an attempt to legislate and get something done.   What is in there? There is a giant corporate immunity provision to  shield corporations from liability if they put their workers in  dangerous COVID-related situations, and there is a tax provision to  benefit wealthy families who send their kids to private schools while  shortchanging middle-class families and public schools.   There is no reason for our Republican colleagues to insist on a  corporate liability shield and a provision to injure public schools in  a COVID relief bill--no reason. They know it is objectionable. They  know it is partisan. They know it is an anchor around the minimal bill  they have--enough to sink it. There is no reason to include these  poison pills in legislation that they know needs bipartisan support to  pass. Twenty Republicans have said they don't want to vote for any  money, so they know they need the Democrats, but they have put things  in the bill that they know the Democrats will oppose and will lead to  the bill's demise, this minimal bill.   So what is the logic here?   Well, there is a perverse logic if the Republican leader wants to  make sure that the bill fails, and that is sure what it looks like. It  is clear why Leader McConnell is forced to do these stunts--a good  portion of his caucus opposes more relief for the American people.   Yesterday, the Republican whip, the member in charge of counting  Republican votes, said: ``I think we're going to have a hard time  finding 13 [Republican] votes for anything''--13 out of 52, 53.   One Republican Member proudly vowed not to vote for ``another dime.''  People are being kicked out of their homes. Children are starving.  There is no testing and tracing that meets the needs. Schools can't  open--and not another dime. Let America suffer so our rightwing  ideology--saying that we shouldn't make well-to-do people pay taxes,  which is what their last tax cut bill did--can prevail over the needs  of America and the American people.   So it is not the Democrats who are blocking a real relief bill. We  know that. Everyone knows that. Speaker Pelosi is still trying her best  with the White House to get a deal. We have already offered to meet the  Republicans halfway. The biggest obstacles to another relief bill from  the very beginning have been Senate Republicans and Leader McConnell.   Then, as if we needed any more proof--it was pretty obvious before-- it was reported in multiple news outlets and confirmed by four Senators  who were at the meeting that Leader McConnell warned the White House  against making another deal on another stimulus bill before the  election. Let me repeat that. Leader McConnell, while he was coming to  the floor and railing against Democratic obstruction, was behind the  scenes, warning the White House against striking a bipartisan deal on  COVID relief.   Who does he think he can fool? Not the American people. Ask them.  They know who is to blame. They know Democrats, up and down the line,  are for relief and Republicans oppose it. I will tell you one thing:  The American people are sick and tired of these political stunts. They  are sick and tired of politicians who would rather have it appear they  are working than doing actual work.   This shouldn't be so hard. We all know how to pass bills in the  Senate--with bipartisan buy-in and bipartisan support. We did it in the  CARES bill back in March. Yet, ever since that bill passed this Senate,  the Republican majority has gone totally partisan every step of the  way, even on an issue as important to the country as relief from this  evil pandemic.    Mr. President, Leader McConnell has argued that what the  Republican majority is doing by ramming a Supreme Court Justice through  the Senate mere days before a national Presidential election is  completely normal, that it is perfectly consistent with precedent. This  is not true. There is no precedent in the history of the Senate for  confirming a Supreme Court Justice this close to an election. There has  never been--never been--a Supreme Court Justice confirmed after July of  an election year.   President Lincoln, a great Republican President--one of our foremost  national heroes--rejected the opportunity to nominate someone for the  Supreme Court close to an election. I dare say every single Republican  Senator already knows this because they all argued that exact position  4 years ago.   Republicans all argued that the Senate shouldn't confirm Justices in  Presidential election years because of the supposed principle that  ``the American people deserve a voice.'' Senate Republicans made that  argument 8 months  [[Page S6344]]  before the election. Now they are rushing to confirm a Supreme Court  Justice 8 days before the election, while Americans wait in line to  cast their ballots. They are waiting in line. They are voting. Millions  of Americans--tens of millions--have already voted. I have no doubt  Republicans would confirm a Justice 8 minutes before election day if it  meant they got their Justice. You could not design a set of  circumstances more hypocritical than this.   The truth is that the Republican majority is perpetrating the most  rushed, most partisan, least legitimate process in the long history of  Supreme Court nominations. Republicans, at the very least, ought to go  on the record and admit that this is an extraordinary breach of  fairness, of comity, of honor, of truth, of consistency, and, of  course, precedent--a black and indelible mark on this Senate majority  which will last forever.   Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the Senate ever considered  a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States this close to a  Presidential election?    Mr. President, I make a point of order that it should  not be in order to consider a nomination to the Supreme Court of the  United States this close to a Presidential election.    Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, I move  to table the appeal, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, by now, the American people know the rank  hypocrisy of the Republican majority, who, so many, when Merrick  Garland was proposed as a nominee, said we must wait, even though it  was 8 months before an election. When Merrick Garland was nominated 8  months before an election, we have to wait for an election. Now that an  election is ongoing, we are rushing through this nomination. It is one  of the worst moments the Senate has ever seen.   Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have defiled the Senate,  and one can wonder if it will ever recover from this kind of rank  hypocrisy. And so, because this has been the most rushed, most  partisan, and least legitimate process in the history of Supreme Court  nominations, Judiciary members will boycott the markup tomorrow and not  provide the quorum that is required because it is a bipartisan quorum.   The bottom line is very simple. We should not be moving forward on  this nomination. She is so out of character with American views. Her  views are way, way, way to the right. She has stated she wants to  repeal the ACA and take away healthcare. She has said she would oppose  Roe v. Wade and remove American women's right to control their own  bodies. She has opposed labor rights. She is to the right of Justice  Scalia on gun safety.   On issue after issue, this nominee is so far out of the mainstream  that her views, if she had to get them to pass in a legislature, would  never pass even with all Republicans. But, of course, now they are  rushing through the process.   Trump has said he wants someone who repeals ACA. Trump has said he  wants someone who would repeal Roe. Trump has said he wants someone who  would be on his side if there is an election dispute.   These are all such violations of American norms, values, decency, and  honor. And that is why the Judiciary Committee will not provide the  quorum tomorrow when the markup goes forward.   We should also adjourn. We should not do this nomination. We can come  back after the election and do just what Republicans have said they  wanted to do when Merrick Garland was on the floor: wait for the  election to decide.   And this sophistry that now because it is a Republican President and  a Republican majority, that makes a difference? No. Everyone sees  through that. That was never mentioned when Merrick Garland came up. It  only came now with a coverup--to cover up the hypocrisy, and it just  doesn't work. We can see through it.   The bottom line, we have never moved a nominee so close to an  election. Abraham Lincoln, when he had the opportunity to fill a  Supreme Court seat, said it would be unfair to do it so close to an  election. But this Republican Party has forgotten the principles and  the honor and the decency of Abraham Lincoln as they move forward in  their rush--in their rush--to push a nominee through, whose views are  decidedly at odds with the vast majority of Americans on issue after  issue. That is why the Judiciary Committee members will boycott  tomorrow. That is also why I am going to move to adjourn until November  9, after the election is decided and do what is fair and right for the  American people.                              Motion to Adjourn    Mr. President, I move to adjourn and to then convene for pro forma  sessions only, with no business being conducted, at 12 noon on the  following dates and that following each pro forma session, the Senate  adjourn until the next pro forma session: Friday, October 23; Tuesday,  October 27; Friday, October 30; Tuesday, November 3; and Friday,  November 6. Furthermore, that if there is an agreement on legislation  in relation to the COVID pandemic, the Senate may convene under the  authority of S. Res. 296 of the 108th Congress; and that, finally, when  the Senate adjourns on Friday, November 6, it next convene at 4:30,  Monday, November 9, and that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed.    Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and I  move to table the appeal.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
