 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by number:  Wicker No. 2146 and Kennedy No. 2210; further, that upon disposition of  the Johnson amendment, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in  the order listed, with no amendments in order to the amendments prior  to a vote in relation to the amendments, with 60 affirmative votes  required for adoption of the Kennedy amendment, 5 minutes for debate  for Senator Wicker and 2 minutes for debate for opponents before the  Wicker vote, and 4 minutes for debate equally divided before the  Kennedy vote.    Mr. President, there are a lot of folks gathering around  our new Senator from Arizona, congratulating him, commending him on his  speech.   I said to him--I am Navy. We have got a bunch of military people that  serve here: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. But in the Navy, when  somebody does an especially good job, we say ``Bravo Zulu.'' And that  was an exceptional, exceptional address.   We are delighted to be joined by Cindy McCain.   Before I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin for his amendment, the  theme that we just heard from our new Senator from Arizona really  focuses on preparing, through the groundwork, plowing the field in  anticipation of creating jobs. And we do that in a lot of ways. He has  mentioned a bunch of them in terms of technology jobs and so forth.   One of the other ways is what we are doing with the legislation  before us today, and that is investing in our infrastructure broadly,  not just roads, highways, and bridges; not just waterworks; not just  broadband; not just surface transportation. All of the above. All of  the above.   So it is a great way to start our day today.   With that, I yield the floor. I think the gentleman, our colleague  from Wisconsin, has some comments that he may want to make, unless the  leader wishes to go next.    Mr. President, over the years, I have made any number of  trips to our Nation's southern border. I have also traveled extensively  throughout Central America--and sometimes with the author of this  legislation--with many colleagues, Democratic and Republican. One of  the people who have been to that part of the world more than me is a  guy who used to serve here in the Senate--later, Vice President--and  that is our President, Joe Biden.   There is a verse in Scripture in the New Testament, Matthew 25, which  speaks to the least of these, and one of the things: When I was hungry,  did you feed me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was  thirsty, did you get me to drink? When I was a stranger in your land,  did you welcome me? Did you welcome me?   To the extent we have looked out for the least of these, then we have  a brighter future.   But anyway, the reason I raise that, we have this moral imperative to  look out for the least of these, and that includes people who end up on  our borders looking for safe haven. The reason why so many people  continue to come to our borders from Central America--especially  Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador--is because they live lives in  fear; deprived of economic opportunity and hope; corruption, crime. You  know, if any of us lived there with our families, we would want to get  out of there, too, and find a place to go to with a brighter future.   As a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, border  security is enormously important. We need secure borders; no question  about that. There are a whole bunch of force multipliers which help  provide more secure borders, including barriers--including barriers-- and I have supported them. So has the Senator, who is also a former  chairman of the committee. We have traveled in that part of the world  together.   One of the things we fully agree on is what I just said. We can spend  the next, you know, year, 5 years, 10 years securing our border. That  is important. But if we don't address those root causes of why people  are coming here, 10, 20 years from now, they will still be coming. They  will still be coming. We have to be smarter than that.   This is a shared responsibility; it is not all on the United States.  I said to my colleague from West Virginia, I like to use the example of  Home Depot, which Ron Johnson, Senator Johnson, heard me use more than  a few times. Home Depot--their ad line is ``You can do it. We can  help.'' In these countries we are getting all this immigration flow  from, they can do it, but we can help.   One of the things we set up was something called the Alliance for  Prosperity a number of years ago, with Democratic and Republican  support--I think with support of certainly then-Vice President Biden  and Senator McCain, the late John McCain. Among the things that we need  to focus on and we are doing under the Alliance for Prosperity are,  one, addressing crime and violence; two, addressing corruption; and  three, economic hope and opportunity. Those are the three buckets. We  put money in those buckets, the expectation is that those three  countries put even more money in those buckets, matching us 2, 3, 4, 5  dollars for every dollar that we put up. There are other countries that  we have an expectation for them to help. There are private businesses;  there is an expectation for them to help. Nonprofits. There is an  expectation for all. This is a shared responsibility.    As the place where all these illegal drugs are coming from, moving  those drugs through these three countries--we have some moral  responsibility to do something to help the situation down there, not  just at the border.   So with that in mind, I am not going to support this amendment. But I  would just note, I always look for common ground. The author of the  amendment knows full well--I have heard him talk about it eloquently,  about the need to go after root causes. For as long as we have been  working on this issue, all those years, we have needed to work on root  causes, and we still do today as well.    Mr. President, colleagues, in about 48 hours, about a  third of the Senate is going to be on an airplane heading for Gillette,  WY, and we are going to go and say goodbye to our friend and colleague  Mike Enzi.   I will never forget where I was sitting about, I don't know, 20 years  ago as the Presiding Officer, and Mike Enzi was literally standing  almost right where you are, talking about the 80-20 rule and why they  were so successful in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. Senator Kennedy and Mike Enzi--Democrat, Republican--how  they were able to find common ground and get stuff done: the 80-20  rule.   I said to Mike Enzi that day: What is the 80-20 rule?   He said: About 80 percent of the stuff, Ted and I agree on, and about  20 percent, we don't. What we do is we focus on the 80 percent where we  agree.   There is common ground here. I think that the Senator from Wisconsin  knows what it is. And I would ask that in addition to talking about our  differences, let's talk about where we agree, and let's do good work  there.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2245     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by number:  Peters-Rounds, 2464; Lankford, 2233; Cardin-Wicker, 2478; Daines, 2449;  and Scott, 2338, CBO inflation verification; further, that at 4:15 p.m.  today, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order  listed, with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to a vote  in relation to the amendments, with 60 affirmative votes required for  adoption of the amendments listed, with up to 4 minutes equally divided  prior to the first four votes and up to 7 minutes for Senator Scott of  Florida and 2 minutes for opponents prior to the Scott vote.   Mr. President, let me amend that request to 4:25--not 4:15 but 4:25.  I ask unanimous consent to make that modification.    Madam President, I ask the clock not start running right  away. Senator Capito and I want to just raise an issue with the Chair  and our colleagues.   That last vote took about 50 minutes--50 minutes--and they are  getting longer, not shorter.   And Senator Capito and I want to use this as an opportunity just to  start a conversation amongst our colleagues, see if we can't do better  than that, maybe a lot better than that.   So start thinking about it, and we would be interested to hear from  you.    You never know. We might do some voice votes. That would  be good.   All right. We thank you.    Madam President, we have had two votes in this tranche;  first vote about 50 minutes from start to close and the second vote  about 25 minutes.   We are going to propound a unanimous consent request--and I am  tempted to do it right now--to try to figure out what would be  reasonable. My sense is that maybe 15 minutes would be reasonable but a  real 15 minutes, and we will start with that.    Any objection?   A SENATOR. Without objection.    All right. Madam President, I would ask that we make it a  15-minute vote, a real 15-minute vote.   Thank you.    Yield back.    Mr. President, Senator Capito and I have a couple of  comments we would like to offer before we start on this amendment with  Senator Lee, and that is we have consulted with both leaders, with  Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell. They are in agreement that 15  minutes firm is the vote.   So when we start this vote, folks have 15 minutes to get here after  we start the vote to vote, and if they are not here, they are too late.   So that is the idea. We have spent way too much time waiting for  people. We have three amendments lined up, and we are going to vote  them and be punctual.   Senator Capito.    Thank you.   I would just ask any staff and Members who are watching, staff, let  your Senators know it is 15 minutes, and that is it.              Amendment Nos. 2279 and 2358 to Amendment No 2137     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by number:  No. 1 is Lee No. 2279; No. 2 is Rosen No. 2358; further, that the  Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed, with no  amendments in order to the amendments prior to a vote in relation to  the amendments, with 60 affirmative votes required for the adoption of  the Lee amendment listed and with up to 4 minutes, equally divided,  prior to each vote.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by our colleague from Utah.   This amendment would undermine the National Environmental Policy Act,  also known as NEPA, by allowing States to assume responsibility for  undertaking complex reviews of Federal action. These are reviews that  Congress vested explicitly in the Federal Agencies that permit or  license projects that could adversely affect our environment.   NEPA is designed to ensure that Federal Agencies consider major  actions carefully to ensure those decisions do not unduly impact water  quality, endangered species, community well-being, air quality, and  other environmental resources.   NEPA is a critical analytical tool that ensures that Federal decision  makers are better informed and that the affected community has an  opportunity to engage and be heard.   Today, as the world is in the midst of a sixth great extinction  event, and climate change is having ever greater impacts on our natural  world, we should be making decisions more carefully than ever, not just  to improve outcomes but also to avoid wasting money on projects that  are not resilient to withstand climate change.   This amendment would instead turn over responsibility for that  critical analysis to the States.   The bill before us includes many environmental deregulatory  provisions--more, in fact, than many of us would prefer. However, it  has been drafted in the spirit of bipartisan compromise.   This bill, as drafted, includes provisions to set deadlines for  project review schedule in order to reduce project review timelines. It  provides or expands categorical exclusions from NEPA. It also  permanently authorizes the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering  Council.   Unlike these provisions, which were the product of committee  deliberation and compromise, the amendment that our friend from Utah  has offered would significantly alter the process for Federal  environmental review without any committee deliberation on such major  changes.   These sweeping changes are inappropriate and unwarranted, and I urge  our colleagues to join me in voting no.    Would the Senator yield?    I object.    Mr. President, let me just take a minute from Senator  Capito to explain what is going on. OK?   So lined up right now, we are going to do three voice votes.  Negotiations are going forward on an amendment from Senator Schumer,  related to the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction. And after that, I  think the last vote will be that of Senator Fischer, and we will be  done.   And the reason why that is delayed is in order to provide time for  negotiation to occur on the Schumer amendment with the Commerce  Committee, and I think we are just about resolved.   I don't like it. It is what it is.   I just want to thank all for your patience. We are close to the end.   I would just ask, when we ask for a voice vote on the amendment from  Senator Jacky Rosen, that we get a voice vote. And I would ask that  when we ask for a voice vote on the Carper-Inhofe amendment, we get a  voice vote. And beyond that, we will be halfway home, halfway home.   So thank you for your patience. We are almost there.    Mr. President, let me have order. Let me have order,  please.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by number:  Carper-Inhofe 2564, Bennet-Hoeven 2548; further, that the Senate vote  in relation to the amendments in the order listed, with no amendments  in order to the amendments prior to voting in relation to the  amendments, with up to 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.    I rise in support of this amendment. I hope we will get  everybody to vote for it. Let's do a voice vote so we can move on.    Mr. President, I rise now to discuss my amendment with  Senators Inhofe, Wicker, and Duckworth.   This amendment makes several changes to the appropriations section of  the substitute in the section that funds the Army Corps of Engineers.   In WRDA 2020, Senator Barrasso and I heard multiple times about the  struggles of small, rural, and economically disadvantaged communities  in meeting project cost shares. These projects range from aquatic  ecosystem restorations to flood control and new levees. Yet because the  Corps is required to cost share the work, these small, rural, and poor  communities never get the assistance they need.   Last year, Senator Barrasso and I created a cap authority that allows  the Corps to pay for full expense of these projects to help these  disadvantaged communities finance the infrastructure the community  needs.   This amendment also makes clarifying changes to the inland waterways  funding. In addition to a technical correction, it makes clear that the  funding provided in this act must be prioritized for projects on the  Capital Investment Strategy Report, the guiding document for the Corps  inland waterways projects.   Finally, this amendment makes sure that inland flooding projects are  prioritized for economically disadvantaged communities and life-safety- related projects. This supports equity for disadvantaged communities  while prioritizing projects with the highest need.   This is a good bill. It is a good amendment, and these small tweaks  make it stronger.   I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and hope that we might  do so unanimously.   Senator Inhofe would be here. He is in Oklahoma with his family right  now. I think some would understand that. He urges us to support this as  well.    With that, Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of  a quorum, waiting for the arrival of Senator Bennet, who will be here  momentarily.    Mr. President, colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that  the following amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported  by number. The first of those is Fischer, 2164, with Cortez Masto--is  that correct? Yes--and the second is Schumer, 2570; further, that the  Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed, with no  amendments in order to the amendments prior to a vote in relation to  the amendments, with up to 2 minutes equally divided prior to each  vote.    Mr. President, I understand there has been a request--let  me ask the Senator.   I understand there has been a request for a recorded vote. Can you  confirm that or not?    All right. Then it will be a recorded vote.   Let me ask our colleagues: 10 minutes; is that OK? Ten minutes from  start to finish, and that is it. And the last amendment will be  Schumer. All right? Let's do this in 10 minutes, OK?                          Vote on Amendment No. 2164
