 Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a column by Max  Boot, conservative, and very well known. I am quoting completely.   ``President Trump is willing, under duress, to briefly and  begrudgingly admit that Russian meddling took place in 2016 before  reverting to calling it a `big hoax.' But he always maintains that the  plot against America had no impact; he describes it as a `Democrat  excuse for losing the '16 election.' Faithfully echoing the President,  other Republicans, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, say it's `clear'  that Russian interference `didn't have a material effect on our  elections.' White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders even  claims that the U.S. intelligence community reached that conclusion.   ``Not quite. Here is the intelligence community's assessment,  partially declassified in 2017: `We did not make an assessment of the  impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.  The U.S. intelligence community is charged with monitoring and  assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors;  it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.'''   To continue the story that Max wrote: ``When then-CIA Director Mike  Pompeo claimed last fall that the `intelligence community's assessment  is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome  of the election,' his own agency rebuked him.   ``While the intelligence agencies are silent on the impact of  Russia's attack, outside experts who have examined the Kremlin  campaign, which included stealing and sharing Democratic Party emails,  spreading propaganda online, and hacking State voter rolls, have  concluded that it did affect an extremely close election decided by  fewer than 80,000 votes in three States. Clint Watts, a former FBI  agent, writes in his recent book `Messing with the Enemy,' that `Russia  absolutely influenced the U.S. Presidential election,' especially in  Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump's winning margin was less than 1  percent in each State.   ``We still don't know the full extent of the Russian interference,  but we know its propaganda reached 126 million people via Facebook  alone. A BuzzFeed analysis found that fake news stories on Facebook  generated more social engagement in the last 3 months of the campaign  than did legitimate articles: The `20 top-performing false election  stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000  shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.' Almost all of this `fake  news' was either started or spread by Russian bots, including claims  that the Pope had endorsed Trump and that Hillary Clinton had sold  weapons to the Islamic State.   ``Elsewhere on social media, tens of thousands of Russian bots spread  pro-Trump messages on Twitter, which has already notified 1.4 million  users that they interacted with Russian accounts. The Russian  disinformation, propagating hashtags such as #Hillary4Prison and #MAGA,  reflected what the Trump campaign was saying. The Russian bots even  claimed after every Presidential debate that Trump had won; whereas,  objective viewers gave each one to Clinton.   ``Russia also hacked voting systems in at least 39 States; and while  there is no evidence that vote tallies were changed, Russians may have  used that stolen data to target their social media or shared the  results with the Trump campaign. The Senate Intelligence Committee  found that `in a small number of States,' the Russians may have been  able to `alter or delete voter registration data,' potentially  disenfranchising Clinton voters.   ``And then there was the crucial impact of the Russian hacks of  Democratic documents disseminated primarily by WikiLeaks. The first  tranche of stolen documents, more than 19,000 emails and 8,000  attachments, was strategically released on July 22, 2016, 3 days before  the Democratic Convention. The resulting news coverage disrupted the  Clinton campaign's plans by creating the impression that the Democratic  National Committee was biased against Bernie Sanders and forcing DNC  Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign.   ``The second tranche of stolen documents was released on October 7,  just 29 minutes after The Post reported on the `Access Hollywood'  videotape in which Trump is heard boasting about grabbing women by the  genitals. These emails, stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John  Podesta, distracted voter attention by revealing the transcripts of  lucrative speeches Clinton had given to Goldman Sachs, a populist  boogeyman.   ``A third release of stolen emails, on October 11, revealed that  Democratic operative Donna Brazile, while working at CNN, had provided  debate questions to Clinton during the primaries and that senior  Democratic operatives, who were themselves Catholics, had exchanged  emails disparaging Republicans who cherry-picked their faith for  political gain. This fueled Trump's narrative that the election was  `rigged' and that the `Clinton team' was, as he said, `viciously  attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.' The latter charge, unfair as it  was, proved especially important in Michigan, Wisconsin, and  Pennsylvania, swing States with lots of Catholic voters.   ``Little wonder that Trump said `I love WikiLeaks' and mentioned its  revelations 164 times in the last month of the campaign. `This  WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable,' Trump said on October 12. Eight days  later, he marveled, `Boy, that WikiLeaks has done a job on her, hasn't  it?'   ``Now, by contrast, Trump and his apologists pretend Russian  intervention, including WikiLeaks, was no big deal. That beggars  belief.''   The end of this is--and I am sorry I have to skip over some of it-- is:   ``That is the inconvenient truth that Putin Republicans won't  admit.''                            ____________________
