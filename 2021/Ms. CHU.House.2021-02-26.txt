 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the American  Rescue Plan.   This bill provides security to families with $1,400 survival checks.  It provides relief to the unemployed, increasing their insurance to  $400 a week. It expands loans to small businesses to help them stay  open. And, most importantly, it improves the distribution of vaccines  and PPE, and expands affordable healthcare coverage so we can stop the  terrible deaths that have occurred, saving people's lives.   One year into this crisis, we are beginning to see the light at the  end of the tunnel, thanks to the approval of vaccines. But we still  have months to go before we return to normal. That means more months of  anxiety for families, businesses, and healthcare providers, all already  stretched to the max. That is why today we must send urgently needed  aid directly to Americans as quickly as possible.   This bill is too important to delay any longer. We must pass this aid  today.
