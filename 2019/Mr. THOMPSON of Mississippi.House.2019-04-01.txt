(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended by       section 3 of this Act, is further amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 711 the following new item:  ``Sec. 712. Annual employee award program.''.       SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall investigate whether the application in       the Department of Homeland Security of discipline and adverse       actions are administered in an equitable and consistent       manner that results in the same or substantially similar       disciplinary outcomes across the Department for misconduct by       a non-supervisory or supervisor employee who engaged in the       same or substantially similar misconduct.        (b) Consultation.--In carrying out the investigation       described in subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the       United States shall consult with the Under Secretary for       Management of the Department of Homeland Security and the       employee engagement steering committee established pursuant       to subsection (b)(1) of section 711 of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (as added by section 3(a) of this Act).

SEC. 6. IMPACTS OF SHUTDOWN.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding the direct and       indirect impacts of the lapse in appropriations between       December 22, 2018, and January 25, 2019, on--        (1) Department of Homeland Security human resources       operations;        (2) the Department's ability to meet hiring benchmarks; and        (3) retention, attrition, and morale of Department       personnel.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1433, the DHS MORALE Act.   Mr. Speaker, every day, the Department of Homeland Security's  workforce carries out dozens of critical missions, which are as diverse  as preventing terrorism, securing cyberspace, transportation security,  and disaster recovery.   These 240,000 men and women deserve to have their contributions to  keeping the Nation secure valued by not only the American people but  also by DHS itself. Yet, even before the President's 35-day partial  government shutdown earlier this year, morale within DHS was a  persistent problem. In fact, for the past 7 years, DHS has ranked dead  last among all large Federal agencies in the Partnership for Public  Service's annual ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government''  survey.   This is unacceptable. Senior DHS leadership, most especially the  Secretary of Homeland Security, needs to prioritize improving morale  within the DHS workforce. In the Obama administration, then-DHS  Secretary Jeh Johnson began to address this operational imperative  through a range of programs under the unity of effort umbrella.  Unfortunately, the current administration largely abandoned those  promising efforts.   I have long been committed to improving conditions for the DHS  workforce. To that end, I reintroduced H.R.  [[Page H2929]]  1433, the DHS MORALE Act, a bill that passed the House unanimously and  received tremendous support from the labor organizations representing  the DHS labor force.   The DHS MORALE Act requires DHS to develop and implement policies  related to leadership development, employee engagement, career  progression, and employee recommendations.   This Congress, two new provisions were added to the bill. The first  directs the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer to analyze government-wide  Federal workforce satisfaction or morale surveys to inform efforts to  improve morale. The second provision requires a report to Congress on  the impact of the recent government shutdown on DHS human resources and  morale. Both of these measures would be a step toward fixing the  longstanding morale problems at DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1433, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   MR. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1433, the DHS MORALE Act. The bill  seeks to address an issue that has plagued the Department of Homeland  Security since its creation: low employee morale.   DHS has consistently reported low employee morale on the ``Federal  Employee Viewpoint Survey'' and today remains dead last out of large  agencies in employee satisfaction.   These numbers are troubling. DHS must find ways to improve employee  morale. The Department's mission is too important for these issues to  be ignored. H.R. 1433 will address the morale problem at DHS by  improving leadership development, workforce planning, and employee  engagement programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1433 to improve  morale throughout DHS and its components, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1433 would help improve morale among the  Department's 240,000 employees by creating and cataloging leadership  development opportunities, identifying and addressing factors that  impact employee engagement, and recognizing employee contributions.   The DHS MORALE Act continues to have the support of the National  Border Patrol Council, National Treasury Employees Union, and American  Federation of Government Employees. Enactment of the bill will help DHS  examine the root cause of the longstanding morale concerns and  determine the best strategy to move the Department forward in a  positive direction.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues' support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1593) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to establish a school security coordinating council, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1593         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Coordinating and Leveraging       Activities for School Security Act'' or the ``CLASS Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. SCHOOL SECURITY COORDINATING COUNCIL.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 711. SCHOOL SECURITY COORDINATING COUNCIL.         ``(a) Establishment.--There is established in the       Department a coordinating council to ensure that, to the       maximum extent practicable, activities, plans, and policies       to enhance the security of an early childhood education       program, elementary school, high school, or secondary schools       against an act of terrorism are coordinated.        ``(b) Composition.--The members of the council established       pursuant to subsection (a) shall include the following:        ``(1) The Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans.        ``(2) The Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure       Security.        ``(3) The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management       Agency.        ``(4) The Director of the Secret Service.        ``(5) The Executive Director of the Office of Academic       Engagement.        ``(6) The Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.        ``(7) Any other official of the Department the Secretary       determines appropriate.        ``(c) Leadership.--The Secretary shall designate a member       of the council to serve as chair of the council.        ``(d) Reports.--Not later than January 30, 2021, and       annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report regarding the       council's activities during the preceding year, including       information on any metrics regarding the efficacy of such       activities and any engagement with stakeholders outside of       the Federal Government.        ``(e) Definitions.--In this section, the terms `early       childhood education program', `elementary school', `high       school', and `secondary school' have the meanings given such       terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 710 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 711. School security coordinating council.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1593, the Coordinating and  Leveraging Activities for School Security Act.   Mr. Speaker, school violence continues to devastate communities and  take the lives of so many young people. In 2018, we saw a record number  of school shootings across the country. In response, Congressman    Donald Payne, Jr., introduced H.R. 1593, the Coordinating and  Leveraging Activities for School Security Act, known as the CLASS Act.   H.R. 1593 seeks to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security  organizes itself to help bolster school security. Specifically, the  CLASS Act establishes a standing body within DHS to coordinate the  Department's school security initiatives, activities, plans, and  policies. Additionally, to help ensure that DHS gives school security  adequate attention, H.R. 1593 requires the Department to report to  Congress on the work of the council.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1593, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), who is the author  of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, school shootings have  claimed the lives of too many young people. Passage of the CLASS Act  would ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is positioned to  be impactful in its efforts to address the escalating risk to school  security.   I commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues' support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1590) to require an exercise related to  terrorist and foreign fighter travel, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1590         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorist and Foreign       Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. EXERCISE ON TERRORIST AND FOREIGN FIGHTER TRAVEL.         (a) In General.--In addition to, or as part of exercise       programs currently carried out by the Department of Homeland       Security, to enhance domestic preparedness for and collective       response to terrorism, promote the dissemination of homeland       security information, and test the security posture of the       United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through       appropriate offices and components of the Department and in       coordination with the heads of appropriate Federal       departments and agencies, shall develop and conduct an       exercise related to the detection and prevention of terrorist       and foreign fighter travel.        (b) Exercise Requirements.--The exercise required under       subsection (a) shall include--        (1) a scenario involving--        (A) persons traveling from the United States to join or       provide material support or resources to a terrorist       organization abroad; and        (B) terrorist infiltration into the United States,       including by United States citizens and foreign nationals;        (2) coordination with appropriate Federal departments and       agencies, foreign governments, and State, local, Tribal, and       territorial agencies, including law enforcement agencies and       representatives from the National Network of Fusion Centers;       and        (3) coordination with appropriate private sector and       community stakeholders.        (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the completion of       the exercise required under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall, consistent with the protection of       classified information, submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate an       after-action report presenting the initial findings of such       exercise, plans for quickly incorporating lessons learned       into future operations of the Department of Homeland       Security, and any proposed legislative changes informed by       such exercise.        (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``material       support or resources'' has the meaning given such term in       section 2339A of title 18, United States Code.       SEC. 3. EMERGING THREATS IN THE NATIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAM.         Clause (i) of section 648(b)(2)(A) of the Post-Katrina       Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 748(b)(2))       is amended by inserting ``and emerging'' after ``credible''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1590, the Terrorist and  Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, in the almost 18 years since the September 11 terrorist  attacks, threats to the American public have become increasingly  complex and today include threats posed by foreign fighters.   In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating  Terrorism and Foreign Fighter Travel issued a bipartisan report that  included a number of recommendations.   H.R. 1590 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop and  conduct a foreign fighter exercise that could be built into existing  DHS domestic preparedness exercises. Importantly, after the exercise,  DHS is required to submit an after-action report to Congress detailing  the initial findings, plans for incorporating lessons learned, and any  legislative changes informed by this exercise.   A very similar version of this legislation passed the full House last  Congress. I am pleased that, through the markup process, modest  modifications were made to improve the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1590, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I close, let me  compliment the gentleman on the passage of this bill. This is, I  believe, his maiden bill before the House of Representatives, and, from  one Mississippian to another, I want to congratulate him for that.   Mr. Speaker, because terrorists are constantly seeking new ways to  cause harm and spread fear, we must continuously work to keep pace with  the evolving threat landscape.   H.R. 1590 seeks to strengthen the Nation's abilities to close the  gaps in how we identify and assess threats from terrorist foreign  fighters. As such, I support it and ask my colleagues to support it as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1589) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  intelligence and information sharing functions of the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to  require dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to  entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``CBRN Intelligence and       Information Sharing Act of 2019''.  [[Page H2932]]            SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1589, the Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Intelligence and Information  Sharing Act of 2019.   In the last two Congresses, the Committee on Homeland Security has  held several hearings on Federal, State, and local capabilities to  prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological,  or nuclear attack.   At those hearings, State and local stakeholders, including public  health professionals, emergency managers, and first responders,  expressed general awareness of the evolving CBRN threat, but expressed  frustration with the level of information sharing about such threats.   H.R. 1589 seeks to facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by  directing DHS to analyze CBRN-related terrorist threats and share  relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local  stakeholders.   These activities could help improve situational awareness at all  levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target their  limited resources.   Prior versions of this measure passed the House overwhelmingly in the  last two Congresses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, effective information  sharing is essential to prevent and respond to threats posed by bad  actors. H.R. 1589 will facilitate information sharing in the CBRN space  where new threats are constantly emerging.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1589, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
