 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Chair, 6 months ago I received an email from Ray Cullen, a  resident of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, who, along with his wife,  Deb, had raised their kids in my district, Pennsylvania's 13th  Congressional District.   Ray told the story of his son, Zach, who last year was out with a  bunch of buddies when he was sold cocaine that was laced with fentanyl,  unfortunately, a deadly poison that claimed Zach's life. Zach didn't  know that the drugs that he and his friends had purchased were laced  with this deadly synthetic opioid.   Because of how lethal the drug is in small quantities, fentanyl has  become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18  and 49. It was Franklin County Coroner Jeff Conner who put it so  bluntly to me. He said: ``Fentanyl is easy to get and it is fast to  kill.''   The Cullens reached out to share the memory of their son because they  wanted to make a difference. They wanted to make sure that the pain  that they were feeling was not shared by parents anywhere else in  Pennsylvania or anywhere else in our country.   Now, on the eve of the HALT Fentanyl Act vote, we in Congress have a  chance to help prevent these needless deaths by passing the HALT  Fentanyl Act, legislation to finally classify these deadly fentanyl  substances as schedule I narcotics.    Deb and Ray Cullen have traveled and presented their case before the  Energy and Commerce Subcommittee of Health. Deb and Ray Cullen will be  here tomorrow. They will be in the gallery as we have a choice to make  to vote in a bipartisan fashion to halt fentanyl and its deadly cause  here in the United States.
