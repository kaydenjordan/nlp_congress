 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Texas, the Honorable Jake Ellzey, be permitted to take  the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, as dean of the Texas delegation,  it is my honor to welcome to the U.S. House of Representatives  Congressman Jake Ellzey, who will represent Texas' Sixth Congressional  District.   Now, I know that he has only been a Congressman for a few seconds,  but I am sure that he is already behind on his schedule, so I will be  very brief.   Madam Speaker, our beliefs may differ, and our votes may contrast,  but I do not doubt for a moment that we share the same commitment to  public service and the same sentiment that what we need is consensus  builders, people willing to work together, regardless of party, for the  good of their constituents. Given that our two districts are next to  each other, I look forward to having a strong working relationship with  Congressman Ellzey, like I had with his two predecessors, Congressman  Joe Barton and the late Congressman Ron Wright.   Again, on behalf of the Texas delegation, welcome to the House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ellzey).
