 Mr. President, we are coming up now on 2 years of  Democratic governance here in Washington, 2 years in which Democrats  have controlled Congress and the White House, and the result of their 2  years in power is not encouraging. Economic insecurity is rampant; our  energy security situation has worsened; and on the national security  front, we are facing a raging crisis at our southern border, plus a  disturbing increase in violent crime across the country.   If there has been one defining feature of Democrat governance over  the past 20 months, it is inflation. When President Biden took office,  inflation was at 1.4 percent--well within the target inflation rate of  2 percent--but then Democrats decided to pass a massive $1.9 trillion  spending spree, the so-called American Rescue Plan Act. The legislation  flooded the economy with unnecessary government money, and the economy  overheated as a result. Inflation quickly began climbing and then  climbing some more and then some more after that.   We have now spent 6 straight months with inflation above 8 percent--6  straight months. The last time inflation was this bad, ``E.T.'' was  about to  [[Page S5119]]  hit theaters, and we still had more than a year to wait for ``Return of  the Jedi.'' For those who weren't around then, that was 40 years ago,  in 1982.   Inflation, of course, has meant tremendous economic pain for the  American people: huge grocery store bills, big utility bills, high  prices at the pump. Americans are dipping into their savings to make  ends meet. They are cutting back on essentials or putting basic living  expenses on their credit cards.   In the month of August alone, inflation cost the average American  household a staggering $715--$715, 1 month. Even if prices stopped  increasing tomorrow, the inflation that we have already experienced  will cost the average American household more than $8,500 over the next  year--$8,500. That is a lot of money--a lot. That is a kid's braces,  essential car repairs, essential home repairs. It is the difference  between putting something away for the kids' college or leaving the  education savings account empty. It is the difference between putting  money away for retirement or spending every penny on necessities. And  for too many families, that is the difference between breaking even or  finding themselves in debt or worse.   Americans' economic security has taken a serious hit under Democrat  control in Washington, and there is little evidence to suggest that  things are going to get any better anytime soon. Our economy is  weakening. We have posted negative economic growth for each of the past  two quarters, and estimates for third-quarter growth are not promising.  Major companies have announced job cuts, and the nonpartisan Conference  Board is projecting a recession in the coming months.   Unfortunately, the bad news is not confined to inflation or slowdowns  in economic growth, neither of which, I should note, will be helped by  Democrats' misleadingly named Inflation Reduction Act or by President  Biden's massive student loan giveaway, which the Committee for a  Responsible Federal Budget notes will ``meaningfully boost inflation.''   One major driver of inflation is high energy prices, and we are  facing a concerning situation on the energy front. As every American  who has paid an electricity bill or filled up his or her car is well  aware, energy has gotten much more expensive in Joe Biden's America.  Gas prices are up 57 percent since President Biden took office, and,  after a temporary decline, they are on the rise again. Electricity  prices were up 15.8 percent in August--the biggest year-over-year  increase since August of 1981. Utility gas service is up 33 percent.  And Americans are facing high prices to heat their homes this winter.   While there are multiple reasons for high oil and gas prices,  Democrats' hostility to conventional energy production is contributing  to this energy price crisis. I am a big supporter of alternative  energy, and I have been working for years in Congress to advance  renewable energy technology, but the fact of the matter is that we are  still a long way from being able to rely exclusively on alternative  energy technologies.   But that isn't something that Democrats seem able to accept. They  want their Green New Deal future, and they want it now. So despite our  continued need for oil and gas resources, President Biden has adopted  an energy agenda that is hostile to conventional energy production:  canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline--an environmentally responsible  pipeline project that would have reinforced our energy infrastructure;  discouraging investment in conventional energy; limiting oil and gas  leasing. The list goes on. And I haven't even mentioned Democrats'  latest measure: a round of tax hikes on oil and gas companies that will  drive up Americans' energy bills and continue to discourage  conventional energy production here at home.   The result of all this, the result of Democrats' attempt to force an  alternative energy future before that future is fully ready, will be  reducing our energy security and prolonging the high energy prices that  are hitting families and businesses.   Our Nation's energy security has declined under the Biden  administration, and so has our national security. I came to the floor  last week to talk yet again about another raging crisis at our southern  border--a crisis the President and Democrats are apparently content to  continue to ignore. The flow of illegal immigration across our southern  border has reached record levels. The Border Patrol and border  facilities are overwhelmed, and border communities are struggling. The  President and the Democrats, it would appear, could not care less.   Border security is an essential part of national security. It is not  just individuals hoping for a better life who are attempting to make  their way illegally across our southern border; all sorts of dangerous  individuals are attempting to make their way across as well, from gang  members, to human smugglers, to possible terrorists. So far this fiscal  year, the Border Patrol has encountered 78 individuals on the terror  watchlist attempting to cross our southern border illegally--78. And  that is the number of individuals the Border Patrol has managed to  apprehend. Given the incredible strain that Customs and Border  Protection is under, it is entirely possible that other individuals on  the watchlist have entered the country without our knowledge.   One thing we do know is that illegal drugs are flowing across our  southern border and contributing to violent crime. My State is almost  as far from the southern border as it is possible to get, but the flow  of illegal drugs across the southern border has a direct impact on  crime in our communities in South Dakota. The sheriff in my home county  in South Dakota recently stated that there is a ``direct connection  between the high percentage of our violent crimes [in Minnehaha County]  to the use and distribution of illegal drugs, in particular the drugs  that are poisoning our community.'' A substantial part of those drugs,  he went on to note, are coming from Mexican cartels across the southern  border.    Mr. President, there is a lot more to say about the way our Nation's  security has declined over the past 2 years. There is the increase in  violent crime--an increase undoubtedly driven in part by woke Democrat  prosecutors' lax attitude toward serious crimes and Democrats'  willingness to accommodate the ``defund the police'' movement. There is  our botched withdrawal from Afghanistan--a national security debacle  that weakened our standing internationally and emboldened terrorists  and the Taliban. And there are the President's ill-conceived plans for  a nuclear deal with Iran.   But I will stop here. Suffice it to say that it has been a rough  couple of years under Democrat governance on both the economic and the  security fronts, and if Democrats get a chance to continue with their  policies, I expect the situation will continue to get worse.
