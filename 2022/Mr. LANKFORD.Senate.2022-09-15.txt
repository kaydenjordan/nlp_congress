 Madam President, 2 years ago, almost to the exact  moment, I was sitting on the south lawn of the White House in the  blazing Sun, where a redhead should never sit, getting a sunburn, on a  hot September day in DC, watching leadership of the UAE, Bahrain,  Israel, and the United States all shake hands and sign an agreement  called the Abraham Accords. It was a remarkable moment in American  history.   We have become so accustomed in the last 2 years to this conversation  about the Abraham Accords, we lose track that it was just 2 years ago  that we had one of the greatest breakthroughs in Middle East peace that  we have had in decades.   In 1979, Egypt and Israel came together for a peace agreement under  President Jimmy Carter and the Camp David Accords. In 1994, Jordan and  Israel normalized relationships under President Clinton. But for 26  years, there were no additional peace agreements and, quite frankly,  very few conversations even. It stopped. All the conversation among  foreign affairs was that you had to resolve the Palestinian conflict  before anything else could be resolved in the Middle East, and for 26  years, all the focus was on that.   The Trump administration came in and put the whole thing on its head  and said: What if? What if we work towards peace agreements outside of  the Palestinian conversation? If we set that aside, could we still  normalize agreements?   Again, most people said: No, that is not possible--until 2 years ago  today. Two years ago today, when the leaders of UAE, Bahrain, Israel,  and the United States met together and signed an agreement, they  started not just a process, they started a conversation and a dialogue.  They shook hands and signed an agreement that had remarkable statements  in it about religious liberty that we look at and think: The Arab world  would not sign that, but they did, quite frankly, because people hadn't  asked them to.   There were conversations and agreements made about energy policy,  about economic development in a region of the world that many would say  that no one will ever meet and this will never get better.   President Reagan once said:         Our involvement in the search for Middle East peace is not       a matter of preference; it is a moral imperative.   [[Page S4806]]     We are a people of peace. We are a people, as a nation, passionate  about religious liberty. We are a people who want to see a nation  joining other nations in economic development. It is who we are. It is  who we have been from the beginning, and we are at our best when we are  expanding that.   Since the signing of that document, several things have happened in  that 2-year time period.   The first thing that happened, really, was that in October of 2020,  Sudan raised their hand and said: I want to join that agreement. Then,  in December of 2020, Morocco raised their hand and said: I want to be  in that agreement. It quickly went from four nations to five, to six,  all in this ongoing dialogue about peace in the region.   The countries have exchanged Ambassadors since then. Again, that may  not sound revolutionary, but it is in that region. The UAE, Morocco,  and Bahrain all opened up Embassies in Israel--again, revolutionary.  Israel opened up its Embassy--the first ever in the Gulf nations--in  Abu Dhabi in January of 2021. It opens up its next Embassy in Bahrain  in September of 2021.   The UAE and Israel have signed comprehensive free-trade agreements.  There is now $10 billion worth of trade in the next 5 years that has  been set up between those nations. Trade has begun between Israel and  Morocco. In fact, it has increased 94 percent in a year. Trade between  the UAE and Israel has increased 88 percent in 1 year. Trade between  Israel and Egypt, even, has increased 41 percent in the last year and  between Israel and Jordan, with a longstanding agreement, has increased  55 percent.   The UAE and Morocco now have university students who are studying in  Israeli universities--something we thought we would never see. The UAE  has overhauled its school curriculum to increase tolerance and  understanding of other faiths and other religious groups.   Dozens of daily flights are now moving in those Abraham Accord  countries, bringing business and tourism. There are even real  conversations about water, about energy sharing and development and  large economic infrastructure projects.   There are other countries, even, in the region that have started to  take notice of this. Countries like Saudi Arabia are now allowing  Israeli-bound flights to fly through Saudi airspace. Now, again, that  may not seem revolutionary to some, that planes get to fly over them,  but, you understand, 2 years ago, that didn't happen. The Saudis made  every Israeli-bound flight go around their airspace. Israel and Saudi  Arabia have also participated in multilateral naval and air drills,  alongside UAE, Bahrain, and other countries. It is an enormous shift.   If I can even say this in the region, Israel and Lebanon are very  close right now to forming an agreement on what they call the Blue  Line, the border between Israel and Lebanon, including the maritime  areas. What does that matter? It is a tremendous development for  Lebanon, for their economic development, because there is a large  natural gas field just off of Lebanon's coast, but the border has been  unresolved for years.   In the conflict between nations and the trust that has collapsed, the  Abraham Accords have provided an opportunity and a moment for the  nations in the region to say: If peace can begin with UAE and Bahrain  and Sudan and Morocco and Israel and recognition and economic  development and Ambassadors can be exchanged, who else can engage in  economic development?   Let's start with their neighbor Lebanon. To build trust is to also  build clear borders. This is real progress in 2 years.   My challenge to the administration and to our State Department is,  fan the flame. Keep going on this. We have seen nations begin to do  economic development, families meeting other families, school  curriculum changing to taking out anti-Semitic tropes, basically, out  of their curriculum. We have seen real progress in this area. Keep  going. Other nations should be welcomed to be able to join in the  Abraham Accords. It is not closed. Other nations can join in that  economic development.   There are four of us who began the Abraham Accords Caucus: myself,  Senator Rosen, Senator Ernst, and Senator Booker. We launched out the  four of us and invited all of our colleagues to be able to join into  it. Our focus is to be able to work with the Ambassadors of those  nations to say: How can we partner together to bless what has already  occurred, and how can we expand into other nations? How can we  encourage increased economic development?   Now, there are still very real challenges. The work is not done by  any means, but it has at least begun, and progress is taking off--this  simple principle of economic engagement, going past all of the  government noise and saying: What if we allowed infrastructure to be  able to work together? What if we allowed tourism to be able to happen?  What if we allowed businesses to work with other businesses in other  nations that used to be hostile? How can we engage in such a way that  would help?   The four of us in the Abraham Accords Caucus brought to the floor  today a resolution to recognize this 2-year anniversary. It sat before  all 100 Senators, and I don't know a single Senator who is opposed to  that because we all want to see peace in the Middle East. We all want  to see that kind of progress, and we all want to see this increase.   So, to our State Department, keep the work going. Keep the  conversation going. To nations around the world that used to be hostile  to Israel and the region, why don't we set down the past and prepare  our families for the future?   I yield the floor.
