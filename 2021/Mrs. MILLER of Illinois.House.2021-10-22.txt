 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 3110, the PUMP Act.   Americans want nursing mothers to have adequate provisions in the  workplace. The fact is, they are already provided in the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   The bill before us consists of unreasonable burdens on employers and  penalties that will end up disincentivizing job creation.   At the same time that nursing mothers deserve protections, employers  deserve allowances for flexibility in their workplace.   We are in the midst of an economic, supply chain, and employment  crisis. We don't need to put more hurdles in the way of businesses and  employment.   When I am in my district and I speak to business owners all around my  district, the number one thing I hear is we cannot find enough workers.  Why are we going to put more strain on them?
