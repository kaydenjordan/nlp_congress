 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 624, the  Promoting Transparent Standards for Corporate Insiders Act.   Introduced by Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry, this  bipartisan bill would require the SEC to update regulatory language to  ensure corporate insiders are not able to take advantage of loopholes  in the system to engage in illegal insider trading.   The language within the bill overwhelming passed the House last  Congress as part of the JOBS Act 3.0.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, it should be a top priority for financial  regulators to ensure clear guidelines and robust enforcement against  any illegal activity.   This legislation, along with the SEC's recent guidance, will help us  better understand insider trading, serve as a driving force to hold  potential bad actors accountable, and further promote good governance  among the leaders of our Nation's financial system.   I strongly support this bill and would like to thank Ranking Member  McHenry for the time this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I also look forward to working with all my colleagues on  the Financial Services Committee, and I thank Chairwoman Waters for  filing this bill and carrying it forward.
