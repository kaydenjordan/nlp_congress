 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Marine  Sergeant Joseph Murray, who paid the ultimate sacrifice on July 12,  2017, when a KC-130 military transport plane crashed in the Mississippi  Delta.   Sergeant Murray had lived in Jacksonville, Florida, since he was 10  years old and was a military dependent whose father was in the Navy for  over 20 years. He was a Sandalwood High School graduate in the class of  2009, and joined the Marines that same year. He was stationed at Camp  Lejeune, North Carolina.   Sergeant Murray was promoted three times in the first 3 years he was  in the Marine Corps, and he was very proud of his two deployments to  Afghanistan. He told his father he wanted to be a grunt instead of an  intelligence officer because ``that is the hardest thing to do.'' He  died as a member of a special operations team, where his closest  friends were the fellow marines who served next to him.   Sergeant Murray was a proud husband and father, with four children: a  5-year-old son, a 3-year-old daughter, and 1-year-old twin boys.    He met his wife, Gayle, the same year he joined the military, and he  was a family man who loved to serve others. Gayle said that he would do  anything for his family and loved to play his guitar for them. She  said: ``What he wanted most in the world, besides his family's  happiness, was to destroy evil on Earth.''   His father, Terry, stated the only thing stronger than his commitment  to his family was his commitment to his church. In fact, he was known  to hum praise and worship songs when he was on patrol, and his fellow  servicemembers looked to him as a faith leader. A fellow marine  mentioned: ``When Joseph stopped that humming and singing praises, they  took the safeties off their weapons because they thought something was  up. All was well when Joseph was with them.''   His father said: ``The city of Jacksonville should be very proud to  have had his son come from here.''   I can attest today for the citizens of northeast Florida that we are  very proud, very proud and honored to have had Sergeant Murray  defending our freedoms. Sergeant Murray's dedication to his faith,  family, and nation will always be remembered.   May God bless and keep you and your family.   Semper fi, Sergeant Murray.                            ____________________
