 Mr. Speaker, he was a soldier who had given 45 years of  service to his country. 222 years ago, this month, he crafted a  farewell address to the Nation. In it, he made no attempt to recount  his time as a businessman, warrior, lawmaker, founder, Framer,  battlefield commander, or President of a United States that he, more  than any other, helped to create.                                time  1700    Instead, George Washington, chose to offer ``disinterested warnings  of a parting friend,'' which he felt were, important to the permanency  of our felicity as a people.   Leaders today departing public service might recount their personal  journey and thank those who shared some of their path. Washington's  final words were nothing of the sort. He chose, instead, to look far  into the future and address all of us, the future. None of us can know  it. We get occasional glimpses of it by talking to older people, those  a little further down the road.   From them, we gain wisdom and counsel. Yet, sadly, each generation  imagines that it faces unprecedented problems only to dismiss the  counsels of the generation or two before them. We find it tough to  absorb the Wisdom of Solomon when he stated, ``There is nothing new  under the Sun.'' Another way to put it is this: Times change, people  don't.   Taking this truth, what would George Washington say to us if he were  here today? What counsels would he give our Nation? What relevance  would it have? Fortunately, in this gleaming alabaster city that bears  his name, we have rich archives to continue to hear from George  Washington. Whether we are wise enough to heed Washington, is another  matter altogether.   Surprisingly, he gave no recommendation for us to love liberty, as  liberty is in the very fiber of the human race, and was certainly  heightened among the early Americans whose efforts had recently secured  it. Instead, Washington made a vital observation while trying to give  future Americans a heads-up. Here it is: Liberty does not secure  independence.   Washington knew a fallen mankind would flourish in liberty, and as  such, Americans would be enticed to reduce and erode our independence  for temporary gain or perceived future benefit. Instead of liberty, he  identified unity as the essential factor to retain American  independence.   At first ponder, this seems counterintuitive. After all, unified  efforts require a certain accommodation to one another for greater  good, necessitating an occasional deferential voluntary reduction in  one's personal liberty.   Unity achieves result without reducing liberty through power, pen,  statute, or sword. For these reasons, Washington told America that  unity was the, ``main pillar in the edifice of your real independence,  the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad, of your  safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so highly  prize.''   Even after 242 years as a Republic, we still embody this idea in our  national motto: e pluribus unum, a Latin phrase meaning, out of many-- one.   We see it in our pledge, with terms like ``one Nation,''  ``indivisible,'' but what of our behavior today? We still, on occasion,  employ the words, but we deploy actions that could better be described  as e pluribus pluribus. One hyphenated nation and divisible.   Washington warned of it: ``But as it is easy to foresee that, from  different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken,  many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this  truth . . . that you should properly estimate the immense value of your  national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you  should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it;  accustoming yourselves to think . . . of it as . . . your political  safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous  anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it  can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first  dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from  the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the  various parts.''   Washington's words today read like stinging rebuke to all Americans.  Instead of guarding our institutions jealously with cordial, habitual,  and immovable attachment, we in these august Chambers across every  aisle allow disruption to displace discourse, polarization to pass for  politics, and resistance to replace result.   Mr. Speaker, we stand condemned, but not irredeemable. Like any first  step, admitting the problem is the path to recovery. How did we allow  these congressional Chambers to suffer such infiltration? Our own  history contains sharp lessons of discord, the loss of our own  lawmakers by caning and shooting--sometimes by our own selves; a  preference for conflict over Constitution, and a division so great that  we ended up destroying each other on America's fields and farms from  Gettysburg to Vicksburg.   Washington's warnings went unheeded a mere 100 years after he gave  them. We self-corrected, but only after great harm to ourselves. It has  been 150 years since we nearly destroyed each other. Are we on any more  secure a path? It would appear from our treatment of each other and our  view of our own Nation's future that we are tempted to walk an old  path. If that be the case, then taking counsel from George Washington  might be a timely exercise.   With regard to unity, we must realize we are all in the ship of state  together. Crashing it on the rocks as we fight each other for control  of the helm will deny any safe harbor we wish to obtain. Washington  believed that we must view our unity as a sacred tie that links  together the various parts.   ``Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a  right to concentrate your affections. The name `American,' which  belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just  pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local  discriminations. With slight shades of difference you have the same  religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have a common  cause fought in triumph together; the independence and liberty you  possess are the work of joint counsels and joint efforts of common  dangers, sufferings and successes. . . . your union ought to be  considered as a main prop to your liberty, and that the love of one  ought to endear you to the preservatio of the other.''    If the unity of our people be the main prop of our liberty, what was  it that George Washington believed would knock out that prop?   Warning number one and number two from George Washington,  Geographical and Party Disunion: Washington believed, ``a government  for the whole is indispensable.'' When various parts of the country  come to feel that they are more important than the others, they will  ``acquire influence within particular districts to misrepresent the  opinions and aims of other districts.''   Disregarding government for some regional or geographical preference  to suit our own interest is a sure way to erode our unity. Washington's  view of our government was to show ``Respect for its authority,  compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties  enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty.''   Washington believed that the Constitution and its authentic amending  was an act by the people upon themselves, and that every American would  naturally have an obligation to obey the established government for the  experiment even to work.  [[Page H9144]]    ``All obstructions to the execution of the laws . . . designs to  direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular constituted  authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and a fatal  tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and  extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the  Nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising  minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of  different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the  ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the  organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and  modified by mutual interests.''   Washington foresaw that geographical interests could coalesce around  party preferences, with urban and rural, coastal and inland, northern  and southern, eastern and western, forming the basis by which we would  try to empower ourselves with party faction to obtain the interests of  one rather than the interests of all.   For our government to work for the whole Nation, he encouraged us to  ``remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the  true character of governments as of other human institutions.''   For example, we understand that it takes time for a child to become  an adult, or that an adult, in time, must master his or her skills and  experience to succeed in work or creativity. Yet, somehow, we imagine  that the difficult things of government can be solved in months, when  in the natural flow of life, it takes years and decades to secure true  accomplishment.   Even if we were able to accept this wisdom, we find ourselves  provoked to what Washington called, ``the spirit of revenge'' among  parties as one faction would alternate domination over the other.  Washington warned that it was, ``natural to party dissension, which in  different ages and countries has perpetuated the most horrid  enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length  to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries  which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and  repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the  chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his  competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own  elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.''   Washington warned that party faction would always distract public  cooperation, weakening our government's ability to function. Loyalty to  party over the Nation would, in his phrases, agitate communities,  kindle animosity, foment occasional riot and insurrection, and open the  door for foreign influence and corruption to weaken the Nation.   He also warned of those using patriotism and liberty as their  justification to stress the Nation, rising in their deep conviction  with the spirit of party and urgency. Admitting that there would be  some indulgence for this, if not favor, he warned that such a spirit  was not to be encouraged.   He called upon all Americans to not fan these embers as they were ``a  fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its  bursting into flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.''   Warning number three, The Encroachment of National Leaders:  Washington warned that national leaders ``to confine themselves within  their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of  the powers of one department to encroach upon another . . . The spirit  of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments  in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real  despotism . . . If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or  modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong,  let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution  designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this,  in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary  weapon by which free governments are destroyed.''   Warning number four, Religious Abandonment: For all of Washington's  warnings about political and party faction, his remedy was very clear.  So clear, in fact, that its absence, he said, would guarantee that our  Nation would lack human rights.   ``Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political  prosperity, religion and morality are dispensable supports. . . . Let  it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation,  for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which  are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us  with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained  without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined  education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both  forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of  religious principle. . . . virtue or morality is a necessary spring of  popular government. Who . . . can look with indifference upon attempts  to shake the foundation of the fabric?''                                time  1715    Warning number five, Public Debt and Weakened Defense: Washington had  much to say about public credit. He believed it should be used as  sparingly as possible. He also believed one sure way to preserve the  national treasury would be to promote peace, but also to fund the  government on time. Proper funding would secure the Nation, preventing  greater cost to repel danger and burden the Nation with debt. Toward  all national debts, Washington reminded all Americans that it took  revenue to pay them.   ``The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but  it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to  them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should  practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts, there must  be revenue; that to have revenue, there must be taxes; that no taxes  can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and  unpleasant.''   For these reasons, Washington warned that our motives must be  decisive in the expense of government and to choose wisely the objects  that we should fund. To ignore this would weaken our Nation as a whole.   Warning number six, Entangling and Favored Alliances: Washington's  view of foreign policy was to: ``Observe good faith and justice towards  all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and  morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not  equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened nation, and  at no distant period, a great nation, to give mankind the magnanimous  and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice  and benevolence.''   Washington believed good morality would naturally create good foreign  policy, fairness, and impartiality. He urged to treat all nations  equally, initially. He warned that adverse relations with nations would  result in poor policy and unnecessary conflict. Unnecessary favor to  particular nations might pull us into conflict with some other where we  may have had no quarrel at all.   Washington was passionate here: ``Against the insidious wiles of  foreign influence, I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens, the  jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history  and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful  foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be  impartial.''   His final warning, warning number seven, Partiality in Commerce:  Washington instructed: ``The great rule of conduct for us in regard to  foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with  them as little political connection as possible.''   Washington believed strong relations could be built upon commerce,  keeping us in a fair and neutral position, preventing entanglement in  disputes between other nations. He urged to steer clear of permanent  alliances, but, rather, that ``we may safely trust to temporary  alliances for extraordinary emergencies.''   Washington argued commerce should be equal and impartial, neither  seeking nor granting exclusive favors; to consult the natural course of  things; to handle gently the natural streams of commerce; to force  nothing; to define the rights of our merchants; to enter upon  agreements in a temporary fashion, recognizing that from time to time  such commerce could be abandoned or modified as needs and circumstances  might dictate.  [[Page H9145]]    Washington foresaw that, if we expected disinterested favors from  other nations without an equal benefit, there would be an accounting.  He warned: ``There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate  upon real favors from nation to nation.''   George Washington had no illusions that his warnings would endure to  control the Nation's passions. He did hope, however, they ``may be  productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; that they may  now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn  against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the  impostures of pretended patriotism.''   So where do we stand, Mr. Speaker, as a nation in these areas of  warning?   How are we doing on geographical and party disunion?   We stand guilty of it. The average American citizen has only been to  8 of her 50 States, and our national leaders and our own people  disrespect our Nation's Capitol as a swamp.   We see coastal cities referring to interior rural towns as ``flyover  country,'' not realizing that nearly all of their food comes from it,  while rural areas declaring coastal regions would not be missed if they  simply fell into the ocean, not realizing that these areas represent  the bulk of national trade and economy.   We see Americans electing the most polarized to the left or to the  right, sending them to work in Washington, D.C., wondering why they  can't get along to get things done when they get here.   We see elected leaders calling for disruption and resistance rather  than discourse and result.   We see chairs thrown through campus windows because we cannot abide  free speech.   We see history expunged because we cannot abide free thought.   We have abandoned accommodation, bypassed toleration, encouraged  isolation, organized intimidation, and are set to pursue a path to  castigation.   What is next? Elimination of our Republic?   We must get reacquainted as Americans with unity, with the idea that  the Nation comes before region, before party, before self. A republic  is a mutual enterprise. We must relearn how to keep it.   How are we doing on Washington's warning of national leaders  encroaching on each other's branch of government or each other's  business?   We complain of judges legislating from benches while we judge from  our legislatures.   We see executive branches move by power of decree rather than by  power of consent.   We see people ignore Federal authority while demanding Federal aid.   We have eroded respected institutions as elected leaders abandon  civil conduct in hearings, confusing disruption, disrespect, and  division somehow with democracy. We have deluded ourselves that  rudeness is now a form of representation.    If we cannot respect these hallowed institutions that we ourselves,  as Americans, control, how can we possibly receive respect in return  from our fellow citizens as we look to lead government?   If we spent as much effort to watch our own lanes and make government  business efficient rather than inflammatory, we might just restore some  respect to the greatest constitutional republic that has ever existed.  And, Mr. Speaker, it starts with us.   And how about Washington's warning on expecting morality without  religion?   We have traded accommodation for castigation, abandoning the very  religious principles adorning all 13 of our original State  constitutions, our own Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and  Bill of Rights.   Every Chamber, hall, ceiling, nook, and corner of our Capitol is  adorned with these foundational beliefs. In this very Chamber, ``In God  We Trust'' is over the Speaker's podium, and 97 percent of the Members  of Congress claim these principles in their personal beliefs. Why then  have we become silent on free exercise of religion guaranteed in our  Constitution?   We have imagined that we can show respect without being respectful.   We have encouraged and exchanged truth for a lie and now wonder why  people are so uncivil to one another, and why we have faded hope,  unclear vision, purpose, or reason to be a force for good in the world  as a United States.   Contrary to Washington's warning, we imagine we can have morality  without the free exercise of religion. We foolishly believe we can fix  moral problems with political solutions. I am of the belief we need to  ask God's forgiveness.   What of Washington's warning on public debt, $20 trillion and  counting?   We demand thrift from each other but not from ourselves in our  personal pocketbooks. The problem is so great today, but not greater  than our people if we lead by our individual examples.   We, the nationally elected leaders, are a reflection of America as a  whole. Until Americans demand fiscal discipline in themselves, it will  be a long wait to expect it from those whom we elect.   We, the people, have put ourselves into this situation by making  demands of government to pay for all of our shortcomings. At some  point, that payment becomes due. We must ask less from the government  and more from ourselves, solving our problems locally, together,  without an invitation for government control.   What of Washington's warning on alliances and trade?   Rather than a fair and bilateral approach to nations, we have  entangled ourselves in multinational permanent agreements on trade,  without the vision to think that the circumstances may change.   We have pledged long-term favored status by treaty as opposed to  short-term agreements and objectives. We have a moral obligation to  honor the agreements we have enjoined, but we would do well to heed  Washington's counsel to approach foreign relations commercially and  have as little political connection to them as possible.   Mr. Speaker, George Washington's counsel is sorely needed today. We  stand guilty in all seven of his warnings. We are guilty but not  irredeemable. Americans have a history of self-correction.  Unfortunately, it often comes with some great distress or disaster. We  can and must heed Washington's warnings now and correct by choice  rather than by circumstance.   As a combat infantryman, a warrior, returning home from more than two  decades of personal service, who now has a political life, I have asked  myself this question:   How did we as Americans allow our voice to be co-opted by self- proclaimed cynics and critics on both sides of the political spectrum  who have divided our great Nation?   When did American zeal for innovation, sweat, and determination  become replaced with intimidation, threat, and extermination of  meaningful dialogue by pathetic keyboard commandos eating their bags of  Cheese Puffs while sunken into their couches?   America has never been built on the labor and counsel of cynics and  critics. Americans, we need to wake up. It is time to rekindle that  spirit that united our country, ended enslavement, enriched our land,  advanced our arts and sciences, granted women's suffrage, protested  inequality, and protected the defenseless.   Americans know the difference between what is evil and what is good.                                time  1730    The question we must now ask is whether we will unite and continue to  live free or continue to attack ourselves, give way to cynicism, and  watch America's liberty and place in the world die.   Thank God America is still full of men and women who know it is not  the cynic and critic who dig the ditch, teach the child, inspire the  solutions, or create the future.   It is time for Americans to put America before self again, to  inspire, to lead, to unify, and to sacrifice. It starts with each of us  sacrificing a few things, sacrifice doubt, sacrifice anxiety, sacrifice  cynicism.   America cannot allow warriors like me to come home from a decade of  fighting and war to see our Republic overcome by the self-indulgent,  the divisive, and the visionless.   As visionary as we Americans and lovers of liberty claim to be, we  will make little headway if our only answers to our friends and  neighbors are mere sideline snipes about what is wrong with this  country.  [[Page H9146]]    Are we so shortsighted that we cannot accommodate dialogue, exchange  ideas, and show some deference and respect to one another and rebuild  our Nation?   It is time for the American people to embrace what is right about our  wonderful country, not what is wrong with it. Let us heed Washington's  warnings and get to work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
