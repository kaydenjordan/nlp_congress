 Madam Speaker, American families are at  greater risk of mass murder terrorist attacks than ever before due to  the failing border policies of President Biden.   Intentionally opening the southern border, nearly 3 million illegal  aliens from over 160 countries have intruded since Biden took office.   American jobs are destroyed. Deadly drugs are smuggled by cartels,  leading to over 100,000 deaths last year, devastating American  families. Most gruesome is the imminent danger of known terrorists from  the Terrorist Screening Database crossing into America.   Last year, in Del Rio, Texas, officials would not reveal to me the  number of terrorists crossing. Now, we see the threat is real, with 50  terrorists just this year. These terrorists are skilled, well-financed,  fully equipped, and maniacally motivated mass murderers.   Open borders for terrorists must be addressed. Biden should now take  every action to protect American families.    In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism, as it continues,  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
