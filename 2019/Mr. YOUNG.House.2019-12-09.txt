 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr.  Johnson has done a great job. That was a great presentation. I am very  proud of him.   Each person who has spoken on this legislation really put it in  context about the Esther Martinez program started in 2006. I happened  to be a cosponsor of that bill. I watched it pass and become a reality,  and it has worked.   What we are doing is reauthorizing a program that allows a culture to  be retained through languages. In Alaska, we have 20 Native languages  and 40-some dialects.   As the gentleman said, we lost that for a long period of time.  Language is what keeps the culture together. It is important for the  past, important for the present, and important for the future.   The University of Alaska has a program, the Alaska Native Language  Center, which has worked very well since the 1970s. We were well ahead  with this program, and we want to continue it.   We have an innovative Alaska Native Cultural Charter School in  Anchorage that teaches Yupik to all the students so there is an  exchange, not just Native, but between other races, so they understand  the language.   I believe this is one of the best programs that we are able to  achieve. The funding probably is still inadequate, but it is a  continuation of good work by this Congress.   I thank each one of you who has been participating in this,  especially Representative Lujan. I am a little bit  [[Page H9380]]  concerned, if I may. I don't want to speak about the other body, but we  know who it is. They have taken Mr. Lujan's bill and sort of put their  name on it, but we will forgive them because we will get it done.   This is good legislation. I also would like to thank Representative  Price, who co-chairs the American Languages Caucus with me.   Again, congratulations. This is good legislation. The chairman has  done well, and let's continue to act.
