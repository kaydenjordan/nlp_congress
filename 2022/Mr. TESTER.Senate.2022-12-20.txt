 Madam President, I want to start by echoing Senator  Padilla in thanking Senator Cornyn from Texas, Senator Padilla from  California, and Senator Murkowski from Alaska for working on this  important issue.   This is a place where oftentimes common sense tends to take a leave  of absence. This is a great example of a commonsense bill wherein folks  have come together on both sides of the aisle to address challenges  that are facing our local governments.   Earlier this month, Senator Murkowski and I introduced our Local  Assistance Fairness Act. This bill fixes an error in the American  Rescue Plan's Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund that has  prevented consolidated local governments from accessing this critical  funding. Back in Montana, this has impacted two of our counties and  municipalities--Butte-Silver Bow and Anaconda-Deer Lodge. Both of these  counties can use this help. This legislation will help them continue to  keep folks safe, improve infrastructure, and lay the groundwork for  bringing good-paying jobs to the region.   I appreciate my friends from Texas and California and Senator  Murkowski  [[Page S7814]]  for including this bill in the Cornyn-Padilla bill.   We thank you very much for that.   I look forward to getting this to the President's desk for his  signature.   I yield the floor.
