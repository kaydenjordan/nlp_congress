 Mr. President, on May 17, 2022, I missed rollcall votes  Nos. 179, 180, and 181 while traveling to my  [[Page S2747]]  daughter's graduation from law school. Had I been present, I would have  voted yea on rollcall vote No. 179, cloture on the nomination of  Jennifer Rochon to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of  New York; yea on rollcall vote No. 180, cloture on the nomination of  Trina Thompson to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of  California; and yea on rollcall vote No. 181, cloture on the nomination  of Sunshine Sykes to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District of  California.   On May 18, 2022, I missed rollcall votes Nos. 182, 183, 184, 185,  186, 187, 188, and 189 while attending my daughter's graduation from  law school. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on rollcall vote  No. 182, confirmation of Jennifer Rochon to be U.S. District Judge for  the Southern District of New York; yea on rollcall vote No. 183,  cloture on the nomination of Barbara Leaf to be Assistant Secretary of  State for Near East Affairs; yea on rollcall vote No. 184, confirming  Barbara Leaf to be Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs;  yea on rollcall vote No. 185, cloture on the nomination of Elizabeth  Watson to be an Assistant Secretary of Labor; yea on rollcall vote No.  186, confirming Elizabeth Watson to be an Assistant Secretary of Labor;  yea on rollcall vote No. 187, confirming Trina Thompson to be U.S.  District Judge for the Northern District of California; yea on rollcall  vote No. 188, confirming Sunshine Sykes to be U.S. District Judge for  the Central District of California; and yea on rollcall vote No. 189,  confirming Christopher Lowman to be Assistant Secretary of Defense.   On May 19, 2022, I missed rollcall votes Nos. 190, 191, 192, and 193  while attending my daughter's graduation from law school. Had I been  present, I would have voted yea on rollcall votes Nos. 190 and 191,  cloture and final passage, respectively, of H.R. 7691, the Additional  Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022. Since the beginning of  Russia's brutal war, I have been a strong supporter of additional aid  to Ukraine, and I am glad that this legislation passed the Senate with  broad, bipartisan support.   Had I been present on May 19, I also would have voted yea on rollcall  vote No. 192, cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 4008, the Small  Business COVID Relief Act of 2022. This important bipartisan  legislation would have provided over $40 billion in COVID relief to  support restaurants, live entertainment venues, and other struggling  small businesses. I have been a longtime supporter of replenishing the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund and providing more aid to small  businesses, so I was extremely disappointed that the Senate fell many  votes short of beginning debate on S. 4008. I will continue to be a  champion for Nevada's restaurants and small businesses, working to make  sure they get the resources needed to get back on their feet.   Finally, had I been present on May 19, I would have voted yea on  rollcall vote No. 193, cloture on the nomination of Stephanie Davis to  be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  beloved member of the Las Vegas community, Angie Ruvo, who passed away  this month at the age of 98. Recognized as Las Vegas' first celebrity  chef, Angie, along with her husband Lou, her sister Maria, brother-in- law Al, and son Larry, established the Venetian Pizzeria in downtown  Las Vegas in 1955--the first pizza restaurant in Las Vegas. Later known  as the Venetian Ristorante and Pizzeria, the famed restaurant hosted a  wide array of clientele, ranging from celebrities such as Frank  Sinatra--a customer so loyal he enlisted a bellman to pick up dinner  for him from there every night--to tourists who traveled from across  the country and all over the world to experience the warmth and comfort  of Angie's cooking.   Born in Niagara Falls, Angie became the matriarch of the Las Vegas  restaurant scene almost as soon as she came to Nevada, but her  remarkable legacy in the Silver State goes beyond her business and  culinary achievements. When her late husband Lou was diagnosed with  Alzheimer's, Angie embraced the role of devoted caregiver. Sharing her  own experience and advice with other caregivers became a significant  role for Angie, and she frequently reminded other caregivers of the  importance of self-care. In 2009, Larry Ruvo and his wife Camille  opened the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in his  father's memory. In honor of her 94th birthday, Larry and Camille  created the Angie Ruvo Endowed Caregiving Chair, which provides  financial support to caregiving research at the Lou Ruvo Center.   In addition to being a champion for caregivers, Angie dedicated her  life to charitable work in her community and was honored by various  organizations over the years, including receiving the Augustus  Society's Justinian Award, presented to notable Nevada Italian  Americans. A woman praised and recognized by Senators and celebrities  alike--and for whom Nevada Governors issued official proclamations-- Angie lived a life of philanthropy, generosity, and dedication. Her  passing marks an immeasurable loss to her family, our community, and  the Nation. May her memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
