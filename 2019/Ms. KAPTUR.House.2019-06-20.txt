 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Bishop), a superb chair of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and I rise to  discuss an issue very important to America's livestock and poultry  farmers, the Packers and Stockyards Act.   For decades, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards  Administration, familiarly known as GIPSA, was a stand-alone agency  within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Until recently, GIPSA was a parallel agency to the Agricultural  Marketing Service itself. But under Secretary Sonny Perdue's  reorganization of the Department of Agriculture and consolidation plan,  GIPSA was moved deep within the Agricultural Marketing Service--some  fear, buried.   Now, the Packers and Stockyards Division of the Fair Trade Practices  Branch within the Agricultural Marketing Service administers the  Packers and Stockyards Act.   Do you see the layers?   This consolidation will increase difficulty for farmers who seek  relief from unfair and abusive practices common--unfortunately--in the  livestock and poultry sectors.   The administration recently announced a rulemaking process to define  criteria the Secretary will consider to determine violations of the  Packers and Stockyards Act on whether an undue or unreasonable  preference or advantage occurred.   I welcome this action.                                time  1245    These terms were never adequately defined or explained. However, I am  very concerned this administration is  [[Page H4947]]  utilizing delays and stalling tactics through this rulemaking process.   For several years, the previous administration's rulemaking process  was blocked through appropriations riders. Year after year, I fought  those riders.   Finally, Congress reacted to the public backlash over the riders and  backed off efforts to block the rule. This enabled the last  administration to move forward and to comply with the 2008 farm bill  requirements. However, the rulemaking was not complete. With the  turnover in administrations, Secretary Perdue quickly stopped all work  on these rules and demoted the agency in charge of the effort.   It seems a positive step that the Secretary decided to advance new  rules to clarify criteria used to enforce the undue and unreasonable  preference or advantage authorities. However, given the  administration's previous actions, I am quite concerned that this  rulemaking will fall far short of addressing the worst abuses that  America's livestock and poultry farmers experience.   There are gross examples of abusive contracting practices,  particularly in the poultry sector. Companies greatly disadvantage  certain growers at the expense of others. The thumb of justice surely  seems obsolete. Protection against retaliation, pay transparency, and a  right to a fair and just legal system are essential to protect our  hardworking farmers from abuse.   Each of these concerns must be addressed in the rulemaking process.  The alarming realities of the poultry industry and similar ones in the  hog and beef industries highlight the imbalance within today's  corporate meat production hierarchy. This must be addressed through  USDA's planned Packers and Stockyards Act rulemaking process.   I hope the administration will better protect small farmers who work  very hard every day to help feed our Nation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Pollinator Week. I am honored to be the Representative of three cities  each named a Monarch City U.S.A.: Oak Harbor, Port Clinton, and  Sandusky, Ohio. They are bestowed this title for their citizenries'  efforts to support the monarch butterfly, a noble and substantial  pollinator, by planting milkweed and nectar plants.   With beekeepers having lost 40 percent of their bee colonies last  year, it is imperative that Congress follow my constituents' lead to  protect and support pollinator populations. The 2018 farm bill and the  fiscal year 2020 Agriculture appropriations bill prioritized a  commitment to the welfare of pollinators for the sake of human life.  The farm bill authorized the Honey Bee and Pollinator Research  Coordinator, and the Appropriations Committee funded the position to  strengthen our research and protect pollinators from extinction.   In the spirit of National Pollinator Week and as an honored cosponsor  of the Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2019, please join me in  celebrating the beauty and utility and essential presence in our  environment of one of nature's finest constructs: pollinators.                            ____________________
