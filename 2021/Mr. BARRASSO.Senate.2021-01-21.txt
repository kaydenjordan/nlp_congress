 Madam President, on Tuesday, January 12, 2021, the 2021  General Session of the Wyoming Legislature got underway. Noticeably  absent from the first day of the session was State Senator Henry H.R.  ``Hank'' Coe. Hank had been present in Cheyenne for the first day of  the annual legislative session for 32 consecutive years.   In March of 2020, on the last day of the 2020 Wyoming legislative  session, Hank announced his plan to retire. Senator Coe represented the  people of Park County from 1988 to 2020.   Hank was a respected and effective legislator. He earned a reputation  for being a kind, thoughtful, persuasive legislator of great integrity.   Hank always had a remarkable grasp of the issues facing the state and  his home community. He could see short and long-term needs and offer  solutions to address those needs.   During his time in the legislature, Senator Coe served on numerous  committees, was elected as majority floor leader, and, in 2001, served  as president of the senate.   For 17 years, Hank proudly served as the chair of the senate  education committee. He was a strong proponent of local control and  high-quality education.   Hank showed students that through hard work and dedication to their  studies, there was a world of opportunities within their reach. He  understood the importance of investing in our young people, recognizing  their achievements, and providing them with the tools needed to  succeed.   When I served in the Wyoming State Senate, I had the great honor of  working with Hank Coe on one of our proudest legislative initiatives,  the creation of the Hathaway scholarship program.   We were able to create a scholarship fund with a $400 million  permanent endowment. Income from the fund continues to fund  scholarships for Wyoming high school graduates today. The Hathaway  scholarship program allows every Wyoming student, regardless of  economic background, to qualify for a merit-based scholarship to attend  the University of Wyoming or any of our State's seven community  colleges.   Senator Coe's leadership was a driving force behind passage of this  legislation. Thousands of Wyoming students without the resources to  obtain a college education have benefited from this scholarship.   Hank's contribution to public service extended far beyond Wyoming's  capitol. He was a mentor to many in his hometown of Cody. He  participated fully on local boards and committees. The Cody Chamber of  Commerce, Cody Medical Foundation, Cody Yellowstone Air Service,  Wyoming Air Service, Buffalo Bill Museum of the West, and the Park  County Commissioners all benefited from Hank's committed service.   When Hank retired, he released the following statement, which was  printed in the Cody Enterprise on March 13, 2020:         ``The Wyoming Legislature continues to be one of the most       effective and civil deliberate bodies in the nation. It is my       sincere hope that this tradition will continue and Wyoming       can be an example to the rest of the nation,'' said Coe.       ``Serving in the Senate has been a true honor and a       privilege. I'm eternally grateful to the people of Park       County who put their faith in me to represent them for so       many years. To my community, friends, family, fellow       lawmakers and the exceptional legislative staff, I say thank       you.''   [[Page S90]]     Hank had a calling to serve. He took that calling and ran with it.  His life's work has made a difference in the lives of the people in  Park County and in every corner of our great State. History will look  kindly upon the contributions and achievements of Hank Coe.   Hank passed away today, January 21, 2021. He leaves behind a  remarkable legacy, and he will be greatly missed by a grateful State.  To Hank's entire family, especially his children and grandchildren: son  H.R. and grandson Henry, daughter Carey Coe Johnson and husband Jeff  and grandchildren Madeline, Jagger, and Jrakke, and daughter Bethany  Coe Boydstun and grandchildren, Jackson, Tyler and Lily--our prayers  and well wishes are with you.   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the remarkable life of  Hank Coe. His dedication to service will have a profound impact on our  state for generations. Thank you Hank.
