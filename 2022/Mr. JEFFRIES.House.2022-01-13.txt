 Mr. Speaker, we are here today defending our democracy  for one reason and one reason alone. It is because the radical right  has decided that the only way they can consistently win elections is to  engage in massive voter suppression. The right to vote is sacred. The  right to vote is special. The right to vote is sacrosanct and central  to the integrity of our democracy.   There are people who died, lost their lives, and shed blood to make  sure that Black people and everyone in America could vote.   We are not going backward. We are only going to go forward. You had  better back up off of us.   We will pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We will  pass Joe Manchin's Freedom to Vote Act. We will get it to Joe Biden's  desk, and we will end the era of voter suppression in America once and  for all.                                time  0930
