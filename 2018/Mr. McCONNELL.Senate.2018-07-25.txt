 Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about the bipartisan  cooperation that has made it possible for us to return to a regular  appropriations process. Collaboration got the four measures we are now  considering through the subcommittee and full committee process, thanks  to the efforts of Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and the subcommittee  leaders, Senators Murkowski, Collins, Hoeven, and Lankford.   On the floor, bipartisanship let us turn to legislation by consent  and kick off the amendment process with several votes yesterday. If we  can keep it up, we will soon take four more big steps toward our goal  of funding the Federal Government the right way and avoiding another  omnibus.   Yesterday, I mentioned that the legislation before us addresses two  pressing national needs: rebuilding America's infrastructure and  bolstering the fight against opioids. But that is far from the whole  story. These measures cover about one-eighth of the total discretionary  spending for next year. They fund a long list of key services that  Americans depend on every day--everything from food safety inspections  to child nutrition programs, to the Forest Service and national parks.  Communities in all 50 States are connected to this legislation.   Here are a few of the provisions that will be particular cause for  celebration in my home State of Kentucky: $37 billion toward rural  development, including support for rural businesses, and loans and  grants to improve rural infrastructure for electricity, telephone, and  broadband internet in communities in Kentucky and all across the  country; another $1 billion in grants to help communities invest in  highways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects, with a guarantee  that 30 percent of this funding would go into rural areas; more funding  for the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program, which helps communities  reclaim abandoned coal mines and put that land to better use; more  funding and a sharper Federal focus on controlling the evasive Asian  carp that threaten local prosperity and water safety in Kentucky Lake  and Lake Barkley in Western Kentucky; and more help for the Kentuckians  who battle the scourge of opioids every day.   The legislation funds the FDA's efforts to intercept illegal drugs,  the DEA's program for high-intensity trafficking areas, and increased  training for first responders.   It also contains a provision I secured directing the Department of  Housing and Urban Development to encourage more access to transitional  housing opportunities for individuals recovering from substance abuse  disorder.   I could go on. The ways the bill before us would assist families and  communities across Kentucky are practically countless, and the same is  true for every State in our country.   That is why every Member understands the importance of  appropriations. Funding the Federal Government--matching resources with  urgent challenges--is one of Congress's most important  responsibilities. I am proud of the appropriations process that is  underway, and I am especially proud of all of the ways the resulting  legislation will deliver for the American people.

Yesterday, I described how my Democratic friends spent the  Obama years talking about the importance of rebuilding American  manufacturing. They talked about it, but it is the actions of this  united Republican government that have made it easier for manufacturers  to expand and hire.   It is on our watch that optimism among U.S. manufacturers has hit the  highest level that one survey has ever recorded. Well, it turns out  that there are quite a few areas where this Republican government is  helping to deliver victories that our Democratic friends spent 8 years  talking about.   In his 2010 State of the Union Address, President Obama proclaimed  that job growth would be the No. 1 focus of the coming year. He said  that ``the true engine of job creation in this country will always be  America's businesses'' and that government's role was to ``create the  conditions necessary for businesses to expand and to hire more  workers.''   Recognizing American job creators as the true engines of prosperity  and giving them room to succeed sounds good to me. It sounded good to  almost everyone, in fact.   But once again, the policies didn't match the rhetoric. Instead, the  Obama administration twice set all-time records for the number of pages  in the Federal Register, and those pages had consequences. By  constantly moving the regulatory goalposts, government eroded the  certainty businesses need to invest and to hire.   Washington, DC, restricted farmers' and ranchers' control over water  on their own property. Bureaucrats overwhelmed small banks and credit  unions with a rule book designed for Wall Street, and an outdated  Federal Tax Code held back job creation and made America much less  competitive.   On Democrats' watch, Americans had to wait out an economic  ``recovery'' that was insufficient, slow, and left whole parts of the  country way behind.   Remember the rhetoric and then remember the facts. Republicans have  always agreed that job creation must be a top priority, but we have a  better idea about how to actually help make it happen. The Republican  Congress has used the Congressional Review Act to slash 17 burdensome  regulations. That is on top of the administration's own Executive  actions. We have passed, and the President has signed, major changes to  Obamacare and to Dodd-Frank, and we passed generational tax reform that  puts more hard-earned money in the pockets of working families and  gives job creators more flexibility.   So what is happening on our watch? Just a few days ago, the number of  Americans newly filing for unemployment benefits hit the lowest level  in more than 48 years. Let me say that again. Newly filing for  unemployment benefits hit its lowest level in more than 48 years. Here  is how CNN characterized the Labor Department's most recent jobs  report:         The U.S. economy keeps adding jobs at a blistering pace. .       . . The job market is so good, many people who had previously       given up looking are starting to look again.    According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans saying now is a good  time to find a quality job hit its highest level in 17 years. That is  not just rhetoric but actual results, due to the hard work of American  workers and job creators, with an assist from this Republican  government.   Unfortunately, this pro-growth agenda hasn't gotten much support from  across the aisle. Not a single Democrat--not one--voted for the tax  reform that helped to turn rhetoric about jobs into actual jobs.   There was hardly any Democratic support for the regulatory  housecleaning that has given job creators more confidence to stay on  American soil, grow their businesses, and add jobs.   So all of us agree with the rhetoric, but not everyone supported the  policy agenda that has helped to deliver these results for the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
