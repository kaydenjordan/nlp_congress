 Today, I introduce the Citizens Count Census Act of 2019,  a bill that would require a citizenship question on the United States  Census.   If we defeat the previous question, as the gentleman from Georgia  said, then we will be able to consider my bill.   It has always been common sense to include a citizenship question on  our Nation's Census. The purpose of the Census Bureau and all Census  surveys is to include data used for apportionment and to better inform  the public about the population, business, and economics of the United  States of America.   The collection of citizenship information during a population census  is a common practice among countries. This is not new, and it should  not be controversial. A citizenship question is asked on the census in  Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, and the United  Kingdom, to name a few. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the United Nations  recommends that countries gather citizenship information about their  populations.   Knowing how many legal and nonlegal individuals are within our  borders is a perfectly appropriate question to ask on our Census, and I  hope we can pass this measure to see that happen.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my congressional colleagues to  vote for this commonsense legislation to ensure we know exactly how  many citizens reside in this country.
