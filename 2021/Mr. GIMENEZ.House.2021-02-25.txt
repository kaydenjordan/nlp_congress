Knight Foundation.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      In what will become a national model for public-private collaboration  to meet industry needs and further fuel the current momentum for  technology and entrepreneurship in South Florida, the Knight Foundation  has made a $10 million gift and FIU a 10-year commitment of $106  million to catalyze the development of the local tech ecosystem.   Today, FIU is Miami-Dade's top 50 public research university and is a  top producer of minority graduates in STEM fields. This partnership  will strengthen FIU's standing, allowing for the doubling of computer  science graduates, researchers and making FIU a hub for research in  artificial intelligence, smart robotics, bioinformatics, biodevices,  and digital forensics.   I am proud of the work we did at the county level when I was the  mayor of Miami-Dade County to make Miami and our South Florida  communities a world-class destination for tech entrepreneurs. The  resources and support for accelerators, incubators, our colleges and  universities, and all the places that serve as creation centers for  innovation through the use of technology has positioned South Florida  as a leader in the economy of the future.   I look forward to everything this partnership between FIU and the  Knight Foundation will do for our South Florida communities.                            ____________________
