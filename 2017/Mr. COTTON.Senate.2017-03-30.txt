 Mr. President, when his nomination comes to the floor  next week, I will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  This is my first time voting on a Supreme Court nominee, and I don't  take the decision lightly. It is a lifetime appointment, after all, and  the Court's rulings have shaped our country's history--for good and for  ill--and will continue to shape our future. But after reading Judge  Gorsuch's writings, meeting with him in person, and listening to his  testimony, I can say with confidence that it is not a hard call. I  believe Judge Gorsuch will be a fine addition to the Supreme Court.   There is no denying Judge Gorsuch's distinctive qualifications. We  all know his credentials: Columbia, Harvard law, and an Oxford  doctorate to boot. He clerked for an appellate judge and two Supreme  Court Justices. He had many years of experience in both private  practice and in public service and, of course, over 10 years as an  appellate judge. He possesses fine judicial temperament: highly  erudite, highly accomplished, and highly regarded by those who know him  best. It is no surprise, then, that the American Bar Association, in a  unanimous vote, declared him ``well qualified'' for the job.   While I wouldn't outsource our responsibilities to any advocacy  organization, I would note that the minority leader himself once said  the ABA rating is ``the gold standard by which judicial candidates are  judged.''   But, of course, Judge Gorsuch is not just filling any seat, but the  seat once held by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a  giant of American jurisprudence. Most Justices earn their place in  history by writing opinions, giving voice to their colleagues, and  speaking for the Court as a whole. Justice Scalia did that many times  throughout his career, of course, but he did something more. He changed  the way judges--both conservative and liberal--think about the law and  defend their decisions. He reminded us all that a judge's job is to  apply the law--including the Constitution, our most fundamental law--as  written, to the case before him, not to rewrite it all together.   Adhering to the law, even when the judge doesn't like the result, is  the greatest public service that a judge can render, because to respect  the rule of law is ultimately to respect the rule of the people.   This is what Justice Scalia taught and what he inspired a whole  generation of judges and lawyers to understand. As we prepare to fill  his seat on the Supreme Court, let us also acknowledge that no man can  fill his shoes. We honor the memory of Justice Scalia and we thank his  wife, Maureen, and his whole family for sharing this great man with our  country for so long.   Judge Gorsuch is a child of the Scalia generation. He has long  advocated for and followed the originalist judicial craft--one rooted  in the text, structure, and history of our Constitution, which is to  say that he respects the rule of law and he respects the people.  Whether defending the religious liberty of the Little Sisters of the  Poor or the Fourth Amendment rights of a regular household, he has  shown a profound respect for the Constitution. I also think he has  demonstrated throughout his career a firm independence of thought. He  has had his influences and his mentors, his promoters and his critics,  but I believe he will be his own man--as he should be.   So I am pleased to announce my support for the next Associate Justice  of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. I look forward to his  confirmation next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
