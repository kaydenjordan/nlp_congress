 Mr. Chair, since the gentlewoman, my friend from Tennessee,  remarked upon economic growth, let me, as one who was here at the time,  perhaps correct the Record.    Bill Clinton's economic growth was higher than Ron Reagan's, and that  is not in dispute. Barack Obama's economic growth was higher than  George W. Bush's. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month at the end of the  Bush administration, to bring up one point, which, by the way, is  closer to 2.1 percent.   People here know I follow these issues like a hawk, but the truth is  that this budget today that is being put forward is a threat to  Medicare and Social Security down the road.   The previous speaker said he is concerned about mandatory spending. I  gotcha. Put out a plan. Put out a plan on Social Security and Medicare.  And don't do it in the backdoor way here as they complain about  deficits and they prepare to embrace a tax cut of $1.5 trillion or,  over 10 years, $2.2 trillion on top of the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and  2003 which amounted to $2.3 trillion. So we are at $5 trillion worth of  tax cuts, and the Clinton administration left us with four balanced  budgets and $5 trillion worth of surplus.   This is not a budget that supports meaningful tax reform. I am ready,  and she knows because of our working together in the past, prepared to  work with Republicans on fundamental tax reform. The system is begging  for it.   Don't call tax reform tax reform when it is really a tax cut. And  that is where this is headed, and I think they know that as well.   This is a partisan roadmap that has failed in the past. They are  using reconciliation instruction so that the majority can ram through a  tax plan here. That is all it is about.   Last night, by the way, the tradeoff is in some States you can keep  the mortgage interest deduction if you are willing to give up the State  and local tax deduction.   I want to tell you something, I guarantee you right now, based on  long history, we will end up keeping both, and they will have to add  more to the debt as time goes on.   Is this a cut for the wealthy? Eighty percent of the tax cut goes to  the top 1 percent in 2027.                                time  1445    This is from the Tax Policy Center in Washington. Incidentally, how  great is it to have a nonpartisan scoring committee offer us a snapshot  of the future?   The average tax cut for millionaires, $230,000 a year in 2027. The  average tax  [[Page H7782]]  cut for the top one-tenth of 1 percent is $1 million in the year 2027.   The people in this country who need tax relief are the middle class.  We should be investing in human capital, community colleges; we should  be investing in vocational education.   So 45 percent of all households with children will see a tax increase  in 2027. Among households earning between $50,000 and $150,000, you are  going to see a one-third tax increase in 2027.   I look at this and say: Why are we not offering some relief to middle  class Americans? Why are we not investing in them? Do we not have  enough faith in them to help them get through what have been difficult  times with children in college and costs mounting all of the time?   Instead, it is back to tax relief for people at the very top. I guess  concentrated wealth in America now is not a big issue. I guess the top  1 percent in America who, by the way, aren't even asking for tax  relief--that is the irony of this. They are not asking for tax relief.  They are arguing for more investment in America rather than  concentrating more money in fewer hands.   The American people deserve a Tax Code that is based on fairness. Our  code should reward hardworking, middle class families, small business,  innovation, and ensure that no one, no matter how wealthy they are, can  avoid paying their fair share.   Our focus is going to be on helping the middle class, creating jobs,  boosting wages, and giving people the assistance they need in a  complicated economy with their grocery bills and childcare as well.  Invest in human capital today.
