Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4054, the U.S. Grain Standards  Reauthorization Act of 2020.   I want to thank Ranking Member Conaway, General Farm Commodities and  Risk Management Subcommittee Chairman Vela, and Ranking Member Thompson  for their bipartisan support for passage of S. 4054, the United States  Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2020.   The inspections provided by the Federal Grain Inspection Service  define and classify grains, as well as assign grades to specify weight  and quality requirements, and these inspections provide a gold-standard  assurance backed by the Federal Government to both grain buyers and  sellers.   American grain farmers participate in a very competitive world, and  foreign grain buyers should be confident in this process that we have  put forward and have in place to ensure our exports are adequately  inspected.   As we move ahead with reauthorization, I hope that we can take stock  in how well the current system of export inspections by the Federal and  State agencies is working, and continue to work on a bipartisan basis,  and to provide necessary certainty and stability for producers and our  Federal grain inspection system.   I would also like to note the need for a dedicated and strong  workforce at our ports to ensure that American grain can be expertly  and efficiently loaded into ships for export. I would encourage those  companies that have not already reached an agreement with their  workforce to continue to seek an agreement. I applaud the American- owned companies that have already committed to their workers.   So I encourage my colleagues to support the U.S. Grain Standards  Reauthorization Act of 2020. American grain farmers participate in a  fiercely competitive world market, and we need to ensure that our  inspection system allows importers to maintain their confidence in the  quality of U.S. grain.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), and I want to congratulate him on his  outstanding support from the steering committee to be the next chairman  of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), one of our new and rising upcoming members of  the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for his willingness to  work with us over these last number of years.   With this bill, we got just about all of our work done. We have the  CFTC reauthorization we didn't get done, but everything else is off the  plate. So that is good.   We made good progress. We will, both of us, ride off into the sunset,  I think, feeling that we have done a decent job.   So, again, I thank Mr. Conaway and all members of the committee for  the work that they do and wish them well in the next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to unanimously support S. 4054, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
