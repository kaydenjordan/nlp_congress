 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two young  Montanans who are among the best in rodeo.   In this month's National High School Finals Rodeo in Wyoming, Montana  was well represented with competitors from across the State. The  National High School Finals Rodeo drew about 1,500 finalists from 43  States, Mexico, Canada, and Australia.   Two Montanans won buckles for placing in the top 10 in their event.  Shai McDonald of Gardiner took second in barrel racing, and Brice  Patterson of Bozeman took fourth in bareback riding.   Rodeo is a time-honored tradition in Montana, and it is part of our  way of life.   The outstanding work ethic and dedication of these young athletes  allows them to compete and succeed at this high level.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Shai and Brice on their accomplishments  at the National High School Finals Rodeo.                            ____________________
