 Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 569.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Principal Jill  Stafford for being named the Principal of the Year for Region 10 by the  Texas Association of Secondary School Principals.   Having dedicated 27 years of her professional career to her students,  Ms. Stafford has displayed her passion for education and commitment to  her community. For the last 7 years Ms. Stafford has served as the  principal of Lowery Freshman Center in Allen, Texas.   Ms. Stafford goes above and beyond each and every day for both her  students and her colleagues. As students face the daunting transition  into high school, it is critical that they have the unmatched support  of strong leaders like Principal Stafford to keep them motivated and on  track. I ask my colleagues and the House of Representatives to join me  in thanking Principal Jill Stafford for her hard work and congratulate  her on this well-earned recognition.                            ____________________
