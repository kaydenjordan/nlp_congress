 Mr. Speaker, duty, honor, country--these three hallowed  words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, and  what you will be. These words were Douglas MacArthur's in a speech to  West Point's Corps of Cadets in 1962.   Memorizing it will be one of the many challenges faced by a young man  from my district, Chayne Dessaso of Leavenworth, Kansas. You see,  Chayne has recently been appointed to be a cadet of the United States  Military Academy at West Point, my alma mater.   West Point will teach Chayne rifle marksmanship, military tactics,  math, chemistry, a foreign language, boxing, engineering, swimming,  gymnastics, orienteering, history, poetry, first aid, and philosophy.  He will also learn about camaraderie, sacrifice, leadership, and the  human spirit. And the world will be a better place for it.   Well done, Chayne. Welcome to The Long Gray Line.                            ____________________
