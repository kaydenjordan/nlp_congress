 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, September 30, 2023,  the House of Representatives was considering a continuing resolution to  avoid a government shutdown. Minutes after the Democratic whip made a  motion to adjourn, Jamaal Bowman decided to pull a fire alarm. He  pulled that fire alarm intentionally and willfully, and he knew exactly  what he was doing.   This happened in the Cannon House Office Building, where my office is  located. I happened to have been in my office when he pulled the fire  alarm. This caused the Cannon House Office Building to be evacuated,  and my staff and I could not return to our office for several hours.   Once the fire alarm was pulled, the elevators shut down. It made it  very difficult for everyone to leave the building, especially if they  were handicapped. People had to go down the stairs in order to exit as  the fire alarm was blaring. Not only that, all the staff had to leave.  They were not allowed to reenter for a very long time.   Capitol Police were scrambling, trying to figure out what had  happened, if there was a fire, and if there was a threat to our safety  and security. They had to go into an investigation immediately in order  to understand why the fire alarm was going.   Jamaal Bowman did not tell the Capitol Police that he pulled the fire  alarm even though he admitted himself that, when he makes a mistake, he  would tell his own students: If you have made a mistake, own up to it  and take accountability.   Jamaal Bowman had plenty of opportunity to admit his mistake and take  accountability for his own actions. He should have told Capitol Police  immediately that he made a mistake, as he claimed.   It wasn't a mistake, Mr. Speaker. It was on purpose. It was  intentional. It was all in part to play the games and the shenanigans  that the Democrats were pulling that day as they were trying to block  the continuing resolution that was being considered on the House floor.    Remember, Mr. Speaker, the fire alarm was pulled minutes after the  Democratic whip made a motion to adjourn.   More importantly, he was intentionally playing his part to obstruct  an official proceeding.   By the way, this is the same thing that has been used against January  6 defendants and is still being used to this day. They are being locked  up, held in pretrial detention, and being prosecuted by the Department  of Justice nearly 3 years later for obstructing an official proceeding,  which is exactly what Jamaal Bowman, a Member of Congress, did on  September 30.   We have a two-tiered justice system in Washington, D.C. Regular  people walked into the Capitol. By the way, many nonviolent offenders  walked in open doors. Some of them who also were standing out on the  lawn and never entered the Capitol are being charged for obstructing an  official proceeding.   Yet, Jamaal Bowman says that it was a mistake and that he should get  a pass. His colleagues make excuses for him and call us unserious.   Do you know what is unserious, Mr. Speaker? Having a justice system  that doesn't hold everyone accountable and doesn't treat people the  same way.   This is an outrage, and this is a disgrace to this institution and  this body.   For someone who is a former principal and who punished his own  students for intentionally pulling fire alarms to make up petty excuses  and think that his own constituents and the American people will buy  his lie is a slap in the face to his voters, the people whom he  represents, this entire country, and every single one of us who serves  in this body.                                time  1830    I would also add that if anyone is going to be charged and forced to  remain in jail, forced to be serving prison time for obstructing an  official proceeding, then Jamaal Bowman should face the exact same fate  of every single January 6 defendant.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this censure  resolution, and I thank Representative McClain for introducing it.
