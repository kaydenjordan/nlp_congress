 Madam President, like all of my colleagues, I spent  last week traveling my home State. I spoke with Kentuckians about where  we have come over the past 15 months, where we are today, and the  bright future we should have ahead.   More than 1.8 million Kentuckians have received COVID vaccines. These  medical miracles were created in record time by genius scientists plus  Operation Warp Speed. And they are proving the pathway back to normalcy  that we had hoped for.   I was happy to get to visit the Baptist Health Hardin Memorial  Hospital in Elizabethtown to hear about their vaccination program and  to thank the staff for all of their work.   We should be on track for a fantastic American comeback summer, full  steam ahead. From vaccinations to job growth, the new Biden  administration inherited favorable trends in every direction, thanks to  the five bipartisan rescue packages that Congress passed just last  year.   But in several important ways, the decisions of elected Democrats  have contributed to slowing the return to normalcy. We have seen some  State and local officials bow to Big Labor and soft-pedal the clear  science on school reopenings. And the big bill that Washington  Democrats pushed through a couple of months ago did not require schools  to reopen in order to receive even more extra funding.   The President and his team keep sending mixed messages about  gatherings and wearing masks that sometimes break from their own CDC's  guidance for vaccinated Americans. Again, there almost seems to be some  reluctance to let go of emergency measures, even to the point of  clashing with science.   And what about our economic recovery? Back in March, Democrats rammed  through their so-called American Rescue Plan with a $2 trillion  partisan spending spree. It is packed with policies that seem designed  for March 2020, not March 2021; for example: continuing to use taxpayer  dollars to pay a special bonus for unemployed people to stay home  rather than filling one of the growing number of job openings around  the country.   Republicans had this crazy idea that with vaccines flooding the  country, with COVID-19 in retreat, it was time  [[Page S2398]]  to actually reopen our country instead of spending even more of working  families' tax dollars to keep things shut down.   Well, a few days ago, experts were stunned by a monthly jobs report  for April that came in way below expectations. It was the first full  month of data collected after the Democrats passed their so-called  rescue plan. This bill they sold as a fast-acting, urgent, emergency  measure that was going to bolster our economy right away. This report  was expected to show that more than a million American workers had  gotten jobs back in the month of April. Instead, we added about one- fourth that many jobs.   Now, I had just spent the prior week talking with Kentuckians. I  spoke with workers and employers at nearly every size of business from  just about every kind of industry, all across the spectrum. And from  big national companies to local chambers of commerce, to businesses  like Manchester Tank in Campbellsville, we heard optimism but also real  concerns--concerns about inflation and runaway costs, concerns about  backed-up supply chains.   And as Washington pays workers a bonus to stay unemployed, virtually  everyone discussed very real concerns about their difficulties in  finding workers who are willing to come back and fill these open  positions. Almost every employer I spoke with specifically mentioned  the extra generous jobless benefits as a key force holding back our  recovery.   Now, I have heard some Democrats say that whatever incentives  Washington creates, the responsibility really falls on workers. But my  friends on the other side can't use the American people to shield their  own bad ideas from scrutiny. Policy matters. Incentives matter.   It is May of 2021. Vaccines are available nationwide. There are  millions of jobs open, ``Help Wanted'' signs from coast to coast. We  should not still be taxing the Americans who are working to fund  continued extra benefits for those staying home.   It is not March of 2020 anymore. It is May of 2021. Kentuckians and  all Americans need our Democratic friends to govern accordingly.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, yesterday marked  the beginning of National Police Week. Under normal circumstance, we  would be welcoming police officers across the country here to  Washington to share experiences and commemorate brothers and sisters  who have fallen in the line of duty.   This year, I understand many of the in-person gatherings have been  postponed until this autumn. But we are still remembering our law  enforcement officers as we prepare for Police Officers Memorial Day on  May 15.   The past year has seen the difficult job of law enforcement become  even harder. They have battled the challenges of the historic pandemic.  In many places, they have grappled with increased violent crime rates  and unrest. And following terrible incidents this past year, the  majority of brave and honorable law enforcement officers have too often  found themselves painted unfairly with a broad brush, as though their  entire profession should be defined by the worst examples.   This year's remembrances will be especially somber here at the  Capitol, where we are still mourning Officers Billy Evans, Howie  Liebengood, and Brian Sicknick, whom we have lost in a matter of  months.   I hope police officers throughout our country, from the Capitol to  Kentucky and all 50 States, know how very grateful we are for their  courage and for their service.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Bluegrass State is home to many  heroes. For centuries, brave Kentuckians have proudly worn the uniform  to defend our country and our way of life. Earlier this month, we said  goodbye to one of these remarkable individuals. Ernie West, of Greenup  County, was recognized in 1954 for his courage in the Korean war with  our country's top military recognition, the Medal of Honor. He inspired  those who knew him and became an example of our Commonwealth's highest  ideals. Today, I would like to join Ernie's admirers in paying tribute  to his incredible life and offering condolences to his family.   For Ernie, who came from humble beginnings in a children's home,  putting his fellow soldiers' safety before his own was practically  second nature. During a patrol, his squad was ambushed by North Korean  fighters. Ernie sprang into action, braving enemy grenades and intense  fire to carry three wounded comrades to safety. As he did, the young  private suffered serious wounds, including taking shrapnel that  eventually cost him his eye.   After the war, President Dwight D. Eisenhower presented Ernie with  the Medal of Honor in recognition of his valor and selfless sacrifice.  Ernie never considered himself a hero and almost refused to accept the  medal. He believed everyone who served with him was deserving of the  same honor. In the years that followed, Ernie became a proud example of  service to a cause larger than oneself. Kentucky was grateful to have  this hero among us for so many years, and we will all miss him.   Mr. President, the Daily Independent in nearby Ashland paid tribute  to Ernie West and his heroism. I ask unanimous consent the article be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From Daily Independent, May 2, 2021]                      A Hero's Legacy: West Dies at 89                            (By Charles Romans)         A young boy came home one day to find his father talking to       a man he did not know. His father's companion was rather       ordinary, the young boy remembered, and appeared to be just       like any of his neighbors he saw on a daily basis. But the       father spoke up and said, ``Do you know this man? He's a war       hero.'' Those words changed the young boy's opinion of the       man, and he became fascinated with learning the man's story.       But the man just smiled and quickly changed the subject,       asking the young boy instead where he liked to fish.        The young boy was Tom Clay, of Greenup, and the man his       father (well-known writer and community activist Soc Clay)       introduced him to was Ernest ``Ernie'' West. Clay remembers       West as being a plainspeaking and easygoing man, and not at       all what one might expect from a war hero. Clay said you'd       expect a war hero to be larger than life, big and bold, but       West wasn't any of those things.        ``He was just a normal guy,'' Clay said. ``One of the       neighbors who really liked to fish.'' But even though West       was hesitant to speak of it, Clay would later learn that West       was not only a hero, but also a hero to whom other heroes       looked as the very definition of the word. West died on       Saturday at age 89.        The man who talked so readily about fishing at the Clay       home was a Greenup County native himself. He was born on       Sept. 2, 1931 in Russell and raised in an orphanage at the       Methodist Children's Home in Versailles.  [[Page S2410]]       West lived in Wurtland and worked on what is now CSX       Railroad. He was drafted in 1950, and in October 1952 he was       serving as private first class with Company L, 14th Infantry       Regiment, 25th Infantry Division in Korea. During a patrol,       West's unit was ambushed and took heavy casualties.        Unit commander Captain George Gividen was seriously       wounded, and West ordered those not wounded to retreat from       the enemy's larger force. West himself, however, didn't       retreat, but instead repeatedly faced a hailstorm of enemy       fire and grenades to rescue the wounded members of his unit       and carry them to safety. And in numerous cases, West faced       not only area fire but personal attacks as well while       rescuing his comrades. At one point, West was carrying his       commander, while returning fire with both his own and his       commander's weapon. And though he said he wasn't aware of       when it happened, West became one of the walking wounded       himself, sustaining wounds that would cost him an eye. But,       in typical fashion, when people referred to him as a hero,       West simply responded, ``They were all my brothers. Any of us       would have done it because you don't leave your brothers       behind.''        For his actions on that day, West received numerous medals,       chiefly the Medal of Honor, which was presented by President       Dwight D. Eisenhower. Again, true to form, West said, ``I       turned it down at first. I thought everybody deserved a       medal.'' But he did accept the medal on Jan. 29, 1954, though       he was still reluctant to speak much of his time at war. And       it was obvious that West desired first and foremost to return       home and continue with his life. Fortunately for West, he was       able to do just that, by marrying and starting a family, and       even returned to his job at the railroad.        ``He was one great man,'' said AMV Commander Lori Grizzle,       a friend who worked with West at the railroad. ``Our post is       named after him, and there are memorials to him at the       post.''        But as much as West the hero, Grizzle says she misses her       friend.        ``He was just such a nice person,'' she said. ``He was       funny and nice to be around. And he was always pleasant to       everyone.''        Grizzle said West didn't really want to talk about himself,       and while she and her husband worked with him on the       railroad, he was very humble and didn't talk about his       service.        ``But his wife persuaded him to talk to schools because she       thought that kids needed to know. And he was always great       about speaking to the kids about what it takes sometimes to       keep our country safe. It was the last thing he wanted to       talk about,'' Grizzle said. ``But she convinced him, and he       never hesitated then to speak to the kids. He will be dearly       missed.''        West also was immortalized in a painting that now hangs in       the Greenup County Courthouse. A committee comprised of Soc       Clay, Tom Crump and Emily Cantrell Stephenson commissioned a       painting from Greenup High School art teacher Brian Moser,       and then sold prints of the painting signed by West, with the       proceeds going toward a scholarship for seniors at Greenup       County, Raceland, and Russell. The scholarship will continue,       and Clay said that it has quite a large impact on the       students.        The official citation of West's Medal of Honor reads:        ``Pfc. West distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry       above and beyond the call of duty in action against the       enemy. He voluntarily accompanied a contingent to locate and       destroy a reported enemy outpost. Nearing the objective, the       patrol was ambushed and suffered numerous casualties.       Observing his wounded leader lying in an exposed position,       Pfc. West ordered the troops to withdraw, then braved intense       fire to reach and assist him.        While attempting evacuation, he was attacked by three       hostile soldiers employing grenades and smallarms fire.       Quickly shifting his body to shelter the officer, he killed       the assailants with his rifle, then carried the helpless man       to safety. He was critically wounded and lost an eye in this       action, but courageously returned through withering fire and       bursting shells to assist the wounded. While evacuating two       comrades, he closed with and killed three more of the foe.       Pfc. West's indomitable spirit, consummate valor, and       intrepid actions inspired all who observed him, reflect the       highest credit on himself, and uphold the honored traditions       of the military service.''        Ernest ``Ernie'' Edison West is a shining example of how a       common man can rise to the occasion and do uncommon things.       His life both on active military duty and as a retired       veteran is a testament of dedication to the community and       country he loved. West passed from this life Sat., May 1,       2021, at the age of 89. But he will live on in the memory of       a grateful community and thankful country.                            ____________________
