 Madam Speaker, today, the national average for a gallon  of gas is a little over $4--$4.06 to be exact. Meanwhile, in my home  State of California, the average gas price per gallon all across our  State is $5.34. For the first time ever, the average gas price per  gallon is over $5 in every single California county.   Now, I know California brings a lot of pain upon itself, self- inflicted, but I  [[Page H1317]]  have seen a lot of the mainstream media try to claim that these price  increases are due to Russia's attack on Ukraine, not the Biden  administration's anti-energy agenda. If that were true, how has the gas  price per gallon increased by $1.60 over the last year, not just the  last two weeks of the Ukraine conflict.   Since taking office, the Biden administration has frozen all new oil  and gas projects on Federal lands and implemented extreme financial  barriers on domestic oil and gas production. On day one, of course, we  all know he killed the Keystone pipeline, which could be supplying  830,000 barrels of oil from Canada to U.S. refineries, more than what  Russia imports to us.   In his first week, we had an executive order stopping new leases on  Federal lands, so we need to replace Russian energy with our own  production.                            ____________________
