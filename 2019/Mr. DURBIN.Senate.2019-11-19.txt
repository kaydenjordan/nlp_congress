 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on September 11, President Donald Trump  held a press conference with the First Lady in the Oval Office. He  announced that his administration would finally be taking bold action  to combat our Nation's youth vaping epidemic. The epidemic is what the  Food and Drug Administration characterized as the vaping that is going  on in schools across America today--not just high schools, where 27  percent of the students are currently vaping, but middle schools and  grade schools as well.   Seated next to the President on September 11 in the Oval Office was  the First Lady. On the other side was the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Directly across from the  President was then-Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug  Administration, Dr. Ned Sharpless.   At the press conference, President Trump stated:         We have a problem in this country . . . and it is called       ``vaping''--especially vaping as it pertains to innocent       children. . . . And we're going to have to do something about       it.    Then Secretary Azar said:         An entire generation of children risk becoming addicted to       nicotine. . . . So with the President's support, the Food and       Drug Administration intends to finalize a guidance document       that would . . . require that all flavors other than tobacco       flavor would be removed from the market.        This would include mint and menthol flavoring, as well as       candy flavors, bubblegum flavor, fruit flavor, and alcohol       flavor.    Explaining why this action was necessary, the Acting FDA  Commissioner, Dr. Sharpless, said:         Flavored e-cigarette products drive childhood use.    Secretary Azar and Acting Commissioner Sharpless committed to  finalizing this guidance, in their own words, within ``a couple of  weeks.'' Yet here we are more than 2 months later with no e-cigarette  flavor ban in place.   What is worse, now there are reports that President Trump has decided  to reverse himself, to break the promise he made to American families,  as a direct result of lobbying from big tobacco and big vape companies.  We know whom this President is hearing from. He is hearing from JUUL,  the company primarily responsible for today's youth vaping epidemic. He  is hearing from Altria, the big tobacco company that just bought a  major stake in JUUL. He is hearing from the Vaping Technology  Association, a lobbying organization that represents vaping shops  nationwide. It makes sense that these companies would want the  President to reverse himself, to break his word to American families,  because they make profits on the backs of our kids, just like Big  Tobacco did for so many years.   Today, almost 30 percent of all high school-aged children are vaping.  That is more than 5 million kids. Where did they come up with these  numbers? From this administration's report to the American people. Four  percent of adults are vaping and up to 30 percent of high school kids.  When they show these pictures of adults walking around with buttons  that say ``We vape and we vote,'' it is a tiny sliver of America. The  kids should be wearing buttons that say ``We vape, and our health is at  risk.''   Over the last 2 years of Donald Trump's Presidency, the number of  children vaping has increased by 135 percent. More than 1 in 4 high  school kids are using e-cigarettes, and more than 1 in 10 middle school  children are following their example. Kids are using these products  because of the cool, sleek designs of devices like JUUL and because of  the flavors designed to appeal to just kids. Listen to them: cotton  candy, unicorn milk, cool mint, mom's sugar cookie, and, of course,  menthol.   According to the Food and Drug Administration, more than 80 percent  of children who vape started with flavored e-cigarettes. Does anyone  believe that these vaping flavors are actually intended for a 50-year- old chain smoker looking to quit cigarettes--flavors like Farley's  Gnarly Sauce, Bubble Purp by Chubby Bubble, Blue Razz by Candy King,  and Cotton Candy by Zonk? Do you honestly think a 50-year-old trying to  break a tobacco cigarette habit is going to buy Cotton Candy by Zonk  flavoring?   Every single one of these products is on the market today without  review or authorization from the Food and Drug  [[Page S6635]]  Administration. That is because under President Trump, the FDA decided  to delay regulation of these products for years. And while the FDA  dithers, children get addicted. As a result, it is the Wild Wild West  out there with respect to unapproved, unregulated, dangerous, and  addictive vaping products, and it is our kids who are paying the price.   Despite what Big Vape says, these products are not safe. In recent  months, we have seen thousands of illnesses and 42 deaths associated  with vaping, including four in Illinois.   Two weeks ago, a woman came up to me and said: You don't know me. I  am a nurse. And she gave me the name of the hospital. She said: I just  want to tell you, I was there when that 22-year-old man died last week  from vaping. He had been in our hospital for months waiting for a lung  transplant because of the damage he had done to his lungs by vaping. He  couldn't find a donor, and he died.   There are other known dangers associated with e-cigarettes and  nicotine. Nicotine is a toxic, highly addictive substance that raises  blood pressure and spikes adrenaline, increasing the risk of heart  disease. Nicotine can have short- and long-term negative health impacts  on the developing brain. Kids who use e-cigarettes are more likely to  transition to tobacco cigarettes, and those kill 480,000 Americans each  year. There is hardly a family in this country who hasn't been touched  by tobacco-related death and disease.   A Dartmouth study shows that e-cigarette use leads to 81 new smokers  for every 1 smoker who quits. Don't buy the pitch from JUUL that you  ought to be vaping so that you can get off of tobacco cigarettes. It is  running just the opposite--kids starting on vaping and converting to  tobacco cigarettes.   What do we know about e-cigarettes? They are predominately used by  our children. Flavors play a major role in hooking kids on nicotine.  Nicotine use harms the developing brain, and kids who vape are more  likely than their peers to transition to tobacco cigarettes.   Now let's consider what we don't know about e-cigarettes. We don't  know whether they are safe. We don't know whether they actually help  adult smokers quit. We often don't know what the ingredients are in  those devices.   E-cigarette flavors need to come off the market unless or until they  can prove they have a public health benefit--and good luck to that.   The President of the United States, the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, and the head of the Food and Drug Administration all told us  on September 11 that they were on the side of kids and families and  public health, and they promised us they were going to do something  about it. Today, I am sending the President a letter asking him to keep  his word, to ban e-cigarette flavors, which threaten our kids with a  lifetime of nicotine addiction, illness, and, sadly, even death.   Along with families nationwide, I am hoping the President cares more  about children than he does about the lobbying pressure from big  tobacco and big vape companies. Just because they can buy an ad on FOX  TV does not mean they are right.   For goodness' sake, Mr. President, stick with your promise of  September 11. Protect our kids from this vaping epidemic.   I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the President be printed in  the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, November 19, 2019.      Hon. Donald J. Trump,      President of the United States,      The White House, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: As President of the United States, you       have a responsibility to put the health and safety of our       people--especially our nation's children--above all else. On       September 11, 2019, you were poised to do just that,       announcing a long-overdue plan from the Oval Office to       quickly ban all non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes, including       flavors such as cotton candy, sugar cookie, fruit medley,       cool mint, and menthol. Sitting alongside the First Lady,       Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, and then-Acting       Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, it had all       the trappings of a made-for-television event you seem to       relish.        Along with all major public health, education, and parent       organizations, I praised this move because e-cigarettes--and       their accompanying kid-friendly fiavors--are reversing       decades of hard-fought progress our nation has made in       reducing youth smoking rates. And now, along with all major       public health, education, and parent organizations, I have       watched in horror over the past two months as you have       seemingly caved to Big Tobacco and Big Vape lobbying       pressure, breaking your promise to address our nation's youth       vaping epidemic.        Here is what we know about e-cigarettes:        We know that, in the past two years of your presidency, our       nation has experienced a 135 percent increase in youth use of       e-cigarettes.        We know that five million children are now vaping,       including more than one in four high-school students and more       than one in ten middle-school students.        We know that nearly 30 percent of children under the age of       18 are now vaping, compared with less than 4 percent of       adults.        We know that JUUL has fueled this youth public health       ``epidemic,'' as it has been defined by every major federal       health official in your Administration.        We know that e-cigarette flavors--including mint and       menthol--are why children first try and become addicted to e-      cigarettes.        We know that more than 2,000 Americans have recently been       sickened as a result of vaping. We also know that, to date,       42 people have died--including four in my state.        We know that not a single e-cigarette product available for       purchase today is on the market with authorization from the       FDA.        Finally, we know that your Administration has completely       abdicated its duty to protect the public health by repeatedly       delaying and refusing to regulate any of these dangerous and       addictive products.        Here is what we do not know about e-cigarettes:        We do not know the short- or long-term health impacts of       using these products, especially in children (though we do       know that use of nicotine in the developing brain has many       negative and long-term health consequences).        We do not always know what ingredients--beyond nicotine--      are in e-cigarettes and the accompanying flavors, nor do we       know the short- or long-term health impact of the use of       those ingredients. We do not if e-cigarettes and flavors       actually help adult smokers quit cigarettes (though we do       know that e-cigarette use leads to 80 new smokers for every       one smoker who reports quitting).        We do not conclusively know why so many people who vape are       getting sick and dying.        We do not have answers to these questions because the       tobacco and vaping industries--shrouded in secrecy and       deception--have refused to conduct the much-needed clinical       trials and studies, instead preferring to keep the health       consequences a secret. Perhaps even more concerning is that       your FDA--the federal agency responsible for regulating       tobacco products--has not required them to do so.        More than two months ago, when you announced the impending       e-cigarette flavor ban, you stated, ``We have a problem in       our country . . . It's a problem nobody really thought about       too much a few years ago, and it's called `vaping'--      especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children . . .       And we're going to have to do something about it . . . We're       looking at very strong rules and regulations.''        You further stated, ``Vaping has become a very big       business, as I understand it--like a giant business in a very       short period of time. But we can't allow people to get sick,       and we can't have our youth be so affected.''        During your September Oval Office press conference with the       First Lady, you made big promises that you now appear to be       breaking. Children and families nationwide are still hoping       that you will reverse course and quickly implement an e-      cigarette flavor ban that protects our next generation from a       lifetime of nicotine addiction, illness, and death.            Sincerely,                                                 Richard J. Durbin,                                                      U.S. Senator.    Mr. President, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20  million Americans have health insurance, including more than 1 million  in my State of Illinois. Why is it so important? Let me tell you the  story of Stefanie from Oak Park, IL. Recently, Stefanie wrote about her  son, who has a history of mental health and substance abuse issues.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, her son will be able to stay on her  health insurance plan until he reaches the age of 26.   The Affordable Care Act also required that all health plans cover  mental health and addiction treatment. It is hard to imagine that  people were selling health insurance in America that did not cover  mental health and addiction.   Two Senators on the floor of the Senate--Paul Wellstone, who stood  right over there, and Pete Domenici, who stood there--teamed up to  require that every health insurance plan in America cover mental  illness. It is so obvious. It is an issue many families face. But  health insurance plans were excluding it. Why did these two Senators  who were wildly different politically decide they would team up for  this? Paul  [[Page S6636]]  Wellstone had a brother and Senator Domenici had a son who were  struggling with mental illness, and they didn't have protection in  their health insurance, so the Senators fought to include it.   Thank goodness they did. Because of that health law, insurance  companies cannot discriminate against Stefanie's son because of his  medical history. Her son just graduated college. She is thankful he can  stay on her company's policy until he gets a job, and she is thankful  her premiums are not higher due to her son's health needs. Stefanie is  afraid that if these protections go away because of a court case that  is currently pending or the actions of the Republican majority in this  Senate, her son will be uninsurable or face enormous medical bills that  he will be unable to pay. Stefanie wrote to me, and she said that if  the Affordable Care Act were to be eliminated, they are ``contemplating  leaving this country to seek manageable health care.''   Democrats are fighting to keep healthcare protections for people like  Stefanie and her son. Because of the Affordable Care Act, people with  preexisting conditions can no longer be denied coverage or charged  higher premiums. Is there anyone among us who doesn't know someone with  a preexisting condition? I have one. This protects 5 million people in  Illinois who have a preexisting condition.   Insurance companies are no longer allowed to impose annual or  lifetime caps on benefits or to deny coverage for mental health,  substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, or hospitalizations, and  young people are allowed to stay on their parents' plan until they  reach age 26.   Despite the Republican and Trump administration's continued efforts  to repeal these protections both in Congress and in the courts, health  insurance under the Affordable Care Act is open for business. If you  are interested and want to know the policies available, healthcare.gov  is the website to visit.   Open enrollment for 2020 health plans began on November 1 and ends on  December 15. If you can, sign up. It is a protection that you hope you  will never need, but if you need it, it is good to have it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senators  Rubio, Cardin, Menendez, and Representative Chris Smith for moving the  Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in both Chambers, legislation  I was proud to cosponsor. With the situation deteriorating by the hour  in Hong Kong, the passage of legislation could not be more timely. I  urge my colleagues in the House to take action quickly without delay.  This bill sends an important message of bipartisan support from the  U.S. Congress for the democratic aspirations of the broad majority of  the people of Hong Kong.   Some of you may realize that we, just a few months ago, celebrated  the 30th anniversary of the bloody crackdown that ended the peaceful  democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. Who among us can forget those  riveting weeks during which there was real hope and possibility of  China opening its political system--the Goddess of Democracy statue  modeled after our own Statue of Liberty--and, sadly, the jarring image  of the protestor that was standing to try to block the onslaught of a  tank?   The crude propaganda and disinformation used by Communist hardliners  to brainwash young military conscripts to turn on their own people was  both heartbreaking and infuriating. Remembering those days, we must not  sit by idly and quietly and allow Hong Kong's freedoms to be similarly  threatened.   I have been moved by the courageousness of the pro-democracy  protestors in the face of increasingly excessive use of force by the  Hong Kong police in one of the most vibrant cities in the world. What  exactly are Hong Kong protesters fighting for--the freedoms we in  America take for granted every day--the freedom of assembly, suffrage,  speech, due process, and rule of law. Rather than sitting down with the  protesters, Hong Kong authorities have increasingly used excessive  force instead of engaging in constructive dialogue. Yet, ultimately, I  believe the Hong Kong Government and the protesters are capable of  finding a solution, and I hope they do.   Let me end by appealing to the leadership in China to show the  courage to allow the continued prosperous democratic autonomy enjoyed  by the people of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's continued special status is the  sign of strength and confidence, not weakness.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, when we in Congress are fortunate enough  to win our elections, we then must take an oath of office. It is quite  simple and straightforward: ``I do solemnly swear that I will support  and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,  foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the  same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental  reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully  discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So  help me God''--defend the Constitution and faithfully discharge the  duties of this sacred office. Notably, the oath does not say defend the  President over the rule of law or our constitutional duties.   And yet President Trump has made crude and inexcusable attacks  against our professional diplomats and military officials who bravely  and patriotically tried to abide by this same oath by upholding these  values of honor and the rule of law. Career professionals testifying as  part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry are facing partisan attacks and  even efforts that threaten their lives and careers. President Trump has  made no secret of his long-held suspicion of government workers, which  he and his allies have perpetually accused of trying to bring down his  Presidency.   That former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House  Members that she felt ``threatened'' by our own President who called  her ``bad news'' is despicable. In fact, Trump even attacked  Yovanovitch on Twitter last week during her powerful public testimony  before the House Intelligence Committee.   There have also been countless baseless attacks and insulting  questions of loyalty faced by witnesses such as LTC Alexander Vindman.  Vindman, who was born in Kiev, immigrated to the U.S. and spent 20  years as an Army officer, an officer who has shed blood for our  country, as recognized by his Purple Heart.   Twenty-five years ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was  another longtime Army officer who was born behind the Iron Curtain. GEN  John Shalikashvili was born in Poland and moved to Peoria, IL, when he  was 16. Thank goodness he served our country in a time where his career  was not derailed by such degrading attacks.   I commend Defense Secretary Esper for promising that Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman ``shouldn't have any fear of retaliation,'' which only  begs the question: Why can't Secretary Pompeo make the same promise for  State Department officials? U.S. diplomats and military officials put  their lives at risk every day at embassies and conflict zones around  the world. To be attacked by their own government--and at the highest  levels--defies belief and is beneath the offices they hold.   That President Trump and Republicans deride and bully these American  patriots for telling the truth while Secretary Pompeo sits silently on  his hands is simply beyond the pale. It is the opposite of what we  teach our children. These career professionals--these  [[Page S6662]]  patriots--are models of courage and respect for our democratic system  that the President and his circle of enablers should look to emulate  rather than belittle.                            ____________________     Madam President, we celebrated Veterans Day last Monday.  On the 11th day of the 11th month, we pause to honor the courage and  sacrifice of our Nation's veterans. Millions of Americans have served  in uniform over the years, many of whom return home with visible and  invisible wounds alike, often to serve again in their communities.   I had the privilege to meet with a group of such dedicated veterans  recently at a meeting of the National Women Veterans United in Chicago.  National Women Veterans United is the only center in Illinois dedicated  to serving women servicemembers and veterans. Run by women and for  women, I met with founder and president, the formidable Rochelle Crump.  Rochelle served in the Army during the Vietnam era and has a long  history of working with the VA at the Federal, State, and local levels.  Rochelle and other members of her community in Chicago noticed that  women veterans were falling through the cracks when it came to  accessing the benefits they have earned, so they founded National Women  Veterans United in 2005 to help fill the gap.   The VA reports that there are approximately 2 million women veterans  in America, reflecting 9 percent of the total veteran population. By  2045, the share of female veterans is projected to double to 18  percent. Women are among the fastest growing segments of the veteran  population; yet many women veterans are either not aware of the  benefits afforded to them or they are frustrated with the VA's  inability to understand or address the unique needs of women veterans.  For example, women veterans tend to be older. The top reported health  issues they face are PTSD, TBI, hypertension, and cardiovascular  disease, but many also require services related to unique health needs  such as military sexual trauma and reproductive health.   Now, the VA has made great strides over the years to provide for  women veterans, but we must do more, especially when it comes to  changing the culture at the VA that has often been a barrier to women  seeking care at the VA. Groups like National Women Veterans United try  to break down those barriers. They have helped hundreds of women  veterans and their families, providing assistance in navigating the VA,  holding healthcare screenings, and offering a host of personal and  professional development opportunities and support groups. National  Women Veterans United also supported entire families, such as the Gold  Star Robinson-Wilson family. SGT Simone Robinson of Robbins, IL, was 21  years old when she died of wounds sustained while serving in  Afghanistan. At the time, she had a 2-year-old daughter. National Women  Veterans United has helped care for the family after the sergeant's  death. Earlier this year, they named their beautiful new center after  her, now the SGT Simone A. Robinson Military Women Veteran's Center.   I would like to recognize a few of the other great women I had the  opportunity to meet during my visit with National Women Veterans  United, including two Korean war veterans: Wille Merine Rouse and  Miljan Akin--Rouse also served again in Iraq, as did her daughter  Rene--Sharon Stokes-Parry, who served in Iraq with the Marine Corps;  Diane Halle, a retired U.S, Army master sergeant who later worked at  the Jesse Brown VA and with Team Rubicon on disaster relief around the  world; Jeannie Adams, a Vietnam Air Force veteran who serves as their  treasurer; Donna Cooper; Hazel Noble; Valorie Harris--the list goes on.   I look forward to continuing to work with National Women Veterans  United. These brave women stood guard for our freedom in uniform, and  now, they continue to stand in support of their community--and  specifically as African Americans, some of whom served during times of  racial segregation, they faced challenges not only as women, but as  Black women. Now, they help others who face challenges.   May we use their inspiration--and the inspiration of all of our  veterans--to find our own ways to sacrifice for the good of our Nation  and our world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2896         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pullman National Historical       Park Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior designated the       Pullman Historic District as a National Historic Landmark       District because of--        (A) the significance of the District to the labor history,       social history, architecture, and urban planning of the       United States; and        (B) the pivotal role of events in the District in creating       the first national Labor Day holiday in the world;        (2) between 1880 and 1884, George M. Pullman, owner of the       Pullman Palace Car Company, built the Pullman community,       which was envisioned by Pullman as an industrial town that       would provide employees with--        (A) a model community; and        (B) suitable living conditions;        (3) the town developed by George M. Pullman, which       consisted of over 1,000 buildings and homes, was awarded       ``The World's Most Perfect Town'' at the International       Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Exposition in 1896;        (4) the Pullman factory site is a true symbol of the       historic struggle in the United States to achieve fair labor       practices for the working class, with the original factory       serving as the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in       the United States;        (5) in the midst of economic depression in 1894, to protest       unsafe conditions and reductions in pay, Pullman factory       workers initiated a strike that--        (A) when taken up as a cause by the American Railway Union,       crippled the entire rail industry;        (B) continued even in the face of a Federal injunction and       a showdown between laborers and Federal troops that turned       violent and deadly; and        (C) set a national example for the ability of working       people in the United States to change the existing system in       favor of more just practices for protecting workers rights       and safety;        (6) following the deaths of a number of workers at the       hands of the United States military and United States       Marshals during the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted       to approve rush legislation that created a national Labor Day       holiday, which was signed into law by President Grover       Cleveland 6 days after the end of the strike;        (7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also played an important       role in African-American and early civil rights history       through the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of whom were       ex-slaves and employed in a heavily discriminatory       environment immediately following the Civil War;        (8) the Pullman porters, who served diligently between the       1870s and the 1960s, have been commended for--        (A) their level of service and attention to detail; and        (B) their contributions to the development of the African-      American middle class;        (9) the information, ideas, and commerce the Pullman       porters carried across the country while traveling on trains       helped to bring education and wealth to African-American       communities throughout the United States;        (10) the positive role of the Pullman porters in the       historical image of the first-class service that was made       available on Pullman cars is unmistakable;        (11) the Pullman community was the seminal home to the       Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which--        (A) was founded by civil rights pioneer A. Philip Randolph       in 1925;        (B) was the first African-American labor union with a       collective bargaining agreement;        (C) fought--        (i) against discrimination; and        (ii) in support of just labor practices; and        (D) helped lay the groundwork for what became the great       Civil Rights Movement of the 20th Century;        (12) the Pullman community is--        (A) a paramount illustration of the work of architect Solon       Spencer Beman;        (B) a well-preserved example of 19th Century community       planning, architecture, and landscape design; and        (C) comprised of a number of historic structures, including       the Administration Clock Tower Building, Hotel Florence,       Greenstone Church, Market Square, and hundreds of units of       rowhouses built for Pullman workers;        (13) the preservation of the Pullman site has been       threatened by--        (A) plans for demolition in 1960; and        (B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the iconic clock tower       and the rear erecting shops;        (14) the diligent efforts of community organizations,       foundations, nonprofit organizations, residents, the State,       and units of local government in the restoration and       preservation of the District after the 1998 fire were vital       to the protection of the Pullman site;        (15) due to the historic and architectural significance of       the District, the District is designated as--        (A) a registered National Historic Landmark District;        (B) an Illinois State Landmark; and        (C) a City of Chicago Landmark District; and        (16) the preservation, enhancement, economic, and tourism       potential and management of the important historic and       architectural resources of the Park requires cooperation and       partnerships from among local property owners, the Federal       Government, the State, units of local government, the private       and nonprofit sectors, and the more than 100 civic       organizations that have expressed support for community       preservation through the establishment of the Pullman       National Historical Park.
