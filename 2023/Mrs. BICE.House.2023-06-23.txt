 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson) for yielding.   When this news broke that the FHFA organization had passed a rule to  change how this particular policy was put in place, I immediately went  to him and I said: We need to fix this, and here we are.   I am proud to stand in support of this legislation, which I am  collating with Congressman Davidson. Under the rule from the Federal  Housing Finance Agency, home buyers with good credit scores will be  forced to pay more for their mortgages to subsidize loans to higher  risk borrowers, and that is why the Middle Class Borrower Protection  Act is so important.   It will roll back this administration's senseless rule and stop the  anticapitalist agenda. Similar to the student loan scam, the President  is, once again, trying to bypass Congress and centralize more power in  the hands of the executive branch.   Since President Biden took office, he has increased the role of the  Federal Government in the lives of everyday Americans, and this is a  perfect example.   With sky-high mortgage rates, the last thing we need is to add more  fees and burdens on hardworking Americans and certainly hardworking  Oklahomans in my district. I stand in support of this legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
