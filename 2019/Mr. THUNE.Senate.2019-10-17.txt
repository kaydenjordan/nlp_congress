 Madam President, before I begin, I, too, want to join with  my colleagues who have preceded me and just say how sad I was to hear  of the death of Elijah Cummings. We joined the House together. He got  there a little before I did in a special election in 1996. I came in  January of 1997. I always admired his fire and his dedication. He was a  fierce advocate for his constituents and for the causes he believed in.  The House will be a lesser place for his absence.   Our prayers are with his family and all those who had the opportunity  to know him, his constituents, those he represented in Baltimore and  the State of Maryland who are going to mourn his loss today and miss  his presence for many, many days in the future.                 United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement    Madam President, farmers and ranchers have gotten some good news on  the trade front in recent weeks with the signing of a trade deal with  Japan.   U.S. farmers depend on access to the Japanese market. It is the  fourth largest market for U.S. agricultural producers. This agreement  will remove barriers to the sale of a variety of products, from cheese  to sweet corn, beef, pork, and wheat.   While this is very good news for farmers and ranchers, we have a lot  more work to do on the trade front to help our ag community and to  increase demand for American agricultural products around the world,  and we should start by passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Free  Trade Agreement. Canada and Mexico are the No. 1 and No. 2 markets for  American agricultural products, and preserving and expanding access to  these markets is key to improving the economic outlook for America's  farmers. Over a year ago, the administration finished negotiating a  strong deal with these countries that will help boost our struggling  agricultural economy.   To start with, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will provide  farmers with certainty about what these important markets are going to  look like going forward. One of the biggest challenges facing farmers  on the trade front right now is the uncertainty about what markets  around the world are going to look like. The United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement will give farmers and ranchers clarity on what trade  is going to look like with these two key trading partners.   In addition to providing certainty and preserving American access for  American farmers and ranchers, the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement makes a number of improvements to the status quo. Of  particular interest to South Dakota are the agreement's dairy  provisions. If you drive the I-29 corridor north of Brookings, SD, you  can see firsthand the major dairy expansion South Dakota has  experienced over the past several years. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada  Agreement will preserve U.S. dairy farmers' role as a key dairy  supplier to Mexico, and it will substantially expand market access in  Canada. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that the  agreement will boost U.S. dairy exports by more than $277 million.   The agreement will also expand market access for U.S. poultry and egg  producers. It will make it easier for producers to export wheat to  Canada and much more.   I have just focused on the benefits for farmers. In fact, the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will benefit almost every sector of our  economy, from the automobile industry to digital trade and e-commerce.  It will create 176,000 jobs, and it will raise wages for workers.   Given the major benefits not only for farmers but for the economy as  a whole, why hasn't Congress passed this agreement yet? That is a good  question, and the answer really is quite simple. By law, the House of  Representatives has to take up the agreement first, but the House has  unfortunately been more focused on political theater of late than on  collaborating on measures that would actually help American families,  and unfortunately it doesn't look like that is going to change.   I heard the Democratic leader down here earlier sort of attacking the  current administration for not doing enough on this or that. Well, the  fact is, if you look at the economic statistics over the past couple of  years, they  [[Page S5860]]  are pretty remarkable. Unemployment is at a historically low rate--3\1/ 2\ percent. Those are numbers we haven't seen in a very long time-- about 50 years, as a matter of fact. The number of jobs that have been  created since the President took office is about 6.4 million jobs. In  fact--a very important data point--the number of people looking for  work juxtaposed against the number of job openings in our economy--for  the 17th month in a row, we have more jobs available--about 7.3 million  jobs available--than those people looking for work--about 5.9 million  people. That is a historically sort of unprecedented, if you will,  statistic.   So if you look at the overall economy, things are in the right place.  They are moving in the right direction. Wages are up--the highest level  in a decade. The American people's pocketbooks, the things they care  about, the things they talk about over the kitchen table in terms of  their wages, their jobs, their prospects, their certainty about the  future--those things have all improved over the past couple of years  because of the policies this administration has put in place, coupled  with the work this Congress has done to try to create conditions that  are favorable to economic growth.   What does that mean? Well, his tax policy. We have cut tax rates for  individuals and families. We have cut tax rates for small businesses  that are trying to expand. We allowed them to accelerate their cost  recovery. Those are both key incentives when it comes to investment and  expansion. And we have seen the results of that.    We have seen regulatory changes made by the administration--in some  cases cooperating and coupled with the steps we have taken here in the  Congress--that have lessened the burden for businesses that are trying  to invest and grow and expand and create more jobs.   If you look at the energy changes, energy policy, we have become  energy independent--something that a decade ago or two decades ago,  nobody ever anticipated was possible. As a nation, we are now actually  an exporter of energy--a remarkable change over a short period of time.  I would argue that is largely due to changes in policy that have  enabled and encouraged that kind of investment in energy, regulatory  changes that have lessened the regulatory burden and made it less  expensive and less difficult to create jobs in this country rather than  more expensive and more difficult, which is what we particularly saw in  the past administration, and lowered the tax burden in a way that  provides incentives for people to invest, to grow their company, to pay  better wages, and to add jobs.   Those are the types of policy changes that have been made that have  resulted in the economic data and statistics we are looking at today.  They are not just data and statistics; they are actually being felt by  people across this country. So it begs the question as to why, then,  another step that we could take on that road to economic progress  hasn't been taken yet. Why, 320 days after the President signed the  U.S.-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement, has that not been taken up and  passed by the House of Representatives? I would argue that if they  would take that up and send it to the Senate, we would vote on it here.  We would pass it. We would send it to the President. He would sign it  into law, and farmers and ranchers in places like South Dakota and  other agricultural States across this country would get the benefit  from that. And it is not just farmers and ranchers. As I mentioned  earlier, it is pretty much every sector of our economy. It is  manufacturing. It is digital.   There are benefits in this trade deal that translate into a stronger,  more robust economy that will keep this expansion going forward and  will continue to create these good-paying jobs and higher wages and  create that better standard of living and quality of life for people in  this country. The reason it hasn't moved is because it is up to the  House of Representatives. They have all the control on this. The  Speaker of the House can move this whenever she wants to. What they are  trying to do now is renegotiate the deal all over again.   Unfortunately, they are very much obsessed at the moment with other  types of activities in the House. If you look at what is happening over  there right now, it doesn't look like that is going to change anytime  soon. With even the Speaker of the House joining the far left's now  impeachment crusade, I don't think it is likely that Democrats are  going to wake up one morning and decide they should spend less time on  partisan politics and more time working with Republicans to pass real  solutions for the American people. But I do hope they will not destroy  this trade agreement. There are thousands of farmers in my State of  South Dakota and around the country who are waiting for the relief that  the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement would bring.   Irrespective of what the distractions are in the House of  Representatives at the moment and much of the partisan rush toward  impeachment that is underway there, I hope they will figure out a way  to multitask and will do what they should have done a long time ago,  and that is to pick up this free-trade deal, pass it through the House  of Representatives, send it to the U.S. Senate, where we can pass it,  and send it to the President, where it can be signed into law, and the  American people can continue to see the benefits of policies that are  good for this economy, that will create more growth in our country,  faster growth in our economy, better paying jobs, and a better quality  of life for people not just in South Dakota but all across America.
