Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1215                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 524, providing for consideration of  three measures: H. Res. 461, H.R. 3799, and H.R. 3564.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3564 under a structured  rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services or  their designee.   The rule makes in order four amendments and provides one motion to  recommit. The rule additionally provides for consideration of H.R. 3799  under a structured rule with 80 minutes of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committees on Education and the Workforce or their respective designees  and Ways and Means or their respective designees. The rule makes in  order three amendments and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 461 under a  closed rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled and by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce or their respective designees.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in support of  the underlying bills.   Today, the Republican majority continues its long process of  reversing and repairing the damages inflicted on the American people by  the Biden administration and the previous Democrat majority.   Mr. Speaker, included in the rule is H.R. 3799, the Custom Health  Option and Individual Care Expense Arrangement Act, or the CHOICE  Arrangement Act, introduced by my friend from Oklahoma, Kevin Hern.   This legislation includes commonsense changes to help lower health  insurance costs, increase competition in the healthcare market, and  ensure access to high-quality, low-cost plans for Americans and small  business owners and their employees.   In 2021, almost 55 percent of Americans were covered by employer- based health coverage. Employer-based health coverage is easily the  most popular option for Americans to receive health insurance coverage.  According to the National Federation of Independent Business, of small  employers  [[Page H3004]]  that did not offer health insurance coverage to their employees, two- thirds reported that the reason they do not offer the health insurance  is because it is simply too expensive.   In 2019, President Trump and his administration published regulations  allowing employers to provide their employees with a fixed amount of  money each year in tax-preferred individual health coverage  reimbursement accounts that an employee could use to buy coverage in  the individual market.   Current regulations allow employers to establish individual coverage  health reimbursement accounts which employees can use to purchase  individual market coverage and pay for their out-of-pocket medical  expenses.   The CHOICE Arrangement Act seeks to codify these regulations to  provide tax-advantaged funds for employees to buy portable health  insurance plans and requires notification to employers of the  availability of these tax-advantaged health insurance benefits.   The CHOICE Arrangement Act also includes provisions codifying the  right of small businesses to band together and form association health  plans to offer pooled health insurance coverage to their employees.   This legislation will give employers maximum flexibility in how they  provide coverage options for their employees by providing CHOICE  arrangements while also providing expected benefits like dental plans,  vision plans, accident, disability benefits, and more.   This legislation will also ensure that stop-loss coverage is not  subject to Federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income and  Security Act. These commonsense changes will stop the Biden  administration from administratively making healthcare more expensive  by regulating stop-loss coverage and ensuring that small businesses  can, in fact, remain competitive.   Mr. Speaker, also included in this rule is H. Res. 461. This condemns  the practice of retrofitting our children's schools to house illegal  immigrants. President Biden and the Democrats' failures at the southern  border are so comprehensive, so overwhelming that municipalities are  now co-opting the schools where we educate our children because  President Biden refuses to secure the southern border.   Because President Biden cannot or will not secure our southern  border, Mr. Speaker, our local communities and municipalities are now  casualties of President Biden's border crisis.   The American people rightfully demand that President Biden and  Democrats in Congress acknowledge this crisis. They demand that they  not only acknowledge the crisis, Mr. Speaker, they demand that their  Federal Government solve this self-inflicted crisis that is pushing our  communities well past the breaking point.   New York City and its mayor, Eric Adams, are the first to cry uncle.  Mr. Speaker, 2 months is how long Mayor Adams and New York City lasted,  suffering under conditions of a size and scale not even comparable to  the conditions that Texans have been enduring these past 2\1/2\ years  under an administration that has only now started to pay attention to  this humanitarian crisis when it started to affect their constituents.   Over and over again, we have pleaded with the Biden administration to  take this crisis seriously, only to be rebuffed time and again. This  humanitarian catastrophe can be laid squarely at the feet of the  Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Mayorkas, and,  of course, President Biden who have chosen to do nothing rather than be  labeled xenophobes by their progressive colleagues for actually  enforcing existing immigration law and securing our southern border.    Mr. Speaker, the temptation for the Biden administration has been to  bury their heads in the sand and hope that these waves of illegal  immigrants coming across our border will, in fact, magically disappear.  They will not, Mr. Speaker, not until President Biden finally gets  serious about the border crisis by demanding that the Secretary of  Homeland Security do his job and secure our southern border, or maybe  find someone else who can do that job.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for consideration of H.R.  3564, the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023. This bill would  repeal the Federal Housing Finance Agency's recalibrated single-family  pricing framework to guarantee mortgages which would charge borrowers  with higher credit scores larger fees to subsidize borrowers with lower  credit scores.   If not for our Republican majority, Mr. Speaker, one out of every two  borrowers with higher credit scores would be assessed higher mortgage  fees in President Biden's radical equity agenda.   President Biden is telling the American people that if you work hard,  if you are responsible with your finances, if you pay your bills on  time, you are going to get to subsidize the mortgages of those who did  not make the same sacrifices that you did in order to attain a higher  credit score. This sends a terrible message to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Davidson for bringing us this final piece of  legislation that underscores that the Republican majority stands with  those middle-class families who have done the right thing and should  not be pushed by a radical administration that is obsessed with radical  wealth distribution schemes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Langworthy), a valuable new member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the only entity cutting Social Security or Medicare  right now is the White House, the Biden administration. Over the last  2\1/2\ years, cuts to Medicare have totaled probably $40 billion in the  part B drugs administered in physician's offices and $300 billion in  Medicare Advantage, all done through the Inflation Reduction Act last  year. The only people talking about cutting Medicare right now is the  administration, and that is really what ought to be stopped.   Right now, that is not the business at hand. What we are discussing  today are three important bills that are going to be considered on the  floor. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the rule and in favor  of the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, there are hearings going on right now in the Energy and  Commerce Committee for the reauthorization of the SUPPORT Act.   The SUPPORT Act passed in 2017-2018 in that Congress. It was a  broadly bipartisan bill. It was geared toward dealing with the problems  that were occurring in this country because of an opiate crisis.   Largely, the source of these opiates were prescription drugs that  were diverted to other uses, and the consequence was people taking a  good overdose and in fact dying from prescription drugs that were  actually diverted from their intended use.   Five years later, we are in the process of reauthorizing the SUPPORT  Act. The SUPPORT Act actually functioned as intended, it did reduce  some of those overdose deaths downward until we were hit with the  pandemic, and obviously that changed a lot of things.   In that 5-year interval, this disease has changed. It is no longer  prescription opiates that are diverted, it is fentanyl. It is fentanyl  that is poisoning our young people. It is fentanyl that is pouring in  from the southern border.   Look, I get it. You want to say it is only coming in at the ports of  entry--that is what you catch. Our Customs and Border Protection are so  overwhelmed with the numbers of people who are coming in at the  invitation of the President and the Vice President, people are pouring  across our border.   Customs and Border Protection cannot do their normal job. They are  doing housekeeping chores, taking care of people who are ill, children  who are arriving at their doorstep, and they have no choice but to take  care of them.   In the meantime, all other areas of the surveillance are non vis  because Customs and Border Protection are tied up with this vast  increase of humanity that is coming in. The bottom line is as we  reauthorize the SUPPORT Act now, we are actually dealing with a  different disease because fentanyl poisoning has replaced opiate  overdose.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, isn't it interesting that thanks to House Republicans  and their investigative efforts there was a settlement yesterday where  a member of the President's family has agreed to pay his taxes that he  hasn't been paying.  [[Page H3011]]  So that is a good thing that delivers money to the Treasury.   Oh, yes, about those background checks, it turns out a member of the  President's family wasn't adhering to the background checks and the  proper handling of a firearm.   So maybe we all learned something in that exchange over the last 24  hours.   I also want to correct a few things on the underlying bills.  Association health plans, like all large employer plans, are required  to cover preventative healthcare. This requirement includes covering  women's preventative health services without cost sharing. In addition,  all AHPs are required to cover pregnancy-related conditions and  coverage of a minimal hospital stay after childbirth as mandated by the  Affordable Care Act.    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires the plans to cover  pregnancy, childbirth, and related conditions in the same manner as  they cover other medical conditions under the association health plan.   The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996--that was  about 10 years before the ACA--the Health Protection Act of 1996  requires large group association health plans to cover a hospital stay  of at least 48 hours for a childbirth and at least 96 hours for a birth  by caesarean delivery.   These are all requirements placed on large group employer-sponsored  health plans. Expanding AHPs does not change these requirements. What  it changes is making that valuable insurance available to more  employees.   The CBO score that the gentleman referenced also had within it the  notation that 200,000 people would be covered if this bill, the CHOICE  Act, is enacted because insurance would not be as expensive for  employers to provide and would give them more possibilities.   Here is probably the crux of that matter: 40,000 of these people have  no insurance currently. So there will be 40,000 people moved from  uninsured to insured by passing the CHOICE Act. I would say that is a  good thing, and I think people would be supportive of that.   I do want to stress that it is important to support the rule and the  underlying measures. I thank my colleagues for their diligence and hard  work in bringing these important pieces of legislation to the floor  today. The Republican majority has demonstrated, yet again, that we are  putting forward a legislative agenda that works for all Americans and  not just the well-connected few.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 524 Offered By Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
