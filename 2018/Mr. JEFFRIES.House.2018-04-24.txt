 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address another egregious  misrepresentation coming from you know who. How dare anyone refer to an  overpriced luxury golf course as the Southern White House.   Let's be clear about something: The Civil War is over. Jefferson  Davis failed. The Confederacy lost. There is no such thing as the  Southern White House.   Thousands of Americans died on the battlefield and shed blood, sweat,  and tears to make certain that, in this country, only one institution  connected to the executive branch stood in the land of the free and the  home of the brave. That institution is located right here in our  Nation's Capital. The address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It was built  by slaves.   The White House does not belong to the ghosts of the Confederacy. The  White House does not belong to Vladimir Putin or his indigenous  collaborators. The White House does not belong to a privately owned  real estate cartel to be used and abused as a prop for an infomercial.   We are a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  The White House belongs to the American people.                            ____________________
