 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to ask for my colleagues'  support for this amendment No. 142 which would protect students' access  to programs that prepare them for the workforce, for a great career.   Specifically, this amendment would prohibit the Department of  Education from implementing, administering, or enforcing one narrow  provision of the newly finalized rule on financial responsibility  regulations which unfairly limits Federal financial aid from being  accessed by clock-hour programs.   What are clock-hour programs? Career-oriented programs in some  community colleges use clock hours to measure a student's progress  rather than the credit-based system that traditional colleges use.   Each State establishes their own licensure requirements and minimum  number of clock hours for programs like cosmetology, massage therapy,  barbering, nursing and allied health, trucking, and others before  students can apply for their State licenses.   Many programs at facilities and schools that offer these programs go  beyond the State's minimum number of clock hours. There are a number of  good reasons for that. They may allow students more time to practice  the trade to increase their speed and income when they get to the job  or it may be necessary to have more hours of instruction time because  of new techniques and practices in instruction to ensure that students  are prepared to pass the licensure exams.   The Department of Education has traditionally allowed career-oriented  programs and some community college programs to go above 150 percent of  a State's minimum number of clock hours and still be eligible for  Federal financial aid. That changes in their new rule.                                time  0030    They would now eliminate from Federal financial aid any program that  goes above 150 percent of the minimum hours. That means that schools  will need to redesign and recertify their programs, which is a very  time-consuming process, or students will now have to pay cash or  private loans for the entire program rather than receiving the  financial aid.   It is estimated today that more than 3 million skilled trades jobs  remain open. At a time when our Nation is struggling to fill these  roles, and employers can't find skilled workers, this is not the time  for the Department to make it harder for a student to access programs  that prepare them for the workforce.   This amendment would ensure that the Department cannot fund the  provision regarding program length in its final rule and would allow  students to continue to use the Federal financial aid they are eligible  for to fund their studies.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have schools in my district that are  providing great instruction. These schools are working well, and the  students are taking advantage of them. They have great careers as a  result of the instruction.   As I mentioned, there are good reasons that these programs, in some  cases, need to go beyond the minimum hours. They may help a student to  qualify to do well on the exam.   Again, there is no mistaking that our workforce is in a dire state.  There are 9.6 million open jobs across the country right now and only  5.4 million individuals looking for jobs. There are not enough people  to fill all of these open positions.   Employers in my area are keenly aware of this. This is a message I  hear over and over again in my district.   This is a huge disservice to students. This will mean fewer students  will be able to use that pathway for a great career because they may  not have the resources to pay for it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
