 Madam Speaker, Ron is one of the good guys. For those  of us who are blessed to be on the Ways and Means Committee, many times  it is one of those committees where you have to do adult stuff that  affects not only this country but the world. Having people that you can  talk to and work it through with is important. Ron is going to be  missed. I thank him for being one of the good guys.   Madam Speaker, this is going to be sort of a two-parter. I am going  to come back in 2 weeks and provide solutions, but right now I need to  define the problem.   As you know, right now around the Capitol complex, we have dozens and  dozens of brand-new Members and hundreds of potentially new staffers.  They are all trying to find their office and which way is up and where  the bathrooms are; I mean, all the things we go through when we are  brand-new around here.   My fear is no one is telling these Members that are new--and even  talking to the Members who have been here a while--the truth. The truth  is the math, and the math always wins.   We are in real trouble. What scares me is with some of the things  going on in the economy right now, with where interest rates look like  they are going, with inflation now becoming structural, it is  potentially just devastating to the individuals out there, our brothers  and sisters in the country, just the affordability, being able to  afford a house, food, but you have got to understand what it also means  to the stability of this country.   Let's actually walk through it. Some of this is big-boy math, it is  going to be complex, but there are a couple punch lines in here I want  to be remembered.   I am not going to take you back to 1965, but let's do last year. This  is last year's budget cycle. Understand, over 71 percent of all of our  spending is on autopilot. The fact of the matter is this is what we  call mandatory. Only 13 percent was defense, 16 percent was  discretionary, what we functionally debate here which we really fight  over.   But this mandatory here, you see red, your government functionally is  an insurance company with an army. This is health, Medicare, Social  Security, other benefits, pensions for military, for government  workers, those sorts of things. This is mandatory. And it is on  autopilot.   I don't think there is a Member here who has ever ultimately voted on  this red portion. It is a formula. You turn 65, you get certain  benefits. You serve in the military a certain amount of time, you get  certain benefits. It is autopilot.   Defense, well, that we debate, we work through, but the fact of the  matter is defense sort of stays within a certain mean of the GDP.   And then domestic. The crazy thing, domestic, actually, as a  percentage of GDP, at the end of a decade will be flat.   So where is all this debt coming from? Where is all this growth  coming from?   I am going to give you an answer, and it is going to make people  really unhappy. You need to understand, when we talk about just last  year's borrowing, does anyone out there understand how big it was?  [[Page H8537]]    Okay. So we borrowed, functionally, $1.375 trillion.   How much is that?   It is $114 billion a month.   It is $26 billion a week.   It is $3.7 billion a day.   It is $159 million an hour.   It is $2.6 million a minute.   We are told with big numbers, how do you get it so it is  understandable? If I came to you right now and said to you, how much  last year did your government borrow every second? Anyone in this body  able to answer that? It turns out it was $43,600 a second. We borrowed  $43,600 every second last year.   Does anyone see a problem? Or is it one of those things that as long  as we are handing out goodies and subsidizing the folks who will vote  for us or contribute to us, the world is good?   Where is all this debt coming from? Brian Riedl, Manhattan Institute,  basically just put out a series of slides where they take the  Congressional Budget Office, the OMB office from the administration,  and sort of look at it and say, what is driving the debt?   Today we hold $31 trillion of total debt. That is borrowing from  trust funds and everything, but that is the total debt.   But from today for the next 30 years, based on a previous interest  rate calculation--so we haven't even plugged in the new higher interest  rates that we are borrowing money on--anyone want to guess what the  borrowing is from today to the future, how much money? We are going to  borrow, functionally, $114 trillion. There is a $114 trillion  shortfall.   Now, the interesting thing--remember on that previous slide, I was  saying, here is mandatory, here is discretionary. Well, it turns out  the discretionary military we calculate today to actually have about a  $1.9 trillion surplus over the next 30 years.   So where is $114 trillion of borrowing coming from? This is really  uncomfortable. I will tell you, I believe the Democrats did something  actually really crappy during the election, but it is a knife fight. I  accept the knives come out, it is all about winning.   But when you had campaigns out there--``They are going to cut your  Medicare''--you can't even have an honest conversation here what is  going on.   The shortfall in Medicare, when you add in the interest cost, is $80  trillion. The shortfall in Social Security is $35.8 trillion. The  entire borrowing over the next 30 years is Social Security and  Medicare.   We got old. The fact of the matter is this place didn't pay any  attention. There was this thing called baby boomers.    You get the clown show around here that says, well, we will do  Medicare for All. That is a financing bill. It had nothing to do with  what we pay. ObamaCare, that is a financing bill; who gets subsidized,  who has to pay. The Republican alternative was ultimately a financing  bill. You need a revolution in what we pay, not who pays it.   But that is actually more uncomfortable here than actually having a  debate over raising taxes or doing entitlement reform, an actual  discussion of should we legalize technology, should we legalize the  things that actually create disruptions in providing our brothers and  sisters the healthcare that we as a society made a deal? We are going  to keep our promise on Social Security and Medicare. Well, I think we  are.   I mean, the fact of the matter is, what is it now? In a decade,  because of the new COLA increase, we just shortened the lifespan of the  Social Security trust fund by, what?, almost a year. So you have a  little bit over a decade, and our brothers and sisters who live on  Social Security are heading toward a 25 percent cut.   What is this place going to do?   Medicare is just unsustainable. The stunning amount to finance our  brothers and sisters, our promise for those who turn 65 and get  Medicare, to finance it, basically consumes every dollar of this  government.   It is math. It is the reality.   How many of you during this last campaign had an honest debate,  honest conversation, anyone who was even willing to talk about this?  Really dangerous because the other side will run nasty ads about you to  scare people, yet by not dealing with it, you are sentencing our  seniors to misery because at some point this hits the wall.   So what is going on? Why am I even more dour right now than I was  several months ago?   It is inflation, it is the cost of everything. It is the  affordability in our society. But you are crushing people. We are going  to walk through a little bit of that. But you have got to understand--I  am sorry, I am going to geek out on interest rates for a moment, but  then I am going to try to show what it actually means to everyone in  this country. What we are doing to you and so many of our brothers and  sisters out there, you don't understand how--oh, I am sorry, it is a  sort of high-level, technical, economic term--how screwed you are.   Let's sort of walk through this. We were building budgets a year ago  on an assumption that U.S. sovereign debt when you did the 2-year, the  5-year, the 10-year, the 20-year, the 30-year, the blended interest  rate, the weighted daily average, it was all these fun calculations.  Actually really interesting stuff.   We were originally about 1.78 we thought would be our mean interest  rate. Then last--what was it, was this March or May?--March we  recalculated because of this thing called inflation. Oh, we are going  to be up to 2.10. Then the reality of it is that we ended up at a  recalculation of, hey, the U.S. mean now is heading toward 2.85. That  is on the 10-year.   We have some economists around us who are starting to say, it is  going higher; it is going higher. I am going to show you a couple  things here of what happens to us as a country if the way the Federal  Reserve has to stop inflation is raising, raising, raising interest  rates, breaking the labor market because you understand within there,  even though there is this delay effect, that also means what you and I  have to pay the interest back on all the borrowing, and the biggest  part of the borrowing cycle has not even hit us yet because we are just  now starting to absorb and get ready for the huge spike in costs  because of our demographics.   Remember, baby boomers, the final tail end of the baby boomers is  moving into their retirement benefits, and as they get slightly older  and a little bit older, a little bit older, the Medicare costs start to  really go up, and we haven't even hit that financing cycle. It is  coming. What happens if we have to finance that at the higher interest  rates?   You start looking at some of this. Three months T-bill back in March  was 0.2. That was our Biden administration estimate for the 3-year. The  actual 3-year right now is 1.75.   Let's see, what is the difference between a 0.2 and a 1.75? Can  anyone say ``a whole lot''?   This may not mean much to you, but this is money your taxes are going  to be paying back.                                time  1615    Here is the punch line. I am going to make it really simple. What if  this inflationary cycle stuck with us? What if instead of that, what  was it, 1.78 or even the 2.3 percent interest rate on U.S. sovereign  debt, what if it were 2 points higher, just 2 percent higher?   Fifteen years ago, that is where we were at. Remember, we actually  had a reprieve, a completely fake economic reprieve for a decade with  artificially low interest rates. We were borrowing, and the Federal  Reserve kept interest rates lower, particularly since 2008. Now, we are  about to pay the cost of it.   What would happen if we paid that 2 percent higher? Functionally--and  my math is a little bit less--the end of 30 years, 100 percent of all  tax receipts, of all taxes, all tariffs, all everything that comes into  the government, 100 percent goes just to pay interest.   You have to understand how sensitive we are as a government, as a  society, as a country, how fragile we have made ourselves because we  structurally are going to borrow another $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion-- there is one estimate of $1.4 trillion--this year. We are never paying  off anything.   It gets worse and worse because of our demographics as we get older,  unless we crash the price of healthcare. Two weeks from now, we are  going to talk about things we can do to accomplish that.   Are you prepared to live in a country that if our mean interest rate  goes up 2 percent and stays there, all tax receipts go just to cover  our interest?  [[Page H8538]]  There is no more government. There is no more military. There are no  more benefits. There is no more Social Security. There is no more  Medicare.   That is why it is so crucial around here to have an honest  conversation where people put batteries in their calculators. Instead,  this place is living on theater. Oh, modern monetary policy--we can  spend all the money we want, and look, nothing happens. Oh, got it.  Didn't work.   I can show you right now the largest tax increase in modern history  has happened in the last year. If you live in my Phoenix-Scottsdale  area and are a working person, you are a hardworking taxpayer, and you  have not had a pay hike, do you realize you have lost 6 weeks, maybe  more, of your labor? We are still at 12.1 percent inflation in my  community. You have lost 6 weeks of your labor.   If I had walked in and told you that I was going to take a month and  a half of your salary, that that is going to be my new tax hike, you  would have lost your mind. But if we do it through this thing called  inflation, where we strip the affordability of your groceries and your  gasoline and everything else in your life, did you notice it? Well, you  know there is a problem. You know life has gotten much harder. You know  sometimes you get to the checkout stand and are taking things back  because the price just doesn't work on your budget.   The perverse thing, you are going to see a chart here, my next one,  where actually there is going to be this little drop in sort of the  debt-to-GDP and those things. That is because that inflation actually  has been a tax. We lowered the value of your income. We lowered the  value of your savings. At the same time, we lowered the value of all  this debt because we are going to pay it back with what we call  inflated dollars, which is wonderful up until the next year or 2 when  we have to refinance the debt and refinance the new spending at the  higher interest rates. Then that little benefit of taxing you through  inflation goes away, and we are off to the races, and it becomes hell.   Remember, this has brought down other countries for hundreds of  years, and it is right in front of us. No one seems to come behind  these microphones--they talk about it, educate about it, and for the  last couple years I have come here behind these microphones and tried  to show solutions, and then it drives the lobbyists out of their minds.   Let's take a look at this. Let's see if I can make this work. These  are deficits during the Biden administration fiscal year 2023 budget  baseline versus a 1 percent rise in interest. Do we all agree that we  have had at least a 1 percent rise in interest rates? Yes. Do you see  this one little bit of a fall right there? This orange is what happens  when you tack on the additional interest. That little fall is,  functionally, the fact that we devalued your dollar. That is our little  benefit from taxing you in a way you didn't know.   But then, boom. Functionally, the budget cycle we are about to work  on is the 2024 budget cycle. You are basically going to have a budget  deficit of $1.4 trillion, and then, boom, it is $1.5 trillion. You get  out a couple more years, you are heading toward $1.75 trillion. In less  than a decade, you are well over $2 trillion a year in just borrowing.  This chart explodes if we go beyond that 1 percent rise in interest  rates.   Structurally, even if I say we are going to go back to living in that  world of that fantasy artificially low interest rate, we are still  heading toward $2 trillion a year borrowing. It just takes 10 years.  This is insane.   Right in here, interest will be just the basic borrowing. All of  defense, a whole bunch of discretionary, and other things will all live  on borrowed money.   Most people have no idea what the concept of debt-to-GDP is. It is  the concept of: Here is the size of my economy, and, yes, we are  borrowing all this money, but look how big my economy is, and that  economy's ability to finance--just like your income finances your  credit cards. As long as your income keeps going up faster than the  debt on your credit cards, you can live. You are going to be okay. What  happens when your economy isn't growing, when your income isn't growing  as fast as you are borrowing on those credit cards? At a certain point,  it comes to an end.   We are heading toward a time where if we add--this is our baseline.  If we start adding a little bit of higher interest rates because we  have to finance the debt, we have to sell our bonds, the bond markets  are expecting higher interest rates because of inflation--you start  seeing the chart where you are hitting a world where at the end--now, I  know these are 30-year projections, but remember, we are selling 30- year bonds. The baseline number is 185 percent of debt-to-GDP. That  means the debt will be 85 percent bigger than the entire economy. If we  had 3 percent higher interest rates, the debt is, functionally, 245  percent bigger than the entire economy.    Do you think we ever get anywhere--because this is what we are doing  to ourselves. This is already baked in the cake if these interest rates  go up. But this down here, the base CBO assumption--remember, we are  already over 100 percent. Right now, our borrowing is already  substantially bigger than the entire size of our economy.   It is why growth is moral but is also necessary. If we don't start  growing this economy and we are continuing just the borrowing-- remember, what was the primary driver of our borrowing? Medicare and  Social Security. We got old. It is demographics. Getting old is not  Republican or Democrat; it is just who we are. That is driving most of  our borrowing. We are not adopting policies that maximize growth at  every opportunity.   We are destroying the future. I need my brothers and sisters on the  left to at least embrace some basic truths.   The very end of 2017, we did tax reform. Some people go, oh, it was  tax cuts, except the rich actually pay a higher percentage of Federal  income taxes today than they did under the old tax system. But, 2022,  tax receipts, the highest in U.S. history by far, and this is under the  new tax system. If you are going to demagogue us for doing tax reform,  trying to bring businesses back to the United States and get them to  domicile and manufacture and do things here in this country, you can at  least pull out a chart and show me where the revenues disappeared  because they didn't. They are right here.   We brought in $4.8 trillion in tax receipts last year, and we are  still borrowing $1.3 trillion. The spending has just exploded around  here, and now we hit our structural deficits because of our  demographics. It gets uglier and uglier, and we have made ourselves  incredibly fragile.   God forbid we ever have a failed bond auction or an undersubscribed  one, and interest rates start to spike. Do you understand what happens  to the entire world, let alone your savings?   We don't need to do this to ourselves. There are solutions, but this  body is incapable of having that debate.   Dear God, please, with a Republican majority, no matter how thin it  is, maybe we will actually try to do something honest and adult with  the calculators.   You keep looking at the charts, and there are charts out there. It is  not revenues. There is this whole line of thought out there that has  been worked on by the left and the right that we raise taxes, somehow  we stay within a certain mean of the size of the economy. When we have  lowered taxes, somehow the revenues come back up. Taxes always seem to  come in just right about here. If this is 20 percent of GDP, you raise  the taxes, the economy seems to shrink, the growth shrinks, we fall  back to the mean. You lower taxes, the economy grows, the revenues come  back. You have decades and decades of data. You look at the charts, and  it is pretty darn clear. We are going to take in 19.1 to 20 percent.  Sometimes we fall down to 18 percent of the economy in revenues, in  receipts, in taxes.   The art here is to design a tax code, design a regulatory code, adopt  embracing of technology and other things that maximize growth. The  ultimate solution is grow, grow, grow, and then adopt disruptive  technologies that lower prices, so affordability.   Imagine if you had a society once again that was growing, your wages  were going up, but inflation wasn't; where your healthcare costs were  actually going down; where your savings, your investments, your  planning for retirement, your ability to help your  [[Page H8539]]  kids go to college got better. We can do that. We did that in 2017,  2018, 2019, even the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. There  is a model to do it.   All that progress, all that closing income inequality, making the  poor less poor, the hardworking, tax-paying middle class, making them  more prosperous, it is all gone. The Democrats succeeded, in 18 months,  in crushing the people of this country by really crappy policy--great  virtue signaling, just incredibly good virtue signaling, really crappy  policy.   Once again, I need my brothers and sisters on the left to buy a  calculator and understand if you came in and said I am going to take  every dime, you make small businesses, rich people, high-income  earners, if I take every dime--if you make $500,000, the next dollar we  just take everything. You have heard this, oh, rich people aren't  paying enough, take every dime. You, functionally, don't get anywhere.   This is assuming that they continue to work as hard, that they make  the same amount of money so they don't change their behavior at all. It  is a math experiment, and you get about 5.1 percent of GDP in taxes.   The problem is our borrowing is already about to hit 6 percent, and  in a couple more decades, we are over 12 percent. It is a fantasy.   Look, the Republicans have their sin, too. We will often say, well,  waste and fraud, foreign aid, that is just almost a rounding error.  Remember a little while ago, $40,000-plus a second in borrowing?                                time  1630    The scale of the problems ahead of us is terrifying, and it is no  longer getting postponed to the future.   I have gotten in front of audiences, and, A, they will boo when you  try to explain to them the truth of the math. They say, Well, I was  told this 10 years ago.   Yes, but we had 10 years of artificially low interest rates that  allowed Congress to engage in really crappy policies.   What is that saying, ``the chickens are coming home to roost''? I am  not particularly good at colloquialisms. But it is time. It is here.   Will this new Congress with a divided government step up, tell the  public the truth, tell our new freshman class the truth, and actually  take on a really tough decision?   Madam Speaker, do you want a society and a country that is  prosperous, innovative, and disruptive but we are growing so fast and  so healthy that you can imagine a world where healthcare prices aren't  going up twice as fast as inflation, where your wages go up faster than  inflation, and where affordability when you go to the grocery store or  your gasoline station doesn't take your breath away?   We can do that. At least I think we can do it.   I just want to know: Are we going to have partners on the other side  to do what is honorable?   Because growth is moral.   Are we going to do the right thing for our society, for our brothers  and sisters out there, or are we going to continue with virtue  signaling?   Because virtue signaling may be brilliant politics, but it is really  crappy economics.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
