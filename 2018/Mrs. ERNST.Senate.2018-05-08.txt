 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the city  of Altoona, IA, which was founded 150 years ago.   Originally named because of its location as the highest point--or  altitude--on the Des Moines Valley Railroad, Altoona has continued to  reach for new heights since its plot was recorded in 1868. Altoona has  come a long way from its turn of the century, coal-mining identity.   Today Altoona is home to Iowa's premier entertainment destinations,  with seemingly unlimited potential ahead. While Altoona's numerous  regional attractions may define the landscape of the city, there is no  doubt it is the people of Altoona who define its fabric. Over the  years, Altoona's leadership has never forgotten its roots, and despite  world-class amenities and contiguous proximity to Iowa's capital and  largest city, Altoona continues to maintain that small town feeling  that Iowans know and love.   There is no better place in America to raise a family than Iowa, and  Altoona is a shining example of why. I invite my colleagues in the U.S.  Senate to join me in congratulating the city of Altoona on their  sesquicentennial, and I wish them another 150 prosperous years.                            ____________________
