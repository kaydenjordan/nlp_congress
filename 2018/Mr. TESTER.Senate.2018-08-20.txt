 Mr. President, Today I wish to honor the memory of  a Montana native who, through his faith and devotion to justice,  touched the lives of thousands.   Raymond G. Hunthausen was born in the mining town of Anaconda.   Over the next two decades, he developed a strong faith in God, a  devotion to humanity and peace, and a heart of compassion and advocacy.   He was ordained a priest for the diocese of Helena in 1946. He took  over as president of Carroll College at the age of 35, where he taught,  coached, and served as athletic director. In 1962, he was appointed  bishop of Helena by Pope John XXIII. He attended the Second Vatican  Council, which was convened by Pope John XXIII in the early 1960s to  reconcile church teachings and practices with the modern world. He  described the experience as transformative, and after, he set about  making his mark on the church and on society.   In 1975, Pope Paul VI appointed Father Hunthausen archbishop of  Seattle. Archbishop Hunthausen led reform efforts in the church. He led  protests against nuclear weapons stockpiling, let a group of gay  Catholics use a cathedral for mass, gave women leadership roles in the  parish far before it was common, and defended the use of birth control.  He wrote what is believed to be the first letter from an American  bishop calling for the church to value the gifts of women equally with  those of men.   He stood for peace and justice in all matters, even when it meant  risking condemnation from the church, and he advocated strongly for  conservation and human rights, all while remaining a humble servant of  his religion and his diocese.   Above all, Archbishop Hunthausen stood for those who couldn't stand  for themselves.   His legacy is one of peace and compassion and unrelenting devotion to  others. I stand here today to honor that legacy and to implore us all  to reflect on the lessons he had to offer during his remarkable  lifetime.                            ____________________
