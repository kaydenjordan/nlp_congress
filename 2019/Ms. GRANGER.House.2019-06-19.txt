 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3055.   Unfortunately, this appropriations bill and the bill that just passed  the House are written to an unrealistic top-line funding number, $176  billion above the current budget caps.   We still do not have a consensus on a budget agreement for fiscal  year 2020, which could lead to sequestration, resulting in devastating  cuts to our military.   Moving this second appropriations package today as is is another  wasted opportunity. The funding levels are far from what the President  has requested and will support. Total discretionary funding in this  bill is nearly 10 percent above the fiscal year 2019.   In addition, this package contains poison pill provisions that will  likely lead to a veto and another government shutdown.   The package jeopardizes our Nation's security. Some of the most  troubling provisions include: preventing funds from being used for the  border wall or barriers; limiting the President's ability to respond to  a national emergency; and allowing Guantanamo Bay detainees to be  transferred to the United States.   The bill allows taxpayer dollars to be used to provide lawyers for  migrants crossing the southern border and prohibits a question on  citizenship to be added to the 2020 Census.    If this bill is enacted, industry would be burdened by more  regulation. The bill allows the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  from livestock, as outlined in the Green New Deal; it supports the  listing of sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act, which would  impact energy and mineral development in 11 Western States; and it  includes three new regulations that would unfairly burden the trucking  industry.   The bill also prohibits the administration from setting reasonable  fuel efficiency standards, and the legislation attacks our Second  Amendment rights  [[Page H4798]]  by removing the longstanding firearms-related protections.   The bill also includes new language that was not voted on in  committee, which would provide backpay to certain Federal contractors  who were affected by the government shutdown. This comes with a high  price tag. CBO says it would cost $1 billion to implement this  provision. It is disappointing that this language is being slipped into  this package.   Perhaps, even more concerning is that we are considering this bill  before we address the crisis at the border. This situation is getting  worse by the day, and we must take action now.   I am encouraged to hear the Senate marked up a bipartisan bill in  committee this morning, and I hope we can move legislation through both  Chambers and get it signed by the President very soon.   The bottom line is the priorities reflected in this bill are  misguided. The bill spends too much money, and it contains partisan  policy issues that will not make it into law.                                time  1545    This package falls short of what our constituents and the American  people expect and deserve. I know that my colleague and friend,  Chairwoman Lowey, has worked very hard to get us to this point today  and that she and her subcommittee chairs included many priorities of  both Members on both sides of the aisle.   Unfortunately, on balance, these bills are partisan measures, and I  cannot support them in their current form.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass a commonsense  border security supplemental bill and a bipartisan budget agreement.  Then we can turn to the work we have to do to complete the fiscal year  2020 bills. We must give the President bills he will sign into law that  are at more reasonable funding levels and without controversial riders.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  package, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Carter).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I said before, these bills were written to an unrealistic top-line  funding number. We still do not have consensus on a budget agreement.   Moving this second appropriations package today as-is is another  wasted opportunity. The package irresponsibly increases spending,  jeopardizes our Nation's security, and burdens industry with more  regulations.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  package. I yield back the balance of my time.
