 Madam President, let me join the majority leader in best  wishes to our colleague Chris Van Hollen.   It came as a surprise this morning, but we are heartened by the news  that he is recovering, and we hope he will be back with us very, very  soon. He is a wonderful Senator, who is representing his State  effectively, and he is very close to Members on both sides of the  aisle. So we wish him and his family all the strength and recovery as  quickly as he can.                                 Gun Violence    Madam President, this was another weekend of bloodshed and loss in  America.   In Chicago, five people were shot dead, including a 16-year-old boy-- killed near ``The Bean,'' which those of us in Chicago know  automatically as that sight in Millennium Park where people race to  gather and take photographs. It is one of the most popular attractions  in our city, and just this last weekend, it was the scene of a murder,  with one teenager killing another.   In California yesterday, a gunman walked into a church and opened  fire, killing one person and critically wounding four others. That same  afternoon, another gunman opened fire at a flea market in Houston,  killing two and injuring three.   A weekend in America.   But both of these mass shootings happened less than 24 hours after a  White supremacist massacred innocent shoppers at a grocery store in  Buffalo, NY. The shooter was wearing tactical gear and carrying an AR- 15 assault rifle--a weapon designed to kill people. He shot 13 people,  11 of whom were Black, in an act of racist violence; 10 of the victims  died. Each of these 10 people had left home Saturday, maybe to grab  dinner or to buy groceries for the week, and they never returned. Now  their families are facing the unimaginable trauma of loss. In an  instant, they lost a grandparent, a child, a spouse.   To those families, I say: You do not grieve alone. America grieves  with you.   One of the victims was Aaron Salter. He was a retired police officer  who was working as a security guard at the grocery store when it was  attacked. Officer Aaron Salter was a hero. When the gunman entered the  store, Officer Salter didn't flinch; he leapt into action to save the  lives of the shoppers and employees, but there was only so much he  could do. He was armed with a handgun while the person who attacked the  store was wearing a tactical vest and firing an assault rifle. Like so  many of our police who risk their lives for us every day, Officer  Salter was outgunned.   As we mourn Officer Salter's loss this week, our Nation's Capital is  welcoming law enforcement from across the country for Police Week.   To every officer who protects our communities like Officer Salter did  so valiantly, we give our thanks.   No officers should ever find themselves in a situation where they are  outgunned by an assailant, but that is exactly what happened in Buffalo  this weekend, and it happens far too often in cities like Chicago.   For decades, this Senate has failed to pass legislation that would  close the gaping holes in our gun laws and reduce the shootings that  tear apart law enforcement families and families of all kinds across  the country. How many more lives will be lost before we act?  [[Page S2510]]    When will the Members of the Senate finally join together in  recognizing the role that White supremacy and White nationalism have  played in fueling these violent terrorist attacks?   Time and again, I have made my position on violent extremism as clear  as I can: The use of violence to advance political goals is always-- always--unacceptable. No matter the ideology, right or left, it is  wrong, but we need to be clear-eyed about the nature of the threat that  we face. Senior law enforcement and intelligence officials have warned  us on numerous occasions that the biggest terrorism threat in America  today is homegrown. It stems from White supremacists and violent  militia extremists.    I have been sounding this alarm for years. In 2012--2012--10 years  ago--I first held a hearing on domestic terrorism after a White  supremacist murdered seven Sikh worshippers in Oak Creek, WI. Today, a  decade later, the threat is even worse.   FBI Director Wray testified at the Judiciary Committee that the  threat of domestic terrorism is ``metastasizing across the country'';  and last year, the FBI reported that our Nation experienced the highest  level of hate crimes in over a decade. These attacks have targeted  Black Americans, who have long been the target of the majority of race- based hate crimes in America, but they are not limited to just our  Black American neighbors. They have also targeted Muslim Americans,  Japanese Americans, members of the AAPI community, and members of other  marginalized communities as well.   They don't happen in a vacuum, and it is clear that influential  figures on the right have been fanning the flames of hate. The gunman  who attacked the grocery store in Buffalo was an adherent of the great  replacement theory--a conspiracy theory that fuels White supremacy and  White nationalism. It is the same White supremacist conspiracy theory  that inspired those neo-Nazis to march through Charlottesville, VA,  chanting: ``Jews will not replace us.'' You will remember that group.  President Trump said at the time that he wasn't sure that they were out  of line. They have inspired multiple mass shootings, including the  attack of Jewish Americans at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, on  Hispanic Americans at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, and on Muslims at  two New Zealand mosques in 2019 as well.   This once-fringe conspiracy theory--this so-called great replacement  theory--has been dragged into the mainstream by media personalities  like FOX TV's Tucker Carlson. According to The New York Times, more  than 400 episodes--400 episodes--of Tucker Carlson's news program on  FOX TV, which attracts more viewers than any other show in the history  of cable news, have alluded to the great replacement theory. Tucker  Carlson is a leading ideologue in the White supremacist movement. He  has even introduced racist terminology into America's conversation,  like the phrase ``legacy Americans,'' which refers to the idea that  immigrants aren't real Americans. The phrase was first used on White  supremacist forums and websites. Tucker Carlson is right at home with  it.   But here is what is the most shocking to me: the number of elected  officials who will jump at any chance to get featured on Carlson's show  and echo his White supremacist blather--his dark gospel of fear and  hate and racism. We don't have to look far to find those elected  officials. The third-ranking House Republican claimed in a campaign ad  that Democratic immigration policies ``will overthrow our current  electorate.''   What will it finally take for the Republican Party to condemn this  hate once and for all, and what will it take for Members of the Senate  to join together in rooting out White supremacist violence?   As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will soon hold a  hearing on domestic terrorism, and the ideologies like the great  replacement conspiracy theory that inspired the acts of hate will be  expounded on at that hearing by experts.   We will also examine a piece of legislation that I introduced 5 years  ago, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which would strengthen  Federal efforts to prevent and address White supremacist violence and  other forms of domestic terrorism. This legislation is an opportunity  for the Members of the Senate to stand united against hate. By passing  it, along with commonsense gun safety measures, we can finally address  the scourge of hate and violence that has claimed far too many American  lives.   Many Americans will be tuned in this week to Tucker Carlson's show to  see if he has any reaction to what happened in Buffalo. Could it be  that, for one shining moment, he will finally realize his complicity in  what happened after 400 shows of spewing fear and hate and in  subscribing to this great replacement theory, resulting in hatred  across this country which is visited on communities every single day?   Ten people died in Buffalo. Will Tucker Carlson take 10 minutes to  say he is sorry for any role he might have played in that outcome?   We will see.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons),  the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Cortez Masto), the Senator from New Mexico  (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the  Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen), and the Senator from  Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.
