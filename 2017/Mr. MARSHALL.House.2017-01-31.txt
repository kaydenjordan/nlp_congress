 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 642, the  Fusion Center Enhancement Act.   I spent the last 2 years traveling across the State of Kansas, and  was reminded time and time again that national security is a top-three  issue for my residents.  [[Page H781]]    Why is this?   After years of turmoil and the lack of strong American leadership,  people in Kansas no longer feel safe.   This legislation that my colleague from Pennsylvania has introduced  will ensure that those on the front lines of protecting our Nation's  citizens have access to the critical information they need to evaluate  threats to protect our national security.   Fusion centers conduct analyses and facilitate information sharing,  which are necessary and fundamental actions that assist State and local  law enforcement in preventing and responding to crime and terrorism.   Just this last week I had the opportunity to go back to meet with  staff and visit the Kansas Threat Integration Center in Topeka, Kansas.  I can assure you the work they are doing is vital to our national  security and the citizens of my State. They are leveraging partnerships  with the private sector and focused on protecting our critical  infrastructure.   I encourages my colleagues to support H.R. 642.
