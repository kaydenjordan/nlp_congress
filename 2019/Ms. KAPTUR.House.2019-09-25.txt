 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the House Congressional  Ukrainian Caucus, I rise to provide some background on why the  conversations between President Donald Trump and the newly elected  President of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky, are so vitally  important to liberty and our Nation's national security.   There is no more important strategic alliance for liberty and with  our military than America's membership with European allies in NATO,  our dependable transatlantic allies who stood at our side through so  many battles for the values we share. The blood lands of Europe  directly influence the very founding of our Republic, our fundamental  ideals of democracy. NATO, today, stands ready every hour of every day  to defend our liberty.   Ukraine, today, is the scrimmage line for liberty for its defense on  the European Continent. Thus, when a U.S. President holds back military  assistance to Ukraine through NATO and other instrumentalities,  Congress must insist on transparency on any conversations that relate  to our cooperation with the nation of Ukraine.   Please let me remind, after the collapse of communist Russia in 1991,  officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Ukraine  became a free nation. At least it had a chance to be. Ukraine had been  occupied for all of modern history by Russia and began its jagged path  forward to the free world, a path that has been tortuous and fraught  with danger and setbacks.   It will be a permanent blot on American history that certain  Americans, including President Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort,  and several other Trump operatives were actually involved in supporting  the corrupt pro-Russian political operatives in Ukraine and doing it to  earn money, millions and millions of dollars from Kremlin allies. What  an abomination to liberty.   Since Ukraine's Euromaidan Revolution of Dignity 5 years ago, the  Ukrainian people have bravely demonstrated their resolute commitment to  their nation's democratic future.   The latest example is the recent historic Presidential and  parliamentary elections in Ukraine, which international observers  lauded as free and fair. What progress.   Ukraine has managed to make critical reforms, despite the immense  pressure of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in which 13,000 poorly  equipped Ukrainian troops and many civilians who were in the pathway  lost their lives; 30,000 have been injured; and 1.5 million Ukrainians  have been dispossessed of their properties and are displaced.   Tragically, Ukraine is at war and must fight a two-front war: one  against Russia and one against the enemy from within, the scourge of  corruption aided by Kremlin allies every minute of every day.   While Ukraine has sought to shake off the vestiges of Soviet  repression, Ukraine's oligarch class has subverted this progress in  order to steal and plunder from the people of that nation to advance  their own sick, insatiable, and corrupt moneyed interests.   In fact, it might surprise people to hear that, in the State of Ohio,  the Ukrainian oligarch who owned the television station that made the  current President of Ukraine famous is the largest commercial real  estate owner in Cleveland, Ohio. With a net worth of over $1.2 billion,  Ihor Kolomoisky is one of the richest oligarchs in Ukraine. But he  travels between Ukraine, Cyprus, Israel, and here. His own son was on  the basketball team at Cleveland State University.   But this oligarch ran the show, servant of the people, who propelled  President Zelensky to stardom. And so the question for history is: Will  President Zelensky be his own man, or will he be beholden to oligarchs?  Will he stand for liberty, and will the people of this country and this  House, who are the Representatives, stand for liberty against  repression?   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record material related to my remarks  this morning.                      [From Clevescene, June 11, 2019]  How Ukrainian Oligarchs Secretly Became the Largest Real Estate Owners                           in Downtown Cleveland                              (By Sam Allard)         In an explosive legal complaint filed last month in       Delaware, attorneys for a major Ukrainian bank alleged that       two oligarchs who founded the bank and controlled it from       2006 to 2016 laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in       fraudulent corporate loans to purchase assets in the United       States and unjustly enrich themselves and their associates.        Dubbed the ``Optima Schemes'' in the 104-page document,       these ``brazen fraudulent schemes'' were successful, among       other things, in making the oligarchs and their co-defendants       the largest commercial real estate holders in Cleveland.        With money siphoned from public bonds and 20 million       private Ukrainian citizens who'd opened accounts with       PrivatBank, the oligarchs Igor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy       Bogolyubov doled out corporate loans to shell companies that       they controlled. They used PrivatBank ``as their own personal       piggy bank,'' in the words of the complaint.        Those loans were then laundered in multiple digital       transactions, sent through dozens of other shell companies       that had been created exclusively for the purpose of       laundering. These accounts were managed by coconspirators at       PrivatBank's branch in Cyprus.        The true origin of the money thus concealed, funds were       then shipped to LLCs in Delaware (hence the legal filing       there). Those LLCs--``One Cleveland Center, LLC,'' to take       just one example--were used to acquire properties and       metalworking facilities in the U.S. Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov       are mineral magnates and own mining factories and       metalworking plants in Ukraine.        The men on the ground in the United States, according to       the complaint, were a Miami-based trio: Mordechai ``Motti''       Korf, his brother-in-law Chaim Schochet, and Uriel Laber.       These three men managed the ``Optima'' companies: Optima       International, Optima Ventures and Optima Acquisitions, all       of which were created and ultimately controlled by Kolomoisky       and Bogolyubov.        ``Optima Ventures'' should be a familiar local name. It was       the company, launched in 2007, used to acquire properties in       the U.S. for Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov. The majority of these       properties were in Cleveland.        Chaim Schochet was Optima's ``front man'' in Northeast       Ohio. He told the Plain Dealer in 2012 that his local goals       were twofold: ``making money for investors betting on the       upside of a Midwestern city, and contributing to the       betterment of a downtown that more high-profile buyers ha[d]       passed by.''        But his investors' funds were ill-gotten, according to the       complaint, proceeds from ``massive, systematic and fraudulent       loan misappropriation and recycling schemes. (In the 2012 PD       piece referenced above, Schochet was reportedly ``circumspect       about discussing how [Optima Ventures] is structured or who       the major investors are.'')        The loan recycling schemes were functionally identical to a       ponzi scheme, except instead of paying purported profits to       early investors with funds from more recent investors, the       Ukrainian oligarchs and their cronies within PrivatBank paid       off early fraudulent corporate loans with money from new       fraudulent corporate loans.        ``On paper, this appeared to be a repayment,'' the       complaint explains. ``But in reality, it was a sham and       fraud, as PrivatBank was repaying itself and increasing its       outstanding liabilities in the process. This process was       carried out over and over again, over a period of many       years.''        In December 2016, the Ukrainian state was forced to       nationalize PrivatBank as a result of the oligarchs' conduct.       The state injected more than $5.5 billion into the bank to       prevent its collapse, and ``preserve the stability of the       [Ukrainian] financial system.'' In 2018, the bank reverted to       private ownership.        The complaint alleges that Korf, Schochet and Laber were in       on the racket, aware of the systematic corruption because       they were under direct supervision from Kolomoisky and       Bogolyubov (or their trusted lieutenant inside PrivatBank,       Timur Novikov), and because they were enriched in the       process. Korf, Schochet and Laber received ``substantial       financial remuneration,'' according to the complaint, which       they used to acquire  [[Page H7911]]       millions of dollars worth of property in Florida.        Using the laundered loan proceeds, Optima acquired the       following Cleveland buildings:        One Cleveland Center: 1375 E. 9th St. Acquired for $86.3       million in May, 2008.        55 Public Square. Acquired for $34 million in July, 2008.        Huntington Building: 925 Euclid Ave. Acquired for $18.5       million in June, 2010.        AECOM/Penton Media Building: 1300 E. 9th St. Acquired for       $46.5 million in August, 2010.        Crowne Plaza Building: 777 St. Clair Ave. Acquired in a       joint venture with Denver-based Sage Hospitality Group.        Here's an example of exactly how the properties were       acquired, via the complaint:        On April 29 and 30, 2008 . . . two Ukrainian [metal plants]       owned or controlled by [Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov] drew down       $2.7 million and $4.3 million in loan proceeds from       PrivatBank Ukraine. The purpose of the loans was ``financing       of current business activities of the entity.'' On April 30,       2008, Bocatoro Enterprises Ltd. (``Bocatoro Enterprises''), a       Cypriot entity owned or controlled by [Kolomoisky and       Bogolyubov] drew down $40 million in loan proceeds from       PrivatBank Cyprus for ``replenishment of floating assets for       payments according to contracts, including purchase of       shares.''        However, the loan proceeds were not used for their stated       purposes. Instead, the loan proceeds were combined with funds       from other sources linked to [Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov] and       laundered in forty-two transactions through fifteen       Laundering Accounts, including the accounts of Defendant       Kolomoisky's Divot Enterprises, Ralkon Commercial, and       Pavanti Enterprises, as well as Defendant Bogolyubov's       Bonique, and [K&B's] Blisont Capital and Brotstone accounts.        On information and belief, [K&B] and their co-conspirators       used Pavanti Enterprises to misappropriate and transfer a       combined $36.1 million into the U.S. to the Multi-State Title       Agency Ltd. to fund the acquisition of One Cleveland [Center]       through Optima One Cleveland Center LLC for Optima Ventures.        At its height, Optima Ventures controlled 2.8 million       square feet of downtown Cleveland commercial real estate.       This was a larger footprint than even Forest City Enterprises       at the time.        In recent years, Optima has been selling off its Cleveland       properties, most of which have fallen into disrepair and       suffer from high vacancy rates.        The AECOM building, for example, which Optima acquired in       $46.5 million in 2010, was sold to New-Jersey based Rugy       Realty last summer for $38 million. When Optima bought AECOM       (the former Penton Media Building), it was 90-percent       occupied. But when Rugby purchased it last year, it had       dropped to only 57-percent occupancy and was in need of       significant renovations.        ``We'll fully renovate the lobby so it fits the 21st       century and doesn't look like the 1980s,'' Rugby principal       Robert Ades said at the time of purchase. Rugby's plans also       included updating the elevators, the mechanical components of       which reportedly dated back to 1972.        The Huntington Building (The 925 Building) was sold to       Frank Sinito's Millennia Companies last year for $40 million.       A full overhaul of the building was projected to cost $300       million. The property was characterized by the PD at the time       of sale as a ``gaping hole in the heart of a revitalizing       downtown.''        A situation of disrepair and vacancy can also be found at       55 Public Square, the only building other than One Cleveland       Center that remains in Optima's local ownership portfolio.        A sale was in the works with K&D development last year, but       K&D pulled out, calling the project ``unworkable.'' Though       Optima had purchased it for $34 million in 2008, it was       appraised for only about $20 million last year. The Plain       Dealer reported that the building was ``in dire need of a       makeover'' and that ``only a smattering'' of businesses       occupied the 2nd through 11th floors of the 22-story       structure. The John Q Steakhouse space on the ground floor       has been vacant for years.        Optima retains a management stake in what is now the       downtown Westin Hotel (formerly the Crowne Plaza) and owns       One Cleveland Center, which it refinanced in 2010. Optima       Management Group, the management company affiliated with       Optima Ventures, also works out of One Cleveland Center.        Scene spoke with a representative there by phone, who asked       that questions for Chaim Schochet about the so-called       ``Optima Schemes'' be submitted via email. Shochet provided       the following via Optima Management Group late Tuesday       afternoon:        The allegations in this lawsuit--part of an orchestrated       political attack by a Ukrainian bank against investors in our       thriving businesses--are false, defamatory and utterly       without merit. We intend not only to contest but to disprove       these reckless allegations, and to demonstrate that they are       part of a smear campaign driven by a Ukrainian political       agenda that we have nothing to do with. We are immensely       proud of our extensive track record building a vibrant real       estate portfolio in Cleveland, and we will not let a       frivolous lawsuit tarnish our hard-earned reputation or       distract us from our mission to continue to serve the       interests of the Cleveland community.        Filed on behalf of the current PrivatBank shareholders, the       Delaware complaint seeks damages which could include all of       Optima's U.S. assets. Those include properties in Dallas and       Louisville and metallurgical assets in addition to the       Cleveland portfolio. Among the metallurgical assets that       Optima Acquisitions acquired was a steelmaking plant in       Warren, Ohio, called Warren Steel Holdings LLC. Warren Steel       shuttered permanently in 2016 and laid off 162 workers due to       ``unforeseeable business circumstances.''        Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov are now back in Ukraine after       having fled from their residences in Switzerland to Israel in       2018. Both oligarchs reportedly have Ukrainian, Israeli and       Cypriot citizenship.        The Daily Beast reported in April that Kolomoisky is under       FBI investigation and that the U.S. Attorney's Office in the       Northern District of Ohio was involved in a wide-ranging       probe. Kolomoisky's lawyer said that his client       ``categorically denied'' laundering any money into the United       States.        Kolomoisky has reportedly returned to Ukraine, however,       with the tacit protection of new president Volodymyr       Zelenskiy, a comedian who played the Ukrainian President on       the TV show Servant of the People (now streaming on Netflix).        That show, immensely popular in Ukraine, aired on a network       owned by Kolomoisky.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is with grave concern for our country,  our longstanding Western security alliances, and liberty itself that I  rise today.   I have the distinct privilege of serving on the House Appropriations  Subcommittee on Defense and co-chair the Congressional Ukraine Caucus.   As the Congresswoman from a district with a strong Ukrainian heritage  and tens of thousands of citizens who understand what liberty demands,  I hold a unique perspective and, dare say, deep knowledge to speak on  the events of the past several days to provide some additional context  on why the conversation between President Donald Trump and the newly  elected President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is so distressing to  our national security.   The American public has looked on in horror as America's President,  President Trump, has willfully neglected his oath of office and sacred  duty to defend the best interests of our Nation in favor of his own  and, in effect, promote the interests of Russian dictator Vladimir  Putin.   This week, we learned of yet another instance in which our President  has put national security at risk in favor of advancing his own  personal, partisan, political objectives.   According to a highly redacted White House memo released this  morning, new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quoted as  saying he was ``ready to buy more U.S. antitank missiles to defend his  nation against Russia's invasion.''   And President Trump, without skipping a beat, responded: ``I would  like you to do us a favor, though.''   A favor to receive the funds that this Congress passed and  appropriated? A favor to disburse the funds already slated for Ukraine  until President Trump held them back to ask a favor?   That is illegal. It is unconstitutional. And it is dead wrong.   This exchange is not only a clear violation of the law; it is an  unprecedented abuse of power that undermines our national security,  violates our Constitution, and compromises the struggle for liberty on  the continent of Europe that includes America's most trusted allies  through instrumentalities like NATO.    Article I of the Constitution clearly states that all legislative  power shall be vested in the Congress of the United States and that  Congress holds the awesome power of the purse.   On July 18, President Trump purposefully directed his administration  to  [[Page H7984]]  withhold nearly $400 million in defense assistance for Ukraine from the  State and Defense Departments' budgets.   These funds were voted by Members of the House and Senate. And,  frankly, at one point this year, we did not know that the President was  holding the funds back. When we learned that he was, I joined my fellow  Ukraine Caucus co-chair, Congressman   Mike Quigley of Chicago, in  issuing a statement demanding that the money we had voted for be  released.   Members of Congress wrote the President letters and sent them to the  White House and were told by the administration that, well, you know,  it was ``an interagency delay'' that caused the funds not to be  released to a nation at war with Russia.   Russia invaded Ukraine, not the reverse. And the scrimmage line for  liberty on the continent of Europe now is at the Russian-Ukrainian  border, and our President delayed the release of those funds.   The President sought to make the release of national security funds  passed and appropriated by this Congress contingent on asking a new  foreign leader for a favor--a favor--prior to release of those funds.   Congress must compel the release of the full conversation that  occurred between President Trump and the new President of Ukraine,  Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as the full whistleblower complaint as was  originally submitted to the Office of Inspector General.   We do not have the full release. I will say more about that in a  moment.   The document we were provided today was not a complete transcript of  the conversation that our President had with President Zelensky. We  only got about 11 minutes of a conversation that lasted upwards of 30  minutes. Congress must demand the full transcript and hold the  executive branch officials in contempt if they refuse to give us the  full documents.   Like so many Americans, I am disgusted by President Trump's repeated  betrayal of American interests in favor of Vladimir Putin's.   This President's efforts to coerce Ukrainian President Zelensky, an  allied leader, into helping him win reelection by urging  congressionally supported military aid as leverage is not only a  dramatic betrayal of the President's constitutional duty; it is also  the latest example of Trump doing Putin's bidding.   I am certain that our President's relationship with Vladimir Putin  didn't start with his veiled support for Putin's election meddling or  inviting the Russians to hack the Democratic National Committee or even  lobbying, most recently, for Russia to be readmitted to the G7, our  most trusted allies, when Russia has invaded Ukraine, for heaven's  sake.   Who benefits when Ukraine loses military assistance? It is an easy  question. Russia, the country that is waging a bloody war in Ukraine  for over 5 years.   Who is to say Putin wasn't listening in when Trump blackmailed  Zelensky?   Madam Speaker, no Member of Congress has traveled to Ukraine as many  times as I, beginning long before I was in Congress and long before the  Berlin wall fell. I can say with confidence that Ukraine, today, is the  scrimmage line for liberty's defense on the continent of Europe. And  that is why President Trump's decision to withhold this money is so  troubling.   There is no more important strategic military alliance for liberty  than America's membership with European nations in NATO, the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization. Every minute of every day, NATO stands  united to defend against dictatorships and protect our liberties.   Russia has always hated this organization and will do anything to  disrupt the Western alliance, and she is hard and fast at work doing  that as we stand here this evening.   We know the battlefields of Europe directly influenced the founding  of our own Republic and our fundamental ideals of democracy. NATO  stands ready, as we stand here tonight, to defend our liberty. In  return, we keep our word--our word--for our NATO allies, a promise that  should never be contingent on a single President's political objectives  back home.   After the collapse of communist Russia in 1991, Ukraine became a free  nation. Ukraine had been occupied for all of its modern history but  began its jagged path forward to the free world, a path that has been  torturous and fraught with danger and setbacks and, yes, bloody murder.   To this day, there exists an insidious network of corrupt Ukrainian  and Russian oligarchs whose tentacles reach far across Ukraine and the  rest of the world, seeking to undermine the Western alliance while  protecting the selfish, corrupt financial looting that continues to  this day in that part of the world and, frankly, even reaching our  shores.   It will be a permanent blot on American history that certain  Americans, including President Trump's campaign manager and several  other Trump operatives, were actually involved in supporting these  oligarchs and the undemocratic forces that are trying to undermine the  Government of Ukraine every time they try to right themselves. And  these oligarchs steal and plunder billions of dollars with their  Kremlin allies.   Despite these setbacks, since Ukraine's Euromaidan Revolution of  Dignity 5 years ago, Ukrainian people have bravely demonstrated their  resolute commitment to their nation's democratic future.   The latest example is their historic Presidential and parliamentary  elections, which international observers lauded as free and fair.   Meanwhile, Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine has resulted in  more than 13,000 Ukrainian deaths, including civilians who have been  targeted by Russian missiles, 30,000 injured, and more than 2 million  displaced internally.   It is sad that Ukraine must fight a war on two fronts: a hot war  against Russia, for which she is completely underarmed, and one against  the enemy from within, the scourge of corruption, both perpetuated by  Russian influence.   In fact, when Boris Nemtsov, a brave Russian, was prepared to lead a  demonstration for Ukrainian independence, he was killed on the steps  near the Kremlin--how about that?--in Moscow.                                time  1930    That is how Russia plays.   Ukraine's new President, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his party in the  Rada won a significant majority because he promised, finally, to root  out this corruption.   While the ink is fresh on the Zelensky Presidency, we have high hopes  for him and his ability to live up to the expectations of his people.  It would be tragic if President Trump compromised him with his recent  missteps.   In order to make good on his promise to root out corruption,  President Zelensky must make clear his independence from every  oligarch. A prime example is his benefactor, the infamous Ukrainian  oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Kolomoisky serves as an example of corrupt  influence on Ukraine's fragile political system.   With a net worth of over $1.2 billion--and I am sure that is a  lowball number--Kolomoisky is one of the richest and most corrupt  oligarchs in Ukraine. He also owns the television channel that ran the  show ``Servant of the People'' that propelled Zelensky to stardom and  popular acclaim.   The question for history will be: Will Ukraine's new President be  able to rise to the highest aspirations of those who voted for him? Or  will he be mired in corruption at home and by entrapment by foreign  leaders like President Trump?   Kolomoisky, like other oligarchs, did not become rich due to their  acumen. Rather, they used lies, intimidation, cheating, stealing, money  laundering, and killing--yes, killing. These are their stock in trade.   Kolomoisky used his company, PrivatBank, as a personal piggy bank by  issuing endless loans to himself and, frankly, laundering billions of  dollars--billions of dollars--including in this country, mainly in real  estate.   In one instance, Kolomoisky hired hundreds of thugs--think about  this--with iron rods, rubber bullet pistols, chainsaws, and baseball  bats to raid a plant in order to take it over. He didn't buy it. He  stole it--surely, a macabre definition of a hostile takeover.   Due to Kolomoisky's corruption and looting of the PrivatBank, the  bank had lost $5.5 billion, putting Ukraine's  [[Page H7985]]  economy at risk. That is why the head of Ukraine's National Bank,  Valeria Gontareva, nationalized it. This was a critical step urged by  the United States, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund,  and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.   Now, Ms. Gontareva's life is under threat. She was hit by a car in  London, leaving her hospitalized. Her son's car was burned. Her house  in Kiev was burned down, her apartment raided by police.   Fear, crime, murder, and destruction are the paths of repressive  regimes. Freedom-lovers simply do not accept that way of life for  ourselves or for the future of Ukraine.   For these reasons, I have invited Valeria to come to Capitol Hill to  share her courageous story in the face of such brutal intimidation.   Corrupt oligarchs, with their ill-gotten gains, launder money to the  West, where they know our laws will keep their ill-gotten money safe.  How ironic it is that the Kremlin mouthpieces mock our values of  openness and our strong tradition of rule of law while Putin's cronies  safely store and invest their dirty money here.   I can tell you that, in our country, recent reports have noted that  Kolomoisky and his business partner, Gennadiy Bogolyubov, have funneled  vast funds through various Delaware-based shell companies into  properties and businesses around our Nation, even in my district of  Cleveland, Ohio, where Kolomoisky has become downtown Cleveland's  largest commercial real estate owner. How about that?   It is not just in my State. It is in Florida. It is across this  country. This is what is going on with the kind of corruption that  spreads across our world, and it is why we have to pay attention to  what is happening in Ukraine because, next to Ukraine, behind the Iron  Curtain of Russian leadership, they have a plan to disrupt the West,  certainly using every tool they have to disrupt the NATO alliance, but  even here in our country, trying to disrupt our way of life.   The newly reconstituted PrivatBank, which was taken over by the  nation of Ukraine, has brought forth a case on behalf of its  shareholders in Delaware against Kolomoisky. According to court  documents--and get this--Kolomoisky laundered $470 billion through a  Cyprus-based shell company between 2006 and 2016, potentially the  largest money laundering case in history.   It is now reported that the FBI is currently investigating these  international financial crimes. I fully support their investigation to  get to the bottom of these corrupt dealings across the world but,  certainly, in the region that I live.   The United States and our allies must send a message that such malign  behavior will not be tolerated. We cannot be complicit in empowering  foreign money laundering and the enrichment of corrupt oligarchs. We  cannot encourage the kind of complicity that the President inferred in  his remarks to President Zelensky in his recent conversation.   The United States and our allies can take steps to combat the illicit  flows of money that empower the oligarch economy of money laundering,  blackmail, murder, and extortion. Congress must enact beneficial  ownership transparency legislation to prevent malign actors from easily  opening shell companies here. We must continue to support investigative  journalism, not just in Ukraine, but here in order to maintain our own  liberty and remain the bastion of liberty for the free world.   President Zelensky and the newly elected Rada must now make good on  their campaign promises to serve the people of Ukraine, not the  oligarchs. Ukraine's new President must fully support the work of  anticorruption that has been promoted by even many Members of our own  Congress, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania,  who has worked so hard to establish that effort even prior to his  service here in the Congress.   Critical organizations to perform the tasks include the National  Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, the National Agency on Corruption  Prevention, as well as the Anti-Corruption Court. The judicial system  must be given true independence to root out corruption free from any  kind of outside political influence.    Madam Speaker, the Ukrainian people have our full support in their  efforts to shake off the rapacious grip of corrupt oligarchs supported  by Russia.   Democracy shines in the sunlight, and we want that sunlight to shine  here. Any conversation between our President and the new President of  Ukraine that can reveal any attempt to threaten security of our  longstanding allied relationships and continue to threaten liberty  demands the undivided attention of this Congress.   I reiterate my call for transparency, accountability, and strong,  unencumbered congressional investigations.   If President Trump and his administration fail to comply with  legitimate congressional inquiries, then there is no other option than  for this House to stand with our American allies and move forward with  impeachment.   We appreciate those who work late into the evening this night to make  sure that these words get placed in the Record.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following material:    Kaptur Press Release on Whistleblower Complaint, September 20, 2019         Washington.--Today, Co-Chair of the Congressional Ukraine       Caucus Representatives Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), released the       following statement after reports of a whistleblower       complaint filed by a member of the Intelligence Community,       which is being withheld from Congress in violation of federal       law, is said to involve Ukraine:        ``Today. press reports indicate that a U.S. intelligence       officers whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump's       possible breach of national security may involve the nation       of Ukraine.'' said Rep. Kaptur. As co-chair of the bipartisan       Congressional Ukraine Caucus. I fully support the efforts by       Chairman Adam Schiff and the House Permanent Select Committee       on Intelligence to seek a detailed accounting of the       complaint and transcript of the incident(s), and call upon       the Speaker and Minority Leader to take all courses of action       for appropriate Congressional oversight to obtain the       relevant documents and necessary testimony to establish       confirmation of fact and circumstance.''        ``Following Ukraine's historic elections and continued       democratic struggles, the Ukrainian people deserve our full       support. We must know to what extent the President and his       lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. are using the weight of U.S. foreign       policy, including holding critical security assistance, to       advance their own narrow personal interests.''        ``The American people deserve a government free of malign       foreign influence. The American people deserve to know the       full truth.''                                   ____    Kaptur/Quigley Press Release To Condemn President Trump's Attempt To         Slow Roll Critical Assistance to Ukraine, August 30, 2019         Washington.--Today, Co-Chairs of the Congressional Ukraine       Caucus Representatives Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and Mike Quigley       (D-IL) released the following statement condemning President       Trump's attempts to slow-roll $250 million in congressionally       appropriated military aid for Ukraine, known as the Ukraine       Security Assistance Initiative.        ``President Trump's decision to slow-walk this       congressionally appropriated military funding for Ukraine is       disturbing and demonstrates once again his affinity for       Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin.'' the       representatives said in a joint statement. ``This funding is       vital to preserving democracy in Ukraine and Eastern Europe       and must not be delayed or hindered in any way.''        ``With Russia's unprovoked, unwarranted and murderous       invasion of Ukraine and with over 10,000 innocent Ukrainians       now having been killed, the President of the United States       should not be a defender of Russian interests. President       Trump has repeatedly berated our closest allies in the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization. lifted sanctions on Russian       oligarchs. and advocated for Russia being allowed back in the       G7.''        ``The President of the United States should be a champion       for liberty, not a pawn for dictators. This funding cannot be       delayed.''                    Memorandum of Telephone Conversation       Subject: Telephone Conversation with President Zelenskyy of           Ukraine.      Participants: President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Notetakers: The           White House Situation Room.      Date, time and place: July 25, 2019, 9:03-9:33 a.m. EDT           Residence.        The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all       watched from the United States and you did a terrific job.       The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much       of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a       fantastic achievement. Congratulations.        President Zelenskyy: You are absolutely right Mr.       President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We       worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an       opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your       skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example       for our elections  [[Page H7986]]       and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were       in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique       success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time,       you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential       election, and the second time you are now calling me when my       party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run       more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over       the phone more often.        The President: [laughter] That's a very good idea. I think       your country is very happy about that.        President Zelenskyy: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we       are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp       here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not       the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we       want to have a new format and a new type of government. You       are a great teacher for us and in that.        The President: Well it's very nice of you to say that. I       will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of       effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European       countries are doing and they should be helping you more than       they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is       talk and I think it's something that you should really ask       them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks       Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything. A lot of the European       countries are the same way so I think it's something you want       to look at but the United States has been very very good to       Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily       because things are happening that are not good but the United       States has been very very good to Ukraine.        President Zelenskyy: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only       100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I       did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met       and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not       doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues       with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions.       They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.       It turns out that even though logically, the European Union       should be our biggest partner but technically the United       States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and       I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States       is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European       Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against       the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for       your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to       continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are       almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for       defense purposes.        The President: I would like you to do us a favor though       because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows       a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened       with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike       . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people. . . The       server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things       that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding       yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have       the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like       you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that       whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man       named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they       say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do,       it's very important that you do it if that's possible.        President Zelenskyy: Yes it is very important for me and       everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a       President, it is very important and we are open for any       future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on       cooperation in relations between the United States and       Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador       from United States and he will be replaced by a very       competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard       on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I       would also like and hope to see him having your trust and       your confidence and have personal relations with you so we       can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that       one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently       and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to       travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.       I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody       but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround       myself with the best and most experienced people. I also       wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends       and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can       continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround       myself with great people and in addition to that       investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that       all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That       I can assure you.        The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor       who was very good and he was shut down and that's really       unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they       shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad       people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He       was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would       like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with       the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's       happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak       to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the       United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she       was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just       want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot       of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the       prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about       that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General       would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped       the prosecution so if you can look into it . . . It sounds       horrible to me.        President Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell you about the       prosecutor. First of all I understand and I'm knowledgeable       about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority       in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100%       my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the       parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September.       He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the       company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the       investigation of the case is actually the issue of making       sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and       will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I       would kindly ask you if you have any additional information       that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the       investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our       country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States       from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It       was great that you were the first one who told me that she       was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her       attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the       previous President and she was on his side. She would not       accept me as a new President well enough.        The President: Well, she's going to go through some things.       I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going       to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the       bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the       prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair       prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is       going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of       assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends,       they're incredible people.        President Zelenskyy: I would like to tell you that I also       have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United       States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I       stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the       Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again       in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation       to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On       the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be       very serious about the case and will work on the       investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for       our two countries and one of the issues that is very       important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we       can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence       with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We       are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future       meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to       discuss these opportunities and get to know each other       better. I would like to thank you very much for your support        The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I       appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr       to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the       White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work       that out. I look forward to seeing you.        President Zelenskyy: Thank you very much. I would be very       happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally       and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our       meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine       and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We       have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the       other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in       Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it       might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We       can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take       your plane, which is probably much better than mine.        The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward       to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I       think we are going to be there at that time.        President Zelenskyy: Thank you very much Mr. President.        The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've       none. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so       much of an upset but congratulations.        President Zelenskyy: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 38 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, September 26, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
