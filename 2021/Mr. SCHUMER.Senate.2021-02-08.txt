 Mr. President pro tempore, I ask unanimous consent that  the order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the Senate is steadily confirming members  of President Biden's Cabinet and other key administration officials. In  a few hours, we will add one more to the list when the Senate confirms  Denis McDonough to serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.   Under President Obama, Mr. McDonough was a member of the National  Security Council and the White House Chief of Staff. He was a regular  face at Walter Reed and a frequent visitor of our troops deployed  abroad.   The VA has one of the most sacred missions of all our Agencies,  deriving its motto from President Lincoln's second inaugural address:         To care for those who shall have borne the battle.    But the task of achieving that mission is one of organization,  institutional know-how, and administrative troubleshooting. I am  confident that Mr. McDonough's decades of experience at the highest  levels of government make him well qualified to take on the job.   Even as Senators prepare this week to sit as a Court of Impeachment,  the Senate will continue its work on other responsibilities. Committees  will continue to process nominations, including the nominees to lead  the EPA, Department of Commerce, Department of Labor, and the Office of  Management and Budget. At the same time, committees will continue the  pressing work of addressing the COVID crisis.  [[Page S563]]    Last week, in the early hours of Friday morning, the Senate passed a  budget resolution that will pave the way for President Biden's American  Rescue Plan. As promised, the Senate held an open, bipartisan, and  vigorous amendment process. Several bipartisan amendments passed with  overwhelming majorities and were added to the resolution. The fact that  the debate went all night and only concluded at around 5:30 in the  morning is a testament to the vigor of the amendment process, which,  again, I note, was bipartisan. The first amendment, in fact--a very  important one by the Senator from Arizona, Ms. Sinema, and the Senator  from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker--helped our restaurant industry, and it  was bipartisan.   Now, our Senate committees have instructions to begin crafting  legislation to rescue our country from COVID-19; to speed vaccination  distribution; provide a lifeline to small businesses; help schools  reopen safely; save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and other  public employees; and support every American who is struggling to put  food on the table and keep a roof over their heads.   This important, historic work will give hundreds of millions of  Americans the relief they need while getting our country back to normal  as quickly as possible.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 14, Kathleen Holland Hicks, of Virginia, to be  Deputy Secretary of Defense.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or  [[Page S588]]  debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following resolutions that  were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 38, S. Res. 39, S. Res. 40, and  S. Res. 41.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to en bloc and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 1 p.m., Tuesday,  February 9; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion  of morning business, the Senate resume the impeachment trial of former  President Donald John Trump.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:15 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, February 9, 2021, at 1 p.m.                            ____________________
