 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Wyoming Shrine Bowl. This postseason high school  football game showcases the top Wyoming high school athletes and  coaches. The annual event supports and enriches patient care at  Shriners Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT.   In 1973, football Coaches Jerry Overton, from Kelly Walsh High  School, and Denny Brown, from Byron High School, started organizing an  all-star football game. The challenging search for a sponsor ended with  an agreement from Shrine Temples in Sheridan and Rawlins to sponsor the  annual game. This partnership created the Shrine Bowl of Wyoming, Inc.,  a nonprofit organization. The first Wyoming Shrine Bowl was played in  1974. It was an all-star football game for Wyoming high school seniors  led by Wyoming all-star coaches.   Since the Shrine Bowl's beginning, the organization has raised over  $1,000,000 for the Shriners Children's Hospital. Thousands of Wyoming  residents are now familiar with the Shrine Bowl's purpose and motto::  ``STRONG LEGS RUN SO WEAK LEGS MAY WALK.'' In 2022, the Shriners  Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City treated 400 Wyoming children.   A cornerstone of the Shrine Bowl is a visit by the coaches and  players to this great hospital. The week prior to the event,  participants and learn about the lives of these children who are  benefiting from their charitable football game. On June 10th, 2023, at  the Kelly Walsh High School in Casper, the all-star north and south  teams will face off in the 50th Annual Wyoming Shrine  [[Page S1702]]  Bowl. Both the athletes and the coaches demonstrate incredible  selflessness by dedicating their time and skill for the patients at  Shriners Children's Hospitals.   Along with the players and coaches, the dedication of the officers  and volunteers to the mission of the game is incredible.
