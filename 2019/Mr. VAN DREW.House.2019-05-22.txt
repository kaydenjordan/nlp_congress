 Madam Speaker, right now, we face a health crisis.   Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease and the most  common form of dementia; 5.8 million Americans have this disease. One  in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's. It is the sixth leading cause  of death in the United States of America, and it kills more than breast  cancer and prostate cancer combined.   Nancy Reagan called the illness ``a truly long, long good-bye.''   There are organizations and people working tirelessly on the research  being done to fight and prevent these statistics from increasing, but  they face three major roadblocks: soaring prevalence, lack of effective  treatment, and enormous costs.   The United States and the world face this crisis, and we must  continue to support the funding of research for this incredibly  devastating disease.   Someday, we will win. Someday, there will be a cure.                            ____________________
