 Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I want to  associate myself with the remarks of my distinguished Senator from New  Jersey. I thank him also for the cooperation he has shown in getting us  a little further down the road on the Saudi Arabia bill.   The issues regarding this longtime ally of the United States are  troubling. I don't think there is anyone on this floor who is adverse  to the idea that action needs to be taken. Obviously, the relationship  is not the same as it has been for a long time. Having said that, on a  transactional basis, there are a number of things we are allied with  Saudi Arabia on.   Also, having said that, some of the things that have happened cannot  go unnoticed. There are certainly going to have to be repercussions,  and we have been negotiating with all parties, including my staff and  the staff of the ranking member, together with the State Department and  with the White House. I think we are very close to having a bill that  could actually pass the Senate, pass the House, and be signed into law  by the President. I think this is a real step forward; I think it is  progress on this issue; and I think the structure we have put together  is in the best interests of all parties.   So I agree with my friend from New Jersey.   I yield the floor.
