 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a man who has  honorably served our Nation with integrity, distinction, and humility.  After more than 30 years of service to our great Nation, Command Master  Chief Russell Mason, whom I am honored to call both a constituent and a  friend, is retiring from the United States Navy.   Having enlisted in the Navy in 1984, Master Chief Mason has been  stationed everywhere from Pearl Harbor to Washington, D.C., and his  tours have brought him all around the world. He has served on multiple  ships, including as chief of the boat, and has completed several tours  as command master chief. In 2017, Master Chief Mason assumed duties as  the command master chief for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command 5th  Fleet.   As a man of strong faith, he has earned the respect and admiration of  many and has forever left a legacy of servant leadership and devotion.   Master Chief, God bless you. Our Nation is forever indebted to you  and your wife, Charlotte. And Russ, thank you for your years of  dedication and service to our country, the United States. You have  completed your mission admirably, and I have no doubt that you will  soon be enjoying retirement with us back in west Michigan.                            ____________________
