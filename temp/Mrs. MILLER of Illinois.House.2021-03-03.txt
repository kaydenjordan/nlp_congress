 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1,  what should be named the for the politicians act. There is nothing in  this bill that is for the people.   I could spend hours highlighting the damaging aspects of this bill,  but let's start with eliminating voter ID. Americans need an ID to  drive, to get married, to get on an airplane, even to buy cold  medicine, but to take part in the foundational component of our  Republic? Apparently, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  think eliminating any proof of who you are is for the people. It is  not. It is for the politicians.   Then we have taxpayer-funded campaigns. H.R. 1 would implement a 6- to-1 match for small-donor contributions up to $200 in a congressional  or Presidential campaign. The people of Illinois' 15th District  shouldn't be forced to fund the campaigns of people they vehemently  disagree with.   The November election made it readily apparent that our election  system needs fixing. This bill just puts the fix in future elections.                            ____________________
