 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, 44 years ago, the Supreme Court issued its landmark Roe  v. Wade decision. It reaffirmed the constitutionally protected right of  every woman to safe and legal healthcare, including the right to  choose.   When life puts a woman in even the toughest of circumstances, the  highest court in the land said the decision that she makes should be  hers, free from any interference from the government.   Roe v. Wade is a firewall that women rely on, but with every passing  year and every new session of Congress, politicians have tried to chip  away at it brick by brick, hoping it will crumble away.   Most politicians are not medical professionals. We shouldn't be  meddling in healthcare decisions that should be made between a woman,  her doctor, her family, and anyone else that she chooses to include.  The American people are tired of politicians who are not doctors, often  playing one on television with this medical decision.   This is the only medical procedure that Congress has made an attempt  to regulate, the only one, and it says quite plainly: We can't trust  women to make a decision; we have to do it for them. The majority tries  to direct this over and over again.   The medical professionals whom we should be listening to all oppose  this ban. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists call  it a part of a legislative agenda that is ``not based on sound  science'' and that ``attempt to prescribe how physicians should care  for their patients.''   That certainly speaks it loudly.   The American Medical Association said that it ``strongly condemns any  interference by the government or other third parties that causes a  physician to compromise his or her medical judgment as to what  information or treatment is in the best interest of the patient.''   Conservative political groups have also been pushing the bill to try  to use it to run up the score in the next election. Why do they do it?  Well, the main sponsor of this bill has admitted--and I hope everybody  hears this; this is a Congressman from Arizona who sponsors this bill,  who admitted the abortion bans are, in his words, good politics--``it  will cost some people the election, but it will cost more Democrats the  election than it will Republicans. I am convinced that in very few  districts in America someone will lose because they voted'' for this  ban. ``And if that is the case, maybe they need a different district  anyway,'' whatever that means.    That makes it as plain as day, as far as I am concerned, as to why,  year after year, for 40 years, we have been confronted with this.   It is abhorrent to me, and it should be to everyone here, that  matters of personal conscience are being reduced to who is up and who  is down in the polls.   This bill is dangerous, and it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court  established in Roe v. Wade, and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v.  Casey, that a woman has the unequivocal right to choose abortion care.  This is the Constitution of the United States that we all justly  revere.   Meanwhile, every Federal court that has reached a decision on bans  like this in States has blocked it every time. This includes rulings  striking down bans in States like Arizona, Idaho, Arkansas, North  Dakota.   Mr. Speaker, this bill before us is nothing more than the latest  attempt by the majority to pass off political posturing as proven  science.   Now, after birth, strangely, this body exhibits scarce attention to  the well-being of the child, and that is proven by the fact that you  cut back on food stamps; Women, Infants, and Children care; daycare;  Head Start; one after the other, the same group that couldn't find it  in their hearts last Friday to extend the Children's Health Insurance  Program before it expired, along with community health services, which  again helps children. More than 9 million children in America get their  health insurance through the program that expired.   The majority did absolutely nothing after 20 children, 6-year-olds  and 7-year-olds, were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, 5 years ago. And funding, as I said, for both  food stamps and the school lunch program is routinely cut.   I don't know anything else to call that but pure hypocrisy: We love  it until it is born, and then it is somebody else's problem.  [[Page H7688]]    A 3-year-old girl in my district was recently killed by the adults  she believed were supposed to take care of her. They abused her so  violently that she was bruised from head to toe and was internally  hurt. There were adults around, but not a single one helped her.   The Child Protective Services of Monroe County got two reports about  abuse and neglect, but the agency was too overworked and stretched too  thin to act in time, which is another hypocrisy: We are not going to  fund those programs enough so that little children would live. Three  years old, and nobody lifted a finger to help this child. They did  nothing to save her life.   This is just some of the reality that children face today. All too  often, this Congress does absolutely nothing to address it. To truly  care about children is to care for them long after they are born.   Now, we have taken up this bill before, and it was a one-house bill,  never able to pass the Senate, and I sincerely hope this bill sees that  same fate.   When the American people went to the ballot box, they were electing  politicians, not somebody to meddle around with their medical needs. It  is simply appalling. Just remind yourself that the only procedure that  we deal with is the fact of a woman's right to choose, which is  protected by the Constitution of the United States. Enough already.   Mr. Speaker, the majority acts like a group of elected physicians. It  has some. They are quiet. It is shameful.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Kerri from New Jersey. This is her  story.   With the help of a fertility specialist, Kerri and her husband were  thrilled to be expecting their first baby in January of 2016. All of  Kerri's tests and scans were looking great until the 20-week  ultrasound.   Kerri recounts: Our ultrasound tech spent a lot of time looking at  her heart, and, finally, the doctor from maternal fetal medicine came  in.   As she scanned, she told Kerri and her husband that there were some  severe brain and heart abnormalities. The doctor also told them the  chest cavity was small and that the lungs were not developing properly.  A few days later, a geneticist told Kerri and her husband that the baby  had three copies of every chromosome, a very rare condition. The doctor  informed them that infants born with this condition very rarely survive  more than a few days after delivery.   According to Kerri: We both calmly made the decision to have an  abortion. We did not want our little girl to suffer. We would much  rather take on that suffering for her.   On behalf of Kerri, New Jerseyans, and women everywhere, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and vote ``no'' on H.R. 36.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  speak for April and against this unconstitutional underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, her story is about one of the most complex and painful  decisions a woman can face, but it would have been even more painful if  this bill that we are debating, which is opposed by the American  Medical Association, was the law at the time.   Eighteen weeks into her pregnancy, she and her husband discovered  that their baby had a birth defect, a lethal skeletal dysplasia, and  was incompatible with life. The baby would never be able to breathe on  its own. The baby would either die in utero or die immediately at  birth. She was heartbroken. She went to other doctors for more tests.  These tests took additional weeks. Tragically, the tests confirmed the  diagnosis.    At 21 weeks, April had an abortion. With this bill, the Federal  Government would compel every woman like April against their will to  carry to term a fetus that they knew would either be stillborn or would  suffer and die at birth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this underlying bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind all Members to heed  the gavel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mr. Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mr. Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Dr.  Jennifer and her patients. This is their story.  [[Page H7690]]    Dr. Jennifer's patients come from my home State of California. They  were a married couple on their second pregnancy. They were so excited  to grow their family. But they discovered, at 22 weeks, that the fetus  was severely growth-restricted, had no fluid around it, had a cardiac  anomaly, and would not survive the pregnancy. Although this was a  wanted pregnancy, they chose to terminate the pregnancy at 23 weeks  rather than prolong the suffering of the mother and her fetus.   Dr. Jennifer wants lawmakers to know that abortion restrictions would  have forced her patient to carry this pregnancy until the fetus died in  the womb, despite the medical advice that their baby would not survive  to term. H.R. 36 and policies like it deny families their  constitutional right to a choice about how they want to move forward  with medical decisions that impact their bodies and their families.   On behalf of Dr. Jennifer and her patients, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on H.R. 36. We must stop these bans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what my colleague is saying, but there is  no scientific evidence or proof that an unborn fetus feels the pain.  That is one of the reasons we are not discussing it over here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), a doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, which deals with children as  well. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of  young people, children, who are Americans in every way except on paper.  [[Page H7692]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the majority keeps trying to take the women's personal  decision and put it in someone else's hands. Over the years, they have  tried to allow bosses to make the healthcare decisions for their  employees. They pushed a bill that would allow women to die if an  emergency room employee coming to her aid had a ``conscientious  objection'' to performing an abortion that would save her life.   Today, they are trying to pass an abortion ban that would put up even  more obstacles and prevent women from receiving safe and legal  abortion, which is protected by the Constitution.   The bill before us today strikes at the heart of Roe v. Wade.  Opponents of the Supreme Court decision have been clear and outspoken  that that is precisely their goal. The ban on abortions after 20 weeks  does not contain reasonable exceptions for victims of rape and incest.  The legislation flies in the face of what the American people--women  and men--want us to be doing.   The majority must have quickly forgotten the national Women's March  that took place in January. Millions of persons across the country and  around the globe marched in the largest day of protest in our Nation's  history. More than half a million people took to the streets right here  in the Nation's Capital. They sent a message to the majority to respect  their rights, including their right to choose.   If people sometimes ask women why we are still marching and calling  and writing about the four decades after the Supreme Court's Roe v.  Wade decision, which it has since upheld, it is because of bills like  this. We constantly have to refight the battles our mothers and  grandmothers won for us. This legislation, again, is proof of that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question to the  rule and the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption.
