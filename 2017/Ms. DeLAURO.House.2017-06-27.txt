 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and so I missed  rollcall vote No. 325 regarding ``On Ordering the Previous Question''  (H. Res. 382). Had I been present, I would have voted ``no.''   I missed rollcall vote No. 326 regarding ``Providing for  consideration of H.R. 1215'' (H. Res. 382). Had I been present, I would  have voted ``no.''   I missed rollcall vote No. 327 ``On Approving the Journal.'' Had I  been present, I would have voted ``no.''                            ____________________
