 Madam President, I want to take a few moments to discuss  an issue, one that is on everybody's mind; that is, the status of  ObamaCare. Congress has taken the first step to repeal ObamaCare. I was  in the House of Representatives when ObamaCare was passed into law. I  opposed the law five times while I was in the House before it was  passed with zero bipartisan, zero Republican support and was signed  into law by the President.   I opposed ObamaCare because I feared that this law would increase  costs, make it harder for patients to see a doctor, increase taxes on  the middle class, increase taxes on seniors, and hurt the economy.   Over the last 7 years, all of these fears have become a reality. A  new Congress and a new administration have heard the people's response  loud and clear, and that response is that we must repeal ObamaCare.  Repealing ObamaCare means repealing all of the taxes that go with it-- not part of them, not some of them, but all of them.   ObamaCare increased taxes on hard-working Americans by $1.1 trillion.  Higher taxes lead to more money being taken out of the pockets of hard- working families. Health care costs have increased to a degree where I  have heard from Nevadans across the State, of all ages and backgrounds,  all with similar concerns.   What I wish to do is take a moment to read an email that I received  just last week from a 13-year-old boy who lives in Las Vegas. He said:         I wanted to write an email to express my concerns about       Obamacare and hopefully persuade you in making a change.        My family used to have health insurance until ObamaCare       kicked in and forced my family to drop our insurance since it       tripled the cost and wasn't affordable. We are getting       penalized now for not having insurance.    Think about that. ObamaCare kicked their family off their insurance  by tripling the costs, making it unaffordable, and then ObamaCare  penalized that family for not having insurance.   Going back to the young boy, he said:         Since then we have had medical bills piling up. This is an       issue with a lot of people and I don't know a lot about       policies but I do know that something needs to change for the       good of the people.        I've heard President Donald Trump will be addressing this       issue. I just hope you will represent Nevada in favor of       getting rid of ObamaCare.    I can assure my constituents back home in Nevada, and especially this  young man who is advocating for his family, that I am committed to  repealing ObamaCare. This young man's parents had employer-sponsored  health care coverage that took care of their family when they needed  medical care. And as a result of ObamaCare, the costs were too high to  afford the health insurance they had.   One of the biggest drivers of cost increases on the middle class is  the 40-percent excise tax on employee health benefits, better known as  the Cadillac tax. In Nevada, 1.3 million workers who have employer- sponsored health insurance plans will be hit by this Cadillac tax.  These are public employees in Carson City. These are service industry  workers on the Strip in Las Vegas. These are small business owners and  retirees across the State.    We are talking about reduced benefits, increased premiums, and higher  deductibles. When I first started working on this issue, I knew the  devastating impact this tax would have on Nevadans, but also in order  to get anything done, we needed a bipartisan effort to reduce this tax  and to eliminate it.   I recruited a good friend by the name of Senator Martin Heinrich from  New  [[Page S922]]  Mexico, and together we were able to gain huge support on both sides of  the aisle. During the highly partisan reconciliation debate in 2015,  where Congress successfully delivered an ObamaCare repeal bill to  President Obama's desk, Senator Heinrich and I pushed our colleagues to  include our legislation to fully repeal the Cadillac tax as an  amendment.   Our amendment passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote  of 90 to 10. With this nearly unanimous vote, we were are able to delay  the Cadillac tax until 2020.   This Congress, Senator Heinrich and I have reintroduced Senate bill  58, the Middle Class Health Benefits Repeal Tax Act, which fully  repeals this bad tax. I hope that my Senate colleagues on the other  side of the aisle will join Senator Heinrich on this bipartisan piece  of legislation and on this issue to support our bill and get rid of  this Cadillac tax once and for all.   I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have a  lot of differing opinions on the Affordable Care Act, but one thing we  can agree on is that the Cadillac tax should be fully repealed.   Now that we have passed an ObamaCare repeal resolution, we will move  to the next phase of the repeal process. The budget we just passed  included reconciliation instructions for the Senate Finance Committee  and the HELP Committee to repeal ObamaCare.   We made a promise to repeal ObamaCare, and now it is time to keep  that promise. This includes my legislation to fully repeal the Cadillac  tax. The goal of health reform should be to lower costs for those who  already have health benefits and to expand access to those who do not  currently have coverage. ObamaCare did not achieve either of those two  goals.   I am committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to high- quality, affordable health care. We must start by repealing the  Cadillac tax.   I thank Senator Heinrich for his continued leadership on this issue.  I want to thank him, and I want to say that Senator Heinrich continues  to put his constituents above politics. I know that he shares my  commitment to repeal this bad tax.   I also want to thank Congressman Kelly and Congressman Courtney for  their leadership on the House side. I know that we are all eager to  work together to get this bill to the finish line.   Madam President, I yield to the senior Senator from Texas.
