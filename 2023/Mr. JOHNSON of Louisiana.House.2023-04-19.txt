 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this evening, I have some of  the most influential leaders in the House Republican Conference to  address some of the key issues we are addressing this week together in  the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield first to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Murphy).    Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I am  a proud cosponsor with you of the Protection of Women and Girls in  Sports Act because we recognize biology is not bigotry, it is reality.  It is a very good bill, and we will pass it this week.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens), the Super Bowl champion.    I am so grateful for your expertise and  wisdom and all the years you worked with troubled and incarcerated  youth. This gentleman knows that of which he speaks.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Thank you for drawing attention to it  because energy security is national security, as we say all the time.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to my great friend, the  great gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    From one father to another, I thank you for  those strong words. We will do that. That is our obligation.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to my friend and classmate, the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend who is  always a voice of great credibility and reason.   You're exactly right, and I am glad you highlighted that the first  100 days of this Congress under Republican leadership has been  remarkably successful. As you said here, this week and in the days  ahead, our important work has really just begun. We have a lot more to  do.   Mr. Speaker, in my remarks this evening, I would speak very briefly  as a father.   We have to defend women's sports. My wife, Kelly, and I have been  blessed with four amazing children. Two of them are bright, beautiful  young women who were high school athletes themselves. But today,  radical transgender ideology is threatening the very same opportunities  that my girls had, and all of our girls have had.   This week, Congress is going to send a clear message: We will not  stand by and tolerate the erosion of fair and equal competition in  women's sports.   We know that right now women's freedom to play sports at competitive,  collegiate, and professional levels epitomizes how far we have come in  breaking down so many boundaries.   How in the world have we gotten to this point where women's ability  to compete on a fair playing field is in question?   Mr. Speaker, this week, Congress will vote, and we are going to pass  out of this House the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.   We will address one of the major problems stemming from today's  extreme liberal ideology, all of these activists.   Just in the last few years, we have seen countless instances of men  competing in women's sports at all stages of competition. It is not  fair.   Our legislation would simply aim to crack down on this backwards  policy by prohibiting federally funded education programs or activities  of any kind from allowing biological men and boys to participate in the  programs or activities designed for women.   Biology is not bigotry. It is reality. Our legislation will make  clear that one's gender, their sex, is based on their reproductive  biology. It is our obligation; it is our duty and responsibility here  to protect and defend the rights of women and girls across this country  to compete and succeed in sports.   I am proud to cosponsor the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports  Act, and I am glad that that legislation will accomplish that very  thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 52 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, April 20, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
