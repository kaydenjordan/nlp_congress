 Mr. President, due to a regrettable clerical error, the  senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, was not added as an original  cosponsor and co-lead of S. 1421, the Ghost Army Congressional Gold  Medal Act, when we introduced the bill together on May 9, 2019. I wish  to clarify that Senator Collins is in fact the lead cosponsor of this  important legislation and has been an indispensable partner in this  endeavor. I thank her for her leadership in ensuring that the heroic  Americans of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal  Service Company are appropriately honored for their service as a  ``Ghost Army'' during World War II with a Congressional Gold Medal.                            ____________________
