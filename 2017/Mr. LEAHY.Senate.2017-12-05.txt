 Mr. President, next week, the Federal Communications  Commission, FCC, will consider a proposed rule, that, if approved, will  end net neutrality as we know it and will threaten the foundation of a  free and open internet. Net neutrality is the simple proposition that  internet service providers should treat all internet traffic the same;  they should not be able to exploit their power to charge for preferred  treatment, allowing big corporations to dominate the internet.   The Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, wants the FCC to undo its  protections for net neutrality. His proposed ruling is perversely  styled as ``Restoring Internet Freedom,'' when in fact it would do the  opposite. It would allow internet service providers to decide which  websites will be privileged and which will be throttled or even  blocked. Make no mistake: This will mean that the big firms that can  afford the ``fast lane'' will be protected, while harming consumers,  startups, and potentially even freedom of speech online.   Alarmingly, Chairman Pai has decided to ignore millions of comments  submitted by individuals across the country, citing concerns that they  are not ``unique.'' As a Member of Congress accountable to my  constituents, this is a particularly offensive posture. Unique or not,  comments and concerns submitted to my office by Vermonters are treated  with the same weight and value as any other. Until the FCC fully and  meaningfully considers the more than 21.7 million comments it has  received about this proposed rule, it should not proceed with this  vote.   A recent New York Times article by Farhad Manjoo, entitled, ``The  Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death,'' lays  out clearly why the FCC's proposed repeal of net neutrality will bring  the open internet one giant leap closer to becoming a corporate  playground. If, as expected, Chairman Pai jams through his proposed  rule change next week, it will be clear that he has done so to the  benefit of a few deep-pocketed corporations and to the detriment of  everyone else who relies on the internet to support commerce,  communication, and community. I ask unanimous consent that the article  by Mr. Manjoo be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Nov. 29, 2017]     The Internet Is Dying, Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death                             (By Farhad Manjoo)         Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up       Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second       cousin's baby pictures. But that isn't really the internet.       It's not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s       and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over       decades through government funding and academic research, the       network that helped undo Microsoft's stranglehold on the tech       business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook       and Netflix.        Nope, that freewheeling internet has been dying a slow       death--and a vote next month by the Federal Communications       Commission to undo net neutrality would be the final pillow       in its face.        Net neutrality is intended to prevent companies that       provide internet service from offering preferential treatment       to certain content over their lines. The rules prevent, for       instance, AT&T from charging a fee to companies that want to       stream high-definition videos to people.        Because net neutrality shelters start-ups--which can't       easily pay for fast-line access--from internet giants that       can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against       the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When       the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look       like and feel like something else altogether--a network in       which business development deals, rather than innovation,       determine what you experience, a network that feels much more       like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you       Napster and Netflix.        If this sounds alarmist, consider that the state of digital       competition is already pretty sorry. As I've argued       regularly, much of the tech industry is at risk of getting       swallowed by giants. Today's internet is lousy with       gatekeepers, tollbooths and monopolists.        The five most valuable American companies--Amazon, Apple,       Facebook, Google and Microsoft--control much of the online       infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud       storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of       broadband companies--AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many       of which are also aiming to become content companies, because       why not--provide virtually all the internet connections to       American homes and smartphones.        Together these giants have carved the internet into a       historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a       network whose very promise was endless innovation into one       stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of       some of the largest corporations on the planet.        Many companies feel this shift. In a letter to Ajit Pai,       the F.C.C. chairman, who drafted the net neutrality repeal       order, more than 200 start-ups argued this week that the       order ``would put small and medium-sized businesses at a       disadvantage and prevent innovative new ones from even       getting off the ground.'' This, they said, was ``the opposite       of the open market, with a few powerful cable and phone       companies picking winners and losers instead of consumers.''        This was not the way the internet was supposed to go. At       its deepest technical level, the Internet was designed to       avoid the central points of control that now command it. The       technical scheme arose from an even deeper philosophy. The       designers of the internet understood that communications       networks gain new powers through their end nodes--that is,       through the new devices and services that plug into the       network, rather than the computers that manage traffic on the       network. This is known as the ``end-to-end'' principle of       network design, and it basically explains why the internet       led to so many more innovations than the centralized       networks that came before it, such as the old telephone       network.        The internet's singular power, in its early gold-rush days,       was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of       new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could       build and deploy them--a site that sold you books, a site       that cataloged the world's information, an application that       let you ``borrow'' other people's music, a social network       that could connect you to anyone.        You didn't need permission for any of this stuff; some of       these innovations ruined traditional industries, some       fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious.       But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it       worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.        But if flexibility was the early internet's promise, it was       soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at       Columbia Law School (he's also a contributor to The New York       Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the       growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing       great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to       Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes       network.        Some of the new uses of the internet threatened their       bottom line. People were using online services as an       alternative to paying for cable TV or long-distance phone       service. They were connecting devices like Wi-Fi routers,       which allowed them to share their connections with multiple       devices. At the time, there were persistent reports of       broadband companies seeking to block or otherwise frustrate       these new services; in a few years, some broadband providers       would begin blocking new services outright.        To Mr. Wu, the broadband monopolies looked like a threat to       the end-to-end idea that had powered the internet. In a legal       journal, he outlined an idea for regulation to preserve the       internet's equal-opportunity design--and hence was born ``net       neutrality.''        Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges       and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the       governing regime on the internet since 2005. The new F.C.C.       order would undo the idea completely; companies would be       allowed to block  [[Page S7841]]       or demand payment for certain traffic as they liked, as long       as they disclosed the arrangements.        At the moment, broadband companies are promising not to act       unfairly, and they argue that undoing the rules would give       them further incentive to invest in their broadband capacity,       ultimately improving the internet.        Brian Hart. an F.C.C. spokesman, said broadband companies       would still be covered by antitrust laws and other rules       meant to prevent anticompetitive behavior. He noted that Mr.       Pai's proposals would simply return the network to an       earlier, pre-network-neutrality regulatory era.        ``The internet flourished under this framework before, and       it will again,'' he said.        Broadband companies are taking a similar line. When I       pointed out to a Comcast spokeswoman that the company's       promises were only voluntary--that nothing will prevent       Comcast from one day creating special tiers of internet       service with bundled content, much like the way it now sells       cable TV she suggested I was jumping the gun.        After all, people have been predicting the end of the       internet for years. In 2003, Michael Copps, a Democratically       appointed commissioner on the F.C.C. who was alarmed by the       central choke points then taking command of the internet,       argued that ``we could be witnessing the beginning of the end       of the internet as we know it.''        It's been a recurrent theme among worriers ever since. In       2014, the last time it looked like net neutrality would get       gutted, Nilay Patel, editor of the Verge, declared the       internet dead (he used another word for ``dead''). And he did       it again this year, anticipating Mr. Pai's proposal.        But look, you might say: Despite the hand-wringing, the       internet has kept on trucking. Start-ups are still getting       funded and going public. Crazy new things still sometimes get       invented and defy all expectations; Bitcoin, which is as Wild       West as they come, just hit $10,000 on some exchanges.        Well, O.K. But a vibrant network doesn't die all at once.       It takes time and neglect; it grows weaker by the day, but       imperceptibly, so that one day we are living in a digital       world controlled by giants and we come to regard the whole       thing as normal.        It's not normal. It wasn't always this way. The internet       doesn't have to be a corporate playground. That's just the       path we've chosen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to alert all Senators to the  situation in Honduras. Those of us who care about Central America have  watched the election for Honduras's next President with increasing  alarm. It has been more than a week since November 26, when the people  of Honduras cast their votes. Since then, repeated delays and  suspicious behavior, which suggests either incompetence or fraud, by  the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, TSE, that has been tallying the  ballots, have incited large public demonstrations.   Late last week, the government of President Juan Orlando Hernandez  suspended constitutional rights and imposed a 10-day, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.  curfew. Several protesters, including a 19-year-old girl, have  reportedly been shot and killed by Honduran troops, and hundreds more  have been arrested. Salvador Nasralla, the main opposition candidate,  called for a new election and reportedly urged the Honduran police and  military to disobey orders of their commanders to fire on  demonstrators.   Even before the Honduran people went to the polls, the prospects for  a free, fair, and peaceful election faced many challenges. The most  obvious point of contention is that President Hernandez is seeking a  second term, since until recently the Honduran Constitution had been  interpreted to strictly limit Presidents to a single 4-year term.   Ironically, in 2009 former President Manuel Zelaya was forced from  power by a coalition of military officers, businessowners, and  conservative politicians, including Hernandez, after they accused  Zelaya of using a popular referendum on a proposed constitutional  convention to extend his own rule.   Zelaya's ouster was initially labeled a coup by the U.S. State  Department, but it was not long before the United States accepted the  result and resumed sending economic and military aid to the government  of President Porfirio Lobo. During the next 3 years, the influx of  illicit drugs and the incidence of violence, including assassinations  of journalists and other civil society leaders, increased dramatically,  and Honduras became among the most violent countries in the world.   After Hernandez became president of the National Congress, he and his  National Party replaced the Supreme Court with justices intended to  support their political agenda. In 2013, Hernandez was declared  President of Honduras after an election fraught with reports of vote  buying and threats and assassinations of political opponents.   Two years later, the same Supreme Court ruled that he could run for a  second term, paving the way for last week's election. Just 8 years  after former President Zelaya was pushed out for allegedly proposing  that the Honduran people vote on the question of a second term,  President Hernandez had consolidated his control by replacing the  justices of the Supreme Court, appointing the TSE, maintaining a  majority in the Congress, and using the state media to drown out his  critics. It was widely predicted that he would coast to victory.   President Hernandez's government, in addition to becoming  increasingly autocratic, has been dogged by accusations of pervasive  corruption.   For these reasons and because of the opaque and bizarre conduct of  the TSE during the vote tallying process, it is perhaps not surprising  that the situation has deteriorated to the point of becoming a national  crisis of confidence in the integrity of Honduras's democracy.   Contrary to past practice, the TSE did not issue early results until  the day after the polls closed. At that time, it announced that, with  57 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Nasralla, a former TV sports  journalist, was leading by 5 percentage points. This indicated the  possibility of an historic upset, and while based on past practice the  final count was expected the next day, the process of tallying the  votes dragged on behind closed doors with no further announcements.   While Nasralla and his supporters celebrated and the third-placed  candidate, Luis Zelaya of the Liberal party, conceded, President  Hernandez and his allies in the press insisted that he would come out  on top once the rural votes were counted.   The TSE also said the rural vote count was delayed, and on Wednesday,  after a long silence, the TSE indicated that Nasralla's lead had  started to shrink, but the press reported that no technical reason was  apparent to explain the delay as the results from all polling stations  were reportedly transmitted electronically as soon as the polls closed.   As time dragged on, suspicions of fraud escalated among Nasralla's  supporters, and last Wednesday afternoon, the TSE said its computer  system had inexplicably ceased functioning for 5 hours. Then on  Wednesday night, the TSE reported that President Hernandez was ahead by  several thousand votes, which triggered protests by Nasralla's  supporters, some of them reportedly throwing rocks and lighting fires  in the streets, who were met by troops firing tear gas and live  bullets.   According to press reports, the opposition is questioning ballots  from 5,300 polling places and has called for a recount of ballots from  three rural departments. Yesterday morning, after only a partial  recount, the TSE announced its final tally in favor of President  Hernandez by just 1.49 percent, a gap of 52,333 votes.   The process has been so lacking in transparency, so fraught with  irregularities and inexplicable delays, and coupled with reports of  excessive force by the Honduran police and military against peaceful  protesters, it is increasingly obvious that the TSE's announcement made  a bad situation worse. There is too much suspicion of fraud and too  much distrust.   On Saturday, I asked the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa three simple but  important questions about the delays, the TSE's tally of the votes, and  the reports of shootings of protesters. It is late Tuesday afternoon,  and I have yet to receive answers. This lack of responsiveness in such  a time of crisis is troubling, and I hope it is not a new standard.   Yesterday evening, the OAS issued a statement that ``the tight margin  of the results, and the irregularities, errors and systemic problems  that have surrounded this election do not allow the Mission to hold  certainty about the results.'' There were also reports that large  numbers of Honduran police officers, many of whom have longstanding  grievances, are refusing orders to use force against the protesters.  Earlier today, I was informed that there may  [[Page S7842]]  be at least 15 fatalities and many people injured from gunshot wounds.  There are reports that the police and military fired many shots,  sometimes in the air and other times at the crowds.   The importance of this election, which will determine who leads  Honduras for the next 4 years, cannot be overstated. This is especially  so because of the way it came about in the first place. There was  already resentment toward President Hernandez for the double standard  of participating in the coup against Zelaya and then orchestrating his  own path to reelection. As one Honduran was quoted saying, they ``are  reliving the entire crisis from the coup of 2009, and the majority of  people don't really like that because it brings back some ugly  memories.''   President Hernandez and Mr. Nasralla offer significantly different  approaches to tackling the country's problems. Given the debacle of the  past week and the growing popular outcry, it is apparent that  establishing the credibility of the electoral process and the integrity  of Honduras's democracy requires either recounting the contested  ballots from each of the 5,300 polling places in the presence of  representatives of the political parties, representatives of civil  society, and international observers or holding a new election.   In the meantime, it is the responsibility of the Honduran Government,  particularly the police and the military, to respect and defend the  right of the Honduran people to freely and peacefully express their  opinions.   Honduras faces a defining moment in its modern history. How the  government resolves this crisis will determine the path of the country  for the foreseeable future. It will also determine the extent of  validity and support the next government receives from the United  States because only a credible election, accepted widely by the  Honduran people as free and fair, coupled with a demonstrable  commitment to transparency, to freedom of expression and association,  and to the rule of law, will justify that validity and support.                            ____________________
