 Mr. Speaker, a week ago, this body acted to bring  justice to our communities to begin the uncomfortable, urgent work of  dismantling white supremacy wherever it finds shelter.   But our work is far from finished.   In the days since we passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,  a young biracial woman named Althea Bernstein was set on fire by four  White men as she sat in her car.   Three police officers from North Carolina were fired after they  laughed about slaughtering Black people.   The President of the United States proudly promoted a video of one of  his supporters shouting ``white power'' at protesters.   Mr. Speaker, if we fail to meet this moment to enact the change  demanded by millions of Americans of all colors, all creeds, all  beliefs, the damage to this institution and to our Nation will be  immense.   This body was built to be a reflection of the people whom we  represent. They have the courage to create that change. So should we.                            ____________________
