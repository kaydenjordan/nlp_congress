 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  40 years of the Jefferson-Clarion Head Start program.   Since its inception more than 50 years ago, Head Start has improved  the lives of more than 32 million children and their families. Head  Start gives every child, regardless of circumstances at birth, a chance  to succeed in school and in life.   When Head Start was first launched in 1965, the idea of providing  comprehensive health, nutrition, and education services to children  living in poverty was groundbreaking.   Jefferson-Clarion Head Start is no exception. For 40 years they have  provided families and children of all ages with comprehensive education  and health services to income-eligible children to ensure that they  will be healthier and better prepared for success in school and life.   Currently Jefferson and Clarion County serves approximately 300  children each year across 10 towns and two counties.   Mr. Speaker, Head Start takes a comprehensive approach to meeting the  needs of young children. They focus on the whole child and the whole  family.   Congratulations to all who work and participate with Jefferson- Clarion Head Start. Your work is vital to our community. Thank you for  going above and beyond every day to make sure our children get the  education they need to prepare for their futures.
