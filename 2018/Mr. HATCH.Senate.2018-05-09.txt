 Mr. President, I listened carefully to the distinguished  Senator, and I am going to come back to the floor and explain why he is  wrong on every point. I am just really amazed that they make these  arguments when they are the ones who really caused the healthcare bill  to come forth, which is just eating us alive, but I am here for another  reason.    Mr. President, as we move through life, certain people  leave a lasting impression, and I rise today to recognize one of them.  Leo Montoya, a citizen of Utah, is an exceptional man who has impressed  me with his commitment to family, faith, and community.   In 1928, the year Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, Leo was  born on June 4 as the seventh of nine siblings to Epifanio and  Decideria (Gutierrez) Montoya. Decideria's family roots were in New  Mexico, where she raised her family as head of household in La Jara and  Lumberton. Decideria worked outside the home, so her daughters took  care of their youngest siblings while the older brothers contributed to  support the family any way they could. The family lived under extreme  poverty and hardship in La Jara until Leo's 14-year-old brother,  Candido, traveled 90 miles north to find work in the Lumberton coal  mines.   Candido saved his meager earnings to buy a small ranch to support his  mother and siblings with the help of his younger brothers, Jose and  Eudoro, who also worked in the mines. Jose had only one arm but loaded  coal shovel-for-shovel against any other worker. Both Candido and  Eudoro served in the military during WWII, and Leo, Tony, and Elisandro  served during the Korean war. Leo's oldest child, Tereso, was born  during the Korean war.   It is Utah's good fortune that the entire Montoya family eventually  settled in Utah. They are hard-working, honest, and enterprising people  who value God, family, and country above all else. Leo is the last of  them, and it is fitting that his achievements and contributions to Utah  are recognized. Leo is a true American success story.   While serving in the Army, Leo met the love of his life at a small  town dance, Rebecca Manzanares, of Monticello, UT. They were married in  the Glendale neighborhood of Salt Lake City and together raised 11  children: Leona, Jay, Guy, Luben, Jim, Tanya, Reba, Leo, Max, Toni, and  Belen. Leo worked at Hall Process Company for $1.45 an hour, but he and  Rebecca still managed to invest a small fortune in real estate.   Where some saw oppression and exploitation, Leo and Rebecca saw  opportunity and fortune, teaching their children that they could obtain  and achieve anything America offered if they worked hard, became  educated, and stayed out of trouble. Their children succeeded in  different ways and remain powerfully united as a loving and supportive  family unit.   Leo also contributed to the Salt Lake community. Beginning in 1965,  he began encouraging young boys to discipline themselves through sports  in his Glendale neighborhood. At first, Leo trained young boys on a  punching bag hung under a tree in his side yard, where he could keep an  eye on them while he worked. By 1970, boys started showing up in larger  numbers, many of them troubled youth from broken homes, so Leo began  holding daily practice in church and school gymnasiums to give the boys  something to do after school.   By 1975, his boxing team had more than 20 members that he took to  compete in tournaments throughout the intermountain area and beyond-- all at his own expense. By 1980, Leo knew he needed something more  permanent for the boys, so he bought an old secondhand store in Salt  Lake's Guadalupe neighborhood and converted it into the Leo Montoya  Boxing Club, which still welcomes young male and female boxers.   Leo supports his Guadalupe neighborhood in other ways as well. In the  winter, he plows the sidewalks of the Boys and Girls Club on 600 West  and 300 North, as well as the sidewalks for his elderly neighbors. Leo  regularly patrols the Guadalupe neighborhood in his golf cart to keep  his community clean and safe. Virtually every resident and  businessowner in the neighborhood appreciates Leo's vigilance.   In 2012, Leo was celebrated in one of Utah's major newspapers under  the Salt Lake Tribune headline: ``In His West-side Gym, Leo Montoya  Turns Boys Into Men.'' In 2013, Leo's contributions to the neighborhood  were featured on the front page of the Deseret News under the headline:  ``Community Celebrates Boxing Coach's 85th Birthday, Impact on  Neighborhood.'' A quote in the Tribune article might have best captured  what makes Leo unique and such a treasure as he contemplates: ``It  makes me feel great that I've been accomplishing something nice (and  helped) somebody . . .  [[Page S2590]]  Everybody wants to get paid for everything. Somebody's gotta do  something for nothing.''   Leo has also been a dear friend to me for many years, and he proved  it by posting my 6-by-9-foot campaign posters in front of his gymnasium  for every one of my reelection efforts over the past 33 years. His gym  is located in a predominantly Democrat neighborhood. Leo's son, Luben,  and daughter-in-law, Ruthie, have been like family to me for more than  30 years, and I had the privilege of blessing his grandson and  namesake, Leo, 24 years ago. Elaine and I have also truly enjoyed the  company of Leo and Rafelita over the years.   From helping his brothers in the coal mines and train yards at 14  years old, to supporting his community and building a small business  empire, Leo is truly deserving of recognition as a great American  success story. I am proud of Leo and his family, and I am very grateful  for his contributions to his community, to Salt Lake City, and to Utah.  In this, the year of his 90th birthday, I welcome this body in joining  me to wish Leo many more years of good health and happiness.                            ____________________
