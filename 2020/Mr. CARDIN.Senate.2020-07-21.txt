 Mr. President, we are in unprecedented times. Modem  transportation and communication technology make our world more  interconnected than it has ever been. These advancements, especially  international travel, create risks, as we have seen through the  devastating spread of the novel coronavirus all over the globe. But  close global connections also strengthen our capacity to work  collaboratively to tackle threats facing our communities. The COVID-19  pandemic is one such threat--it is a challenge that we will only be  able to overcome together. United Nations Secretary General Antonio  Guterres put it best when he said, ``We are only as strong as the  weakest health systems.''   President Trump's decision on July 6th to begin formally withdrawing  the United States from the World Health Organization, or the WHO, is  irrational, reckless, and simply the wrong thing to do. While the WHO  is not perfect, its technical capacities and relationship with nearly  every country in the world make it the best organization to manage the  response to a global pandemic like COVID-19. A few weeks ago, the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard from a panel of public health  experts who all spoke with one voice--leaving the WHO in the middle of  a global pandemic will not only compromise the international response  to COVID-19, it will put Americans' lives at risk.   Today, I am introducing a resolution with 28 co-sponsors that  expresses the sense of the Senate that withdrawing from the WHO  undermines U.S. global health leadership and the international COVID-19  response. This resolution recognizes that since the WHO was founded in  1948--with help from the United States--it has relied on U.S. support  to lead the world in disease detection and eradication and  strengthening health systems. The resolution also highlights the  significant benefit the U.S. gains by participating in the WHO,  including the ability to improve public health in regions of the world  that would be impossible to reach on our own.   Finally, the resolution highlights the lifesaving work of the WHO in  responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This work includes convening an  unprecedented global clinical trial--the Solidarity Trial--to help find  an effective treatment for COVID-19; coordinating global supply chains  of personal protective equipment and other health commodities for more  than 135 countries; and pre-positioning manufacturing capacity and  distribution channels to ensure that all countries have access to  future therapies and vaccines faster and at a fair price. Last month,  the Senate unanimously passed a resolution urging U.S. participation in  global efforts on therapeutics and vaccine development and delivery to  address COVID-19. Leaving the WHO will make it drastically more  difficult to accomplish those goals.   The WHO has its flaws, but the United States is best positioned to  effect positive changes by maintaining our seat at the table.  Historically, we  [[Page S4356]]  have been able to encourage the WHO to make important reforms, like  improvements to the organization's health emergencies program that were  undertaken following the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. By  withdrawing from the WHO, we are forfeiting our voice in these  conversations and empowering countries that do not have our best  interests in mind. The international community, and especially the  American people, will suffer as a result.   For these reasons, I hope that I can count on the Senate's support  for this important resolution. If we are to be successful in the fight  against COVID-19 and any other pandemic health challenges we may  encounter, the U.S. cannot isolate itself from the rest of the world.  An isolationist stance will only lead to domestic and global failure.  With the pandemic raging in our own backyard, it is more important than  ever before for the United States to continue to collaborate with  countries around the world to end this global health emergency and  prevent future ones from starting. If I may paraphrase John Donne, no  nation--not even the United States--``is an island entire of itself.''  We are all ``part of the main'' and the bell tolls for all of us.                            ____________________
