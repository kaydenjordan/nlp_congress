 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hillside  fifth and sixth grade all-star basketball team for winning their  championship game in overtime to become the 2018 Jersey Basketball  Association Gold Division champions.   This was the first year that Hillside had a fifth and sixth grade  team at all. In fact, some of the players on this talented team had  never even touched a basketball before signing up this year. Their raw  talent, positive attitude, willingness to learn, and parental support  helped drive the players toward victory.   Under Coach Nikko Velez and his father, Coach Nick Velez, the team  achieved a 13-1 regular season record and a 4-0 postseason record. The  only team that they lost to in the regular season was the team they  beat in the championship game.   I ask my colleagues to join me to congratulate the Hillside fifth and  sixth grade all-star team for its winning season.                            ____________________
