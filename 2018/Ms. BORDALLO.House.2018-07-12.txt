 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce the AMBER Alert  Nationwide Act.   I thank my colleagues from the other U.S. territories for their  support as original cosponsors.   In 2003, Congress passed the PROTECT Act, establishing the national  AMBER Alert system to mobilize the American public in cases of missing,  abducted, and exploited children. However, this 2003 law did not  provide for all of the U.S. territories to implement the AMBER Alert  system. Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are  still not integrated into the national system.   Our AMBER Alert Nationwide Act would fix this by integrating Guam and  all U.S. territories into the next AMBER Alert system and providing  needed Federal support for local law enforcement.   This bipartisan bill would also optimize the system for the  territories by authorizing Federal funding for AMBER Alerts in major  transportation hubs such as airports, maritime ports, customs  checkpoints, and other ports of exits.   A truly nationwide AMBER Alert system must protect our missing,  abducted, or exploited children in the U.S. territories. I urge our  House colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bill.                            ____________________
