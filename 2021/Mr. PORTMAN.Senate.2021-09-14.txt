 Madam President, I am here today on the floor to  remember the life of Navy Fleet Marine Force Hospital Corpsman Third  Class Maxton Soviak. Max was a 22-year-old native of Berlin Heights,  OH, a young patriot who died far too soon in service to all of us.   Max was one of 13 brave American service men and women who were  tragically killed when an ISIS-K suicide bomber in Kabul on August 26  exploded a bomb that wounded dozens of others and killed many Afghans.  He was there working to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from a  city that was suddenly overrun by the Taliban.   Max was a special guy. They say he was quick to make friends and  quick to earn the respect of those he interacted with. As a student at  Edison High School, Max was a member of the wrestling team that won the  2016 State championship and a football team that made it to the  semifinals 2 years in a row. He was an athlete and a leader. He  achieved the rank of Life Scout, the second highest rank a scout can  reach. He was a lover of the outdoors, spending his free time doing  rock climbing, skiing, scuba diving, and other extreme sports.   And he was one of those rare individuals who, at a young age, had  that drive to defend his Nation as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces.  He joined the Navy and was signed as a Fleet Marine Force hospital  corpsman, serving side by side with the infantry marines of the Second  Battalion, First Marine Regiment.   Affectionately known as a ``devil doc,'' a takeoff on the Marines'  ``devil dog'' nickname, Max was a member of a select group of medical  specialists trained to operate side by side with the men and women of  the U.S. Marine Corps on the frontlines, just as he was doing in Kabul  the day he died, helping evacuate Americans and our allies who were  fleeing the tyranny of the Taliban.   In his far too short time with us, Max did his duty, and he did it  with distinction and valor. He took care of his marines and, while in  Kabul, cared for innocent Afghans who were fleeing the Taliban.   Kathleen, Max's sister, said it well: ``In Maxton's final days, he  spent his time helping others stay alive, as he had developed a passion  for saving the lives of others, so much so, that he was willing to risk  his own life and made the ultimate sacrifice.'' So true.   Before the attack in Kabul, Max was able to FaceTime his mom, Rachel.  As they said their good-byes, his mom told him to be safe.   Max replied:         Don't worry, mom, my guys got me. They won't let anything       happen to me.    That was the last time she spoke to him before Max and his fellow  marines and soldiers gave their lives in service of keeping so many  others--moms, dads, kids, and fellow servicemembers--safe. He didn't  want anything to happen to us.   For his bravery and sacrifice, Max was awarded the Purple Heart and a  Combat Action Ribbon. When he came home to Berlin Heights, OH, he was  greeted with a hero's welcome that he richly deserved. Families lined  the streets as his casket, draped in the American flag, was brought  home to his family.   When I visited his hometown over the weekend to deliver an American  flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of his service, there were  flags in every yard and posters and flowers; you could sense the love  and support for Max and for his family from his grateful neighbors.  Yesterday, hundreds came to the Edison High School football stadium,  where Max had helped lead the Chargers to victory time and time again;  they came to pay their last respects to an honorable American life  taken too soon in service of all of us.   Max's sacrifice, along with that of the other marines and soldiers  who died or were grievously wounded that day, reminds us of how blessed  we are to have such courageous and selfless fellow citizens willing to  stand guard for us. We must be grateful for the sacrifices our troops  make every day to keep America safe. My thoughts and prayers are with  Max's parents, Kip and Rachel Soviak, and his entire family, as well as  those he knew and who loved him. May God comfort them in the days and  weeks ahead.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100- year anniversary of the founding of State Auto Insurance Companies.   Founded with $30,000 in borrowed funds by Robert S. Pein in 1921, the  State Automobile Mutual Insurance Association had three employees in a  rented room at 257 East Broad Street in Columbus, OH.   Pein believed that the insurance industry at the time was ripe for  improvement to customer service and increased affordability. The  company's early mission statement was ``Prompt and Satisfactory Service  in the Settlement of All Claims and operated by a golden rule of ``do  unto others as you would have them do unto you.'' Those guiding  principles remain to this day.   State Auto's geographic footprint expanded as the company entered new  States and acquired or affiliated with companies throughout the  country. Today, the company offers products in 33 States. State Auto  has grown steadily and now is among the 40 largest property and  casualty insurance companies in the United States.   Throughout its history, State Auto has been an innovator in the  insurance industry. The company introduced the industry's first auto  insurance payment plan and recently transformed into an entirely  digital provider of auto, home, and business insurance.   This required a transformation not only of its technology but also of  its products and culture. State Auto's culture is open and inclusive,  with a belief that every voice is important. Feeling comfortable, even  obligated, to speak up, challenge, and disagree is critical.   It is an impressive feat for a company to reach its 100th  anniversary. State Auto has reached this milestone while being a great  community partner in central Ohio.   I wish State Auto Insurance Companies a future of continued  success.                            ____________________
