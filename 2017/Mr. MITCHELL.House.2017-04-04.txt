 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the selfless  actions of farmers in my district and across Michigan. In early March,  wildfires spread through Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado,  devastating families and destroying crops and livestock--farmers'  income for next year.   Hearing of the devastation, Michigan farmers and truckers mobilized  quickly to bring aid to the farmers in need of immediate assistance.  Selfless individuals have donated their resources, including over 250  bales of hay, fencing, cattle feed, financial support, and more.  Convoys of volunteers, farmers, and truckers have volunteered their  time and their vehicles to drive these resources hundreds of miles to  affected areas. Farmers in 68 of 83 Michigan counties have donated  supplies or driven to deliver aid, and their efforts are expanding.  This weekend, 50 students from Sanilac County 4-H are delivering aid to  Ashland.   These selfless acts are truly inspiring and humbling. I am proud to  recognize their efforts and was happy to be able to aid some of these  efforts by getting permits issued for their travel.                            ____________________
