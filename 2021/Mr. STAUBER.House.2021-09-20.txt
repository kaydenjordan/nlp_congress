 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brainerd,  Minnesota, a city in my district that is celebrating 150 years of  culture, history, and exceptionalism.   As the weeklong celebration begins with festivals and a beautiful  park dedication, it is important to recognize what makes Brainerd so  special.   Located along the mighty Mississippi River and surrounded by many of  Minnesota's 10,000 lakes, what started out as a railroad town has  evolved into a bustling community where countless Americans have chosen  to open a business, engage in commerce, and recreate.   While Brainerd has grown and evolved throughout the past 150 years,  one thing has always remained the same: it is an excellent place to  live and raise a family.   As we celebrate 150 years of Brainerd, I want to recognize the former  and current community leaders, business owners, and families who have  made this community great. I could not be prouder to represent this  amazing community in Congress.    Here is to 150 more years of prosperity and excellence.                            ____________________
