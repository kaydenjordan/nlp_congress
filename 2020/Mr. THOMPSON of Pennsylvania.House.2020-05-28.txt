 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Jack ``JD'' Barnes Shaw of Russell, Pennsylvania, for  accepting a fully qualified appointment to the United States Naval  Academy.   Jack is the son of James and Ruth Shaw and a senior at Agora Cyber  Charter School. During his time in school, Jack was very involved with  the Boy Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, and fencing.  [[Page H2327]]    Over the years, Jack has held many leadership positions, including  senior patrol leader in his Boy Scout troop and a Sea Scout National  Quarterdeck, a representative on the Sea Scout National Committee. He  is an Eagle Scout and has been recognized as the 2018 Northeast Region  Sea Scout of the Year.   Jack's dedication and discipline are two traits that will lead to his  success at the U.S. Naval Academy. Jack is a proven leader. I wish him  the best in this exciting new chapter of his life.                            ____________________
