 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  Bentonville, Arkansas's 150th anniversary.   Founded in 1873, Bentonville has a long and vibrant history. In 1837,  a site was designated as the county seat for Benton County. Then in  January 1873, residents filed a petition with Benton County to  incorporate as the town of Bentonville. On March 28, incorporating  documents including a petition, map, and transcripts of the court  hearing were certified, and in April, the certified incorporating  documents were officially filed with Benton County.   The county and the town, which became the county seat, were named in  honor of Senator Thomas Hart Benton, from Missouri, in recognition of  his advocacy for westward expansion of the United States that resulted  in Arkansas's admission to the Union.   Over the years, this community has grown and flourished, becoming a  hub of commerce and culture in the region. It officially became a city  in 1905 and was known most for the agricultural activity that  characterized its economy and lifestyle. Just a few decades later, its  economic footprint began to change. By 1950, Sam Walton had opened the  original Walton's 5&10 store on the Bentonville Square and helped  transform the city as the company continued grow, expanding its  influence both locally and globally.   Bentonville is also home to the stunning Crystal Bridges Art Museum,  which houses a world-class collection of American art. The museum's  architecture and natural surroundings make it a must-see destination  for art lovers throughout the U.S. and around the world.   The Natural State is blessed with over 100,000 miles of streams and  rivers, 600,000 acres of lakes, hundreds of miles of trails, and over  3.2 million acres of public land, and Bentonville is a great example of  a community that embodies the opportunity these outdoor amenities hold.  The city has become a premiere cycling destination with over 181 miles  of dedicated trail across Bentonville and neighboring cities in the  county. These paths have become a key cultural and economic driver and  represent the strong recreational quality of life that thrives in the  region.   Given its rapid growth, I have been proud to work with local leaders  and support their efforts to improve infrastructure and allow citizens  to enjoy these trails or access the unique opportunities available in  the community and throughout Northwest Arkansas.   Congratulations to the entire Bentonville community on the milestone  of 150 years and counting. I applaud the City of Bentonville Public Art  Advisory Committee members for their hard work and dedication in  organizing the celebratory events. They have brought pieces of the past  together in a commemorative logo that defines the history, small-town  feel and culture that is Bentonville. The State flower of the apple  blossom shares the story of the city's history as a one-time top apple  producer. I am pleased to see the excitement in recognition of this  occasion and wish the community the very best as it continues to grow,  help define northwest Arkansas, and serve as wonderful place to live,  work, and explore.                            ____________________
