 Mr. President, when it comes to Medicaid, there is no  question the program is front and center in the fight against the  opioid epidemic. Medicaid is the single largest payer of substance use  disorder services in the Nation, paying for a third of all medication- assisted treatment across the country and covering millions of  Americans currently suffering; yet gaps in the system still exist.   The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes a number of  policies that will help fill some of these gaps both within Medicaid  and across the healthcare system. One such provision focuses on  providing States with additional flexibility around Medicaid's so- called IMD exclusion related to inpatient and residential treatment. I  view this provision as one piece of a larger approach focused on  ensuring patients have access to the care and services they need across  the entire continuum of care. It includes early prevention, access to  critical outpatient and community-based services, residential and  inpatient care when needed, and essential step-down care so individuals  can successfully transition back into the community.   However, I want to take a moment to note my concern about this  particular provision that will leave gaps for young adults seeking care  and treatment. Specifically, I am particularly worried about young  adults who may not be able to access quality residential substance use  disorder treatment services in the same settings as older individuals.  Under the Medicaid statute, the IMD exclusion applies to all  individuals under the age of 65 with limited exceptions for individuals  under age 21 for inpatient psychiatric hospital services. As a result,  I am concerned that, because the provision in this bill only applies to  those age 21 and older, younger adults below the age of 21 may not have  access to the full array of residential substance use disorder  treatment options, settings that may be closer to home, closer to  support networks, and that more appropriately serve their needs.  [[Page S6482]]    I am hopeful that my colleagues across the aisle will work with me to  address this and other yet to be addressed gaps in our healthcare  system to better meet the needs of the millions of Americans, young and  old, suffering from the scourge that is the opioid epidemic.    Mr. President, today the Senate passed a preconferenced  Federal Aviation Authority bill without amendment offered or accepted  by myself or my colleagues. I voted against this bill primarily for  three reasons.   First, this FAA reauthorization does not include a critical and  necessary consumer protection bill, the FAIR Fees Act. The FAIR Fees  Act would have limited the amount that airlines could gouge consumers  when they wanted to change flights. Now, without this provision,  working Oregonians will still have to pay absurd prices, such as $200,  to change a simple $80 flight.   Second, Senator Merkley and I had introduced legislation to qualify  the Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport to receive Essential Air  Service funding, and despite our attempts to include it to this 5-year  FAA authorization, the legislation was excluded. The airport near  Klamath Falls is currently without commercial air service, and  Essential Air Service funding would help them recruit an airline to  return commercial air service to the region. I was disappointed this  important provision was not included by either the House or the Senate  because it would have increased economic development and tourism for  the Klamath region. I will continue to pursue any and all avenues to  help restore commercial air service to the Crater Lake-Klamath Regional  Airport, a must for quality of life and economic development in the  Klamath Falls area.   Third, this bill includes the Preventing Emerging Threats Act,  legislation aimed at empowering Federal agents to prevent drone-based  crime.  [[Page S6491]]  This legislation confronts a clear need and represents careful--but  incomplete--efforts to create a narrow program with appropriate  congressional oversight. Specifically, this bill allows for broad  carveouts to the Wiretap Act, and it is not clear this broad authority  is necessary. Additionally, the privacy protections could be  interpreted as applying only to information gathered between the drone  and the drone operator and not applying to additional information  gathered, collected, stored, or analyzed while initially detecting  drones. Interpreted this way, the bill represents a massive expansion  of the government's warrantless wiretapping authority.   I have received assurances from the Department of Homeland Security,  the Department of Justice, and my colleagues from the Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee to work together to address my  concerns. Despite that, I voted against this bill while looking forward  to remedying this quickly in perfecting legislation. Similarly, I am  looking forward to published guidance from the Department of Justice  and the Department of Homeland Security making clear that all  information gathered, stored, analyzed, or collected under this act are  subject to the privacy protections.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate has just cleared the most  sweeping package of bills to address the opioid epidemic to date. These  fresh policies will make a difference on the ground. In my view, there  are promising ideas dealing with some key important priorities: helping  people steer clear of addiction from the get-go and knocking down  barriers that prevent people from getting help when they need it.   These policies were crafted on a bipartisan basis in practically half  of the committees in Congress. The Finance Committee passed its own  bill in June with more than two dozen policies that at least one member  from each side of the aisle sponsored.   For example, Senator Bennet led the way on a provision that will help  root out fraud by requiring prescriptions to be sent electronically  from doctors to pharmacies. It is too easy to fake a script on old- fashioned paper and get a bottle of pills, so this policy would make  electronic prescriptions the norm in Medicare's drug program.   Senators Brown and Stabenow have important provisions that will help  make sure new mothers and infants have access to the care and treatment  they need. Senator Menendez and Senator Scott worked on provisions that  will help parents get treatment and find smart, safe ways to reunify  families.   Since homelessness and addiction often go hand-in-hand, Senator  Cardin and I have worked on a bipartisan provision that is about  uncovering innovative opportunities in Medicaid to provide housing- related supports and services to individuals struggling with substance  use disorders including for those transitioning out of residential  treatment and for those who are experiencing homelessness.   Senators Warner, Cardin, and Thune have also brought forward an  important provision that would expand access to telehealth services in  Medicare for older Americans struggling with substance use disorders.  That will expand this promising technology so seniors who don't live in  rural areas can also remotely connect with their doctors to get  substance use disorder treatment. When it comes to ensuring a substance  use disorder is being correctly managed, frequent and convenient check- ups can make all the difference in the world.   These are only a few of the ideas the Finance Committee has been able  to bring forward in this bipartisan package.   This legislation represents a measured but important step towards  ensuring Federal and State policies are working towards a resolution of  this crisis, not making it worse. I view this legislation as an early  step in dealing with the epidemic. Nearly 70,000 Americans are dying  every year due to drug overdoses. This is one of the most serious  issues of our time, and the work will need to continue, especially when  it comes to identifying how the crisis began in the first place and  holding those responsible accountable.   Congress is going to keep at it until pain policy in this country is  back on track. I think of how this has progressed as a ``prescription  pendulum.'' Years ago, when I was the director of the Oregon Grey  Panthers, I would get calls from the families of older people coping  with pain. They would say, ``My dad is 93 years old, he's in agony, but  he can't get a prescription because they say he'll get addicted.''   More recently, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.  If you broke a bone, came down with a bout of back pain, or had a root  canal, getting a script for a bottle of opioids became routine.  Millions of Americans got hooked. No community has been spared from the  consequences--mothers, fathers, babies, sons, daughters, grandmothers,  relatives, friends, coworkers--I would challenge any American to claim  someone in their social network has not felt the effects that opioid  addiction have had.   Congress has a responsibility to stay on this issue until no family  is torn apart just because of a misused or inappropriate prescription  after an accident, until no parent has to spend day after day wondering  if they will receive a call that their child has overdosed again, until  no baby has to spend days or even weeks after they are born recovering  from opioid withdrawal. The bill before the Senate today will start to  turn the tide, and I am proud so many of my colleagues supported it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, through the Wilderness Act of 1965,  Congress reserves the authority to designate as Wilderness Areas  certain Federal lands with remarkable natural and ecological values.  Over the last 53 years, the Wilderness Act has been referred to as the  gold standard of conservation, providing the highest level of  protections for some of America's most treasured public lands. In  addition to congressionally designated Wilderness Areas, the Wilderness  Act gave the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture  the authority to study and evaluate the wilderness characteristics of  public lands under their respective jurisdictions. Once identified, the  Forest Service manages lands with wilderness potential as an  ``inventoried roadless area,'' and the Bureau of Land Management  manages lands with wilderness potential as ``wilderness study areas.''  These designations are not always without controversy but are critical  in providing a measure of interim protection for wilderness-quality  lands while Congress deliberates on further, permanent protections.   The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act, which the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee reported yesterday, adjusts the  boundaries of the Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study  Area in Central Oregon, removing over 600 acres of land from interim  protection under the Wilderness Act. The Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead  Falls Wilderness Study Areas contains cultural and historical  artifacts, provides drinking water for thousands of Oregonians, and  provides critical habitat for fish and wildlife species, some of which  are threatened or endangered.   Proponents of this legislation argue that the release of the acres  from interim protection under the wilderness study area designation is  necessary. According to the proponents, the ``release'' language was  necessary to allow Federal land managers greater flexibility in  conducting hazardous fuels reduction projects to better protect the  adjacent community, Crooked River Ranch, from the threat of wildfires.  In truth, hazardous fuels reduction projects technically could have  taken place under existing land designations.   Adding insult to injury, the Crooked River Fire Protection Act  originally gave no direction on how the BLM should manage the released  lands. In addition, the original bill fell short in addressing the  wildfire concerns while allowing for the release of wilderness study  area acreage from interim protection without any corresponding lands  protections. This is just a lost opportunity for compromise and comity.  In an attempt to provide local landowners some measure of certainty  over how the released lands will be managed, I worked to clarify that  the released lands will be managed in a way that improves fire  resiliency and forest health, while preventing off-road recreational  vehicle use, which could actually increase the risk of wildfires.   While these changes do not address the future management of the  entire Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area, it does  provide management direction for the released lands and pushes the BLM  to meet the goals of the legislation: to promote fire resiliency and  forest health. I am committed to finding a path forward for a solution  for the entire wilderness study area in line with the traditions of  compromise and doing things the Oregon way.                            ____________________
