 Mr. Speaker, today I will vote present on H.R. 6691. I  support the premise of this legislation and agree that action needs to  be taken after the Supreme Court's ruling earlier this year. However,  in their finding the Court cautioned that careful consideration should  be exercised before any new or expanded criminal definitions are  finalized. This bill does not meet that test.   In April, the Supreme Court ruled that the current definition of  ``crimes of violence'' was unconstitutionally vague and needed to be  clarified. I support efforts to rectify this issue and make certain we  are prosecuting criminals to the fullest extent of the law. Yet since  the Court's ruling, Republicans have taken no steps to meaningfully  consider what this new definition should be. Instead, they rushed the  bill to the floor without a hearing, markup or time for proper review.   I agree clarification is needed to ensure we are able to prosecute  those who are guilty and uphold our laws as they are intended. However,  rushing through a hasty definition of crimes of violence is dangerous  and irresponsible. The definition is used in a number of federal  criminal offenses beyond just the Immigration and Nationality Act. For  instance, it also applies when determining whether a juvenile may be  prosecuted as an adult in federal court.   There is simply too much potential for unintended consequences to  rush through a definition written impulsively and without proper  review. I would rather the House carefully consider what an appropriate  definition should include, in order to properly balance the rights of  Americans with the need to fully enforce our laws and protect our  fellow citizens.
