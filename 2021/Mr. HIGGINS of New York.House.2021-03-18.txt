 Mr. Speaker, federally qualified health  centers are located in neighborhoods, connecting to people where they  live and where families today are struggling.   Health centers in my western New York community--Neighborhood Health  Center, Community Health Center of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, Jericho  Road Health Center, and Evergreen Health Services--are on the front  lines in the fight against COVID-19 and the ongoing battle to end  health disparities.   This week, I met with several of these health centers, hearing  firsthand about the role that telehealth, primary care, outreach,  education have in providing better health outcomes.   Today, I am pleased to announce over $3.5 million in resources to  help Federal health centers in western New York continue to battle the  pandemic and protect our neighborhoods. This funding, provided through  the American Rescue Plan, will help support the health center workforce  and deliver testing, treatment, and vaccines to help our communities  and keep them safe.
