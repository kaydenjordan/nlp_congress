 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I just listened to the last speaker, Mr. Speaker. He said that he had  a bill that he thought and hoped maybe the Republicans could support,  and he used the word, ``united.''   Do you know the easiest way to know if the Republicans support it?  Ask them. Let them in the room. Actually work with them. That is  probably a quicker way. The united part is a little difficult if you  want to unite people and you leave them out.   So let me recap. Having been the leader on this side of the aisle and  having worked on numerous COVID relief bills, let's recap what we have  gone through each and every time we try to bring America relief.   Mr. Speaker, do you know what? Let's not take my word for it. Let's  just read the headlines. I think that will work best.   March 22, The New York Times: ``Emergency Economic Rescue Plan in  Limbo as Democrats Block Action.''   Yes, that was The New York Times. That was March 22.   So let's go to April 9. Let's go to the NPR: ``Senate Democrats Block  GOP Effort to Boost Small Business Aid.''   A week later, we watched the Speaker of this House appear on ``The  Late Show,'' bragging about blocking the relief while eating high-end  ice cream. For reference, there were 22 million unemployed Americans at  that time.   August 3, CBS News said: Democrats Reject White House Offer for  Short-Term Extension of Unemployment Benefits.''   Let's go to September 10, Politico: ``Senate Democrats Block  Republican COVID Relief Proposal.''   That is weird. All those headlines, and I never heard ``united.'' I  did hear ``blocking.'' I did see the Speaker.   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a little bit of my personal  experience. When we wanted to do the CARES Act, the Senate worked with  Republicans and Democrats by committee. They put the bill together. You  listened to Leader Schumer, that night, say: Yes, we are ready to go.  The bill is prepared.   I took the red-eye and flew back. The Speaker did, too. We went into  the meeting together. And do you know what, Mr. Speaker? Just read one  of these headlines. The Speaker was able to stop it for another whole  week.   How many people were laid off that week?   But do you know what? There was change in the bill. The John F.  Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts got a little more, but that was  the only thing, and then we were able to pass it.   In there, we were able to produce the PPP for small businesses. It  allows you to pay your rent and your utilities. But you took that money  and you paid your employees.   Why were you paying your employees? Because government shut down your  business.   Was it successful? Whoa, was it successful.   Did it go to the owner? No. It went to the people. It went to the  workers. Fifty million workers were saved. It was so powerful and so  successful that the money was running out.   So do you know what, Mr. Speaker? The Treasury Secretary sent a  letter to us and said: You don't need to change anything. Just add a  little more money because it is so successful at saving so many jobs.   Well, we got our answer. One person stopped it all, and she did it on  ``The Late Show'' for all of America to see.   Mr. Speaker, do you remember her smiling as she opened that  refrigerator and denied those 22 million people, that they were going  to join those unemployment lines, and she was going to smile about it  because she had her ice cream.   Do you know what happened, Mr. Speaker? I listened to the Speaker's  words. She said: Do you know what? We are going to get this done. We  are not going to leave.   Because she has all the power of whether we stay in here and do our  job or not. It doesn't matter if one-third on the other side stays home  and votes by proxy and still gets their paycheck. She had everybody  leave.   But then I had hope. I had hope for those who were unemployed. I had  hope for those who wanted to go back to school and needed the money,  because the Speaker called an emergency meeting and forced us to come  back here. So I thought maybe she changed, maybe actually what she said  she meant this time. So she was going to force Congress back, and she  did.   Do you know what? One-third on other side didn't show because they  didn't think it was an emergency.   Was it about COVID relief? Was it about the American people who were  hurting? No. No. No. No. No. No. It was about the post office. It was  political. So we should have everybody come back.   When you are in the minority, there are only certain rules you have  and certain options to put something on the floor. So do you know what  the Republicans chose to do that day, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats  chose to talk about the post office? We put COVID relief on the floor.  So there was an option. There was an opportunity.   The power of the Speaker rose again. She put her thumb down and  everybody else on the other side followed.   So do you know what, Mr. Speaker? The American public lost that day,  too. They lost one more time.   The facts speak for themselves. The common denominator in holding up  relief for the American people is very simple: Speaker Pelosi. She  spent the last several months stonewalling negotiations instead of  working to solve problems.   You know why we are here today, Mr. Speaker? It is because  Republicans put a discharge petition on the floor.   I wonder why we got out early last Friday. Hmm. The discharge  petition must have become ripe where people could sign it.   When her Members revolted, she responded by recycling an old,  unrelated liberal wish list from her first bill.   Now, at a time when 837 more Americans are filing for unemployment  and small businesses are closing permanently, she is wasting Americans'  time on yet another multitrillion-dollar special interest bailout that  rewards K Street and not Main Street.   Today's so-called compromise isn't realistic or responsible. It is  the Pelosi pipe dream 2.0, and it is filled with the same radical,  reckless, and ridiculous ideas as the first bill.   Instead of prioritizing new money for small businesses through the  Paycheck Protection Program, it provides a massive tax break to the  millionaires and billionaires who are totally unrelated to the  coronavirus.   Now, let me give you an example. Let's take one person in America who  is going to benefit from this. Mr. Speaker, you actually ought to  rename this bill the Mike Bloomberg bill.   Mike Bloomberg is reported to have made $3.5 billion last year. He  lives in New York. So if you take the State and local taxes and you  combine it, it is 12.5 percent. So that would mean, if this bill  passes, you just gave him $160 million in his pocket.   That is an interesting number, 160 million. I wonder if $160 million  is how much he would save. How would that affect him?   Well, I just read a couple reports, Mr. Speaker. Do you know Michael  Bloomberg just put $100 million into Florida to win it for Joe Biden?   In another interesting report, he had given the Democrats $60 million  to help  [[Page H5431]]  them try to keep the majority this year.   What is even more interesting, Michael Bloomberg ran for President,  and when he was on stage, do you know what he said? He said he bought  the Democrats the majority. He said he spent $100 million. He bragged  about the individuals that he was able to spend that money on.   Hmm. Some people would wonder if that was money well spent. Some  people might wonder if they read that bill: Hmm, $160 million.   What does that mean to the person who is unemployed? I don't think  Mike Bloomberg needs that.   I know a lot of small businesses and I know a lot of unemployed  workers who need the money, but you chose somebody else to respond to.  You chose somebody else to reward. Shame on you.   Instead of guaranteeing commonsense protections against frivolous  lawsuits for schools, for small businesses, for childcare, and for  churches, it gives amnesty, work visas, and taxpayer-funded stimulus  checks to illegal immigrants.   Lots of times when you read a bill, you see what you prioritize.   Instead of boosting jobs, it bails out the cannabis industry.   Mr. Speaker, have you read your own bill? In fact, it mentions  cannabis more than it mentions jobs. Did you read the bill? It mentions  cannabis more than it mentions jobs.   I would challenge anybody in this body to name me one time in their  district in one meeting that it mentioned cannabis more than it  mentioned jobs with what you are going through right now. Our districts  may be different, but I don't believe anybody has that.   Instead of reopening the economy, it releases criminals to our  communities. Democrats think the economy should be locked down, but  they don't think serial killers should be locked up.   But the Speaker's latest bill does have a noteworthy difference from  the original.   At a time when the leftwing mobs are creating chaos in our cities,  the bill unequivocally embraces the left's defund the police agenda. In  fact, it removes $600 million of the emergency funding for State and  local enforcement and community-oriented policing that was in the first  bill. That is where they cut. Democrats actually believe the top  priority of Congress is fewer cops and more criminals.   Again, sometimes when you read the bills, it lets people know their  priorities.   I listened to the Speaker before. She always told me that bills show  your values. I heard the Speaker recently say that the Democrats'  values are different from Republicans'.   These are your values. Yes, they are. Yes, they are.   Another striking difference is the tens of billions of dollars for  public education to combat misinformation about the coronavirus  vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, I was happy to hear my colleague on the other side speak  a little earlier about the vaccine. I was excited because the Democrat  nominee for President and the person he choose to be his running mate  don't think that people should take the vaccine even though it is going  to be safe and effective and save people's lives.   It is interesting. The individual who is running for President on the  Democrat side said that he is the Democratic Party.   Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Speaker Pelosi actively spread in  public, over the last few weeks, misinformation about an ability to  save lives. American families, workers, and small businesses will  continue to pay the price for Democrats' refusal to take this crisis  seriously.   It doesn't have to be this way. That is the worst part of all of  this. It doesn't have to be this way. As the past several months have  proven, targeted and timely relief related to COVID hardship actually  works.   Fifty million people are without a paycheck because of PPP.   I can't tell you how many people got laid off for every time Speaker  Pelosi has delayed our bills.   I can't tell you how many households and how many businesses have  gone bankrupt because she didn't keep her word and say that we would  stay here and do it.   I can't tell you how many more people wonder if their kids can go to  college because Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, called us back for an  emergency, but it wasn't about COVID.                                time  1900    Instead of using American's suffering as leverage to pass a socialist  agenda, Congress should be working on getting the American people back  to work safely and back to school safely.   Republicans have spent months using every tool available to the  minority to build on the CARES Act and get support to Main Street. The  American public actually ought to see how people vote here, because  just yesterday we put on the floor a vote for PPP. Every single  Democrat voted ``no.'' Every single one. It is something they have  already supported before. Money is already sitting there--more than  $130 billion.   This month, our efforts culminated in a discharge petition to reopen  the Paycheck Protection Program, which I have said, has already saved  51 million jobs.   Mr. Speaker, to the American public, what does a discharge petition  mean? You see, the Speaker, whoever he or she is, has all the power.  They can determine what comes to the floor. But a discharge petition  gives the power to the Members. All it takes is 218 Members to sign it.  The public knows what it is. All it would do is take the money that is  there for the Paycheck Protection Program and make sure the bill comes  to the floor and could be voted on. It will be really telling to know  how many people back home say they support it and how many times they  come here and are fearful, fearful if there are threats if they sign  the discharge petition.   The petition is being led by Ranking Member   Steve Chabot, and Jaime  Herrera Beutler. I thank both of them. Because you know what they have  done? They put the American people first.     Steve Chabot, ranking member of Committee on Small Business, when  we were crafting the CARES bill, where the PPP was created--yes, it was  him who worked so hard to make sure the small businesses, those who are  employed by them, got resources. He did an amazing job.   Jaime Herrera Beutler is probably one of the most bipartisan Members  in this body. They didn't do it for political gain. They did it because  they listened to their district.   As of Friday, this commonsense solution officially became open for  signatures--just 218 to earn a vote on the floor. I think it deserves a  vote. I think if you took it to the public, they would pick that a lot  sooner than they would pick what this bill is doing.   Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body must make a choice tonight.  Members who endorse the Speaker's reckless actions can vote ``yes'' on  this recycled liberal wish list. Then they can go home and explain to  small businesses in their district why they prioritized politics over  people.   They could stand up and say, No, we worked hard for cannabis, a lot  harder than we worked for jobs. We made sure the police got cut, and we  made sure Mike Bloomberg got paid back. Now that $160 million that he  is spending in the campaign today, he will get it all back because the  taxpayers will pay him for it. That is exactly what this bill does. It  could be the Michael Bloomberg, Cannabis, Cut-the-Cops bill. That is  power. That is real power. You can make sure Michael Bloomberg does not  lose $1 of the $160 million he has invested to make sure that Joe Biden  and the Democrats stay in power.   If you are that proud of this bill, why don't you name what it does?  It makes sure all Americans know that cannabis is your number one  priority, not jobs.   It makes sure that you take care of those who take care of you in a  campaign--Michael Bloomberg.   And it makes sure everybody knows you do not care about the safety of  our streets, that you are going to cut the police by $600 million.   That is one heck of a campaign. That is amazing. What is interesting,  so many times the leaders, people have said here, the Speaker of the  House, she is the Speaker for all of America. And she always tells us,  This will tell you what your values are. And I remember what she  recently said, That our values are different.   I want to agree with the Speaker. Our values are different. On this  side of  [[Page H5432]]  the aisle, we believe in a commitment to America. We believe that we  will defeat this virus because we will create a safe and secure  vaccine. The other difference in our values? Our commitment to America.  You can read it. You can go to CommitmentToAmerica.com. And we actually  reject defunding the police. We say we will spend $1.75 billion more on  the police, not cut by $600 million. You know what we will do with the  money? Community policing, more training, and 500,000 body cameras.   We also have a plan. We can tell you how many jobs we are going to  create. We are going to create 10 million new jobs. I don't know how  big you will expand the marijuana business, but in here, it mentions  that more than jobs.   We are going to end the dependency on China. We don't just say it, we  actually do it. We just came out with a task force that not only shows  you the problem, it shows you the solution.   Mr. Speaker, you know what we did different than what you did with  this bill? We didn't produce something and say, Well, we think the  Democrats might like some of this. We actually invited you to join us.   Mr. Speaker, a year ago, I went to the Speaker, and I asked her if we  could create a bipartisan committee dealing with China. China is  representing its 71st anniversary. There is no more freedom in China  today than there was 31 years ago in Tiananmen Square.   It took me 8 months of negotiation with the Democrat leadership until  they finally said, yes. We actually picked the people who were going to  be on it. And right before we went to name it, they decided no. They  didn't want to be a part of it. This was before COVID. I just don't  understand it. I just don't understand why our values are that  different.   Members who want to bring an end to the Speaker's excuses, who  believe this is a moment to work for Main Street not K Street should  vote ``no'' and sign the Herrera Beutler-Chabot discharge petition. By  adding your name, you will be advancing a fair process towards making  bipartisan law for American families. That is what our neighborhoods  need. They need us to legislate for them, not posture for November.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all my Democrat colleagues to join us. Make a  commitment to America, not to Michael Bloomberg, not to cannabis. Focus  on who actually voted for you to get here. Do not be so intimidated  because somebody supplied so many millions of dollars to try to  persuade people to vote a certain way. Listen to those who have been  laid off.   I know what it is like to have a dream to open a small business. I  know what the hardships are like, but I have not witnessed personally  the hardship of what the virus has done when they have been shut down.  The least I would expect is this body would act, would put people  before politics. But, unfortunately, yes, the values of one side are  different than ours.   Every chance we have we have put forth relief for the American  public, and the only opportunity we have now is the discharge petition,  because no one definitely can vote for this.
