 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this  bill that uses dangerous procedure to advance dangerous policy to erode  our important firearms background check system and undermine public  safety.   In response to the tragic mass shooting at Virginia Tech, the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Amendment  Act was passed by Congress unanimously and signed into law by President  Bush because everyone agreed that we need federal and State agencies to  submit relevant information to maintain an accurate, effective system.   This bill directly undermines public safety by permanently blocking a  federal agency from submitting records to this critical safeguard  system.   I know the high cost of gun violence on families and communities. I  know that policy makers have an obligation to address public safety  carefully and responsibly. Reasonable people can disagree about whether  the rule by the Social Security Administration struck the right balance  between the threshold and process reporting to the background system.  While opponents have raised some concerns about whether there is  sufficient due process in this rule, the solution is not to block the  rule entirely. Rather, the solution is to fix it.   Therefore, I oppose this CRA because it would permanently prohibit  the Social Security Administration from ever reporting individuals to  this critical safety system, which is an extreme, dangerous,  irresponsible, and irreversible action that threatens the safety of our  communities.
