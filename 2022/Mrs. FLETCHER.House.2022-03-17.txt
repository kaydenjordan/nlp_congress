 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the FAIR  Act. I have heard some of the debate in this Chamber today, and as a  litigator, I disagree.   The FAIR Act is about restoring justice for the American people. It  is for consumers, it for workers, it is for small business people, it  is for people whose civil rights have been violated, it is for millions  of Americans who are denied their right to seek justice and  accountability because of forced arbitration.   There is certainly a role for arbitration of disputes and other forms  of alternative dispute resolution in our system of justice. I know this  from my own experience representing individuals and organizations in  the courts and before arbitrators.   The FAIR Act is important because it recognizes the role arbitration  can play in resolving disputes between willing parties while it  recognizes the fundamental rights of the people who have  [[Page H3798]]  been subjected to arbitration agreements without their true consent.   The FAIR Act protects the freedom to contract, the freedom of choice,  and the freedom granted in our Constitution, including the Seventh  Amendment.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''                                time  1330
