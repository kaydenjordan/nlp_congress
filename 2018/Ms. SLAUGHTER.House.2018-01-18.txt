 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are back to the House floor today to pass another  bill, the real intent of which is to harm women and limit their  constitutionally protected healthcare they can receive. I need to  repeat that because most people I find do not understand that the  Constitution of the United States, which we revere, protects a woman's  right to choose.   To add insult to injury, this intrusive legislation is totally  unnecessary. Killing an infant, or anybody else, has always been  against the law.   To reiterate the point, a bipartisan law was passed in 2002 to  reinforce that medical care should be given to any infant born alive.  To illustrate how unnecessary this bill is, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who is  the only example we have in America, is going to spend the rest of his  life in prison without any possibility of parole for three first-degree  murder convictions.   But H.R. 4712 goes much further than the current law. It legislates  medical standards of care and threatens the providers with civil and  criminal penalties.   The effects of this are best described by an OB/GYN from my district:   ``I have been a practicing OB/GYN for more than 35 years, and it is  my life's calling to care for women across their lifespan. Throughout  my career, I have cared for patients during their highest highs and  lowest lows, from healthy pregnancies to devastating fetal anomalies,  to cancer diagnoses. I take my role as their trusted physician very  seriously, and take pride in providing compassionate and ethical care  to each and every patient.   ``H.R. 4712 would take that ability away from me, inserting  politicians into the patient-physician relationship and the profoundly  personal healthcare decisions of my patients.   ``Recently, I had a patient with severe HELLP syndrome, a life- threatening blood pressure condition during pregnancy for which the  only treatment is to deliver. This meant induction of her previable  fetus to save her life.                                time  1300    ``As her condition deteriorated, and after consulting her family,  spiritual leader, and several specialists, she decided to deliver''-- she should be able to consult whomever she pleases--``knowing that her  extremely preterm infant would not survive. If enacted, H.R. 4712 would  take away this family's choice of providing comfort care for their  baby, put my patient's life at risk, and threaten me with criminal and  civil penalties for providing appropriate and empathetic care to my  patients.''   H.R. 4712 is just the next bill in a long line of votes that we have  had here that would hurt women.   But Congress is just part of the current crusade against women. This  administration has done more than its share to ensure that 2017 saw an  unprecedented amount of attacks against women and our ability to access  healthcare.   Just this morning--America, please don't lose the irony in this. Just  this morning, the administration announced a rule to allow providers,  hospitals, nurses, and others to refuse patients needed healthcare  based solely on the religious or moral beliefs of the provider.   Is it just me who thinks that is in direct contradiction to this bill  they are trying to push off on us now? On the one hand, they are saying  everything has to be treated, and, on the other hand, they are saying  you don't have to treat anybody if your personal or moral convictions  prevent you from doing so. That is really dangerous, believe me. This  is an unconscionable effort to blatantly ignore the needs and the best  interests of the patients.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.    This silly rule will put individuals' lives and health  in danger and will result in deaths, based on an undefined moral  objection. It doesn't even have to be explained that they have some  idea that they would not be able to treat that person who may be  bleeding to death before them.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to close again with the words from the OB/GYN  from my district:   ``The purpose of this legislation is to scare and intimidate  physicians and punish them for providing abortion care, but the true  impact will be on the women and families who will be denied the highest  quality medical treatment they deserve.   ``H.R. 4712 is a dangerous bill. I urge you to protect my patients'  access to care and reject this gross interference in the patient- physician relationship.''   Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, the whole idea of this bill is a  political issue. But the idea of what the administration did this  morning, to completely negate this bill that we are debating right now,  is irony that is just too delicious to miss.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary  time.   Mr. Speaker, the Chamber finds itself in much the same position it  was in on September 8, December 7, and December 21. Those were the  other three continuing resolutions that we passed to try to get through  here, but we are rushing again with one of the majority's short-term  continuing resolutions with days to spare--actually, tomorrow--one day  to spare until the great Government of the United States closes for  business.   Now, you might think that would be the most important thing on the  minds of the majority and of the United States Government, but it isn't  because we are not going to get to vote on this tonight until 7 p.m.-- and all the people in the country who are holding their breath to see  whether they are going to be laid off, the Federal workers, and all the  other things that go with that devastating thing.   Let me remind you that the last time the government had a shutdown,  $24 billion was lost to the economy, a lot of it to laid-off workers,  and also the fact that large numbers of facilities owned by the  government have stores and newspaper stands in them that were also  closed.   But, no, we are not in any hurry today. Nobody is concerned about it,  and the President of the United States and several Members of the House  have gone to a political rally in Pennsylvania. They are trying to save  a congressional seat there of a person who was forced to step down.  That, obviously, is of more importance to them than whether or not this  government continues to function.   That is a tragedy, Mr. Speaker, but that is what we have been putting  up with for a long time.   I don't recall a time we have had four continuing resolutions in  probably a month and a half, but here we are, and I bet you that we  will come back in February and do yet another one.   Now, my colleagues who have gone to Pennsylvania could have gone next  week--because we are taking another week off back to the district next  week--and not caused this great hubbub today, which is one of the most  important days in the life of the Nation as to whether we are going to  continue to be the Government of the United States.   It is tragic, isn't it?   I remember I was on the floor the last time it shut down, and at  midnight I had said: The government of the United States is now closed.  I would  [[Page H505]]  hate to be up here to have to say something like that again.   I don't know what else to call it except incompetence. That certainly  comes as close to the definition as I can make.   But this latest proposal that we will not vote on until after 7  p.m.--and I understand that will inconvenience some people, but I do  hope that other people will be able to stand the suspense. This is the  fourth continuing resolution since the end of the fiscal year in  September, and it will run, as I said before, through February 16,  where I bet you we do another one.   If past is prologue, we probably will find ourselves back because  what we do in this House now is be a standby person while the majority  goes from one self-imposed crisis to the next. And much like the  proposals before it, this continuing resolution is not the product of  bipartisan negotiations. It was written solely by the majority without  a single Democratic fingerprint anywhere on the bill.   America, pay heed to that. If this government should shut down, this  problem is solely that of the Republican Party. We were not asked for  our input when it was written in the back room, but since its public  release hours ago, the majority has being asking for our support and  saying what a shame it is, what a shame that we who don't even believe  in this particular thing are not out there beating the drum for it.   But that is not how it works. The majority cannot craft this bill  solely by itself and fail to address the matters that we agree we need  to take action on and then criticize us for not supporting this  partisan proposal.   We had an idea we would come to this point for some time, and I think  everybody will agree with me, certainly on my side, and I suspect on  both, that our leader, the minority leader, Nancy Peolsi, certainly  made herself clear all the way through as to what it would take to get  the votes of the Democrats in the House. But there was no consideration  given to that, and yet they are asking us for votes.   This stopgap measure continues to just chip away at the Affordable  Care Act--and I know my colleague said he was happy about that--by  targeting some key funding mechanisms under the law. I suppose I  probably did the rule on at least the vast majority of all the times  repeal and replace was the fashion here, and I have always asked every  single time: Why does the Republican Party want to take healthcare away  from people? I have never gotten an answer to that, but I am totally  convinced, after all this time, that that is exactly what they want to  do.   Since the majority waived the rules requiring the provisions to be  paid for for the healthcare act, it is actually a massive tax cut for  the health insurance industry. It comes on the heels of the majority's  tax cut for the wealthy and corporations, which represents the largest  transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthy that our Nation  has ever seen. It is a bill that made tax cuts for corporations  permanent.   Now, the continuing resolution before us today includes a temporary  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which  provides healthcare for 9 million of America's children. That was only  to be for 6 years. But, as you heard already from a previous speaker  this morning, had it been made permanent, it would save over $6  billion. I fail to understand the economic benefits of what they are  doing here.   Mr. Speaker, why is the majority giving permanent tax cuts to  corporations but it won't even give permanency to children in need of  healthcare? The majority believes that a temporary reprieve on CHIP  will force us to vote for this misguided plan. But what about the  community health centers? What about improving healthcare for veterans?   The continuing resolution turns a blind eye to victims in desperate  need of help in the wake of some of the worst hurricanes, mudslides,  and wildfires our Nation has ever experienced and to 700,000 DREAMers  who remain at risk of being deported following President Trump's  decision to end DACA.   Remember what DACA was about. We asked young people who had been  brought to the United States by their parents at a very young age to  come out and to register and say that they were undocumented and that  we would protect them as a way to citizenship. But instead, that was  taken away from them, and they face deportation and are being deported  daily--and it is an emergency.   But it also fails to take any action, this particular CR does, on  bipartisan priorities like the pension crisis, veterans healthcare,  and, as I said, the community health centers.   What has the majority prioritized instead of crafting a long-term  spending bill that deals with these urgent issues? Ideological crusades  like undermining financial reform laws and attacking women's health.   We had a wonderful debate just before this bill came on the floor of  a thing called Born-Alive. We passed a bill I think unanimously, and I  think it was done by voice vote, in 2002, that any infant born in an  abortion setting would be given every care in the world, and, in fact,  we didn't even need that bill. That is a given.   At the same time, though, that we are debating that on the floor  today, that is to do every medical thing possible, the administration  announced that, if a provider--a nurse, a doctor, or anybody in a  medical setting, and they don't have to give any reason for this--if  they personally or for some other reason, morality reason, decide they  do not want to treat a patient before them, they don't have to.   Think about that a minute. Well, you know what I am trying to say  here. It is more than ironic. It is stupid. But we sort of get used to  that.   A separate bill on the floor today, H.R. 2954, would weaken the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a thing hated by this Congress,  their ability to respond to the problematic trends in the mortgage  market. So here we go again. The CFPB has already saved over $12  billion for consumers.   Another measure that will be considered this week, H.R. 4712--that  was the one I mentioned a minute ago--tries to shame and scare doctors  out of providing constitutionally protected abortion services. The bill  this morning gives doctors and medical professionals up to 5 years in  prison just for practicing medicine to the best of their ability.   And all the while, the majority has been ignoring the elephant in the  room and we march toward another government shutdown, and the American  people and the world are once again forced to wonder whether the  greatest superpower on this planet can keep the lights on. Surely, this  is no way to run the Government of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   For months, the majority has been holding the healthcare of 9 million  children and more than 9 million individuals, including seniors,  pregnant women, and veterans, hostage while they pass the tax breaks  for millionaires and billionaires.   Well, the time is up, and with each day we fail to act, our  constituents face uncertain futures. This is wrong. Mr. Speaker, even  President Trump agrees we need to act on CHIP. Just this morning, he  tweeted: ``CHIP should be part of a long-term solution, not a 30-day or  a short-term extension.''   Well, here is our chance to stop playing politics, except we can't do  it until 7 o'clock this evening because the President and so many  Members of the House are in Pennsylvania at a political rally. I guess  this wasn't as important as we thought it was.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Representative McEachin's bill, H.R. 4820, the  Advancing Seniors and Kids Act. This bill would restore certainty and  stability to so many of our most vulnerable citizens by responsibly  addressing critical healthcare priorities.   It permanently reauthorizes CHIP, saving us $6 billion. It  reauthorizes the community health centers for 2 years and includes  other vital healthcare programs that provide relief to pregnant women,  seniors, and so many more.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). Is there objection  to the request of the gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant minority leader, to discuss  our proposal.    I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant minority leader, to discuss  our proposal.    I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant minority leader, to discuss  our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Oklahoma--and he is  a good friend. We have seen each other often in the Rules Committee-- protests too much. This is not a bill, and the American people should  know that it is not a bill. It is an affirmation of the inability of  Republicans to govern.   Republicans have the Presidency, the Senate, and the House. A few  months ago, their President indicated that we need a good, beautiful  government shutdown. Those are not my words. Those are the words of the  President of the United States. This is not an appropriations bill.  This is a stopgap emergency method in order to save ourselves from  collapse. That is the Republican's responsibility.   Democrats, so many months ago, passed a budget, as a member of the  Budget Committee, a budget that respected the needs of all Americans,  including the United States Department of Defense. It provided funding  for ordinary men and women who put on the uniform, some of them on food  stamps. It provided for veterans health. It provided for the children's  health insurance. It provided for infrastructure, and it provided for  ensuring that Americans could have good healthcare. That was the  Democrat's budget.   The Republican budget was a $2.4 trillion, and counting, cut to the  needs of the American people. It threatened Medicaid and Medicare,  quite contrary to Democrats. Now, we find ourselves in the midst of  those in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who barely got lights or  power during the holiday season or thereafter. It is dealing with  Texans who have no power in their homes, living in shells. They have no  heat. They are waiting on disaster supplemental relief that is not  coming.   And, of course, what about CHIP? I represent the Texas Children's  Hospital with my colleagues. My district surrounds that area. I have  been to that hospital. I have seen what the Children's Health Insurance  Program means to saving lives. What does that mean? Six years, that is  nebulous. What about permanent?   What about passing Mr. McEachin's bill on working with seniors and  children? That is serious. And I don't know what my friends heard, but  earlier this morning, I heard the President say: Snatch CHIP out of it.  They want to be in negotiation. I just want to be mean.   And you know how you are being mean? You are not here seriously  dealing with this. You are going off on a rally so that you can support  the man that is running in the Pennsylvania suburbs who loves the  President. That is not democracy. Whoever is running, let them run.   Right now, in here, we need some help and we need to work on these  issues for the 700,000 near-Americans. They are DREAMers, but they  serve in the military. They are in medical school. They are Ph.D.s.  They are teachers, and we have them suffering. Some of them have  committed suicide because of the ugliness of this body controlled by  Republicans in the House and the Senate.   Finally, let me say that any President who can call something an s--- hole is not a serious negotiator.   I believe it is the Republicans' responsibility to put a bill on the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule, which makes in order  legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in effect for  another month, or until February 16, 2018.   This resolution is yet another short-term Continuing Resolution (CR)  to extend government funding for a few weeks, this time until February  16th.   This is the fourth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a rule that does not make in order  legislation that provides full funding for disaster recovery, extends  additional health access for veterans, provides funding to combat the  opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fourth CR extension that does  not address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,0oo Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us includes a six year  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),  which provides health coverage to nine million children, and which  Republicans allowed to lapse on September 30, 2017.   In contrast, making CHIP permanent would not only provide long-term  stability for families, providers, and states, it would save $6 billion  according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Republicans are only just now getting around to reauthorizing the  program because they wasted months on efforts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and enact unpaid for tax cuts for the wealthy.   This resolution includes additional tax cuts totaling over $26  billion, including a two year delay of the medical device and Cadillac  taxes, and a one year delay of the health insurance tax.   At the same time, the resolution fails to address numerous other  expired and expiring health priorities, from funding for community  health centers to waiving caps on therapy services for seniors on  Medicare, to preventing cuts to safety net hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern.   Therefore, I cannot support the Rule or the underlying bill.   Instead, Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Texas has  expired. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized. The gentlewoman  from Texas is not recognized.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. * * *   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Oklahoma.  [[Page H508]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he is  prepared to close? I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend, Mr. Cole, seems almost to be desperate  to have us vote for this continuing resolution, which says to me that  the majority doesn't have enough votes to pass it. Somehow by saying  that because the Democrats will not support this farce, then we are  going to be responsible for it. But, frankly, my good friends are three  for three on government shutdowns just since I have been a Member of  Congress. Nobody is going to believe that, with all the excess numbers  of votes here--I think you have 23 more Members have than we have got-- we are at fault.   But, anyway, let's get to the business here.   Instead of treating this like the serious issue that it is, the  President is treating it like another reality show. He has suggested  that Democrats would certainly be blamed for the majority's inability  to keep the government running. But he is wrong about that, too. Just  this week, a poll from Hart Research Associates found that the public  would blame the majority by a double-digit margin. That gap grows wider  when you look specifically at independent Americans.   History shows this to be true. When the majority shut down the  government over the Affordable Care Act in 2013, a majority of the  public placed the blame on them, not President Obama. We saw similar  results when former Speaker Gingrich engineered shutdowns in both 1995  and 1996 because he thought the seat given to him on Air Force One did  not fit his stature. The American people then blamed the Republican  congressional majority, not President Bill Clinton. That is because  facts matter, and the fact here is that the majority chose a partisan  approach that threatens our ability to keep the government functioning.   But this discussion should not be centered on blame. It is about  whether the Republican majority can even govern. Holding the White  House, the Senate, and the House comes with great responsibilities,  and, obviously, the most basic one--and we all understand this--to  start with is keeping the Government of the United States running.   Yet we are confronted all the time with this problem: Are we going to  be able to pay the bills and keep things going?   That is so humiliating for America. There is no other word for it.   But this majority, as pointed out before, just lurches from crisis to  crisis to crisis, and they lurch around from one deadline to the next  without any plan. All the time, all you need to do is ask to let us  work together, let Democrats in on your backroom plans. We never get to  see that. We are never consulted and never a part of any plan.    Let me remind everyone watching that the last Republican shutdown in  2013 cost the economy an estimated $24 billion. Federal loans to small  businesses, homeowners, and families were halted, and numbers of great  Federal employees were furloughed. Federal permitting was stopped.  Hundreds of patients at the National Institutes of Health were unable  to enroll in possible lifesaving clinical trials. Federal scientific  research was also put on hold. We had five Nobel Prize-winning  scientists working for the Federal Government at that time, and four of  them were furloughed.   The majority apparently thinks it has the votes to go it alone on  this bill, but I don't think so anymore. We thought so when I wrote  this. But they think we are going to prevent a repeat of all that  carnage. It is a shame that they squandered a chance to work with us to  craft a bipartisan bill. Frankly, I think it is tragedy, and I think it  is no way to run the government.   Without question, we could have kept the government running while  addressing the priorities that Members of both parties agree on, like  we used to.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule,  and the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H511]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
