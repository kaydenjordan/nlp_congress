 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Indiana, the Honorable Rudy Yakym III, be permitted to take the  oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not yet arrived, but there is no  contest and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, as the dean of the Indiana delegation, I  am honored to welcome the newest Hoosier to serve here in the people's  House, Congressman Rudy Yakym.   Before his election last week, he worked as a vice president at a  commercial real estate firm and, most recently, as a director of growth  initiatives at an Indiana logistics and supply chain company. He was  also nominated by former Governor Mike Pence to serve on the Indiana  Judicial Nominating Commission.   Our new colleague will be representing Indiana's Second Congressional  District, and he is supported by his wife, Sallyann, and their three  children.   I welcome the Congressman to the House and look forward to working  with him to advance Hoosier values.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Yakym).
