 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Second  Lieutenant Matthew Chaires on his graduation from the United States  Military Academy at West Point.   Lieutenant Chaires, or Gunner, as his family and friends call him, is  from Hilliard, a small town in northeast Florida with a population of  just over 3,000.   At Hilliard Middle-Senior High School, he was a student athlete and  all-State football player, and he received numerous athletic and  academic honors. In fact, Lieutenant Chaires is the only Hilliard  resident to ever attend and graduate from one of our Nation's  prestigious service academies.   At West Point, he was assigned to Bravo Company B2 Bulldogs in the  second regiment and was a member of the cannon crew for the Black  Knights during football season. With his time at West Point complete,  he now heads to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to begin field artillery training.   On behalf of the Hilliard community and all of northeast Florida,  thank you to Lieutenant Chaires for his commitment to both service and  academic excellence. We are all very proud of him.                            ____________________
