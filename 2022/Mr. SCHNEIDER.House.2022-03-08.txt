 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Nick Helmer, the late, beloved mayor of Prospect Heights, and  someone with whom I was proud to have a friendship.   Mayor Helmer was a dedicated public servant, serving as mayor since  2011. His tenure transformed Prospect Heights. He led the city out of a  lingering recession into what he lovingly called Prosperous Heights.   Throughout his 79 years of life, Mayor Helmer shaped Prospect  Heights, building a home with his wife, Gail Ann Helmer, and raising  their two children, son Nick Helmer, Jr., and daughter Rebecca.   Through his work, he literally built both Prospect Heights and  Chicago with a career and a passion for real estate. He was recognized  as Chicago's Certified Property Manager of the Year.   One of my favorite memories was joining Mayor Helmer for the Fourth  of July parade in the parade marshal car. Over the course of the parade  route, I got to see firsthand his passion for his community, his love  of his constituents, and the mutual love they shared for him.   Mayor Helmer leaves a huge hole in Prospect Heights and a hole in all  of our hearts. He will be sorely missed. May his memory be a blessing.                                time  1115                            In Support of Ukraine     Mr. Speaker, I rise to affirm Congress' resolute  support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their defense of the  unprovoked, unlawful Russian invasion.   The world will hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his invasion and  the actions of his armed forces. He is solely responsible for this war,  its devastation, the senseless deaths of thousands of Ukrainian forces  and civilians, and the forced migration of millions more. Putin's war  is an affront to every nation and to all people that respect  international law and self-determination.   I commend the administration's swift and strong response to unite  NATO and other allies against the Russian aggression and for heeding  Congress' call to ban imports of Russian oil.   In Congress, our bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian  people and for isolating and sanctioning Putin and his regime is rock  solid. The United States, together with our allies, must do all we can  to compel Putin to end this unwarranted, illegal war. We must do all we  can to help the Ukrainian people in their struggle and their fight for  their independence and their freedom. Putin must know that Americans  and people of conscience around the world stand with the people of  Ukraine; and that we will stand strong until Ukraine is again free.                            ____________________
