 Mr. Speaker, electric utility transformers provide a  service that plays a pivotal role in the lives of Americans. Right now,  there is a critical shortage of those transformers that enable  America's electric grid. This shortage is keeping homes from being  completed and hindering grid reliability as power utilities, co-ops,  and energy producers try to keep up with demand.   Why is the Department of Energy hurting American consumers more by  making a transformer shortage worse?   Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise as a proud supporter of the  Protecting America's Distribution Transformer Supply Chain Act, which  will delay the Department of Energy from imposing unnecessary mandates.   Our power sector, builders, and contractors need a ready supply of  electric transformers. We must stop the administration from turning the  lights out on American families, including my constituents in Idaho.                            ____________________
