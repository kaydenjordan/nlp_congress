 Madam President, I rise to speak on the National       Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023, which passed the Senate       last week. This year's defense bill supports our servicemembers,       bolsters our security both at home and abroad, and advances important       defense projects across our State. It invests over $800 million in       critical defense assets in Maryland, ensuring they are be ready to       address the challenges of today and tomorrow. It includes a 4.6-percent       pay raise and investments in health and child care benefits to ensure       that those who defend our Nation and their families enjoy the economic       stability they have earned. And this legislation includes vital       improvements to our military justice system that we have been fighting       to enact for years. Like any bill, this package isn't perfect, but on       balance, I believe it will strengthen our national security. I am glad       we came together and sent this bill to the President for signature.        In particular, I am very pleased that this NDAA includes the Service       to the Fleet Act, which authorizes $636 million for a major       infrastructure overhaul of the Coast Guard yard in Curtis Bay, MD. The       yard is the Coast Guard's sole shipbuilding and major repair facility       as well as a critical economic driver for Maryland, directly and       indirectly creating thousands of good paying, skilled, union jobs. The       yard and the hard-working men and women who keep it running need the       proper infrastructure and equipment to continue to provide top notch       support for the fleet, which is why we must deliver the funds to       modernize their World War II-era facilities. Sending this legislation       to the President's desk is a major win for Maryland, and I look forward       to working with the White House, the Department of Homeland Security,       and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that this       authorization is fully funded through annual appropriations       legislation.        I am also glad that this legislation includes key language from the       HBCU RISE Act, which I introduced with Senator Tillis. This bill aims       to spur greater research investment in historically Black colleges and       universities and other minority serving institutions while       strengthening our national defense research ecosystem. It creates a new       program with the U.S. Department of Defense to help HBCUs and MSIs       achieve ``very high research activity status,'' also known as ``R1''       status. Maryland is home to four outstanding HBCUs that provide a       quality education for their students and help power American       innovation. And with this bill heading to the President's desk we are       providing an even greater investment in the success of universities       like Morgan State and UMES in Maryland and many others across the       country.        Further, I am glad that this legislation includes the pilot program       established in the First Lieutenant Hugh Conor McDowell Safety in Armed       Forces Equipment Act, which will improve the readiness and safety of       the operation of military tactical vehicles. This legislation honors       the legacy of First Lieutenant McDowell, a distinguished U.S. marine       whose life was cut tragically short as the result of a vehicle rollover       accident. It was my honor to offer this legislation alongside Senator       Cardin and Representatives Brown, Wittman, and Ruppersberger, and it is       my hope that First Lieutenant McDowell's loved ones will be comforted       by the knowledge that, just as he protected his marines in life, First       Lieutenant McDowell's legacy will be the protection of future       servicemembers from these avoidable accidents.            [[Page S9770]]              The FY23 NDAA also includes historic reforms to the military justice       system and extends an innovative tool to address the backlog in       infrastructure needs at DOD laboratories that is used by multiple       Maryland military installations. It includes provisions I authored in       the State Department Authorization Act requiring the Department to       submit recommendations to Congress to streamline the security clearance       process and mandating that passport applicants be given the option to       have supporting documents returned to them by certified mail. This       legislation also includes the Water Resources Development Act, which       advances several key Maryland priorities, such as resources to ensure       our shipping channels and other waterways remain clear and accessible       for navigation, support for a variety of local water infrastructure       projects, and funding authorization for Chesapeake Bay watershed       environmental restoration. Lastly, this bill includes funding and       language that is critical to supporting Maryland's military       installations, including $175 million in authorized military       construction. The bill also includes report language ensuring the       Army's continued support for the demolition of contaminated facilities       at Aberdeen Proving Ground.        While I am pleased with many of the provisions included in this bill       and voted for its passage, I do have significant reservations.        I believe it is a mistake to continue funding for the research and       development, production, or deployment of the nuclear-armed sea-      launched cruise missile--SLCM-N--and its associated nuclear warhead.       The United States already possesses an array of nonstrategic nuclear       capabilities that fulfill our theater nuclear deterrence missions and       reassure our allies of our extended deterrence commitments. In its 2019       cost estimate of U.S. nuclear weapons programs, the CBO projected that       the SLCM-N would cost $9 billion through 2028. This projection does not       account for production costs after 2028, nor does it factor in costs       associated with integrating the missile on ships, nuclear weapons       training for personnel, and storage and security for nuclear warheads       on naval bases. Not only is the program a waste of money, it will also       dangerously raise the risk of nuclear miscalculation and escalation.        I regret that the bill does not include the Upholding Human Rights       Abroad Act, which I introduced with Representative Jacobs to close a       loophole that allows some U.S. security assistance to foreign forces       without being subject to Leahy Law restrictions that bar U.S. military       assistance to units credibly believed to have engaged in gross       violations of human rights. This is a simple, straightforward matter of       the United States living up to our most basic commitments as a member       of the international community.        I also regret that the bill does not include the District of Columbia       National Guard Home Rule Act, which would give the D.C. Mayor the same       control over the D.C. National Guard that the Governors of the States       and Territories have over their National Guards. The attack on the U.S.       Capitol on January 6, 2021, and the events at Lafayette Square on June       1, 2020, are prime examples of why the D.C. Mayor should control the       D.C. National Guard. Denying this authority to the D.C. Mayor adds       needless layers of bureaucracy between the emergency of a situation       requiring the deployment of the Guard and its actual deployment.       Moreover, current law creates a dangerous loophole by which a President       may evade the Posse Comitatus Act and use the military for civilian law       enforcement. I will continue to work with Senator Carper and       Representative Norton to pass this legislation in the next Congress.        Finally, I believe that this bill fails to reckon seriously with the       long-term budget challenges facing our country. We simply cannot afford       to continue this level of investment in defense at the expense of other       critical national priorities. I oppose the decision to invest an       additional $45 billion over the President's budget request for defense       while we continue to underinvest in diplomacy, development, and a wide       range of critical domestic priorities.        While I am opposed to some of the provisions in this bill and       disappointed by the omission of others, I believe that, on balance, the       NDAA will strengthen our national security and advance other important       national priorities. For that reason, I voted in support of final       passage.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I rise today to honor the career of       a dedicated public servant, Dr. Kenneth Katzman, for his three decades       as a Congressional Research Service, CRS, analyst supporting the U.S.       Congress.        Dr. Katzman began his CRS career in 1991, where he established       himself as an indispensable expert on the Middle East. Known as a       prolific writer, Dr. Katzman has authored hundreds of memoranda,       reports, and other writings on the Middle East.        Throughout his time at CRS, Dr. Katzman has covered critical foreign       policy issues, from the Gulf War to U.S. sanctions policies and the       Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. His insights and analysis include       tracking developments across the Middle East, including Qatar, Oman,       the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Dr. Katzman's expertise       is deeply appreciated and critical to many Members of Congress and       their teams across both sides of the aisle. Throughout my time in       Congress, I have worked closely with Dr. Katzman on a number of issues       related to the Middle East and thank him for all he has done to help       inform my work related to the region.        Dr. Katzman personifies the Congressional Research Service's mission       by delivering objective, fact-based analysis to offices across Capitol       Hill so they can better understand unfolding events, their historical       context, and the potential implications of congressional decisions. It       is no surprise that he has been asked to testify before multiple       congressional committee and subcommittee hearings covering U.S. foreign       policy in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. In 1996 and, again, in 2001, Dr.       Katzman was detailed to the then-House International Relations       Committee to support its work on Middle East issues, hearings, and       legislation--including the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. In       addition to his large body of written work and testimony before       Congress, Dr. Katzman has shared his expertise with Members and staff       on several congressional delegations to the Middle East, including       trips to Iraq and Afghanistan.        We will miss Dr. Katzman on Capitol Hill as a cherished resource on       foreign policy matters. I congratulate him on his well-deserved       retirement.
