 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 93, and I ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Hawley] proposes an       amendment numbered 93.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To require the imposition of additional duties with respect   to articles imported from the People's Republic of China until trade  between the United States and the People's Republic of China comes into                                  balance)         At the appropriate place, insert the following:       SEC. __. IMPOSITION OF DUTIES TO BALANCE TRADE WITH THE                     PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.         (a) Calculation of Trade With the People's Republic of       China.--Not later than January 31 of each year, the President       shall calculate and publish in the Federal Register, for the       preceding calendar year--        (1) the total value of articles imported into the United       States from the People's Republic of China; and        (2) the total value of articles exported from the United       States to the People's Republic of China.        (b) Imposition of Duties.--        (1) In general.--If the total value calculated under       paragraph (1) of subsection (a) exceeds the total value       calculated under paragraph (2) of that subsection for the       preceding calendar year, the President shall impose an       additional duty with respect to each article imported into       the United States from the People's Republic of China of 25       percent ad valorem.        (2) Additional duties.--A duty imposed under paragraph (1)       shall be in addition to any duty previously applicable with       respect to an article.        (c) Continued Imposition of Duties.--The duties imposed       under subsection (b) with respect to articles imported into       the United States from the People's Republic of China shall       remain in effect until the total value calculated under       paragraph (1) of subsection (a) is equal to or less than the       total value calculated under paragraph (2) of that subsection       for the preceding calendar year.     Madam President, in the last 20 years in the State of  Missouri, we have lost 60,000 jobs to the People's Republic of China.  That number nationwide is almost 4 million. Our trade deficit with  China, as we stand here tonight, is at near-record levels, and every  dollar of that deficit represents blue-collar jobs destroyed, industry  shuttered, manufacturing capacity withering away.   I would submit to you that it is the most important deficit that we  face. We can talk about budget reforms, and we can talk about savings  here and there, but until we do the work of bringing back productive  capacity to this Nation and good-paying blue-collar jobs you can raise  a family on, we will not put our economy on the basis that we need to  address the economic challenges that we face.   So my amendment does something very simple. It imposes across-the- board tariffs on China for every year in which we have a trade deficit  until that deficit is zero. Bring back jobs to this country.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.   The Senator from Ohio.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.  [[Page S1887]]    The legislative clerk called the roll.
