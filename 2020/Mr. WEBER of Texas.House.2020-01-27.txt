 Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to commemorate  what is an anniversary we shouldn't have ever had to commemorate and be  here for, again, the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz- Birkenau.   Mr. Speaker, I have been to the concentration camps. I have seen the  train tracks where they brought in loads of people in railcars and they  herded people like they were cattle. I have seen the ovens. I have seen  the gas chambers.   Mr. Speaker, I saw where Dr. Josef Mengele performed experiments on  people as if they were lab specimens; many of them women. It is  something that we should never have experienced and should never  experience again.   Mr. Speaker, today, we do remember what the gentleman from New York  said, the six million Jews who tragically lost their lives in the  Holocaust. To keep that mind-numbing number in perspective, if we were  to take a moment of silence for every Holocaust victim, I would stand  up here for 11\1/2\ years.   It is so imperative that we remember all of those who fought  tirelessly to defeat the Nazi regime. With rising levels of anti- Semitic sentiment attacks spreading in the West today, we should  emulate those brave men and women that my good friend, Lee Zeldin  talked about, the Greatest Generation who, in their spirit, they  fought, and many of them gave all to combat and liberating those  downtrodden by the Nazis, those families who were forever destroyed  under the German Nazis; liberating them from anti-Semitism in all  forms. Anti-Semitism needs to be defeated today.   So, Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today as we recommit ourselves  to the protection of our Jewish brothers and sisters and the State of  Israel against all those who seek to destroy them, no matter what form.  Come what may, BDS, anti-Semitism, all of those, may God protect Israel  and the Jewish people, as we proudly say; and remind our children--what  I call the latest generation--who need to understand what the Greatest  Generation knew, and that is that it can never be tolerated, never  again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being here  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Shalala).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for her comments, and I yield to another gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being  here for tonight's Special Order, and I yield to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments, and I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my friends on both sides of the aisle  for being here to express those sentiments.   Mr. Speaker, President Roosevelt said that December 7, 1941, was a  day that would live in infamy. On this day, 75 years ago, a horrific  infamy was revealed--one that should never have been allowed and one  that should never ever be allowed.   Mr. Speaker, 6 million Jews and their families were subjected not  just to a day of infamy, but a lifetime of the memory of that kind of  infamy and the effect it had on their families. They will be  remembering that horror for a long time. My friend from Florida talked  about the people who come back and meet each other since before World  War II.   Anti-Semitism, BDS, that kind of infamy should not be allowed  anywhere at any time.   Mr. Speaker, let us covenant together that not now, not tomorrow, and  not ever, never again will it be allowed. I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.
