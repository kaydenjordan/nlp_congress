 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Stephen Bates, who was Vermont's first Black sheriff and chief of  police. Mr. Bates was elected sheriff and chief of police of Vergennes,  VT, in 1879, where he served as a public official until his death in  1907.   Mr. Bates faced many obstacles on his journey to his elected  positions in Vergennes. Born in Shirley, VA, in 1842, historical  records show that he and his family members were enslaved on the  Shirley plantation. In August of 1862, Mr. Bates successfully escape  from the Shirley plantation. Several months prior to the Emancipation  Act of 1863, Mr. Bates courageously helped many other enslaved people  escape to freedom.   After the Civil War, when Mr. Bates was in the service of officers at  Harrison's Landing, Mr. Bates was employed by U.S. Representative  Frederick E. Woodbridge, of Vergennes, VT. Mr. Bates worked as  Congressman Woodbridge's coachman and moved with him to Vergennes in  1866. In 1871, Mr. Bates married Frances Mason of Elizabethtown, NY,  and had two children, Rose and Fredrick. The Bates family lived on  North Street in Vergennes until 1880, when their home was destroyed by  a fire. The residents of Vergennes showed much support to the family  following the fire, rallying to raise money to help them during that  difficult time.   During his time as chief of police, Mr. Bates was responsible for  some notable arrests, including ``Brooklyn Slim'' and ``Ottawa Red,''  two members of a gang of post office burglars. He also had in his  custody Oliver Curtis Perry, an infamous New York train robber of the  time. Newspaper articles describe Mr. Bates as the arresting officer in  murder, grand larceny, check forgery, and vagrancy cases in Vergennes  and the surrounding area. In 1897, Mr. Bates was awarded $100 by the  Assistant Attorney General of the Post Office Department for his  extraordinary work in arresting two people involved with robbing post  offices in Morrisville, Glover, and Windsor, VT, in 1894.   Though Mr. Bates dedicated his life to his community, he still faced  many challenges as the first Black sheriff in Vermont. During one  incident, a man tried to kill Sheriff Bates while he was responding to  a call. And while the man was charged with attempted murder, he was  found guilty of obstructing, beating, and wounding an officer.  Vergennes community members stated that Mr. Bates ``was almost entirely  a self-taught man, and in the discharge of the duties of his office was  cool and self-restrained, rarely if ever acting hastily.'' Despite  this, Mr. Bates was not well-compensated for his work and was required  to work a number of other jobs to provide for his family. As he was  skilled at handling and caring for horses, he managed a horse company  owned by Congressman Woodbridge's son. He also worked as a trusted  night watchman at a local bank, as well as a custodian. Uniquely  dedicated to his community despite the hardship he faced, Mr. Bates  also served as an appointed agent for the Humane Society, and he and  his family were active members of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in  Vergennes. Mr. Bates died from cardiac arrest while milking a cow on  June 10, 1907.   I am proud to honor the life and work of Mr. Stephen Bates. Though he  remains relatively unknown by many Vermonters, it is encouraging to  know that Vergennes and its residents came together not long after the  end of the Civil War to elect Vermont's first Black sheriff and chief  of police, who was an exemplary public servant and community leader. It  is a remarkable American story that I am glad to honor and celebrate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Dr.  Jack and Lydia Clemmons of Charlotte, VT. The Clemmons family's  positive impact on Vermont is powerful every single day, but I am  especially pleased to recognize them during Black History Month. The  Clemmons family has been instrumental in preserving and promoting  African-American farm heritage in my home State of Vermont, and for  that, I am extremely grateful.   In 1962, Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons moved to Vermont, where Dr. Clemmons  joined the University of Vermont's department of pathology and became  the second African-American on the faculty of the College of Medicine.  Dr. Clemmons is nationally recognized for his ground-breaking work in  perinatal pathology and cytogenetics. He has long advocated for  universities to implement recruitment strategies that attract and  retain more students and faculty of color. Mrs. Clemmons was the first  African-American nurse anesthetist at the University of Vermont Medical  Center.   During the same year that they began their careers in Burlington, VT,  Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons purchased a historic farm in Charlotte, which was  in need of significant repair and improvement. They raised five  children on their farm, while working hard to restore its many  buildings and working lands. For the Clemmons family, as 1 of only 17  Black-owned farms in Vermont, the work was always about more than one  farm; it was about the massive loss of Black-owned farmland in Vermont  and across the Nation.   To that end, Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons have worked tirelessly to ensure  their farm can continue under African-American ownership for  generations to come. They, along with their family, have also dedicated  themselves to fighting for racial justice and creating opportunities  for Vermonters to learn about Black arts, farming, heritage, and  culture. The arts are a particular passion of Mrs. Clemmons, who ran a  [[Page S855]]  shop in their town of Charlotte, which featured sculptures and other  artwork imported from Africa. Additionally, the Clemmons farm is now 1  of 22 official landmarks on Vermont's African-American Heritage Trail,  also serving as a multicultural arts center, with a gallery and  programming for all Vermonters to enjoy.   I am grateful to Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons for their enormously important  contribution to Black farming and cultural heritage in our State. I  wish the entire Clemmons family all the best today, and for generations  to come.                            ____________________
