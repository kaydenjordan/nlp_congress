 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, colleagues, I am very pleased to be joined  on the floor today by Senator Young. We are both members of the Foreign  Relations Committee, and both have an interest in Middle East security.  We have joined together on the floor today to give remarks and perhaps  have a short colloquy about a humanitarian crisis that is unfolding  before our eyes in the Middle East.   Today, inside the country of Yemen--a country that, frankly, not a  lot of our constituents give much thought to--every 10 minutes a child  under the age of 5 is dying due to preventable causes. Today, 18  million Yemeni civilians--two thirds of the entire population of this  country--cannot survive without humanitarian or protection support, and  7 million of those are on what we would call a starvation diet, which  means that on a daily basis they don't know where their next meal is  coming from. They don't have enough food to eat in order to remain  healthy. Three million have already fled their homes because of the  violence that has been caused by a civil war--that both Senator Young  and I will talk about--inside their country and the humanitarian  catastrophe that has resulted from that civil war.   This is one of four current famines that exists in the world today.  But I would argue that this particular humanitarian crisis is in some  ways the most relevant to the discussions we will have here in the  Senate because the United States is participating in the military  campaign that is, in fact, causing in part this humanitarian crisis.   The United States is an active participant with a Saudi-led military  campaign seeking to regain control of Yemen from a group called the  Houthis, who overran the capital and now control large portions of the  country.   We, of course, are allies of Saudi Arabia. The President will be  visiting Saudi Arabia very soon to solidify that alliance. But it is  time we started asking some really hard questions about the conduct of  the Saudi campaign inside Yemen and whether we are, in fact, helping to  create a humanitarian catastrophe on the grounds that is impossible to  defend on moral grounds but also is hard to defend based on national  security grounds as well.   Let's be honest about what is happening here. The Saudis are  deliberately trying to create a famine inside Yemen in order to  essentially starve the Yemenis to the negotiating table. Saudi Deputy  Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman said:         Time is on our side. Being patient is in our interest. We       have the supplies and we have the logistics and high morale.       The enemy does not have supplies and funds and is impatient.       Time is on our side and we will exploit the time to serve our       interests.    What are the Saudis doing to try to exploit this question of time and  supplies? First, they are coming directly after the main port city,  which brings 70 percent of food into Yemen and about 80 percent of all  of the oil. That port city is called Hodeidah.   Senator Young has been very good in meetings to draw issue with what  is believed to be deliberate targeting by the Saudis of the cranes and  infrastructure in this port which allow for the supplies to come off of  boats and move into these desperately, desperately needy areas of the  country.   Second, they are requiring an additional screening process for this  humanitarian aid above and beyond the one the United Nations has put  into place. The United Nations is vetting supply ships coming in to  Hodeidah to make sure there is really food and aid on these ships, not  weapons, and it is working. But the Saudis are putting an additional  process on top that is adding up to a month from the time the aid gets  off the ship and into the country. Between that and the military  campaign targeting the port and its infrastructure, this has  essentially resulted in an effective blockade being put in and around  Hodeidah, such that humanitarian support cannot effectively get into  the country. But that is just the beginning.   The Saudi bombing campaign has deliberately targeted roads and  bridges throughout the country, many of them in and around north Yemen.  There are reports that the bombers have engaged in something called  double tapping, which is where you hit a humanitarian--a civilian-- asset. You wait until the workers come to try to address that first  strike, and then you hit it a second time to take out the civilians who  have responded to the emergency. This isn't just my opinion of the  situation. Representations have been made by multiple aid organizations  on the ground, and, more importantly, by U.S. officials who have been  embedded with the coalition.   This is a quote from Dafna Rand, the former Deputy Assistant  Secretary of State who was in charge of the Saudi coalition portfolio  at State:         In 2015, the U.S. Government offered technical training on       cyber, ballistic missiles, border security, counterterrorism,       and maritime security, [and] the precision guided       munitions were transferred in 2015 on the hopes that they       would enable better and more precise targeting by the       coalition of the targets  [[Page S2977]]       itself. [But instead,] what we have seen since is not an       improvement in the targeting, and the issue itself is the       target selection. It is not the precision of the target       itself, but it is the choice of targets and adherence to       the no-strike list.    That is a really important statement, a really important sentence,  because what is happening is that the United States is telling the  coalition: What are the civilian targets you should stay away from, so  the humanitarian aid can move into the country? The coalition is  deliberately ignoring that advice. It is not a matter of mistakes being  made on the ground, though there have been mistakes. It is also a  matter of a no-strike list being ignored.   I mention that this is not just about the millions and millions of  Yemenis who are starving today because of this civil war. It is also a  question of whether this is accruing to the U.S. national security  interests. Again, I am speaking just for myself on this matter.   We are allies of the Saudis, and there is no doubt that an Iranian  proxy state inside Yemen presents a threat to the Saudi State. There is  no doubt that Houthis have been launching attacks into Saudi Arabia.  This is a real security threat for our allies. But we do have to  acknowledge that there are other players that exist inside Yemen today.  It is not just the Houthis and those Yemeni forces supported by the  Saudis. There is also al-Qaida--a branch of al-Qaida we know well  because it has traditionally been the piece of al-Qaida that has the  most advanced threats to the U.S. homeland--and ISIS, which is growing  inside Yemen. They have taken advantage of this civil war to fill in  the ungovernable spaces.   Recently, with the help of the UAE, we have begun to hit back against  al-Qaida and ISIS inside Yemen. But for a portion of time, they  controlled a sizeable amount of territory and revenue inside that  country. ISIS is growing as well.   As a group of Yemeni Americans told me in my office about a year ago,  to Yemenis the bombing campaign is not perceived as a Saudi bombing  campaign; it is seen as a U.S. bombing campaign or, at the very least,  a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign.   So when responsibility inside Yemen is allotted and attributed for  this starvation campaign, it is placed upon the United States, as well  as on Saudi Arabia. We have to think about what that means, given the  fact that there is the potential for millions of Yemenis to be  radicalized in a place with very sophisticated radical infrastructure.  This is a real national security concern for the United States.   I think it is time for us to draw a hard line with this coalition and  say that we will not continue to support it if there is not a real  commitment made to change the way the targeting happens and to make  sure that relief supplies can flow into that country to try to address  this unfolding famine and humanitarian catastrophe. We can be allies  with the Saudis. We can be military allies with the Saudis. But they  have to understand and their partners need to understand that this  humanitarian nightmare inside Yemen is both immoral--to participate in  a campaign that perpetuates that kind of humanitarian crisis--but it  also, in the end, doesn't benefit the long-term security of the United  States or our partners in the coalition.   So we come down to the floor today to try to explain to our  colleagues what is happening on the ground and to see if there is a  bipartisan way for us to have a policy that brings significant relief  to the suffering of the Yemeni people and strengthens our national  security in the region.   With that, I notice Senator Young is going to say a few words, and  then I think we will engage in a colloquy.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana. I think he  walked through his thoughtful approach to this issue, which has led him  to cosponsor this resolution placing these very commonsense conditions  upon the transfer of further munitions.   I might ask him a question. In his list of steps he has asked the  Saudis to take--I have joined him in that letter, as have many of our  colleagues--amongst them is a commitment to not take military action  against the port of Hodeidah.   We both met with the Foreign Minister, who talked about the need to  use increased military pressure inside Yemen backed by U.S.  participation in the coalition to try to draw the Houthis to the table.  We have both expressed reservations about the effectiveness of that  tactic, and we have something to say about it because none of this can  occur without U.S. military support.   Can the Senator talk a little bit about our joint fears or his  personal fears about a major new campaign on this port that brings in  so much of this aid and how, in the end, that really doesn't further  the goals of the coalition, the United States being amongst the  partners?    I thank Senator Young for making it clear in his prepared  remarks that while we are focusing on the Saudis because we are part of  this coalition, the Houthis do not have clean hands here either. Part  of the reason humanitarian supplies have a hard time getting to places  that need them is because there are roadblocks put up by the Houthis as  well. And there is this known connection between the Houthis and the  Iranians--sometimes, in my opinion, a bit overplayed by some foreign  policy thinkers, but it is real.   To your second point in answer to my question, Senator Young, that  is, to my mind, also a likely result of a deepening of the military  conflict. If the Houthis had nowhere to turn, then the calculation  might be different, but because the Iranians are there as a support  system to lean on, a continued military campaign against Hodeidah would  push them deeper into a corner and just broaden the scope of the  military conflict.   There ultimately has to be a political resolution here, and by simply  upping the military ante and continuing the humanitarian crisis, you  get further away from that political negotiating table rather than  closer to it.    It goes without saying that it is in no one's interests  in the region for this civil war to continue at its current pace. So  this is an important moment at the beginning of a new administration,  with a pending arms sale on the table with the Saudis, to  [[Page S2979]]  use that transition moment and the leverage that exists with this new  proposal for major arms sales to the Saudis to make sure we get this  right.   I think there is nothing political about this. We all join together  in trying to abate humanitarian crises and famines around the world,  and we all want a policy that is going to bring an end to this civil  war because, as I said, it is just as important to remember that the  most immediate enemies of the United States--those terrorist groups who  want to do harm to us--find their most fertile ground today inside  Yemen. The sooner we can put an end to this civil war and be able to  have a central government structure that spreads across the scope of  the country, the quicker we can all be focused on trying to eliminate  the ISIS and al-Qaida presence--AQAP, as we refer to them--in Yemen  from that battlespace.   I say to Senator Young, I don't know if you have closing remarks, but  I appreciate your willingness to speak up and your leadership here, and  I hope we can get others on both sides of the aisle to propose and  support these commonsense conditions upon this new military transfer so  that we can get the situation right inside Yemen.
