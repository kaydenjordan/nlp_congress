 Madam Speaker, Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino, my  hometown of Orlando, Vegas, Parkland: Young Americans have grown up  associating these cities with pain and tragedy. They have only known a  Congress that is unwilling to address gun violence or be moved even by  the senseless murder of innocent children.   After car accidents, gun violence is now the second leading cause of  death among young people. This is a staggering statistic, and my young  constituents know it. They live in fear that their classmates, friends,  family members, or neighbors could be the next target. But instead of  sitting on the sidelines, young Americans have marched, mobilized, and  found purpose.   Today, their collective voices reverberated across the Halls of  Congress as the House, for the first time in decades, answers their  calls for commonsense gun safety measures.   I am proud to support legislation that will strengthen our background  check system to help keep dangerous weapons away from dangerous people.   By passing these commonsense measures, we are finally taking concrete  steps to defend the lives of these young Americans and guarantee them a  safer future.   As chair of the Future Forum, I thank every young leader who has  helped us get to this historic moment. We hear your pleas. We value  your activism. And we will keep fighting with you to end gun violence  once and for all.                            ____________________
