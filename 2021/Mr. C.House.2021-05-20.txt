 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  unequivocal support of our ally Israel.   As a sovereign state, Israel has every right and a duty to protect  its people from the unprovoked attacks of the Iranian-backed terrorist  group Hamas.   It is painful to watch the parents and their terrified children  fleeing to bomb shelters as rockets rain down indiscriminately on  civilian neighborhoods. Thankfully, our Israeli friends are protected  by the Iron Dome, a joint U.S.-Israeli defense initiative that has  saved countless lives.   It is shameful that some within our Congress choose to condemn our  longtime ally for simply defending themselves. No doubt, if a similar  attack took place in the U.S., these same Members would expect our  military to protect their homes and communities.   Sadly, we shouldn't be surprised when terrorist groups like Hamas  feel emboldened to attack our allies when the Biden administration's  policies signal weakness to our adversaries.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak up,  with one voice, in support of Israel, one of our great allies.                            ____________________     Scott Franklin               of Florida, Mr. Crenshaw, Mr. Steube, Mrs. Luria, Mr.               Moulton, Mr. Garcia of California, and Mr. Crow):        H.R. 3367.
