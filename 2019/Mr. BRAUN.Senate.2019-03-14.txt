 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  letter be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                                     March 14, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, I am requesting to be consulted       before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent       agreements or time limitations regarding H.R. 269, the Over-      the-Counter Drug Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. I       further request that this legislation not be incorporated       into any larger legislative vehicles that the Senate as a       whole may consider until the concerns I describe below are       fully addressed.        This legislation streamlines the outdated over-the-counter       (OTC) drug approval process at the U.S. Food and Drug       Administration (FDA)--a process originally developed in 1972.       Specifically, the legislation allows the FDA to approve OTC       versions of prescription drugs administratively, rather than       going through the lengthy notice-and comment-rulemaking       procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. The       legislation also encourages more innovation and investment in       the OTC space by providing an 18-month market-exclusively       component that rewards a return on investment for new OTC       drugs. The 18-month market exclusivity period is crucial to       creating a thriving OTC drug market; however, H.R. 269 does       not contain adequate oversight mechanisms to ensure that this       exclusivity provision is not abused by some OTC drug       manufacturers after the reforms of H.R. 269 are implemented       by the FDA.        Although the legislation encourages more innovation and       investment in the OTC space, it does not include any       conditions under which an OTC drug manufacturer would forfeit       eligibility for the 18-month exclusivity  [[Page S1894]]       period. For example, there is no ``failure to market''       provision for OTC drug approvals in the legislation similar       to the provisions applying to generic drugs under Hatch-      Waxman to prevent OTC drug manufacturers, who can otherwise       enter the market, from refraining to do so (a practice called       exclusivity parking).        Anti-competitive behavior--like exclusivity parking--has       disrupted the generic drug industry. In fact, exclusivity       parking has become common in the context of patent litigation       settlement agreements where proprietary drug manufacturers       pay generic drug manufacturers to delay entering the market,       allowing proprietary drug manufacturers to charge higher       prices for long periods of time (i.e. pay-for-delay       settlements). The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that       this behavior costs consumers $3.5 billion per year as a       result of higher brand-name drug prices. And even though the       process for obtaining OTC drug approval under H.R. 269 is       more straightforward than that for obtaining market approval       for a generic drugs--anti-competitive behavior (e.g.,       exclusivity parking) may creep into the OTC drug space if       Congress fails to include sufficient oversight mechanisms in       the legislation to ensure adequate accountability and       effective competition.        Modernizing the OTC drug approval process under H.R. 269       will benefit consumers and advance the public health;       however, H.R. 269 as currently drafted does not give the FDA       the necessary oversight tools to ensure accountability in the       OTC space. Including a ``failure to launch'' provision in       H.R. 269--that is, a mechanism that gives an OTC drug       manufacturer a reasonable amount of time to bring an FDA       approved OTC product to market--will protect the incentive to       innovate and invest, while also providing adequate       accountability. Indeed, to ensure effective competition in       the OTC space, Congress must provide the FDA with the       necessary oversight tools to prevent abuse of the OTC       regulatory approval process under the reforms of H.R. 269.        Thank you for protecting my rights as a Senator to weigh in       on this legislation, which has not gone through regular order       during my time as a member of the Committee to which this       legislation has been referred to in the 116th congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Mike Braun,      United States Senator.                            ____________________
