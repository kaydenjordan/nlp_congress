 Mr. Speaker, I promise to conserve time and  conserve the lake.   Mr. Speaker, Lake Pontchartrain is perhaps not a very well-known  lake. It is actually the second largest saltwater lake in the United  States, but it wasn't always this way.   Lake Pontchartrain, as a result of coastal land loss in Louisiana,  has had this intrusion of saltwater that has fundamentally changed the  ecosystem of that lake and the communities.   This is a lake that serves as a watershed for 16 parishes in  Louisiana, 4 counties in Mississippi, and most importantly, this lake  takes the brunt of the surge from 2 Canadian provinces and 31 States.   Mr. Speaker, what happens is each time we have these high-water years  on the Mississippi River system which drains 31 States and 2 Canadian  provinces, there is an emergency relief valve that sends water through  the Bonnet Carre Spillway into Lake Pontchartrain.   This isn't water that is coming from Louisiana. In fact, less than 1  percent of the water is even coming from the State of Mississippi. It  is water coming from all of these States, from Montana, to New York, to  Canada, and all of these States in this large watershed funnel in- between.   And so on average, the Bonnet Carre Spillway had been operated once  every decade; once every 10 years. Yet, in recent years, we have had to  open it four times, including last year. Last year, for the first time  ever, it was opened in January, and for the first time ever, it was  actually operated twice in 1 year.   And so this is in the State of Louisiana. This is this lake, this  basin, this watershed that has been taking it on the chin for the rest  of the country.                                time  1445    The reason this is important, Mr. Speaker, is because this lake is an  incredibly productive ecosystem with recreational and commercial  fishing. You see lots of folks out there in sailboats and other boats  out there enjoying the lake.   What has been happening as a result of all the Nation's water's  drainage coming into here is that the health of the lake has been  compromised and challenged, which therefore affects our fisheries, both  recreational and commercial, and the millions of pounds of crabs that  are harvested out of the lake.   This lake bounds New Orleans and Jefferson Parish. It bounds the  north shore and the river parishes, such as Saint John Parish and Saint  Charles Parish over on the west side.   This is an important part of Louisiana. Because of the coastal land  loss that we have experienced and the change in this ecosystem, we must  make investments to maintain this as we help to manage this rapid and  unfortunate transition from a freshwater lake into a brackish and  saltwater lake that we now have.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my good friend from California, the  chair of the subcommittee, Congresswoman Napolitano, and her staff,  Ryan. I want to thank Congressman Westerman, the ranking member of the  subcommittee; Ian Bennitt as well as Maggie Ayrea on our staff for all  the work they put into this; and, of course, Chairman DeFazio and  Ranking Member Sam Graves for all their work in ensuring that we get  this bill right and that we have the right caps on here to ensure that  the money goes to actually investing in the lake, as Congressman  Mitchell mentioned, as opposed to going toward bureaucracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bipartisan legislation that we  have introduced with my friend, Congressman Cedric Richmond of New  Orleans.
