 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Illinois, and I thank Chairwoman Castor for her exceptional leadership  of our select committee.   My colleagues have done a good job so far of explaining why we need  ambitious climate action that follows the science and meets the scale  of the challenge we face. However, I would highlight one climate impact  that is particularly important in the area I represent.   My district encompasses more than 50 miles of coastline in southern  California, North County San Diego, South Orange County. Our coasts are  a huge part of our communities. They drive our economies and are  critical to our way of life. But sea level rise threatens all of this.  It is accelerating the erosion of our coasts, which washes away beaches  and threatens critical infrastructure, like the Los Angeles-San Diego- San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor, also known as the LOSSAN Corridor.   The LOSSAN Corridor is the second busiest intercity passenger rail  corridor in the United States and the busiest State-supported Amtrak  route, with nearly 3 million inner-city passengers and 5 million  commuter passengers each year. $1 billion in goods and services are  also supported by the rail line.   At the same time, coastal erosion threatens the bluffs that run along  our coasts in San Diego County. Bluff collapses have, tragically, taken  the lives of eight people in our communities in recent years.    The impacts of climate change in coastal southern California are not  theoretical. We see and experience them every single day. I strongly  believe that we must take ambitious action to make our country more  resilient to climate impacts while transitioning to a zero-carbon  future, and we must do it now. We must do it now.   With President Biden's American Jobs Plan, we have a once-in-a- generation opportunity to do so. The American Jobs Plan, as proposed by  the President, advances real climate solutions that will make a  difference in the lives of our constituents. It will put us on the path  to meeting the challenge presented by the climate crisis while creating  2.7 million new jobs, the jobs of tomorrow in clean energy, the jobs  that will help us compete on the global stage. Those are the jobs we  need.   The American Jobs Plan will create them, but in order to achieve  these goals, in order to pass the American Jobs Plan as intended by the  President, we must not abandon the key climate provisions and  investments that the President proposed in his version of the plan. The  package must deliver on the promise to put our country on the path to a  100 percent carbon-free energy powered electricity grid by 2035.   We can do this if we include strong tax policies that incentivize  renewable energy generation. We can do this if we include clean energy  and energy efficiency standards that promote renewable energy and  reduce electricity use. We can do this if we include the policies and  funding to electrify cars, buses, and buildings. And we must include  the transportation sector. It is the largest source of greenhouse gas  emissions in the country.   We need significant investment to incentivize the sale of zero- emission vehicles. Specifically, we must ensure that 100 percent of new  light-duty vehicle sales are zero emissions by 2035, as envisioned  under the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act that I introduced last Congress  with Senator Jeff Merkley.                                time  2000    Moreover, the build-out of zero emission vehicle fueling and charging  infrastructure must go hand in hand with the deployment of the vehicles  themselves, which is why I strongly support the President's vision for  500,000 new charging stations across the country.   The American Jobs Plan provides us a pathway to finally achieve these  goals and to lead the world when it comes to vehicle electrification.  So without these key climate provisions, it is hard to imagine  supporting any package that comes before this Chamber for  consideration.   I am eager to help advance a strong American Jobs Plan that employs  our communities, follows the climate science, and matches the scale of  the challenge we face. I know my colleagues here feel the same.   Now is our opportunity to get this done. It is an opportunity that we  must seize.
