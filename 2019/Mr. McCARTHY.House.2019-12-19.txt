 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, in sharp contrast to yesterday, today is the first  time this Chamber can finally rally behind an overwhelming, bipartisan  legislative win since the beginning of this Congress.   More than a year ago, President Trump came together with the leaders  of Mexico and Canada to sign a transformative trade deal that would  revamp how we trade goods with our top two leading traders. Despite  delay after delay from our Democratic colleagues, Republicans never  relented.   We understood months ago that the United States-Mexico-Canada  agreement would deliver a much-deserved win for the American worker.  Today is for them. It is for our hardworking farmers who have early  mornings and long days maintaining their harvest and livestock. It is  for our consumers who will be paying less money at the checkout for  everyday goods. It is for generations of Americans that will be able to  enjoy a more prosperous and financially secure future for decades to  come.   And because of that Republicans fought. We spoke to our constituents.  We took to the floor to deliver speeches. I just did a report to see  the number of times in the last year USMCA was mentioned on this floor.  Ninety-one percent of all the times it was mentioned were from this  side of the aisle and 9 percent on the other. I want to congratulate  our members for never giving up.   We spoke about the wins the USMCA would deliver any chance we got,  and we stayed in close contact with the administration to ensure that  it would be the right deal worthy of the American workers' legacy.   Republicans also understood that the ratification of USMCA would only  make the United States stronger as we continue to negotiate a trade  with China.   I am glad today is here, but it is a year late. Mexico is our number  one trader. Canada is our number two. China is number three. For the  last year we have been trying to negotiate an agreement with China. Our  hand would only have been stronger if today happened months ago. I am  glad today is here, but the delay has hurt us.   As we move forward, another goal that President Trump continues to  make progress on is our negotiations with China. Today will make him  stronger and, hopefully, help his hand from the last year.   Our economy is booming, exceeding expectations on a regular basis.  Thanks to this President and Republicans in Congress pushing pro-growth  policies, we are living through the best economy in a generation.   Regardless, if you are a Republican or a Democrat, the strength of  this economy is undeniable, and that is a fact worth celebrating.                                time  1045    The ratification of the USMCA will guarantee that the trajectory  continues to move in the same positive direction.   After 25 years, a revised trade agreement was well past due.   I know other Presidents had promised they would be able to do this.  It is no small feat and not easy by any means, but it is another  promise kept by this President, and we want to thank him for his work.   When President Trump ran for office, passing the USMCA was a campaign  promise. Critics said it couldn't be done, yet he made it happen.  Another promise made, another promise kept.   I also want to commend the incredible support he had from  Congressional Republicans, especially our Ranking Member Kevin Brady  and the entire team he has on the Ways and Means Committee. They never  faltered, they never backed down, and they continued to work.   Madam Speaker, they never let the Democrat pushback hold them back  from delivering a major win for the American worker.   Today is a day worth celebrating. It is a day this House, after  nearly a year, finally checked their partisanship at the door to better  the lives of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady).
