 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third District, I rise today to recognize, ``Who is James  Holzhauer?''   James, a local Las Vegas resident, shocked the world with an  unrivaled run on ``Jeopardy!'' and he did it in a very Vegas fashion:  betting big, making some noise, and laying it all on the line.   Madam Speaker, with 32 straight wins and just over $58,000 shy of the  all-time record, James' ``Jeopardy!'' skills weren't the only thing on  display. His charitable heart was as well. He donated his time and some  of his winnings to noble local causes to improve the lives of our  southern Nevada kids, students, families, and community as a whole.   He even paid tribute to the victims of the tragic October 1 shooting  with the wager, as he put it, ``Vegas Strong, 10,117,'' as in 10-1-17.   James may have just missed the record, but he is a legend in our  eyes, and he did southern Nevada proud.   Congratulations, again, to James. And if I ever see him out at a  trivia night in Vegas, I will make sure to get him on my team. I will  buy the beer. He can handle the questions.                            ____________________
