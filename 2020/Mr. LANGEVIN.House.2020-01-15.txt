 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his exceptional leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act.   Age is just a number. We hear that all the time, and there is so much  truth to it. Yet, each year, too many Americans over the age of 40 face  discrimination at the office. In fact, AARP reports that over half of  older workers have seen or experienced age discrimination.   Congress outlawed workplace discrimination against older Americans  over 50 years ago in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. However,  due to a misguided 2009 Supreme Court ruling, older Americans still  face negative employment actions.   As the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission acknowledged in  2018, ``Age discrimination remains a significant and costly problem for  workers, their families, and our economy.'' This is simply  unacceptable, and it is wrong.   Employees over the age of 40 bring talent, experience, and wisdom to  an office. Additionally, these workers are more likely to stay at their  companies.   On average, Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 stick with their  employers three times as long as employees aged 25 to 34. Even more  disheartening is the effect age discrimination has on disabled workers.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Consortium  for Citizens with Disabilities in support of the bill.                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                      Jan. 15, 2020.        Dear Member of Congress: As co-chairs of the Consortium for       Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights Task Force, we write       to urge you to support passage of H.R. 1230, the Protecting       Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. We attach our       letter of June 10, 2019 in support of the bill. CCD is the       largest coalition of national organizations working together       to advocate for federal public policy that ensures the self-      determination, independence, integration, and inclusion of       children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of       society.            Sincerely,      Jennifer Mathis,        Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.      Samantha Crane,        Autistic Self-Advocacy Network.      Co-Chairs,        CCD Rights Task Force.

Kelly Buckland,        National Council on Independent Living.                                   ____                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                      June 10, 2019.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chair, Education and Labor Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Education and Labor Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: As co-chairs       of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights       Task Force, we write to express our strong support for the       Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA)       (H.R. 1230) and the Transformation to Competitive Employment       Act (H.R. 873). CCD is the largest coalition of national       organizations working together to advocate for federal public       policy that ensures the self-determination, independence,       integration, and inclusion of children and adults with       disabilities in all aspects of society.        POWADA would correct a Supreme Court decision, Gross v. FBL       Financial Services, Inc., that narrowly interpreted the Age       Discrimination in Employment Act to require that unlawful       discrimination be the ``but-for'' cause of an employer's       conduct in order to be actionable. Some courts have also       applied this but-for cause requirement to claims of       disability-based employment discrimination under the       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), making it harder for       people with disabilities to prevail on workplace       discrimination claims.        POWADA is an important opportunity to restore workplace       rights for people with disabilities. People with disabilities       have the lowest employment rates of any group tracked by the       Bureau of Labor Statistics, and their labor force       participation rate has consistently been less than half of       that of people without disabilities. Attitudinal barriers       among employers are among the top reasons for these low       rates. It is critically important to address barriers to       employment for people with disabilities, and POWADA would       help do that.  [[Page H261]]         We also support the Transformation to Competitive       Employment Act, which was discussed along with POWADA in your       May 21, 2019 hearing on Eliminating Barriers to Employment.       This bill would provide incentives to assist providers of       subminimum wage employment for people with disabilities to       transform the services that they provide to focus instead on       competitive integrated employment, and would make grants       available to state agencies to collaborate in developing the       services needed to support the individuals served by these       providers to secure and maintain competitive integrated       employment.        The Transformation to Competitive Employment Act represents       an important step toward ending the practice of paying       subminimum wages to employees with disabilities under Section       14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and expanding the       supported employment services needed to ensure that people       with disabilities who are served in subminimum wage sheltered       workshops to receive the services they need to secure and       maintain competitive integrated employment. This bill is       another important measure that would bring needed expansion       of real employment opportunities for people with       disabilities.        We stand ready to work with you to help secure passage of       H.R. 1230 and H.R. 873, both of which are important steps to       address barriers to full and meaningful employment of people       with disabilities.            Sincerely,      Jennifer Mathis,        Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.      Samantha Crane,        Autistic Self-Advocacy Network.      Kelly Buckland,        National Council on Independent Living.      Co-Chairs,        CCD Rights Task Force.      Mark Richert,        National Disability Institute.      Heather Ansley,        Paralyzed Veterans of America.     Mr. Chair, as it outlines, people with disabilities  already face significant barriers to competitive, integrated  employment, and we cannot allow another barrier to remain in their way.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to vote in favor of strengthening the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act, and I thank my good friend, Chairman  Scott, for championing this effort.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring justice for  American workers and voting in favor of final passage.
