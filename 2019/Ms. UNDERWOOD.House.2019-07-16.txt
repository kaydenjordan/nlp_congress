 Mr. Speaker, in my district in northern Illinois, many  farmers are struggling with the challenges that come from a delayed  planting season and an uncertain market.   But, recently, Kaylee Heap invited me to her family's farm to share  her story about yet another challenge: healthcare costs.   Kaylee and her husband, Kevin, own a pumpkin farm in Minooka,  Illinois, and Kaylee dreams of being able to work on the farm to grow  their business.   Unfortunately, that is not an option because health insurance is too  expensive for them to purchase on their own--easily over $20,000 per  year in my district--so Kaylee works for an outside employer in order  to afford health insurance for their growing family.   Having to make the choice between entrepreneurship and healthcare is  unacceptable, and that is why I introduced the Health Care  Affordability Act, H.R. 1868, to reduce insurance premiums.   My bill would reduce premiums by hundreds of thousands of dollars for  approximately 20 million Americans, 39,000 of whom reside in my  district.   A typical Illinois family like Kaylee's would see their premiums cut  in half, saving over $750 per month--and that is real money.  [[Page H5835]]    Mr. Chair, Americans shouldn't have to wait for lower healthcare  costs. We need to pass the Health Care Affordability Act now.                            ____________________
