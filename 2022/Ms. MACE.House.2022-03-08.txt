 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Buck  Limehouse, a beloved member of the Charleston community, public servant  to the State of South Carolina, and a fellow graduate of the Citadel,  the military college of South Carolina.   Buck served as a commissioner from the First Congressional District  for the South Carolina Department of Transportation and would later  serve as South Carolina's first Secretary of Transportation. He even  started the State infrastructure bank, the first of any State in the  Nation. His leadership was instrumental in the implementation of  several transportation projects across the State of South Carolina.   Buck was a pillar of the Charleston community, the consummate  entrepreneur. While he will be sorely missed, his legacy will live on  in our State for decades to come. I offer my sincerest condolences to  the Limehouse family.                      Recognizing Beaufort Film Society     Madam Speaker, I rise today because for over three decades  Beaufort has served as the backdrop for major motion picture films,  including Forrest Gump, The Big Chill, and of course Pat Conroy's The  Prince of Tides.    Today I rise to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Ron  Tucker and his team at the Beaufort Film Society.   This past month, the society recognized aspiring filmmakers of every  genre at the 16th Annual Beaufort International Film Festival,  showcasing Beaufort's sweeping marsh vistas and quiet charm to visitors  from all over the world.   Over 10,000 attendees from four continents, eight countries, and 32  States gathered at the University of South Carolina-Beaufort for this  incredible exhibition of independent films and documentaries.   After such a spectacular festival this year, I know the global film  community is looking forward to coming back to Beaufort next year.                        Coastal Carolina Eagle Scouts     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 98 Coastal  Carolina Eagle Scouts, including their first female Eagle Scouts, which  totaled six young women from our area to achieve this distinct honor.  It was an honor to meet these women just a few weeks ago.   Only about 6 percent of Scouts achieve the Eagle rank, and as the  first woman to graduate from the Citadel, I can appreciate the special  challenges inherent with being one of the first women anywhere.   As a conservationist, I am also pleased to inform the House of  Representatives that over half of the projects completed by the Eagle  Scouts in the Charleston area were conservation, climate, and  environment-related. In reaching this goal, these Scouts completed over  21,000 hours of volunteer work in their communities.   I commend their efforts, and I was glad to congratulate each of them  in person just last month.                              Crisis in Ukraine     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the rising crisis in  Ukraine. I want to recognize President Zelensky and the people of  Ukraine for their valor, for putting it all on the line to defend their  freedom, their country, their democracy. We have seen people from all  walks of life, all ages defending their country and their homeland.   As much as I dislike social media, I think it has really influenced  how quickly we have responded to sanctions, not only us but our allies.  I commend us and our allies, our friends and partners around the world  for doing that, but more needs to be done.   Upwards of 600,000 barrels of oil a day are imported into our country  from Russia. Vladimir Putin funds his war machine, his wars and his  invasions of Ukraine and elsewhere through the oil and gas economy, so  every gallon that we fill in our cars today from Russian gas has the  stain of blood from the Ukrainian people. I can't think of one person  in the State of South Carolina who wants to put one more gallon of gas  in their car from Russia.   I am encouraged to see the administration today is looking more  seriously and may announce a moratorium and ban on Russian imports of  oil and gas, and we need to do that, but the administration should be  concerned about getting jobs here going to Texas, going to South  Dakota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, American jobs, and not a job in  Venezuela. Venezuela is aligned with Russia. They are an ally of  Vladimir Putin. We shouldn't be seeking jobs for Venezuela and Saudi  Arabia to replace Russian oil when we have those jobs right here in our  country or our neighbors to the north in Canada, who are not aligned  with Russia, who do not support Putin. Replacing one bloody regime with  another is just wrong.   We need to be able to keep costs down. We should not be dependent on  kowtowing to global dictators. When I look at the rise of inflation,  the cost of goods over the last year is up over 100 percent, gasoline  over 80 percent, coffee over 70 percent. Every single crisis our Nation  is facing today, whether it is Ukraine, whether it is Afghanistan,  whether it is the border, is a direct result of President Joe Biden's  failed policies in his first year in office, and it has got to end  today.                            ____________________
