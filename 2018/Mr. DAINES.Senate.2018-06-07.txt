 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Gary Dent of Pondera County for his over 42 years of  service in law enforcement.   Gary Dent was born and raised in Miles City. After high school and  college, Gary discussed entering the police force with a family friend,  and from there, he began his career in law enforcement. After 11 years  of serving around Montana, he landed in the Conrad City Police  Department where he spent over 30 years as their police chief. He and  his wife have one son named GR.   Gary's passion for his job is clear; yet it is his passion for the  community that sets him apart. While serving as police chief, he filled  his spare time by serving Conrad in any way he could, including by  spending time coaching middle school and high school sports teams.   Gary's legacy in the Conrad City Police Department will survive long  after his retirement. His favorite part of serving in law enforcement  was the interaction with folks in the community, and that did not go  unnoticed. He impacted many around Conrad and the greater Pondera  County community. I congratulate Gary on a career well spent, and I  wish him the best of luck in retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on July 23, 1962, a B-47 Bomber carrying  four  [[Page S3296]]  men on a routine training mission crashed into the southwestern slope  of Emigrant Peak, killing all on board. Crash debris still remains on  the unnamed ridge where these men lost their lives. After over half a  century, it is time that these men are memorialized for their service  so their families may have closure. Capt. Bill Faulconer, Lt. Lloyd  Sawyers, Lt. David Sutton, and Lt. Fred Hixenbaugh lost their lives  while serving our country. Naming the ridge in their memory will  forever remind Montanans and visitors of their sacrifice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on July 23, 1962, a B-47 Bomber carrying  four  [[Page S3296]]  men on a routine training mission crashed into the southwestern slope  of Emigrant Peak, killing all on board.
