 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the  Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. I want to thank Senator  Carper, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works  Committee, for his partnership on this bill. Our bipartisan bill would  help ensure that we have accurate information about the extent of  mercury pollution in the United States.   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. It poses significant ecological and  public health concerns, especially for children and pregnant women.  Mercury exposure has gone down as U.S. mercury emissions have declined;  however, levels remain unacceptably high in some areas. It is estimated  that nearly 100,000 to 200,000 children born in the United States have  been exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to  impair their neurological development. This exposure can impose a  lifelong disability.   In Maine, some of our lands and bodies of water face higher mercury  pollution compared to the national average. Maine has been called the  ``tailpipe of the nation,'' as the winds carry pollution, including  mercury, from the west into Maine.   A system for collecting information, such as we have for acid rain  and other pollution, does not exist currently for mercury, even though  it is a more toxic pollutant. A comprehensive national mercury  monitoring network is needed to help protect human health and track the  effect of emissions reductions. This monitoring network would also help  policymakers, scientists, and the public better understand the sources,  consequences, and trends in U.S. mercury pollution.   Specifically, our legislation would do the following: First, it would  direct the Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the  Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park  Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other  appropriate Federal Agencies, to establish a national mercury  monitoring program. This program would be tasked to measure and monitor  mercury levels in the air and watersheds, water and soil chemistry, and  in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms at multiple sites  across the Nation.   Second, our bill would establish a scientific advisory committee to  advise on the establishment, site selection, measurement, recording  protocols, and operations of the monitoring program.   Third, our bill would establish a centralized database for existing  and newly collected environmental mercury data that can be accessed on  the internet and that is compatible with similar international efforts.   Fourth, our bill would require a report to Congress every 2 years on  the program, including trend data, and an assessment every 4 years of  the reduction in mercury deposition rates that would need to be  achieved in order to prevent adverse human and ecological effects.   Fifth, the bill would authorize $95 million over 3 years to carry out  these activities.   We must establish a comprehensive, robust national mercury monitoring  network to provide the data needed to help make decisions that can  protect the people of Maine and the Nation. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this important bipartisan legislation, the  Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 1776. A bill to provide for the protection of and investment in  certain Federal land in the State of California, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
