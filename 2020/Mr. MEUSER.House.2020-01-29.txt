 Mr. Speaker, there are different definitions of  productivity at the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue at this point in  time.   Here at the Capitol, Democrat leadership seems to confuse activity  with accomplishment, spending years--years--trying to impeach and  remove a duly-elected President.   At the White House, just this week, President Trump delivered two  major accomplishments, a Middle East peace plan and the signing of the  USMCA.   The President's two-State peace agreement with Israeli leadership  protects Israel's security and ensures Palestine has a prosperous  future as long as it too seeks peace. It is the product of compromise  and is a promising solution for a long-unstable region.   The USMCA, just signed earlier today, opens new markets for American  goods, levels the playing field for North American trade, and creates  jobs nationwide. It is great for our country and it is great for  Pennsylvania.   As was stated very well earlier this week: ``Imagine if all the  energy from this impeachment was used to solve the problems of the  American people.''                            ____________________
