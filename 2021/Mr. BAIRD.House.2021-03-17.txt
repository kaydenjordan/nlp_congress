 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Indiana Secretary of  State Connie Lawson.   Since 2012, Connie has overseen Indiana's elections and modernized  how Hoosiers and businesses interact with the State. Connie championed  comprehensive election reforms that included election security and  expanded our voting access for Hoosiers.   Connie is a fierce advocate for Hoosiers to be financially literate  and has advocated high schools offer a free financial class to all  students.   Connie modernized State government departments by implementing an  efficient one-stop portal for businesses to register, file, report, and  make payments to State agencies.   Prior to being secretary of state, Connie served 16 years in the  Indiana State Senate and, before that, was clerk of the Hendricks  County Circuit Court.   I congratulate Connie on her retirement. On behalf of all Hoosiers,  we will miss your 33 years of dedicated public service.                            ____________________
