 Madam President, first, I thank my colleague. I was  asked by my colleague from North Carolina if I would agree with his  remarks, and he said he thought so. I definitely do. I think Erdogan is  doing very bad things to the Turkish people, to our NATO alliance in  the Middle East. He has had a vehemently anti-Israel position. To allow  him to get away with all of this stuff without putting maximum pressure  on him makes no sense. So I thank my colleague from North Carolina.
