 Madam Speaker, we are beginning November here. What  does November mean? It varies from city to city, but it means the Hmong  New Year.   Madam Speaker, I call to my colleagues' attention that some time  during November or December, if you have a Hmong population close by,  they will be celebrating their new year. I encourage everyone to show  up and learn more about Hmong culture, their beautiful dress, great  clothes, and great music.   Our country always has a debt to pay to the Hmong, who fought during  the Vietnam war against totalitarian atheism, the most evil form of  government we have ever known. Afterward, they came to our country.   Wisconsin has the third most Hmong in the country, and I have gotten  to know many. I have yet to run into a Hmong family--I am sure they  must exist--that was not doing very well. Everyone was getting married,  having children, living the American Dream.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate my Hmong friends. I look forward to  celebrating separate the new year in Oshkosh and Sheboygan. I hope that  anyone listening out there finds their local Hmong New Year  celebration.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment would increase and decrease  the Section 8 housing program to call for a U.S. Government  Accountability Office study on: first, the marital demographics of HUD- administered housing program beneficiaries;   Second, the existence and effects of any marriage penalties for  means-tested housing benefits administered by HUD--in here, we are  getting not only the Section 8 but also the 42 credits and that sort of  housing-- Third, any recommendations and policy solutions for reducing  marriage penalties within the HUD-administered programs.   In the last 80 years in this country, we have had what I believe are  means-tested programs. The practical effect is to discourage marriage  and, in particular, discourage men from getting involved in their  children's families.   I remember touring a low-income housing project about 5 years ago,  and the woman who was administering it, who was a crackerjack girl,  really tremendous job, but she pointed out one of her major goals is to  make sure she had no men in any of the housing units.   I can believe that a lot of those men, since they weren't husbands,  were maybe causing trouble, maybe doing drugs. It brought home the fact  that right now an effect, and sometimes goal, of low-income housing  projects is to keep men away from their families. This is, of course,  only one.   I am highlighting the housing programs because we are dealing with  HUD right now. It is, of course, true of all sorts of other income- transfer programs as well. Food stamps, medical programs, and Pell  grants all come with their marriage penalties.   We want to focus on this. We want to see if this is a program that  largely benefits people who are not married, largely benefits families  without men in them. We know that there was a powerful group in this  country, whose prescribed purpose, they said, was to get rid of the  Western-prescribed nuclear family. We know under Marxism, one of the  goals is to get rid of the family.   The purpose here is we want to have hard statistics, a GAO study, on  the degree to which we are penalizing families with both parents there.   Madam Chair, we have all sorts of statistics here. My only comment is  that, A, it is a little bit more difficult for a child, a little bit  more of a tough row to hoe in life if they don't have a man at home.   I think one of the problems we have in some of our inner cities today  that not only affects the children, but it affects the parents, because  I think for a lot of people the most important thing they do in their  life and their motivation for life is getting involved in their  children's families, and right now the low-income housing program as  well as other income-transfer programs are designed to deny men a role  in their children's lives.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, let's look at the big picture here for a  second.   In the year that just wrapped up, the year ending September 30, the  Federal Government was borrowing 22 percent of every dollar it spent.  That should shock and scare people to death.   We reached a neat agreement that I maybe think the Republicans should  be  [[Page H5507]]  paying a little more attention to on the debt limit increase. In that  debt limit increase, there is going to be a mild cut in spending,  discretionary spending. Even if we stick to that amendment, we will go  from borrowing 22 percent of everything we spend in fiscal year 2023 up  to 23 percent, another percentage increase in the next year.   In other words, we have a pretty scary situation going on here. I  think as we approach all these bills, our goal should always be to  spend a little less money. It is kind of frustrating when you hear  people wanting to spend more money.   Madam Chair, perusing this bill, there seems to be one area that is  obviously not the Federal Government's business, which is that of the  Community Development Block Grant program. I cannot imagine why it  would be the Federal Government's business to get involved in housing  or any other sort of construction on a local level.   We are broke, broke, broke out of our mind, and getting more broke  every minute. Actually, some of our States are running surpluses. I  know Wisconsin right now has a tremendous amount of money, so I thought  we could look at the Community Block Grant Program. President Trump, or  at least his finance director, tried to get rid of it altogether.  Because I am so easygoing, I thought we would introduce an amendment  just to reduce it by half, which would save $1.65 billion in the next  fiscal year.   I think one would be hard-pressed to say that these programs have  been effective. Like every program that is paid for on a Federal level  but administered on the local level, they have all sorts of rules  involved that make things unnecessary, costly, and take a longer period  of time. Insofar as it is a good program, the States and locals will be  able to do it.   I have a list here of things that I don't think we were anticipating  when this program began: $500,000 to expand Niagara County brewing;  $276,000 to fund a skateboard park in North Adams, Massachusetts;  $500,000 in corporate subsidies to persuade Procter & Gamble's Natura  acquisition to move to Fremont, California, probably from some other  city around this country.   In any event, I think this is a small effort at spending a little bit  less money and weaning the local governments off the Federal  Government. If they want to do their own stuff, they can.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I love my colleagues, but the States right  now--at least Wisconsin big time--are running a surplus. If the State  of Wisconsin feels they need more government involvement in building  things, they are perfectly capable of appropriating their funds on  their own. If the individual cities want to subsidize one part of town,  they are perfectly capable of doing that on their own. There will be  less paperwork, and it will be done quicker and at lower costs without  Federal Government involvement.   Again, I emphasize that we are borrowing over 22 percent of what we  spend as it is. Our goal shouldn't be to look for more things for the  Federal Government to do. Our goal should be to go through each and  every one of these appropriations bills to look for less before the  value of the dollar completely collapses.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
