 Mr. President, yesterday, many of us in the Senate had  the opportunity to meet with the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United  States.   It was an opportunity for many of us to express our admiration for  the commitment of the Ukrainian people to the sovereignty of their  country. They are motivated by the love of their country and a passion  for freedom. Their President, President Zelenskyy, has shown courageous  leadership. He has been inspirational as we have watched how he has put  his own life at risk in order to serve his country. He has put country  before personal safety.   Ukraine versus Russia, good versus evil, this unprovoked attack on a  peaceful sovereign country, orchestrated by Mr. Putin. We are not  surprised. It was widely publicized, the use of his playbook. We knew  what he was doing hour by hour in planning the invasion on Ukraine. It  doesn't diminish the tragedy of Mr. Putin's actions. This is Mr.  Putin's war, and he must be held fully accountable for what he has  caused.   I want to thank President Biden for his extraordinary global  leadership on this issue. We have seen unity among our alliance, and we  have seen global unity in condemning Mr. Putin's actions, which is so  important in order to put the right focus on who is responsible and who  can end this tragic war.   We have imposed the strongest set of multilateral sanctions ever on  Russia's leaders and institutions. We have cut off many of its banks  from the Swiss system of banking. We have put personal sanctions on Mr.  Putin and his enablers. We have frozen assets around the world. We have  isolated Russia from international organizations and events. We have  restricted airspace to Russian aircraft. All that has been done not  just by the United States but in conjunction with our allies around the  world, and it is having a major impact on Russia.   We have seen unity in NATO. I think Mr. Putin thought that his  campaign in Ukraine would weaken the NATO alliance. It has done just  the opposite. It has strengthened the NATO alliance. We have sent NATO  troops to the countries that border Russia that are members of NATO to  make it clear that we understand our collective obligation under  article 5 of the NATO treaty: an attack on one is an attack on all, and  we will come to each other's mutual defense.   And we have seen many countries that have been reluctant to get  involved in war-type activities change their position because they  realize how clear it is what Russia is doing violates every  international commitment and jeopardizes not just the integrity of  Ukraine but the integrity of Europe, the integrity of sovereign states  around the world.   So let me point out just one of our NATO partners, Germany. Germany  canceled--put on hold Nord Stream 2. We know Mr. Putin has used energy  as a weapon. He has weaponized the source of energy he has in his  country. He has done that several times. Nord Stream 2 would give him  additional wealth and energy--stopped by Germany. But Germany has gone  further than that. For the first time, now they are going to be  supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine, recognizing that all of us have a  responsibility to help Ukraine in its hour of need.   And, yes, Germany has now made a commitment that we have asked all  NATO nations to do, devote 2 percent of their economy to our mutual  defense, and Germany is now stepping up to meet that 2 percent  commitment. That is what we are seeing from NATO partners.   Turkey is going to block the use of warships from being able to use  its waters in order to get engaged in the conflict; that is, Russian  warships.   We have seen non-NATO countries step up to the plate. We are very  pleased with the global response, Finland's response, Switzerland's  response. This is unprecedented that we had this type of global unity  saying to Mr. Putin: Stop this invasion, an unprovoked attack on a  peaceful nation. Stop it.   Now, the consequences of our action have had major impact on the  Russian economy. Their interest rates have gone up dramatically. The  value of their currency, the ruble, has fallen dramatically. Their  economy is suffering dramatically. And when the Russian people want to  know who to blame as a result of their economy going into the tank--one  person, the person who caused this war, Mr. Putin.   The Ukrainians are defending their country and have disrupted Putin's  military expectations. These are really people motivated for the right  reasons to defend their country, and they have been able to do amazing  things in stopping Russia's advancements. That is because of the will,  determination, and bravery of the Ukrainian people.   They need our help, and they need the help of our allies in supplying  the necessary military equipment in order to defend themselves. We know  how many Russian tanks are out there, and we know how many Russian  aircraft are out there. They need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons,  and they need ammunition. They need a lot in order to defend  themselves, and we and our allies need to step up to make sure they  have what they need.   They also, by the way, need humanitarian aid. We know that there are  already over several hundred thousand refugees who have escaped the  violence in Ukraine and have gone into neighboring countries. It is  estimated that number could grow into the millions. We need to work  with the international community in regard to the humanitarian needs of  the refugees. We also have to realize that Ukraine's supply chain has  been totally disrupted. We need to provide humanitarian aid within  Ukraine, get it to the border, and work with the Ukrainian officials so  they can get it inside the country. That is our responsibility in order  to help in this hour of need. We need to do even more than that, and  there are additional steps that we can take.   We need to continue to ratchet up the sanctions that are being  imposed against Mr. Putin and Russia. As I said earlier, these  sanctions are severe today, and we need to consider doing more. The  administration is already setting up a process by which we can trace  laundered assets so that, when we say we are going to freeze the assets  of those who are being sanctioned, we will find those assets wherever  you try to hide them. We are going to work with our allies around the  world in order to make it clear that there is no safe haven for you to  hide your wealth.   We need to continue to build on individual sanctions. We know that.  Individual sanctions mean a great deal, and there are others who need  to be sanctioned. Yes, I think we need to consider the oil and gas  industry as to how we can make it clear that we are not going to let  Mr. Putin benefit from his assets.   Trading policies need to be reevaluated. A country that invades  another country without any provocation whatsoever should not be  entitled to normal trade relations with the United States, and we  should be looking at how we can enforce those types of changes.   Yes, there needs to be personal accountability. It has now become  quite obvious that Mr. Putin has had no regard whatsoever for civilian  casualties. In fact, there have been reports that he may have targeted  civilians in his effort to gain control of Ukraine. We  [[Page S869]]  need to make it clear that, if the facts are there, we will pursue  potential war crimes. No one should escape accountability. We should  hold those who are responsible for these tragedies accountable for  them.   Let me make it clear. As Mr. Zelenskyy has said, the President of  Ukraine, we will always look for a diplomatic way to end this war. We  want this war never to have started, and we want it to end as soon as  possible. We will look in any way we can for a diplomatic end to this  war--preserving the sovereignty of Ukraine.   We recognize that Mr. Putin's war has brought to our attention other  issues that we need to really pay attention to. One is the energy  policy of Europe and the United States. I have heard my colleagues talk  about this, but the right answer is energy independence, investment in  renewable energy sources, so that we can not only protect our national  security but so that we can also protect our environment. We need to  make those investments moving forward so none of our allies ever has to  rely upon an autocratic government's supply of oil or gas.   I want to underscore the importance that was brought to our attention  yesterday. There was a parliamentarian from Ukraine who was there who  said: Thank you so much for the Magnitsky sanctions that you have  imposed on individuals because that really hurts.   Well, we are proud because it was this body that initiated the  Magnitsky sanctions.   Let me remind my colleagues that our law expires at the end of this  year. Now is the time to expand and extend the Global Magnitsky law. We  need to protect our supply chains. We saw that during the coronavirus,  but we also recognize, with supplies in autocratic countries, that we  need to shore up our own supplies and make them in America. We have  legislation that has passed the House and Senate. Let's get that bill  to the finish line. That would be so important for our national  security.   Our immediate priority: Let us all stand with the people of Ukraine  in their struggle for freedom. They have not only our admiration, but  they have our support. We want to do what we can, and we stand with the  people of Ukraine.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a  rare event happening this Saturday at my home synagogue of Beth Tfiloh  in Pikesville, MD. At what is the largest Modern Orthodox Synagogue in  America, with over 1,200 members, we will install only the fourth  senior rabbi since the founding of the congregation in 1921.   In Judaism, a rabbi is a leader or teacher. ``Teacher'' is the  literal translation of the word. He or she is a spiritual guide for the  community through spiritual learning and religious exploration. Our  rabbi is an integral part of all life-cycle and congregational events.   Rabbi Chai Posner was selected by a unanimous vote of the members of  the Beth Tfiloh congregation as the next spiritual leader of our  synagogue in September 2019, just before the pandemic transformed our  world. While his official installation will take place on Saturday,  March 5, Rabbi Posner officially became the senior rabbi of Beth Tfiloh  Congregation and dean of the Beth Tfiloh Dahan Community School on  January 1, 2022.   Originally, from Brooklyn, he has been a member of the Beth Tfiloh  clergy since 2010 and is often described as ``wise beyond his years.''  Rabbi Posner represents the next generation of leadership in our  community. He has a keen understanding of where the community has been  and where we are heading.   In a recent interview with local Jmore Baltimore Jewish Living, he  described the legacy he has taken on: ``One of the main reasons that  Beth Tfiloh has been so successful is we have stayed true to our  mission but have also adapted to the changing world around us. Rabbi  Samuel Rosenblatt, Beth Tfiloh's founding rabbi, was committed to  tradition, modernity, Israel, education, children and women's  inclusion. All of those look different today than they did 100 years  ago, but it's astounding to see that we are still committed to all of  these same principles.''   The other part of this spiritual transition, along with Rabbi Posner,  is Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg, who held the position of senior rabbi for  43 years. He will serve in the position of rabbi-in-residence through  December 2025.   What can I say about Rabbi Wohlberg? He has been a friend and a  counselor, a leader and guide for Beth Tfiloh Congregation and  Baltimore over the course of four decades--for my family and me as  well.   Through his legendary sermons and community involvement, his moral  leadership has inspired generations of community leaders. For 40-plus  years, he has led our community through the most joyous and most  painful moments in our lives, and everything in between. Through it  all, he maintains, ``we are supposed to serve God in joy.''   As for those sermons--on every topic imaginable and then some--they  stand as a legacy to Rabbi Wohlberg's love of scripture, his faith, and  the world as a whole. In one such sermon, he shared ``It is said that  actions speak louder than words. That may be so but words carry a lot  of weight. They are what makes us human.''   Rabbi Wohlberg also has embodied the spirit of tikkun olam--repairing  our world. I want to share one example among countless instances of how  he has transformed the lives around him.   A half-dozen years ago, Rev. Dr. Terris King of the Liberty Grace  Church of God in Ashburton reached out to Rabbi Wohlberg in fellowship.  This was a time when Baltimore was still healing from the death of  Freddie Gray and some national leaders chose to attack Baltimore for  their own personal gain. Rabbi Wohlberg and Dr. King connected over  faith, shared community and shared history. Barely 5 miles separates  the two congregations, but as the two clergy have explained: ``In some  ways, Ashburton and Pikesville are in two different worlds. But the  reality is, we are next-door neighbors. Maryland's recently maligned  [[Page S873]]  seventh district reminds us that there are no barriers separating  Baltimore City and Baltimore County; the only barriers are the ones we  establish in our hearts. We have discovered that getting to know each  other not only brings us closer, but helps us to learn from each other,  to better understand each other's lived experiences, and even to better  understand ourselves.''   The interfaith and interracial relationship between Beth Tfiloh and  Liberty Grace has grown stronger over the years, nurtured by Rabbi  Wohlberg and Dr. King. Branded as ``Building Bridges Across  Baltimore,'' volunteers from both communities have come together to  provide fresh produce and meals to West Baltimore residents, renovate  local schools, host local festivals and book fairs, promote reading and  writing partnerships, and work together to reduce violence. This model  of community involvement has maintained its focus of ``Working together  to improve the education and health of Baltimore children and families  [as] the only way we will improve the conditions of our city.''   Throughout Rabbi Wohlberg's four decades at Beth Tfiloh Congregation,  I especially have been struck at how he has made the children of our  congregation and our community a priority. During his tenure, the Beth  Tfiloh Dahan Community School has grown in both size and reputation.   Thanks in no small part to Rabbi Wohlberg's determination and high  expectations, in 2000, the school, which now serves children from  preschool through high school, was named a National Blue Ribbon School  of Excellence. It was 1 of 12 schools nationally to receive an award  for its special emphasis in technology.   On a very personal note, I am a third-generation member of Beth  Tfiloh congregation. Rabbi Wohlberg and I have been friends for years,  and my children and grandchildren have attended the schools. He  presided over the B'nai Mitzvahs of our children and the wedding of my  daughter. Rabbi Wohlberg is and will forever be an indelible part of my  family history.   As Beth Tfiloh congregation begins to write a new chapter in its  century-long history, I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations and  thanks to both Rabbi Posner and Rabbi Wohlberg.   Transitions are not always easy, but these two spiritual and  community leaders, who have worked side-by-side for so many years, have  forged a path forward that celebrates past successes and has the  community excited for the future.   As it says in Ecclesiastes Chapter 3, ``to every thing there is a  season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.''                            ____________________
