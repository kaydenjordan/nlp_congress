 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Puppies  Assisting Wounded Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act or the PAWS  Act.   Americans enjoy the blessings of hard-earned peace and liberty  because of our warriors who answer the call to defend our country. Our  men and women in uniform are a constant reminder of the true source of  our Nation's greatness.   In middle Tennessee, we have a proud history of military service. Our  veterans represent the very best of America, and they deserve our full  support when it comes to ensuring that they have access to the  resources they need to help them live a meaningful, productive post- service life.   It is widely acknowledged that the suicide rate for veterans is  tragically high, as 20 veterans are lost to suicide every day. We need  to address this problem.   No one can deny the emotional and psychological benefits of man's  best friend, but for our service veterans, that connection has an even  greater impact. Psychiatric service dogs paired with veterans suffering  from post-traumatic stress disorder have been shown to provide hope,  independence, security, and companionship.   As I travel my home State and speak with our Nation's heroes, I have  heard how service dogs help improve their quality of life, and I have  even heard that had it not been for their service dog, they wouldn't be  with us today. The PAWS Act would pair more servicemembers with quality  service dogs trained by reputable organizations.   Every veteran has earned a life after their military service free of  post-traumatic stress disorder that too often leads to suicide. In that  regard, we should do everything we can to ensure their well-being. In  my view, passage of the PAWS Act is a minimum down payment on what we  owe these brave Americans.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in letting our veterans know  that Congress stands with them on their path to healing.   I thank my colleague, Representative Stivers, for his leadership on  this bill and wish him success as he leaves the House next week.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the incredibly brave  patriots who keep America safe. This National Police Week, I want to  share my profound appreciation to members of our law enforcement  community, our officers, deputies, and troopers, and especially those  law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty  for the safety and protection of others.   America is the land of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.  For our Nation to remain strong, we must have law and order.   Low morale is permeating police departments across our Nation as  rioters and lawbreakers repeatedly vilify, demonize, and verbally  attack the thin blue line. I will tell you here today: any violence  against law enforcement must end, and it must end now.   Fair treatment in the justice system is critical, but it will not be  achieved by the defund the police movement and cop-free zones.  Lawlessness without police equals crime and the destruction of our  Republic.   In my State, Tennesseans know that the men and women who serve in law  enforcement are some of the best people in our communities. They run  towards danger, never away, and they risk their lives to protect us and  our families. Those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of  every citizen every day.   I thank our law enforcement officers for what they do every day, and  this National Police Week we respect, honor, and remember those we have  lost.                                time  1900
