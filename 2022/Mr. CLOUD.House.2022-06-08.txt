 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize an extraordinary  friend and great servant of the Texas 27th Congressional District,  Steve Meinhausen.   Steve came to Texas in 2004 with his wife, Carrie, and four children:  Matthew, Makenna, Kacey, and Ellie. Steve and his family brought  selfless hearts and an entrepreneurial spirit to our part of south  Texas.   Steve opened many businesses during his time, the most famous being  Stevie Lew's BBQ. In 2017, when Hurricane Harvey hit Rockport, among  his many generous community endeavors, Steve graciously opened his  restaurant to feed over 12,000 meals to volunteers and others in need.   Steve has built for his family a legacy of generosity, a sincere love  of God, and a strong work ethic. I thank Steve for all he has done for  the many people he has blessed in the Rockport-Fulton area. He is truly  a servant of God and an exemplary citizen.   It is my honor to recognize Steve for his outstanding service and  dedication to family, to community, and to our Nation.                            ____________________
