 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the tremendous  service provided by the Boys and Girls Club of Douglas, WY.   On April 22, 2023, the Boys and Girls Club of Douglas will host its  ninth annual Commit to Kids fundraising event. Douglas Mayor Kim Pexton  will be the emcee. Former Police Chief Ron Casalenda is the live  auctioneer. Esther Martin of Cheyenne, the Wyoming Boys and Girls Club  2023 State Youth of the Year, will also speak.   For over 20 years, the Boys and Girls Club of Douglas has made a  positive difference in the lives of children in Converse County. Every  day, the Club fulfills its mission ``to inspire all youth, especially  those who need us the most.'' The Club strives to help young people  reach their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring  citizens.   In September 2002, the Boys and Girls Club started meeting at a local  primary school. With an increase in membership, they then relocated to  the Douglas Roller Skating Rink. The need for a dedicated facility  became clear. In 2020, the dream of their own building was realized.   The Club's new facility, located at 802 Riverbend Drive, has over  13,000 square feet. The Club successfully funded the innovative new  space primarily with donations and private partnership funds. Designed  with the local youth in mind, the building provides a safe, nurturing,  and inspiring space to develop and learn. There is also administrative  space, a teen center, an arts and crafts area, tech room, game area, a  kitchen, and a gymnasium with climbing wall.   The Club serves 300 youth, ages 5-18, by focusing on three priority  outcomes: academic success, good character and citizenship, and healthy  lifestyles. Club members participate in afterschool, summer, and teen  programs with academic, career development, character and leadership,  sports and recreation, and homeschool curricula. Meals are provided for  all members who need them. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many kids fell  behind in their schoolwork. With the Club's reading program, students  were able to get back on track. Every August, there is no better place  to be than the Wyoming State Fair Parade in Douglas. I look forward to  seeing the Boys and Girls Club float, along with the bright and engaged  faces of its members.   Never losing sight of its values, volunteers, staff, and board  members remain dedicated to meeting the needs of children as they grow  into young adults. Today, the Club staff and board members include:         Jay Butler, Board Chairman        Travis Wells, Board Vice-Chair        Lindsey Hanks, Board Secretary        Catherine Nicholas, Board Treasurer        Carl Kosters, Board Member        Joe Schell, Board Member        Paige Rider, Board Member        Shawn Wilde, Board Member        Todde Moore, Board Member        Joe Burke, Chief Executive Officer        Robert Ricks, Unit Director        Carrise Moon, Special Programs Coordinator        Amy Lolley, Grants Manager/Marketing Specialist        Amy Rudloff, Bookkeeper        Tania Malone, Office Administrator        Heidi Toone, Kitchen Manager        Brendon Amble, Health & Wellness Specialist        Addy Sexson, Life Skills Specialist        Holly Winters, STEM Specialist        Baylea Senger, Art Specialist        Whitney Tomlinson, Teen & Workforce Specialist        Taylor Ward, Youth Development Professional        Zoey Redfern, Youth Development Professional        Katelynn Hill, Youth Development Professional        Hesston Haskins, Youth Development Professional    A special thank you to board chairman Jay Butler, along with his wife  Linda, who provided a matching gift of $100,000 in honor of this event.
