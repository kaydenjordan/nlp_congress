 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 104 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an       amendment numbered 104.    The amendment is as follows:    (Purpose: To remove the sunset on modification of work requirement                                exemptions)         In division C, in section 311, strike subsection (b) and       insert the following:        (b) Application.--A State agency shall apply section       6(o)(3) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C.       2015(6)(o)(3)), as amended by subsection (a), to any       application for initial certification or recertification       received starting 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified that there is  6 minutes, equally divided, to this amendment under the previous  agreement.   The Senator from Louisiana.    Madam President, the American people are the most  generous people in the world. In our country, if you are hungry, we  will feed you. If you are homeless, we will try to house you. If you  are sick, we will pay for your doctor. I am very proud of that, and I  know you are too. However, those who can work should work. Those who  can work should work.   A person without a job is not healthy, not happy, and not free.  History has demonstrated that the best social program is a job. The  best social program is a job. Free enterprise has lifted more people  out of poverty than all the social programs put together. So while we  should continue to be generous to our neighbors as Americans, we also  need to repeat and repeat often: Those who can work should work.   My amendment would make the food stamp work requirement in this bill  permanent. It would remove the sunset.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.    Yes, Madam President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute 11 seconds  remaining.    Thank you, Madam President.   I think we all know the June 5 deadline is a fiction. It is. We know  that. We know that the Treasury Secretary can take special measures to  extend the deadline until the middle of June, when tax revenues will  come in. I understand the need to go ahead and act, but we all know  that.   Let me say it again. Those who can work should work. Those who can  work should work, and that is all my amendment does.                          Vote on Amendment No. 104    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?   If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.    Madam President, it is late, and I will be candid.   To my colleagues, I say, not a single one of you is a dummy. Not a  single one of your mothers raised a fool, and if she did, it was one of  your siblings. We all know that a pay-go requirement for a regulation  that can be waived by the proponent of the regulation is meaningless.   This amendment will provide that the pay-go requirement cannot be  waived.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time is expired.   The Senator from Michigan is recognized.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 102 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an       amendment numbered 102.    The amendment is as follows:    (Purpose: To require up-to-date employment data for waivers of work                               requirements)         In division C, after section 311, insert the following:  [[Page S1891]]            SEC. 312. WAIVERS.         Section 6(o)(4)(A)(i) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008       (7 U.S.C. 2015(o)(4)(A)(i)) is amended by inserting ``, as       determined by the most up-to-date employment data'' before       ``; or''.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this amendment, there is 6 minutes of  debate, equally divided.   The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.    Madam President, this is the last amendment of the  evening. I have 3 minutes. I can read a room, and I can count votes.   This amendment would require States to use the most up-to-date  unemployment data for waivers of food stamp work requirements. Thank  you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.    Madam President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.    Madam President, I will accept a voice vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 102    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.   The amendment (No. 102) was rejected.
