 Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about  increasing insecurity in the Darfur region of Sudan and to call for  immediate action to prevent further violence and protect civilians.   As many of my colleagues will recall, in 2003 the regime of toppled  Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir began a vicious and deadly campaign  against his own citizens in the Darfur region. Millions were driven  from their homes, and hundreds of thousands killed and sometimes raped  by militia armed and supported by the government. In 2004 Congress and  the State Department stood united in determining that what was taking  place in Darfur was, in fact, genocide. Three years after that  determination, the United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in  Darfur, UNAMID, was established.   UNAMID has not been perfect. However, despite numerous obstacles the  Government of Sudan put in place under al-Bashir to obstruct the  mission's ability to carry out its mandate to protect civilians, UNAMID  has provided critical support for the people of Darfur. UNAMID  policewomen have served as trusted confidants for Darfuri women to  report sexual and domestic violence, and UNAMID soldiers have provided  a protective presence, deterring violence against civilians in areas  where they have been deployed. Overall, the presence of international  forces has reinforced some sense of security and stability for the  hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur who remain displaced, so that  that they can continue to live full and dignified lives. These efforts  have come at significant cost both in blood and treasure: 64 UNAMID  peacekeepers have been killed, and billions of dollars spent, in  support of the mission.   With the fall of Bashir, many had hoped that the situation in Darfur  would improve. However, those hopes have yet to be fully realized.  Violence in West Darfur in late December of 2019 killed dozens and  displaced an estimated 40,000 people. In January 2020, two separate  violent incidents in North Darfur were additional indicators that all  was not well in the region, as were deadly attacks on internally  displaced camps in July. In January of this year, communal clashes in  West and South Darfur resulted in the death of over 250 people and the  displacement of over 100,000. These episodes raise the specter of a  return to the catastrophic and genocidal violence that engulfed the  region in 2003. But instead of redoubling its commitment to Darfur's  long-suffering people at this critical time, the international  community risks abandoning them.   This past December, the United Nations Security Council made the  decision to dissolve UNAMID. Although it will retain a presence in the  region until it completes its full drawdown at the end of June 2021,  UNAMID's core civilian protection functions have now ceased. UNAMID is  to be replaced by the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance  Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS. UNITAMS is a Sudan-wide political mission  that is aimed at assisting with the transition. I agree that such a  mission is needed to ensure that Sudan's transition to democracy is  successful. However, supporting the transition and protecting  vulnerable civilians are not mutually exclusive, and the mandate for  UNITAMS could have included both. Unfortunately, Sudan's transitional  government refused to accept this course of action, and  [[Page S852]]  UNITAMS therefore lacks UNAMID's Chapter VII authorities to deploy  military tools in service of civilian protection and the advancement of  peace in Darfur. Officials in the transitional government at the  highest levels have argued that a Chapter VII mission is not necessary  because the security situation in Darfur has improved; that many of the  warring parties in Darfur have made peace with the Government of Sudan  through the Juba Peace Agreement; that Bashir's genocidal regime, which  bore primary responsibility for the crisis in the region, is no longer  in power; and that the transitional government is implementing a  security plan for Darfur that will adequately protect civilians.   I do not share this assessment of the situation in Darfur, and recent  clashes, as well earlier rounds of violence that have plagued Darfur  since Sudan's transition began in 2019, demonstrate that the region  remains fragile. Communal tensions over land, water, and political  power persist, and Darfur is awash in weapons. The government's program  to provide security to the region, including through its National Plan  for Civilian Protection, has yet to be adequately fleshed out let alone  implemented. Just last week, the UNAMID team site at Saraf Umrah that  was transferred to the Sudanese Government on January 21 was looted by  unnamed assailants, and all of the buildings on the site were  reportedly destroyed despite the government's prior commitment to  secure it. The Juba Peace Agreement, while promising, has not been  endorsed by all of Darfur's warring parties. And most worryingly, those  likely to be charged with protecting civilians in Darfur, including  components of the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces, RSF,  of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are the same actors that for years worked to  implement Bashir's campaign of terror and genocide in the region.   In this context, the United Nations Security Council's ill-timed and  poorly-conceived decision to end UNAMID's mandate--facilitated by the  Trump administration's lack of a well-thought-out diplomatic strategy  and approach--and to rapidly draw down the mission exposes the Darfuri  people to significant harm. It could derail Sudan's civilian-led  transition to democracy, resulting in another round of instability that  Sudan and the broader region can ill afford. That is why in February  2020 I led a group of Senators in writing to the Trump administration,  urging it to ensure that the U.N. maintain a mission in Darfur with an  adequate number of peacekeeping troops operating under a robust Chapter  VII mandate to protect civilians from violence; and that is why I am  raising the alarm again here today. The United States, along with its  international partners, must work rapidly to put in place mechanisms  that can protect Darfur's civilians until such a time that Sudan's  transitional government is capable of providing security to the region.   Fortunately, the plight of Darfur has long attracted the bipartisan  support of Congress and multiple administrations. At this critical  time, it is vital that our commitment remain steadfast. I hope to work  with the Biden administration to urgently address the security vacuum  created by UNAMID's drawdown and call upon Secretary of State Blinken  and United Nations Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to take urgent steps.   First, we must use our voice and vote at the UNSC to encourage a  temporary reauthorization of UNAMID so that it can carry out critical  protection of civilian functions, at the very least until it fully  draws down in June 2021. Second, we must work actively at the UNSC to  strengthen the mandate of the UNITAMS so that it includes robust  civilian protection mechanisms. Third, we should press Sudan's  civilian-led transitional government to develop a credible civilian  protection plan in Darfur that does not--I repeat, does not--involve  the RSF or any other forces implicated in violence in Darfur. Fourth,  the administration should carefully monitor progress on civilian  protection in Darfur and provide support where necessary, including by  considering how much of the recently appropriated $700 million for  Sudan needs to be set aside to support civilian security in Darfur.  Fifth, we must make clear to all that sustainable peace in Darfur  requires justice and accountability for past atrocities, no matter how  powerful the people implicated.   Mr. President, I strongly support a closer bilateral relationship  with Sudan and will continue, as I have for the past 2 years, to do  what I can to ensure the United States does its part to see to it that  Sudan's civilian-led transition to democracy is successful. We have  what may be a once in a generation opportunity. A healthy political  transition at the national level will only aid the cause of peace in  Darfur, and vice versa.   Mr. President, the situation in Darfur requires our urgent and  considered attention. Let us continue our strong tradition of  bipartisan support for the long-suffering people of Sudan at this  critical time.                            ____________________
