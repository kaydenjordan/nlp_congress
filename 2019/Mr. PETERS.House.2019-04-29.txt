 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today  to speak of the tragic shooting that took place at the Chabad of Poway  on Saturday. As the synagogue celebrated the last day of Passover, a  19-year-old terrorist walked in and opened fire with an assault rifle.   One woman was killed, and three others were badly hurt. Lori Gilbert- Kaye died while selflessly trying to protect her rabbi from the gunman.  She is recalled as a faith-filled, generous caregiver who put others  before herself. Lori died as she lived.   Yesterday I attended an event to honor local Holocaust survivors. As  I watched these brave men and women who survived Nazi Germany, I was  confronted with the tragic realization that  [[Page H3296]]  today in 2019, Jews are still being threatened by murderous white  supremacists.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence, but we must follow it  with action. We must act against gun violence and come together to stop  the rising tide of white supremacy that plagues our Nation today.   Please join me in a moment of silence.                            ____________________
