 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, along with the  American people, I oppose any reckless action that would lead us into  another endless war in the Middle East. And, yet, we now have thousands  more troops in the Middle East than we had before the President  unilaterally made the decision to kill Soleimani.   My prayers are with each and every American serving in harm's way to  keep us safe.   While I do not mourn the death of Soleimani, a terrorist with  American blood on his hands, the American people deserve to know how  this will make us safer. How will it make us safer?   Unfortunately, the President provided little clarity in his  statement, so we still don't know how this action will affect our  Nation's security.   I am against war with Iran. Another endless war in the Middle East  would be a grave mistake.                            ____________________
