 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  scheduling this time for all of us to address each other, as well as  address our country.   I rise to express my gratitude to the men and women of California's  10th Congressional District for allowing me the honor of serving them  and representing them here in our Nation's Capitol for the last 8  years.   Together, we were able to accomplish incredible things for the  Central Valley. The recent passage of the farm bill ensures greater  prioritization of the Central Valley and will help our farmers, our  farmland to keep the valley productive for future generations. The  bil includes my VET-2-FARMS Act; crop insurance, dairy, and specialty  crop protections; and several key animal welfare provisions.    We also advanced the debate on immigration reform. I am proud to have  stood with my friend, Pete Aguilar, as we fought to protect our  Nation's Dreamers and secure our borders in a bipartisan manner.   My Veteran Skills to Jobs Act, which passed in 2012, has helped many  veterans find employment using the skills that they learned while  serving their country. There is no greater way to show respect to our  men and women in uniform than allowing them to use the credentials and  the service and the expertise that they had on Active Duty to gain  gainful employment once they depart service.   We passed the Civilian Property Realignment Act, which allows us to  sell off the properties we don't need so we can reduce our debt,  including the first property, which was the Trump hotel, the old post  office.   The Passenger Railway Authorization bill, which forced Amtrak to run  more like a business, actually having pets on trains for the first  time, which allows them to create a new profit center.   The Sandy Recovery Act, which allowed us to not only serve in FEMA  reform, but actually allowed us to build smart policies across the  entire country so that we are building stronger communities resistant  to some of these natural disasters.                                time  1700    Additionally, in our own area, I am proud to have secured the funding  and authorization for the French Camp veterans healthcare facility,  which will start construction early next year.   We made real progress on the issue of human trafficking as well. In  our community, we have fought to make sure that we were working with  all levels of law enforcement, utilizing the best techniques to stop  the human trafficking, which has much larger impacts even in  California.   But to have Uber as a partner, now for the first time, the 10th  Congressional District has the technology available to align our law  enforcement with the victims that could be stuck in harm's way in an  Uber or some other type of transportation.   Through my work on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  we secured big wins for the 10th District: two different highways, $29  million in TIGER grants and BUILD grants for local roadways to improve  safety and ease congestion.   Last but certainly not least, for years now, for decades, we have  talked about water. It is the lifeblood of the Central Valley. If you  shut off our water, you shut off our farms, you shut off our economy.  We made big strides, securing funding, making sure that, with the WIIN  Act, we also passed the New WATER Act, allowing for the first time to  have an infrastructure bank so we can borrow money with a guaranteed  payback to build new water storage and new reservoirs.   You want green energy? Hydro is the greenest, most renewable energy  that we have. This is our opportunity to build Shasta with the $20  million upfront, and the new grant for $450 million for Sites  Reservoir. We need four to five million new acre feet of water. We have  the ability now to move that forward.   So some great progress as we move forward on Los Vaqueros, Shasta  Dam, Temperance Flat, and many of our irrigation districts that are  looking to expand, create green hydro energy, new recreation, new  water, and the future of the valley as well.   It has been my greatest honor to bring these achievements home for  the valley. Thank you, again, to my constituents and to all of my  colleagues, especially in the California delegation. We have come  together on many different issues to fight for our State. It has been a  big honor.   Let me end with saying this: I started my public service career  wearing the cloth of this great Nation, and I have been blessed, once  again, to serve this country in a new capacity. There is no greater  honor than being able to serve this body and fight for and represent  the American Dream that we have in our communities, and it is with  great respect and honor that I move into the next chapter of my life.
