 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Christiana Duarte. Christiana attended the Route 91 Festival in Las  Vegas on October 1.   She had recently graduated from the University of Arizona with a  degree in business marketing. While in college, she interned with the  Arizona Wildcats and was a member of the sorority Sigma Kappa. After  graduation Christiana worked for the Los Angeles Kings as a fan  services associate.   Friends and family remember Christiana as a bright, beautiful young  woman who was full of life and energy.   I would like to extend my condolences to Christiana Duarte's family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
