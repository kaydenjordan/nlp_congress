 Madam President, yesterday the White House released  its budget proposal for fiscal year 2020. Understanding the President's  key priorities and vision for Federal spending is critical to the  success of the entire funding process here in Congress.   Republicans agree that we need to remain focused on important goals,  such as the continued rebuilding of our military, keeping up the fight  against opioid abuse, and addressing the ongoing security and  humanitarian crisis at our southern border.   As the senior Senator from Kentucky, I was especially encouraged to  see the President's commitment to our Nation's veterans front and  center, including a request to fully fund construction of the new  Robley Rex VA Medical Center in my hometown of Louisville.   Together with my Senate colleagues, I look forward to carefully  reviewing the administration's priorities as this year's funding  process moves ahead.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Rao nomination expire at 12 noon tomorrow;  further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action. I further ask unanimous consent that if cloture is  invoked on the Beach nomination, all postcloture time expire at 1:45  p.m. tomorrow; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.  [[Page S1789]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation  by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a  criminal action pending in New York Federal district court. In this  action the defendant is charged with making threats, in the course of  telephone calls to former Senator Al Franken's office, to kill and  inflict bodily harm upon a former President of the United States. A  trial is scheduled for March 18, 2019.   The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's former  staff assistants who heard the statements at issue. Senator Franken  would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant former  employee testimony from his office.   The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other  former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant testimony  may be necessary, to testify in this action, with representation by the  Senate Legal Counsel of such staffers and Senator Franken.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 105, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 106, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 107, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  91 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the Coons amendment to  the preamble at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, moving right along, I ask unanimous  consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn  until 9:30 a.m., Wednesday, March 13; further, that following the  prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, morning business be closed,  and the Senate resume consideration of the Rao nomination under the  previous order.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic colleagues.
