 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his  work on this effort. I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle and the intent of what we are trying to accomplish.   Obviously, we are all very concerned and should be concerned about  what occurred on January 6, all of us who were here in the Chamber, all  of us who saw what unfolded.   My concern, and the reason that I am opposing this legislation, is  that I believe we have got a significant amount of power with our  existing structures in place, the Committee on Oversight and Reform,  the Committee on the Judiciary, and otherwise. While the investigation  is going on at the Department of Justice, we ought to be looking at  that and using those powers to do what we can to seek the truth  wherever it may lead.   I have questions right now for the Department of Justice. We have got  450 Americans who have been arrested. I don't know for how long, I  don't know how many of them are in jail, or for what period of time. We  are trying to look into that. I have sent letters to the Department of  Justice to get those answers.   I wish the gentlewoman who spoke, the chair of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform, would afford us the ability to call people  forward from the Department of Justice. Let's inquire as to what is  going on. Let's inquire about the investigations. Let's inquire about  the facts that have been found. Let's use the powers that we have and  the powers of this body and the committees we have to seek the  information and the truth, wherever it may lead.
