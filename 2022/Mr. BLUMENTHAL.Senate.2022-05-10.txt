 Mr. President, when I introduced the Women's Health  Protection Act in 2013--yes, in 2013, almost 10 years ago--the idea  that Roe v. Wade would be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court was  virtually unthinkable. We accepted 50 years of established precedent,  long-accepted law in this country--as something that was virtually  unimaginable.   Women relied on it. Our society took it as a core principle of our  constitutional law, much as Brown v. Board of Education, Marbury v.  Madison, Roe v. Wade, tenets and pillars of constitutional law in this  country. And when we asked nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, the  three most recent of them--and I personally asked this question--is Roe  v. Wade established law, they said to us that they would rely on stare  decisis, which for everyday Americans is, basically, we will follow  established precedent as articulated year after year by the U.S.  Supreme Court.   The now well-reported Alito draft of an opinion overturning Roe v.  Wade came like a thunderbolt, an earthquake, a seismic blow that  constitutional scholars thought was unthinkable.   The draft itself is strident and brash. It is disrespectful in a way  that Supreme Court opinions never are. It is unprecedented in its tone  and approach, saying that Roe v. Wade was egregiously wrong, failing to  accurately portray what it held and the reasons for its holding.   There is no question in my mind that the Court, in its final opinion,  will smooth the edges of that draft. It will try to tone down the  rhetoric. It will dress it up. But the result will be the same. No  matter how the Court may try to dress it up, it will have the same  impact on millions of Americans and their families because the U.S.  Supreme Court is poised to issue the most radical ruling in recent  history--perhaps in the entire history of the United States--the most  extreme contraction of fundamental constitutional rights in the history  of the United States.   Let's indulge ourselves for a moment in a belief in the American  dream and the exceptionalism of America, which is to expand rights and  liberties. The story of America is expanding freedoms and liberties for  all of us, not reducing it, restricting it. But this Supreme Court is  poised to eradicate a fundamental right that millions of Americans have  relied on for half a century. The Court has signaled that it will  inflict an enormous leap backwards, with incalculable costs and chaos  for countless women and their families. If the Court indeed overturns  Roe, 23 States have laws that would immediately go into effect to be  used to restrict the legal status of abortion.   Today, 90 percent of American counties already lack a single abortion  provider--not one in 90 percent of American counties--and 27 cities  have become so-called abortion deserts because people who live there  have to travel 100 miles or more to reach a provider. Without the  protections of Roe, this situation will become even worse for millions  of Americans. Women in Louisiana, just to take one example, will be 630  miles from the nearest abortion clinic. Women in Florida, Texas,  Mississippi, Utah, and many other States would be in a similar  position. Access to reproductive freedom will depend on a woman's ZIP  Code, not on her personal choices or her needs.   Abortion bans without Roe will disproportionately impact low-income  women in those 23 States poised to ban abortion.   Justice Alito--perhaps not surprisingly--fails to address the ways  that the Court's ruling will disproportionately impact communities of  color all around the United States. There is an issue here of racial  justice because these restrictions disproportionately affect Black  women and other racial minority communities. Today, fewer than 1 in 10  abortion providers are located in neighborhoods where the majority of  residents are Black. That is a simple, straightforward fact of life.  And the closure of clinics will make it only worse.   The simple fact is that Dobbs will turn back the clock. It will roll  back protections relating to fundamental rights.   May I say that the same people who argue that mask requirements  designed to protect public health infringe on their fundamental  liberties are perfectly happy sending the government into a hospital  room as a couple makes an incredibly difficult, personal life decision.  The same people who see masks as an infringement on bodily autonomy are  perfectly happy with the government telling a woman who comes to a  hospital, possibly in mortal danger of internal bleeding from an  ectopic pregnancy: You will have to die. No doctor can help you.   That is not bodily autonomy; that is not liberty.   After the Court's final decision in Dobbs, today's young women, the  young women of 2022, will have fewer rights than their grandmothers.  Young women today will have fewer rights than two generations ago. To  someone who recalls the seminal decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the  promise of that moment, it is unacceptable.   I was a law clerk to the author of Roe v. Wade in the term after he  wrote the opinion. Justice Blackmun and the Court decided by a 7-to-2  majority--7 to 2; Justice Blackmun was appointed by a Republican  President--that this right is fundamental. Whether you criticize the  decision--and there have been plenty of people who criticized that  opinion--it has been established law, relied on, incorporated in  precedent after precedent. And now, in the Women's Health Protection  Act, we ask that it be incorporated in statute, that the Roe v. Wade  standard be enshrined and embodied in a statute, just as Connecticut  did in its State statute in 1990--a law that I championed when I was in  our Connecticut State Senate.   In lieu of well-established Supreme Court precedent, Justice Alito  relies on a 17th-century English jurist who advocated for marital rape  and who tried women for witchcraft. This isn't just judicial activism;  this is extremism. This is fringe history cloaked in a judge's robe.  [[Page S2397]]    And do you know what is conspicuously absent from Justice Alito's  radical draft opinion? What is absent is women. Justice Alito gives  absolutely no credence to the empirical evidence before the Court-- evidence offered by health experts and economists who demonstrate the  ways in which women have relied upon abortion access to make decisions  about their health, their lives, their careers, and their future.  Instead, he gestures at the fact that women have the right to vote as  evidence they don't need the right to control their lives and their own  bodies. I am sorry, but the right to vote is where rights begin; it is  not where they end.    And we know the truth, whether or not Justice Alito acknowledges it:  The Court's world without Roe would not just impact one segment of  society, one demographic, one geographic area; it will affect all of  us. One in four American women will undergo an abortion in her  lifetime--one in four.   To the men of America, all of you love someone, you know someone, you  treasure someone who has had an abortion, who has needed an abortion.  You can't sit this one out.   It is all of us, men as well as women. We all have a stake in this  radical decision that will affect all of America and make us a lesser  nation with fewer rights and liberties.   The Court's draft opinion in Dobbs is just the next step in a  multidecade fight which the Court has waged on abortion access. It has  already shown willingness to dramatically curtail the right of a  pregnant person to decide whether and when to have a child. Just ask  women in the State of Texas. They are living in a State without the  protections of Roe v. Wade, with a dangerous anti-abortion law, SB 8,  which contains a 6-week abortion ban. Six weeks is far before many  women even know they are pregnant, as all of us in this Chamber know.   Texas's dangerous law deputizes private citizens to enforce the  State's onerous abortion law. In Texas, a rapist can sue a doctor if  they provide an abortion to a rape survivor. Someone who drove their  sister to a healthcare clinic where she has an abortion could be sued,  again, by anyone in the United States--anybody--with a $10,000  government prize money waiting for that bounty hunter. This is  extremism--extremism--in a judge's robes.   I am proud to say that the State of Connecticut today has a law-- literally, the Governor signed this law today--making sure that people  are protected in Connecticut against those kinds of bounty hunters. My  hope is that other States will follow Connecticut in providing that  kind of basic protection.   It has never been more urgent for the Congress at the Federal level  to pass the Women's Health Protection Act. The Women's Health  Protection Act would protect rights established by 50 years of Court  precedent, protecting the right to an abortion prior to fetal  viability. It would put an end to laws like the 15-week ban on abortion  that is now before the Court in the Dobbs case.   Importantly, as well, the Women's Health Protection Act would put an  end to medically unnecessary restrictions posing as health restrictions  that single out abortion care with one goal in mind: to block and  impede access to safe, needed healthcare--laws like the so-called TRAP  law, or targeted regulation of abortion providers; such as minimum  measurements for room size or hallway width that have no rationale  other than the transparent desire to curtail access; laws that require  providers to offer medically inaccurate information when providing  abortion care, like in Alaska, Kansas, Mississippi, Texas, and West  Virginia, where healthcare professionals are forced to tell women--give  them medically inaccurate information about links between abortion and  breast cancer. It would put an end to a reality where our doctors are  required by law to lie and mislead about the risks of a safe medical  procedure, and it would restore an evidence-based approach to informed  consent.   In short, it would essentially guarantee the right that exists now,  and it will exist until the Supreme Court rules that you can decide  whether and when to have children.   Let us be very clear about what the Women's Health Protection Act  does and what it doesn't do. It does not force any unwilling medical  provider to perform abortions if they wish not to do so. It says that  doctors, nurses, and hospitals may provide abortion care, not that they  must do so.   This measure is an evidence-based, scientific approach to the  protection of women's healthcare, and it restores a future where all of  us are free to make personal decisions that shape our lives, our  futures, and our families with dignity and respect, without political  interference in a decision made between a patient and a doctor, much as  all healthcare decisions should be.   The implications of the Court's draft decision in Dobbs and what we  are expecting from the Court in coming weeks simply can't be overstated  or exaggerated, but it would be foolish to believe that the Court's  conservative supermajority will stop even at Roe.   Justice Alito's draft opinion, even if it is never issued by the  Court, is the road map where this Court will go in the future. It is  permeated with support for the notion that ``fetal personhood,'' a  dangerous theory furthered by States like Louisiana that seek to make  abortion a crime of homicide from the moment of fertilization, if  adopted, the Court's novel, invented theory of personhood could and may  well lead to nationwide prohibitions on abortion. And most recently,  just over the weekend, the minority leader of the Senate has made clear  that in a post-Roe world, a Federal ban on abortion is on the table; so  did State officials who spoke over the weekend.   It is more than a cloud on the horizon; it is an impending, real,  imminent storm upon us. A ban nationwide on abortion, that would  override even the States like Connecticut that are seeking to legislate  protections for women that will make us a safe harbor and haven.   The draft opinion also invites challenges to a host of fundamental  rights that were also not widely recognized in 1868, the moment in  which Justice Alito freezes us in time. He literally freezes  constitutional rights regarding reproductive liberties in that long- gone moment.   The draft opinion cast invites challenges to a host of fundamental  rights, including contraception, Griswold v. Connecticut; interracial  marriage, Loving v. Virginia; same sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges;  and sexual intimacy between consenting adults, Lawrence v. Texas.   You don't need to be a constitutional scholar to understand the clear  and present danger to American democracy in this draft opinion.   This Court may dress it up, but the results and the reasoning will be  the same: radical extreme fringe--and directly contrary to what three  nominees testified in their confirmation hearing. Oh, we respect  established precedent, of course, stare decisis, fundamental principle.   The legitimacy and credibility of this Court is deeply in peril at  this moment, and our democracy really depends on the credibility and  respect that the American people accord the Supreme Court of the United  States. It has no armies or police force. It has no power of the purse.  Its authority depends directly on trust and credibility, the sense of  legitimacy that the American people accord it.   In the United States, public support for legal access to abortion is  at the highest it has been in two decades, a cruel irony for this  Court. And today the overwhelming majority of voters believe that  everyone should have access to the full range of reproductive  healthcare, including annual screening, birth control, pregnancy tests,  and abortion. It is a matter of health.   And at the same time, millions of Americans across this country are  absolutely terrified. They are angry and horrified about what the  Supreme Court is poised to do because they depend on accessible women's  healthcare. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe and we have taken no  legislative action, we will find ourselves in a nation where young  women of this country, not only have fewer rights than their  grandmothers, they have fewer rights than any of them thought possible.   We have to resolve that we are not backing down, we are not going  away, we are not going back in time. It has never been more urgent to  elect people, Members of this body, who will protect fundamental  rights. And I guarantee that in elections to come, reproductive rights  will be on the ballot. The women  [[Page S2398]]  and men of America will mobilize. They will be galvanized on this issue  because the Women's Health Protection Act will be on the ballot, and we  will have more votes in this body so that Members will be held  accountable for what they do or fail to do. And, ultimately, the  American people and the world are watching.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today with a heavy  heart to pay tribute to Edward Leonard Marcus, an extraordinary public  servant who passed away on May 5, 2022, at the age of 94.   Born in Brooklyn, NY, Ed was a shining star from an early age in the  classroom and on the sports field. He attended Yale University as an  undergraduate, where he also played football, baseball, and basketball,  as well as managed the wrestling team. In 1950, he obtained his LLB and  LLD from Yale Law School. Inspired by the community involvement he  enjoyed while at law school, Ed successfully ran for the board of  alders, and, demonstrating his tremendous leadership skills, he quickly  was elected majority leader. At the same time, Ed established the  Marcus Law Firm, which would gain recognition for legal excellence  throughout New England.   Following his initial city political success, Ed was elected to the  Connecticut Senate, where, again, his leadership acumen and political  prowess resulted in him serving as the majority leader of the  Connecticut State Senate for an impressive six terms. In 1992, he  became the Democratic State chairman.   Throughout his time in public service, Ed thrived most when given the  opportunity to debate with his peers and learn from those around him.  He had a reputation as an obstinate, tough leader, a credit to his  well-earned confidence and determination to help the people of  Connecticut. Outside of work, Ed was a caring and compassionate man who  valued his family above all else.   Ed's wife and three daughters exemplify the same generous spirit he  embodied. His wife, Jill, was elected chair of the Branford Police  Commission in 2015; his daughter, Shelley, is a judge on the  Connecticut Superior Court; his daughter, Susan, enthusiastically  supports the work of Ed's law firm; and his daughter, Nicole, is a  dedicated teacher. I have had the privilege of knowing the Marcus  family and witnessing firsthand their unstinting work to better  Connecticut and the Nation. Ed's tireless efforts will be an enduring  legacy, and his wife and daughters continue this remarkable lifetime of  service.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Jill, Shelley,  Susan, Nicole, and all of Ed's loved ones during this difficult time.  May their many wonderful memories of Ed provide them solace and comfort  in the days ahead. I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering  Edward L. Marcus.                            ____________________
