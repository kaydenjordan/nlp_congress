 Mr. Speaker, America must pay its bills  and must not default. Failure to do so would trigger massive job loss,  a recession, and rising costs.   Congress must raise the debt limit, as previously done on a  bipartisan basis. This cannot and should not fall on the backs of  eastern North Carolinians, rural Americans, and the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we must not engage in the politics of division and  uncertainty. We must always protect the full faith and credit of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can come to a bipartisan resolution to deliver  for eastern North Carolina and America.                            ____________________
