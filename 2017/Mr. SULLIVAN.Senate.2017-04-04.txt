 Mr. President, I, too, wish to spend some time talking  about the confirmation and upcoming vote on Judge Neil Gorsuch. As many  of my colleagues have noted, this is certainly one of the most  important responsibilities we have in this body--to confirm the next  Supreme Court Justice.   As the Presiding Officer noted in remarks made a few days ago about  Judge Gorsuch, he is an exceptionally well-qualified candidate for the  U.S. Supreme Court. I will go briefly into his bio.   First of all, he has a sterling academic reputation and credentials.  He graduated from Columbia, Harvard, and Oxford. He clerked for two  Supreme Court Justices. He worked at the Justice Department. Very  importantly--and we are not hearing a lot about it from our colleagues  on the other side--he was unanimously confirmed for a U.S. court of  appeals job for the Tenth Circuit in 2006. Senators such as Hillary  Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden all voted for him, as well as many  of my colleagues in this body on the other side of the aisle who are  still serving.   He is a westerner. We know that right now the U.S. Supreme Court,  with the possible exception of Justice Kennedy, has no westerners.  Geographical diversity on the Court is very important. This morning, my  colleague Senator Murkowski talked about how the current Supreme Court  is occupied by Justices who have spent almost their entire lives in the  Boston, New York, DC corridor. That is not America. That doesn't  represent the whole country. Judges in Western States focus on issues  like Native-American law, lands issues, oil and gas issues. It is very  important, certainly for my State of Alaska, to have a judge with that  kind of background.   But it is more than facts on a page that make Judge Gorsuch such a  strong candidate for the High Court. During Senate Judiciary Committee  hearings last week, his temperament was also tested and his judicial  philosophy was articulated. It was clear during those hearings that  Judge Gorsuch will bring a commitment to following the rule of law and  that he believes no one, including the President of the United States,  should be above the law. He reveres the separation of powers and the  fundamental principle that it is the Congress of the United States, not  the judiciary, that makes our laws.   He performed exceptionally well. He answered question after question  with consistency and displayed a legal philosophy well within the  mainstream of judicial thought within the United States.   As the Presiding Officer knows, it is not just Members of this body  who are talking about Judge Gorsuch and how well qualified he is;  commentators across the country have focused on how qualified Judge  Gorsuch is to be our next Supreme Court Justice. Let me highlight just  a few of their quotes.   This is from an editorial from the Chicago Tribune:         Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the       judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to       interpret it faithfully.        Neil Gorsuch should be confirmed.    The Detroit News:         After two days of often hostile hearings, Supreme Court       nominee Neil Gorsuch is proving himself an even-tempered,       deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the       United States Senate.    The Denver Post said:         [Judge Gorsuch] possesses the fairness, independence and       open-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to       the Supreme Court.    USA TODAY's editorial board declared: Gorsuch merits confirmation.  This Supreme Court nominee is qualified within the broad judicial  mainstream of America.   In fact, we looked to see if there was any major paper across the  country or commentator who is opposed to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It  was hard to find any. It was hard to find any in any part of the  country. Two former chief justices of the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals--both appointed by different Presidents of different parties-- stated that Judge Gorsuch ``represents the best of the judicial  tradition in our country.''   Even one board member of the liberal American Constitutional Society  who said he supports Democratic candidates and progressive causes  declared: ``There is no principled reason to vote no on Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation.''   He received the highest rating from the American Bar Association. And  it is not just the ABA, there is a long list of different groups across  the country, many representing minority groups in America, who have  supported Judge Gorsuch--the National Congress of American Indians, the  Native American Rights Fund, the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the Central  Council of Tlingit and Haida Tribes in Alaska. The list goes on and on  and on.   Given the broad-based support--from the left, from the right, from  the center--why would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  threaten the traditions of this institution and not even allow an up- or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch? Well, I have been listening. I have been  listening to the speeches to see what they are saying. It seems that  some of my colleagues are focused on this vague notion of vagueness-- literally, vagueness. If we listen to their comments, they talk about  Judge Gorsuch's supposed ambiguity, his vagueness, his evasiveness,  that he won't answer questions on how he would rule on specific cases,  so they are going to oppose him because of this. Well, these are  curious and, to be frank, unconvincing reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch.    First, as we know, a nominee is typically not expected to say how he  or she would rule on future cases. Judicial nominees, whether appointed  by Democratic or Republican Presidents, have said this repeatedly. I  will provide a quote from a prior nomination hearing by one of our  current Supreme Court Justices. She stated:         Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would       be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative       chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme       Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here       what I would say and how I would reason on such questions, I       would be acting injudiciously.    That was what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Senate Judiciary  Committee in 1993. She continued during her confirmation hearing:         A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,       no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the       specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain       for the entire judicial process.    Many have called this the Ginsberg standard, one that Justices have  followed in front of the Judiciary Committee during their confirmation  hearings and one that Judge Gorsuch also followed. Indeed, during his  hearing, Judge Gorsuch stated that if the President or others had asked  such a specific question on how he would rule on a particular case, ``I  would have walked out'' of the room.   So my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can't have it both  ways. They say they want an independent voice on the Court, but they  are also opposing Judge Gorsuch because he won't tell them how he would  rule on certain cases. This is a new standard and an impossible  standard to meet.   The second reason the vagueness standard of many of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle in their opposition to Judge Gorsuch is  unconvincing is that it ignores the fact that this is a judge with a  record. They say: He is vague. We are not sure what his views are.   Judge Gorsuch has decided roughly 2,700 cases, over 800 of which he  authored. There is nothing vague about that. In 97 percent of the time  in those cases, he reached a unanimous decision with the other  panelists on the Tenth Circuit. These are not vague decisions. His  judicial philosophy and temperament are on full display in literally  [[Page S2338]]  tens of thousands of pages of decisions in his own words. There is  nothing vague about them.   My colleagues can challenge him on his mountain of legal opinions,  but please, with all due respect, let's drop the facade of opposing him  because of vagueness, and that they don't know what the issues are is  not an argument that has much merit.   So despite widespread acclaim from groups across the country,  representing a broad spectrum of liberals and conservatives, and  despite a tenured, concrete record as a judge on the U.S. court of  appeals, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to want to  engage in a partisan filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination.   What exactly does this mean? The language, I admit, can be  confusing--cloture, filibuster, 60-vote threshold. In plain English,  what is really going on? It means that the minority leader right now  wants to prevent the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on the  merits of this Supreme Court nominee. In other words, no vote ever on  the qualifications of Judge Gorsuch. We will just filibuster.   I have been watching a number of my colleagues come to the floor and  talk about what they are planning on doing. The minority leader has  essentially been saying: We all do this. We are all guilty. Nothing new  here. This is just a little bit of payback. This is how this place  operates.   In many ways, these arguments are almost cavalier in what they are  about to do. But we shouldn't buy that. I have been in the Senate only  2 years--a mere blink of an eye compared to others--and I missed a lot  of the other nominations and debates in 2013, the Gang of 14 many years  ago. But I like to read a lot of history, and here are some facts that  are important to understand as we debate the Gorsuch confirmation:   First, there has never been a partisan filibuster of a new  President's nominee for the Supreme Court--never.   Second, it has been the custom, always, of the U.S. Senate to give a  new President's nominee an up-or-down vote. For example, Republicans  gave this courtesy to President Clinton when he nominated Ruth Bader  Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994 and President Obama with  his first-term nominees, Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elana Kagan in  2010. They all got up-or-down votes.   Third, there has never been a 60-vote requirement for any Justice on  the Supreme Court during the confirmation process in the U.S. Senate-- never.   Let me go through the votes of the current Supreme Court Justices:  Justice Kennedy, 97 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg,  96 to 3; Justice Breyer, 87 to 9; Chief Justice Roberts, 78 to 22;  Justice Alito, 58 to 42; Justice Sotomayor, 68 to 31; Justice Kagan, 63  to 37.   Incidentally, Justice Scalia, whom Judge Gorsuch would be replacing,  passed the vote in the U.S. Senate 98 to 0. Note that two of the  current members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60  votes.   Bottom line: There has never been a 60-vote requirement in the U.S.  Senate or a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee during a  President's first term--never.   Here is another fact equally as relevant to Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation: More than any other President, more than any other  Presidential election in recent memory, the one last year was clearly  about the U.S. Supreme Court. Republicans in the Senate and Candidate  and now President Trump told the American people: There is an open seat  on the U.S. Supreme Court. This is an important issue. Let the people  decide.   And they did. Polls show that millions of Americans ended up voting  for President Trump and against Hillary Clinton based, at least in  part, on which candidate they believed should nominate our next Supreme  Court Justice and whether they wanted the Court to act as a  superlegislature, interpreting a living Constitution, or whether they  wanted a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia, with a more modest view  of how the Court should view its station in our constitutional order.   The American people, including my constituents, spoke loudly in  November on this issue of the U.S. Supreme Court by voting against  Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump. And to his credit, President  Trump kept his word on this important issue by putting forward an  extremely well-qualified candidate who will be a worthy successor to  Justice Scalia.   Despite all this--an extremely well-qualified nominee and a national  election that focused on who should fill the vacancy of the Supreme  Court--it appears that the minority leader of the Senate is going to  ignore the will of the American people and set a precedent dating back  to our Nation's founding by leading a filibuster against Judge Neil  Gorsuch. We shouldn't allow this to happen, and we won't.   I hope my colleagues who are contemplating this will change their  minds because in going forward with this filibuster, who are they  really punishing? They are punishing the American people, as well as  undermining the traditions of this body--a body with rules crafted  carefully over the last two centuries.   As I mentioned, we need to work together in this body. In my 2 years  in the Senate, I have tried hard to work with my colleagues on  bipartisan issues. I have also tried hard to show all my colleagues the  respect they deserve as duly elected Senators of this important body.  Whatever the outcome of this vote on Judge Gorsuch, I certainly want to  make clear that we need to continue respectfully working across the  aisle for the sake of our Nation, and we need to rebuild trust in the  Senate. But at the same time, I believe strongly that Judge Gorsuch  deserves to get an up-or-down vote. I certainly encourage my colleagues  to bring that vote forward and to confirm this exceptionally well- qualified candidate to be our next Supreme Court Justice. And the  American people deserve as much, as well.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, for months, I have been coming down to  the floor every week to recognize someone in my State who has made a  difference to our communities in Alaska, someone who has devoted time  and energy to making my State a better place to live. I call these  individuals our Alaskan of the Week.   As I have said repeatedly to all of my colleagues and to those  watching on TV, I am a little biased here, but I believe my State is  the most beautiful in the country and, I would argue, in the world. I  urge everybody in this room, everybody watching on TV, to come to see  for yourself. Take a trip to Alaska. It will be the trip of a lifetime.  I guarantee you.   It is the people who truly make my State unique, people who are  helping each other, strong-willed, warmhearted, tenacious people who  have worked tirelessly for years for all of those who live in Alaska.   This week I would like to honor Dan Fauske, one of the strongest  willed, warmest hearted people I have ever known. All he has done for  us has made Alaska a better place for literally thousands of people  throughout our State.   Dan came to Alaska in 1974 after serving in the Army, as so many  Alaskans do. Like so many Alaskans, he arrived with a glint of steel in  his eye and a mission to help build our State. Alaska is full of  natural wonders, but our manmade wonders are also marvels, and Dan  wanted to be part of building more of those marvels for our State and  for our country.   He first arrived in the North Slope Borough--the top of the world--to  help the community build up their infrastructure and strengthen the  Alaskan Native villages in the area. It was a time of enormous change  for all of Alaska, particularly the North Slope. Oil from the North  Slope Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, had recently  begun to flow down the Trans-Alaska System for 800 miles. The largest  land claims act in U.S. history, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement  Act, had recently passed, and the governments in rural Alaska were  being formed and reformed to take advantage of these opportunities.   After Dan went back to school to receive a master's degree in  business administration from Gonzaga, he made his way back to Alaska  again to serve as chief financial officer and chief administrative  officer for Alaska's North Slope Borough, where he launched an  ambitious and ultimately successful capital plan to provide basic  necessities that so many Americans take for granted, like running water  and sewer,  [[Page S2359]]  those kinds of services, to the villages throughout the North Slope  Borough, again, on the top of the world.   According to Bill Tracey, Sr., from Point Lay, which is one of the  villages there, who was a coworker at the time, ``Dan's excellent work  ethic and skills earned him the respect of the North Slope leaders. . .  . His accomplishments were remarkable.''   With his beautiful and spirited wife Elaine always by his side, Dan  then moved his family to Anchorage to head up the Alaska Housing  Finance Corporation. For 18 years, he managed HFC's nearly $5 billion  in assets. It is not an overstatement to say that he revolutionized  that agency, doing remarkable things, including and most importantly  helping thousands of Alaskans--thousands of our constituents, our  fellow Alaskans--pursue their dream of buying an affordable home. There  is nothing more important than that.   The Alaska Legislature just passed a bill to name the Alaska Housing  Finance Corporation the Daniel R. Fauske Building, and the dedication  ceremony will take place in Anchorage on Saturday.   As his bio indicates, there is no doubt that for decades Dan Fauske  served Alaska with his hands, his heart, and with his head. But a bio  on paper can only tell you so much about a person; to really appreciate  him, you would have to have been with him and watched the energy and  can-do spirit radiate from Dan Fauske. You had to watch him talk to  people with respect and humor and understanding and a very keen  intelligence. He had a big laugh--a very big laugh--and he told great  stories. He also had that rare ability to genuinely connect with  everybody he met, it didn't matter who. He was able to speak the  language of a businessman, a builder, a veteran, a public servant. He  spoke the language of a father, a husband, a friend, and a true  Alaskan. In doing so, he gained the respect of everybody, and I mean  everybody, in my State--politicians, State workers, military members,  people from all across Alaska, people from all across the political  spectrum. If you wanted something done and if you wanted it done right  in Alaska, you asked Dan Fauske to help you do it. People trusted him.  I trusted him.   Most importantly, Dan was a great father to three great boys, D.J.,  Scott, and Brad, and two daughters, Marcy and Kathy, and he was a great  husband to his incredible, vivacious, and very strong wife Elaine.   Mr. President, Dan Fauske passed away this afternoon with his family  and friends by his side. Our prayers and the prayers of so many  Alaskans go out to all of them during this very difficult time. For  anyone watching, I humbly ask that you say a prayer too.   For all he has done for all of us, all his memory will continue to do  for all of us, Dan Fauske is our Alaskan of the Week. He was also my  very good friend. My wife Julie and I will miss him greatly.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Colorado.                            ____________________
