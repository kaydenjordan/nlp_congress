 Mr. President, I rise today during this Black History  Month to call attention to two remarkable daughters of the State of  Mississippi, two basketball legends: Lusia Harris and Ruthie Bolton.  These two Mississippi athletes took women's basketball to new heights.  And they continue to inspire countless young girls to follow their  dreams in sports.
