 Mr. President, Rabbi Michael Cohen is a longtime friend of  Marcelle and me. He occasionally sends me a Sunday sermon, which I  thoroughly enjoy and share with family members. Following a week of  mourning the passing of Justice Ginsburg, it was comforting to have  this sermon to read after church this last Sunday.   I ask unanimous consent that this sermon be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Jerusalem Post, Sept. 24, 2020]                          The Echoes of Yom Kippur                        (By Rabbi Michael M. Cohen)         When the gates of heaven close during the Ne'ila service of       Yom Kippur, many of us put the avodah, the work, of Yom       Kippur behind us. But that is an illusion. As the expression       goes, when one door closes, another opens.        Commentating on the Kol Nidre service at the beginning of       Yom Kippur, when the gates are open wide, Rabbi Max Arzt       teaches the goal of Yom Kippur is, ``to lessen the distance       between what we are and what we ought to be.''        If the long day of introspection has worked, then at Ne'ila       those gates close on who we were and open to a lighter,       better and more refined version of who we are.        But that too is an illusion. It is a fleeting moment of       personal triumph. Like the sunset that gives way to the       night, the dawn to the morning, the moon and its phases, the       high tide and the low tide; stasis is not derech haolam, the       way of the world.        Each morning the siddur, the prayer book, reminds us, ``Day       after day You renew creation.'' In that unfolding story we       are, truth be told, composed of stardust. Most of the       elements of our bodies originated in stars and the Big Bang.        Like the rest of the universe, our course is one of       continual renewal. Yom Kippur highlights that awareness and       the work we began on Rosh Hodesh Elul, the beginning of the       month of Elul, 40 days earlier. Our work reaches a higher       level on Rosh Hashanah and the Ten Days of Repentance, aseret       yomei teshuva, culminating with Yom Kippur.        Those 40 days parallel the period when Moses returned to       Mount Sinai to receive the second set of tablets following       the incident of the Golden Calf. Moses, Moshe rabbeinu, Moses       our teacher, literally models teshuva, repentance, return,       when after the first tablets lay shattered at his feet he       turned around and returned to once again climb Mount Sinai.        We are no different, as the echo of Yom Kippur is always       with us, pushing us to climb the mountain all year long. Yom       Kippur Katan, the small Yom Kippur, observed by some in most       months on the day preceding Rosh Hodesh, is one of those       echoes. It includes a daylight-hours' fast and special       liturgy.        Rabbi Shefa Gold elucidates the origins of Yom Kippur       Katan, teaching, ``Kabbalists were moon watchers. The lenses       through which they gazed were intensely focused on issues of       exile and redemption. And so as the moon waned, the exile of       the Shechina (the Divine Presence) was noted and mourned.        With the moon's return came the celebration of the miracle       of redemption, a redemption that could be tasted and known       but briefly before the cycle of exile continued. They based       their custom on a legend that was recorded in the Babylonian       Talmud in which God says to Israel, ``Bring atonement upon me       for making the moon smaller.'' (Hullin 60b) THAT EPISODE in       the Talmud is fascinating in and of itself. There God admits       after God made the moon smaller than the sun that God had       wronged the moon, and because of that God needed to do       teshuva! Implied within that radical text: If God can admit       to wrongdoing and address transgression, who are we not to?        In addition to Yom Kippur Katan, another echo of Yom Kippur       is the sixth paragraph of the weekday Amidah prayer. There we       say the confessional selach lanu, forgive us, in the same       manner that we say the confessional prayers ashamnu and al       chet of Yom Kippur. Interspersed within the al chet Yom       Kippur liturgy itself we also say selach lanu as we do during       the rest of the year: ``Ve'al kulam eloha selichot selach       lanu. Mechal lanu. Kaper lanu,'' And for them all, God of       forgiveness, please forgive, pardon us, help us atone.'' The       selach lanu paragraph follows the fourth and fifth paragraphs       of the Amidah. We first ask for binah, understanding,       including self-understanding, so we can ask in the next       prayer for help with teshuvah, repentance. There is a logic       within the order of the Amidah: first self-understanding       followed by repentance, and only then forgiveness.        Three times a day the weekday Amidah is said. This means       three times a day--evening, morning, and afternoon--we ask       for forgiveness. In Judaism there is the concept of not       saying a bracha levatala, a blessing whose purpose is not       going to be fulfilled. This means that when we ask for       forgiveness throughout the day there is the implied       understanding, since we can't say the bracha in vain, that we       did something wrong in the morning, afternoon and evening.        For some this is proof Judaism is a religion of guilt.       Rabbi Art Green teaches the opposite when he says that       Judaism is actually about guilt relief. This system provides       us precious moments throughout the day to check in with       ourselves and recalibrate as needed.        Elaborating, Rabbi Daniel Kamesar, z''l (of blessed       memory), looks to the past daily sacrificial system of the       Temple in Jerusalem as a model for that guilt relief when we       would bring a chatat or an asham offering as expiation for       our wrong choices, for missing the mark. Watching the smoke       rise heavenly could be a cathartic, like watching the       breadcrumbs of the Tashlich service float downstream away       from us.        ``Burn it up and let it go,'' Daniel points out. ``Most       therapists are trying desperately to help us achieve that.''  [[Page S6022]]         While we are talking about the echoes of Yom Kippur       throughout the year, we also note on Yom Kippur itself we       have echoes of the Temple service. The chatat offering became       the al chet prayer, and the asham offering became the ashamnu       of the Yom Kippur liturgy.        One of the most profound moments in our daily prayer life       emanates from the Ne'ila service. The Talmud (Yoma 87b)       discusses the wording for the service. Shmuel and Ulla bar       Rav suggest we say, ``What are we? What is our life? What is       our kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our       salvation? What is our power? What is our might?'' THOSE       QUESTIONS eventually migrated into the daily morning prayers       of the siddur. In the context of the Talmud and the siddur       they are traditionally understood as questions arising from a       sense of ``our iniquities too many to count,'' as Rav Judah       states.        However, they can also be read as seven existential       questions addressing the essence of our lives. We start by       asking, ``What are we?'' The ultimate question, but in some       ways too immense to answer, and so we fine tune and arrive       at, ``What is our life?'' That is to say, what do we do with       our lives, this precious gift? We want to define who we are.       To answer that question, we realize our lives are measured by       how we treat others, and so we ask, ``What is our kindness?''       and ``What is our righteousness?'' In other words, what care       and consideration do we bring to others, and in a broader       social reach, how do we strengthen justice in our communities       and the world?        Our lives are also measured and grounded by our inner       spiritual lives, and so we ask, ``What is our salvation?''       Answering and living by the answers to these questions takes       energy, and so we conclude by asking, ``What is our power?       What is our might?''        While they are the final questions, they are both       cautionary, giving us pause to think how we use our strength       and efficacy while at the same time reminding us that we have       agency.        There is another lesson with these questions. Only the       first two actually appear in the Talmud. As the scholar of       Jewish liturgy Lawrence Hoffman points out, ``Frequently,       prayers were ad libbed. They began with a starting point,       like Mah anu? Mah chayeinu? What are we? What is our life?       But they then moved in whatever direction the prayer leader       preferred. It could be made up on the spot. What was done one       year would not have been the same as in later years. There       were no ``right'' and ``wrong'' as we think of them.        ``Right'' was just making up the prayer and delivering it       on the proper theme, with, ideally, some biblical texts to       support the idea. Congregants would recognize the biblical       support and nod in recognition. So the Talmudic writer of       this section might have had his own practice in mind, or no       practice in mind at all, other than the idea that we start       with the citation in question, and then develop the theme in       a way that makes sense at the time.        Such a process invites us to go deeper than the printed       words on the page of the siddur. It asks us to drink from the       essence of its message. What a liberating, creative,       empowering approach; an approach with immense responsibility       as well.        Ne'ila metaphorically suggests the gates of heaven close at       the end of Yom Kippur, while at the same time we remember       those daily Yom Kippur touch points and messages throughout       the year. They remind us throughout the year that we always       have the gift and opportunity to improve who we are, as well       as to repair our shared world.                            ____________________
