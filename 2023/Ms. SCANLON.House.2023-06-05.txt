 Mr. Speaker, Americans are demanding action, and we must  deliver. Too many lives are being lost to senseless gun violence. Every  day, we are retraumatized by yet another shooting.   In school, our children are learning active shooter drills before  their ABCs. When families go to a grocery store or the mall, they scan  the crowd for shooters rather than sales.   We know we don't have to live this way, fearful for our kids and our  loved ones when they leave the house, furious that gun manufacturers  are making billions of dollars marketing weapons of war to  irresponsible gun owners, and frustrated by lawmakers who lack the  courage to pass commonsense gun safety legislation.   We can change this. There are commonsense, constitutional solutions  with broad public support that can stem the carnage. Where leaders in  my district and across the country have adopted those solutions, we  have seen progress. It is not enough, but it is a start.   Above all, doing nothing is not an option. We cannot sit idly by and  allow preventable gun deaths to happen day after day. We need to pass  policies that will save lives now.                            ____________________
