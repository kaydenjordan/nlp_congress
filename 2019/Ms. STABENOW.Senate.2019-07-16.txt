 Mr. President, before our distinguished leader and  chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  leaves, I want to thank him for his hard work.   Having grown up in a small, rural community in Northern Michigan, I  [[Page S4835]]  can speak directly to how important healthcare services are. My mother  was director of nursing at a small hospital, and I know, since that  time, they have gone through many changes, barely holding on to the  hospital. We have had a number of hospital closings and consolidations.   There is important work that has happened in the health community. I  want to congratulate the distinguished chairman and also indicate that  the Presiding Officer and I, as we were doing the farm bill--it is my  honor and privilege to work with the Presiding Officer--we were part of  the solution, including language on telehealth in rural development to  actually help expand services, and I think telehealth is an important  way to do that as well.   I thank the chairman for his comments.
