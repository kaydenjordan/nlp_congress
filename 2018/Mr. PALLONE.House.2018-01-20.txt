 Mr. Speaker, you know, I respect my colleague from  Oregon, but you have done nothing over the last year but sabotage the  Affordable Care Act and sabotage healthcare in this country. The fact  of the matter is that the only reason you are willing to bring up this  CHIP bill as part of the CR is because you put in a tax plan that  eliminates the mandate for health insurance, which means 13 million  people are not going to have health insurance in this country over the  next few years, and the money that would have subsidized their premium  now does not have to be paid.   So all of a sudden you say: Okay, we will put a 6-year CHIP bill on  the floor.   The pay-fors were not only from the Prevention Fund. The pay-fors  also said that if somebody didn't pay their health insurance within 30  days, they were going to lose their health insurance. And the CBO said  that another 500,000 people would lose their health insurance.   Everything that this majority has done since day one of this session  has been to sabotage the ACA and not allow people to even know that  they can buy insurance through the exchange, taking away their cost- sharing subsidies. The list is endless.   And for you to come up here today and suggest that somehow you care  about the kids and you are going to have CHIP continue for the next 6  years, where are those kids going to go?   You haven't done anything about community health centers. Forty to  fifty percent of them have to use community health centers because  people won't take CHIP. You haven't done anything about the hospitals,  the disproportionate share hospitals that many of them have to go to.  That is not addressed in this legislation.   So the only reason that you have brought this bill and put it on the  CR is because of the fact that you have sabotaged health insurance for  millions of Americans. So don't stand up here and tell me that somehow  the Republican Party cares about the kids. They don't. And you also  know that this was not going to pass. You know that it wasn't going to  pass.                                time  1745    You are not trying to act in a bipartisan, bicameral way. You know  that this is going nowhere. You are responsible for the shutdown, and  putting CHIP in the bill is part of that responsibility that you have  created here today. So don't go on and on and on about how the  Republican Party cares about the kids. The Republican Party does not.
