 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work on this.   Mr. Chairman, I always get excited when I hear people speak on the  floor, especially when they come from California. Mr. Chairman, it is  always interesting when people want to tell us what is the best way to  make things happen.   It is interesting, in California, when the legislature was controlled  by Democrats, they did waive CEQA, but it wasn't for a dam. It wasn't  to prepare for a drought we were going through. But they waived it  twice, all for sports. One was in San Francisco, and one was in L.A. It  seems odd, but sometimes people have their priorities, I guess, not in  the right place.   Now, Mr. Chairman, California and the West recently endured the worst  drought in our century. Though it was the worst drought, this was not  our first. We have faced droughts for generations, and each time the  rain and snow came back and delivered the water that we needed to  survive.   Just like previous years, this past winter was a godsend to  Californians; the wettest on record. Living in the naturally dry region  that we do, you would think it would be common practice to prepare for  inevitable times of drought by capturing water when Mother Nature  blesses us with the rain and snow. But the fact is that we aren't doing  enough to store the water we do get for the times we don't get it.   So what can we do now? What would help the people in our district and  across California and across the West to prepare for future droughts  that we know are coming?   We should start by building more dams and reservoirs.   So what is stopping us?   Well, some is a ridiculous permitting process that forces us to wait  and wait and wait when actually we should be acting.   Just look at history. Take the High Savery Dam in Wyoming. It took 14  years to permit the project but only 2 years to build it. It was  finished in 2004. Think about how much the world has changed in those  14 years of time.   In 1990, somewhere around 5 million people had cell phones and only  about 15 percent of Americans owned a computer. By 2004, when the dam  was finished, about 180 million people had cell phones and 62 percent  of Americans owned a computer. In 1990, the most popular movie was  Total Recall. By 2004, we were already on to Shrek 2.   Looking forward to my home State, we can't wait 14 years after  starting the permitting process to finish our projects. The Temperance  Flat Reservoir, once fully operational, can provide enough water to  meet the needs of 172,000 households for an entire year. Finishing the  Sites Reservoir proposal could provide 2 million California homes with  enough water for a year. That is an astounding number. But, Mr.  Chairman, I am sure on this floor we will hear those 2 million should  actually wait. But I guess for a baseball stadium, no need to wait.    So fixing the process isn't just about saving some headaches or a few  hours of time. This is about making sure millions of people in  California and across America have the water they need and deserve.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Tom McClintock for this  legislation. Fixing this permitting process for water storage is more  than just common sense. It is about making us a nation of doers again  to get the American what they actually need.   Mr. Chairman, Mr. McClintock has worked. He has tried to work with  both sides of the aisle. He has been through this process.   But you know what?   Mr. McClintock has been home. He has been listening to his  constituents on both sides of the aisle that don't have water. We have  been through these droughts. We know these droughts will come again,  and they have only been worse in the last couple of years.   Why?   Because of what has been imposed by the Federal Government. Even in  the years where we have more than 170 percent of snowpack, we don't  keep the guarantee of 100 percent of the water.   So as the environmental laws continue to take water away and put it  out to the ocean instead of providing for the fruits to be grown and  the fiber across our country and provide the water for the citizens of  California, we should build more dams, and they should not have to wait  14 years with only 2 years to build it. We can do better, we should do  better, and we will do better when we pass this bill.                                time  1500
