 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Takano for  yielding. I rise today in support of this bipartisan legislation, the  Veterans Benefits Improvement Act.   As ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee, I am honored to be able to partner with the subcommittee  chair, Mr. Luttrell, on this legislation. I thank him for working in a  bipartisan fashion to ensure that our veterans can access the benefits  and services that they are owed.   We all have a solemn obligation to ensure that the needs of veterans  are met. We know that too many of our heroes encounter red tape,  delays, and backlogs when trying to access benefits. My office has  spoken with countless veterans across New Hampshire who have had  trouble completing and filing disability benefits questionnaires due to  a lack of clear and timely communication.   Often, our office will step in when things go awry along the way and  advocate on their behalf with VA, but veterans shouldn't have to reach  out to yet another office just to navigate these processes, which are  all too complicated.   By improving transparency and accessibility for those filing a  disability claim, as well as communications between veterans, their  accredited representatives, and contractors, we can make sure that  veterans receive the support that they have earned.   As we see more veterans file claims as a result of the PACT Act, it  is so crucial that we have steps in place that are going to improve  these processes as soon as possible.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  commonsense legislation, which will help reduce the VA claims backlog  and minimize delays that too many of our veterans are facing today.
