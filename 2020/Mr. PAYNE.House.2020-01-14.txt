 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the Newark Mentoring  Movement, an organization that wants to turn Newark into ``Mentor  City.''   Unlike most mentoring organizations, they do not supply mentors.  Instead, they do a more valuable thing. They connect politicians with  organizations who support mentoring so they can discuss how to increase  mentoring opportunities in the future.   The importance of mentors in America has never been greater. Today,  more than 30 percent of children come from single-parent homes, and it  is incredibly difficult to raise children alone. Mentors give these  parents a helping hand. They give their children a role model. They can  help increase their grades and increase their self-esteem. In addition,  they can put students on a better path and keep them on a positive  trajectory.   We need to dedicate more time and resources to provide mentors for  children across this great Nation. Every child must be given a chance  to succeed.                            ____________________
