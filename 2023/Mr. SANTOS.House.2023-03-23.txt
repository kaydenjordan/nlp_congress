 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are begging for a compromise, asking for our trust.   We trusted that our children would be safeguarded from lewd content  such as this book. I can't quote a page nor show a page from this book  because it is against the decorum for this body. Why is this  appropriate in our schools?   Here is the reality. We used to trust our educators. We trusted that  our educators respected the boundaries of the home. We trusted that  they would leave the rearing of our children to the parents. We trusted  that the curriculum was not formulated by bureaucrats and that  classrooms would not be transformed into indoctrination camps. We  trusted that our school boards would respect children's parents and not  refer to them as domestic terrorists when they voiced their concerns.   We were let down.   The Parents Bill of Rights Act will put the power back in the hands  of parents and provide them with the information they need to ensure  their children receive the best education.   Parents have a right to know what their children are taught. Parents  have a right to see the school budget and spending. Parents have the  right to keep their children safe.                            ____________________
