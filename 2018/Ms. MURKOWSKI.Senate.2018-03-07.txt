 Mr. President, I thank my colleague and congratulate  him. I recognize him and Senator Crapo, as well, for their efforts.   I think, as we look to those energy solutions that can take our  country and our planet to a place that is better, that demonstrate a  truly greater environmental stewardship through the uses of clean  energy, one should almost immediately look to the benefits that nuclear  is able to provide for us.   In my coming from a fossil-producing State like Alaska, people often  ask, if I were not someone in Congress, would I be a supporter of  nuclear. I truly believe that when it comes to our energy portfolio and  those that will allow us to have a balanced approach to our energy and  our energy solutions and when we are talking about the affordability,  the accessibility, the diversity of supply, and the security of supply,  you must also include and emphasize the clean energy supply.   What the Senator from Rhode Island continues to repeat is worth  repeating. Focusing on how we move ourselves to a cleaner energy  environment is something we have had opportunities to visit and is  something to which I am committed. So I look forward to finding those  areas of balance.                           Remembering Jim Balamaci    Mr. President, I am here this afternoon for a brief few moments to  pay tribute to an Alaskan whom we lost just within the past 2 weeks.   My State is a State that is well known for the strength of its  nonprofit sector, and we lost one of our leaders of that sector--a very  special person who was beloved by many. He was a gentleman, a friend,  by the name of Jim Balamaci. Jim was the president and chief executive  officer of Alaska's Special Olympics. He unexpectedly passed away at  the age of 63.   This Sunday, I will be going home and will join with thousands who  will fill the Alaska Airlines Arena on the University of Alaska  Anchorage campus to pay tribute to Jim and to celebrate his  contributions to the Special Olympics. Jim was really a giant in the  Special Olympics, both at the local level and at the national level.   I think it is most fitting that the celebration of Jim's life will  occur during the weekend of the Special Olympics Alaska Winter Games.  This will provide an opportunity for the many Special Olympians, the  coaches, the volunteers--I am actually going to be there to help pass  out awards--and for so many of us whose lives have been touched by  Jim's inspiration to gather together to show our love and our  admiration for, again, a truly great man.   Being born in Alaska affords one a certain quantum of bragging rights  when it comes to leadership, but truth be told, when the history of  Alaska post-statehood is written, it is people like Jim who came from  somewhere else and chose to make Alaska their home--their lives will be  remembered for making Alaska the extraordinary and very special place  that it is. Jim really fit that bill.   Our NBC affiliate in Anchorage, KTUU, said: ``If there was ever an  Alaskan who wore his heart on his sleeve, it was Balamaci.''   In a 2017 interview with KTUU, Jim explained what makes Alaska so  special in words that show how significant a figure he will be  remembered as. He said: ``We build our communities, we build our state,  and we build our friendships.'' That in a nutshell really explains the  DNA of post-statehood Alaska. Jim absolutely got it, and I think that  is one of the reasons he has earned a place in history, as well as in  our hearts.   Jim was born in Bridgeport, CT. He was active in sports. He was  active in church. He entered a pretheology program at St. Vladimir's  Orthodox Theological Seminary in Yonkers, NY. He was concurrently a  student at Iona College in nearby New Rochelle. He graduated from Iona  in 1976.   A year after graduation, Jim left the suburbs of New York City to  pursue his Alaskan adventure, his Alaskan dream. He moved north. He  settled in Kodiak--pretty remote, not on anybody's road system. He  worked in commercial fisheries there. He was a carpenter and teacher,  and he kind of did it all. That is when he began his career, his  lifetime of volunteer service.   He began volunteering in the Special Olympics in 1979, and shortly  thereafter, he moved into coaching. He was selected as president and  CEO of Special Olympics in Alaska in 1996. Back in 1996, there were  about 400 athletes around the State. Jim grew that universe of athletes  of Special Olympians. Alaska's Special Olympics community today  includes some 2,000 athletes, and I can tell you, they are all friends  of Jim's.   In a career as rich as Jim's, it might be difficult to identify just  one or two experiences that were truly exceptional, but I would bet  that Jim would probably say that he was most proud of the 2001 Special  Olympics World Winter Games that were hosted in Alaska. We had over  3,000 athletes from 80 countries who participated in the event. Eunice  Kennedy Shriver, who, of course, is the founder of the Special  Olympics, reportedly told Jim that it was the best World Winter Games  in Special Olympics' history. That was substantial praise from the  founder of the Special Olympics.   Up until the last visit I had with Jim here in Washington, DC, Tim  Shriver, who is also an extraordinary individual working within the  Special Olympics, has been there with Jim when they come to Washington  to visit with me.   Another capstone experience occurred in 2014 with the completion of  the Special Olympics Alaska Athlete Training Center and Campus. I will  tell you, this is a phenomenal facility. It is really a one-of-a-kind  facility. It is 28,000 square feet. It has a facility center, an indoor  track, and a multipurpose sports court. It has a kitchen where the  athletes learn about nutrition. It was built at a cost of about $7  million. It remains one of the world's only dedicated training centers  for developmentally disabled athletes. I have had occasion several  times a year to be able to go out to their games. They have field  hockey inside. The games they are able to participate in year-round in  a place like Alaska--to have this training facility is absolutely  exceptional and unparalleled.   When we think of the Special Olympians, we typically tend to think of  younger athletes, but as young Special Olympians age, they still remain  Special Olympians. Jim saw this. We had so many conversations where he  was talked about just the demographic, the aging population that we are  seeing among our Special Olympians and those who are developmentally  disabled. He said that we cannot not be thinking about their future as  well.   Jim was truly a pioneer. He worked in developing the Aging Unified  Athlete Program with Special Olympics leaders across the country to  ensure that developmentally disabled athletes live long and healthy  lives, focusing on lifetime learning but really making sure that at all  ages, there is engagement.   Jim had an extraordinary heart, a big heart, a warm personality. He  was just so loved. I cannot convey it enough. He was loved by not only  those within the community of the Special Olympics but within the  broader Alaskan community at large. I certainly saw that this fall when  the torch run was being put on, which is a partnership with our law  enforcement, along with our Special Olympians--again, a coming together  of a community to provide support for one another.   Jim could motivate and charm with the best of them. You need look no  further for evidence of that than to be out at a place called Goose  Lake in Anchorage, AK, the third week of December. Jim Balamaci is a  guy who could  [[Page S1432]]  get thousands of Alaskans--literally thousands of Alaskans--to jump  into a hole in a frozen lake in December to raise money for the Special  Olympics.   If you have never dressed up in costume to jump into a hole--this is  not something where you can wade out to get your feet wet and say: I  have done the polar plunge. This is a polar plunge where you go into  that hole and you are swimming in a frozen lake, and it is December. I  was out there in December. Jim Balamaci reminded us that we were all  there ``freezin' for a reason,'' and that reason was to help the  Special Olympics and Special Olympians. He was an extraordinarily  special person to so many of us.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I send my condolences to Jim's  mother Frusina. She visited him often during his 40-year Alaskan  adventure. We send our condolences to his sister and brother and to all  those who were touched by Jim's kindness and generosity.   Alaska and our Special Olympians across the country are better  because of Jim Balamaci.   With that, Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
