 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  congratulate her on her great leadership chairing an important  committee of the House, and thank her for bringing this legislation to  the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Adam Schiff for his leadership in putting  this legislation together, and I will get to that in a moment.   But first, I just want to say how proud we are today. Every day that  we serve in this House, a House of the people, is a privilege. No  matter what honors others may bestow on us in this House, whether we  are Speaker, or leader, or whip, or whatever, nothing, no honor is  greater than to be able to step on the floor and say that we speak for  the people of our district; that they have chosen us to come here, as  was intended by our Founders.    Mr. Speaker, 245 years ago, in an act of daring that would redefine  the world, our Founders--imagine the courage they had--declared their  independence from an oppressive monarch. They said: ``We hold these  truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they  are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that  among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' The  pursuit of happiness was written into the founding document.   And they continued:         Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of       these ends, it is the people's duty to throw off such       government, to provide new guards for their future security.    They were speaking about England.   Our Founders would then forge those guards for our own government,  the democratic institutions enshrined in the Constitution which, for  nearly 2-1/2 centuries, have safeguarded the security and well-being of  the American people.   But, disturbingly, the last administration saw our democracy in  crisis, with a rogue President who trampled over the guardrails  protecting our Republic.   Now, Congress has the solemn responsibility and opportunity to  safeguard our democracy, ensuring that past abuses can never be  perpetrated by any President, of any party.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act ensures the strength and survival of  a democracy of, by, and for the people, defending the rule of law,  revitalizing our system of checks and balances, and restoring our  democratic institutions.   Thank you to Chairman Adam Schiff and the chairs of the committees of  jurisdiction, Judiciary being one of those, the Committee on Oversight  and Reform, another, and many cosponsors for their leadership on this  transformative package of democracy reforms which will put in place  essential safeguards to prevent any President from abusing the public  trust, no matter what his or her party is.   This legislative package is sweeping and future-focused, looking to  the future, designed to restate the rule of law now and for generations  to come.  [[Page H7608]]    Our chairs have crafted a robust reforms package that can stand up to  and prevent attempts to undermine our democracy including: The abuse of  pardon power, abuse of office for personal enrichment, the solicitation  of foreign assistance in our elections, retaliatory attacks on  whistleblowers and inspectors general, politicization of the tools of  justice, and contempt of Congress' oversight powers on behalf of the  American people, including our lawful subpoena power and the power of  the purse.   These steps ensure that no one, not even a President, is above the  law.   During the Constitutional Convention, one of our Founders, George  Mason, asked: ``Shall any man be above justice? Above all shall that  man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?''   In his great wisdom, George Mason knew that the injustice committed  by the President erodes the rule of law, the very notion, the idea of  fair justice, which is the bedrock of our democracy. And if we allow a  President to be above the law, we surely do so to the peril of our  Republic.   Addressing Presidential abuse, therefore, goes to the very heart, the  very survival of our democracy. We are a democracy; three coequal  branches government, each a check and balance on the other that cannot  be undermined. Otherwise, we are a monarchy, and that is what we chose  not to be.   Let me close by recalling another scene from that Constitutional  Convention. On its final day, as our Constitution was adopted, Benjamin  Franklin was greeted by folks as he descended the steps from  Independence Hall. People know this story. Children in school learn it.   The people asked, what do we have, a republic or a monarchy? Benjamin  Franklin responded, ``A republic, if you can keep it.''   This was the vision of our Founders, and we are grateful to them for  it. This is what our men and women in uniform defend, freedom, our  democracy, and we are grateful to them for it.   This is what we owe our children as we go forward, to meet their  aspirations to live in the United States of America, with liberty and  justice for all. And we are responsible it.   May we be worthy of the vision of our Founders, the sacrifice of our  men and women in uniform, and the aspirations of our children.   The Congress--as Article I, the first branch of government--will  uphold our solemn duty to keep our Republic by passing the bill, for  the people.   I say this with great appreciation to all who worked so hard to put  this together. I support this bipartisan amendment that is on the floor  right now, and I thank those who worked together in a bipartisan way to  put that forward, and I hope that we can have a successful day for the  people, again, honoring our Founders, our men and women in uniform, and  for the children.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his recognition,  and I thank him for hosting us this evening with this Special Order to  honor a real hero in our country, Bob Dole.   I also thank the gentleman for what he did for the bereavement  resolution, enabling us to have the use of the rotunda, which takes an  act of Congress to use the rotunda, and to have the catafalque that was  constructed for Abraham Lincoln to lie on so that Bob Dole could lie on  that, a true hero for our country.   I take great pride, Mr. Estes, in the fact that Senator Dole served  in the House of Representatives as his first step in the Congress of  the United States. I was teased by some of the Senators saying, you are  laying claim to him. He was only there 4 years. He was in the Senate  over 24 years. And yet we do because, again, his service here is a  source of pride to us.   But not only that, when he turned 90, we had his birthday party in  Statuary Hall on the House side of the Capitol, and so many of his  friends and colleagues that served with him and friends and staff who  had served with him came, and I was happy to be invited by him to  participate in the ceremony. It was his 90th birthday, fully pledging  to be there to honor him for his 100th birthday. Well, we made it to 98  and nearly a half.   A great life, beautifully lived, one that is justified by his lying  in state and, as I said today at our ceremony, wrapped in the American  flag. It is hard to think of anyone who deserves that honor more than  Bob Dole, super patriot.   As a young, young person, he fought for our freedom in World War II.  He has been a champion for our men and women in uniform ever since,  along with Elizabeth Dole, Senator Dole also. Senator Elizabeth Dole  took up the cause of hidden heroes, those who care for our men and  women in uniform when they come home and need care.   The beautiful love between the two of them is a joy to all who knew  and love them--know and love them, still in the present. And they are  prayerful, patriotic, lovely Americans.   Indeed, it was just 4 years, almost 4 years ago and we gathered under  the very dome where we were in the rotunda to present him with a  Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor that Congress can bestow.  We knew then, as we do today, that Bob Dole belongs among the pantheons  of patriots memorialized in the rotunda.   And I couldn't help but thinking, watching him lying in state there,  he felt very comfortable under the dome of the Capitol, where he spent  so much time, but time beautifully spent in leadership, making a  difference. As his casket lies in this temple of democracy right now,  draped in the American flag, we are so proud.   From his heroism in World War II to his leadership in the House and  the Senate, he served our Nation with legendary courage, dignity and  integrity. Duty was a word that sort of guided his actions, his duty to  our country and its military and the elective office and as an elder  statesman in this country.   He was greatly admired on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of  the Capitol, and across the country because he was a person of  integrity, a person of his word. He worked in a bipartisan way, whether  it was addressing hunger in America, respect for people with  disabilities, and advocates for troops, veterans and our hidden heroes  and, of course, he took great pride in his work on Social Security.   He continued his powerful legacy beyond his retirement from Congress,  alongside, again, his loving wife and prayerful partner, Senator  Elizabeth Dole. His life and legacy will forever challenge us to act  worthy of him. As he said, we shouldn't try to change the ideals of our  country. We should try to be worthy of them.   May it be a comfort to his beloved wife, Elizabeth, his dear, dear  daughter, Robin, his longtime colleagues and friends, and the people of  Kansas that a grateful Nation joins them and prays for them at this sad  time as we mourn with him.   May he rest in a very much-deserved peace.   Thank you, Senator Dole, for your leadership to our country, for  being a leader, exemplary leader, one that everyone would want to be  like. We are going to miss him, his humor. He was very funny and very  serious and very patriotic.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Estes for bringing us together to say some  more words about Senator Robert Dole. It is such an honor to have him  lie in state under the rotunda, an honor shared by very few people, but  one very much deserved by Senator Dole.
