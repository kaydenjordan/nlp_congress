 Mr. President, studies show that women and  underrepresented minorities face substantial barriers to completing  educational opportunities and pursuing careers in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Congress and the Federal  government should be doing more to help women and underrepresented  minorities succeed in these areas, which will strengthen our economy  and communities in the long-term.   For these reasons, I come to the floor today to reintroduce the STEM  Opportunities Act of 2019 and the Women and Minorities in STEM Booster  Act of 2019, two important bills that would help to broaden  participation in STEM and strengthen our nation's STEM pipeline for  women and minorities.   Recent trends indicate that we are not keeping pace with training the  scientists and engineers we will need for the 21st century careers of  the future. Unfortunately, women and minorities too often ``leak'' out  of the STEM pipeline before completing degrees in these critical  fields. In order for the United States to remain competitive in our  increasingly global economy, we need to make sure opportunities are  available for everyone because only when everyone succeeds can we all  succeed.   As members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that our  country remains competitive and provides opportunities for all  Americans. We have an important role to play in breaking down barriers  for women and minorities in STEM and must work to ensure that Federal  government agencies, Federal laboratories, institutions of higher  education, State and local governments, industry, and nonprofit  stakeholders are working collaboratively to support these efforts.   The STEM Opportunities Act represents a comprehensive approach to  improving the severe shortage and lack of diversity in our Nation's  STEM pipeline by addressing factors that limit the progression of women  and minorities in research environments and implementing research-based  practices to improve the recruitment and retention of faculty and  students. Specifically, the bill would provide for guidance, data  collection, and grants for women and minorities in STEM at institutions  of higher education and at federal science agencies to improve access  and reduce cultural and institutional barriers that limit diversity in  STEM research and careers.   The Women and Minorities in STEM Booster Act represents a more  targeted approach to strengthening the STEM pipeline, by providing for  training, outreach, mentoring, and other resources  [[Page S5752]]  for women and minorities in STEM. Specifically, the bill would require  the National Science Foundation to award competitive grants to promote  activities such as online workshops, mentoring programs, internship  opportunities, outreach efforts, and other designed to increase  recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in  STEM. It is through these purposeful efforts that we, as a nation, can  foster a stronger, more expansive, and diverse STEM workforce that will  help us remain a competitive force around the world.   As we work to build and maintain our STEM workforce, it is important  for us to promote opportunities for women and minorities that encourage  participation so that we engage our entire talent pool and ensure that  our nation's future economic and national security are secure.   We have made important strides to provide opportunities for women and  minorities in our country, but more work remains and we should continue  our efforts by considering and passing these bills. I thank my  colleagues for joining me in reintroducing the bills, and encourage  others to join us as we work to strengthen the STEM pipeline for  everyone in the United States.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, Ms.          Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Brown, Mr. Carper, Mr.          Casey, Mr. Coons, Ms. Cortez Masto, Ms. Duckworth, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Harris, Ms. Hassan, Ms. Hirono,          Mr. Jones, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Menendez,          Mr. Merkley, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Reed, Ms. Rosen, Mr. Sanders, Mr.          Schatz, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Smith, Mr. Peters, and Mr.          Kaine):   S.J.
