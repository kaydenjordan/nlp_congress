 Mr. Speaker, by using diesel-powered  equipment, nitrogen, and other fertilizers, American farmers feed our  Nation and are the number one exporter of food worldwide.   My fellow farmers and I are alarmed because Joe Biden and his green  bad deal team are in the process of creating a food crisis.   Radical leftists will destroy farms, especially family farms, with  attacks on fertilizer and livestock. The leftists are pushing to  replace the farmland we need for food with solar panels that are  terrible for the environment and made in China.   Without farms, people starve. Radical leftists are causing famine,  blackouts, and rationing in other countries. We cannot let them control  our food production.                            ____________________
