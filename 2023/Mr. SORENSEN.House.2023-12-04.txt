 Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the Space and  Aeronautics Subcommittee, I was thrilled to lead the DOE and NASA  Interagency Research Coordination Act alongside my colleague and  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, Congressman Williams.   I would be remiss if I didn't also share that my mother gave me the  wonder of what is going on above so that I could spend the first 22  years of my professional life as a meteorologist helping explain how  things work.   Also, I hope that the people at home see that this body is working  together today in a bipartisan way, just like NASA and the Department  of Energy have for decades and decades. They have improved our  understanding of the universe by working together.   This bill seeks to build and expand upon that legacy by advancing  coordination on fundamental and applied science. The collaborative  research and development efforts that this bill facilitates will have a  profound impact not just for my constituents but for the entire rest of  the country.   As a meteorologist, I know that we need to improve climate modeling  and simulation to increase our understanding of how the planet is  changing. It will help us make smart decisions to change the trajectory  while creating resilient communities. This takes interagency  collaboration.   Most importantly, as we see here in the Science Committee, when we  collaborate, we inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers.  When the first humans land on Mars, they are going to rely on the  things that we develop today. That is why I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
