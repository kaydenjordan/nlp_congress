 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  538, the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic Park Boundary Revision Act  of 2017.   First, I thank the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr.  Sablan) for yielding. And I thank the coauthor of the legislation, the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my friend and colleague. He  has been a tireless advocate on behalf of this legislation, and we  would not be here today without his help and his advice.   I also thank Chairman Rob Bishop and Ranking Member Raul Grijalva  from the full Committee on Natural Resources for their work in bringing  this bill to the floor so early in the 115th Congress.   In the 114th Congress, Chairman McClintock and Ranking Member Tsongas  of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands were very helpful as well, and I  commend them and their staffs, especially Terry Camp and Brandon  Bragato, for their efforts.   This legislation was approved last March by the full House of  Representatives by voice vote. The Senate Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources also approved a companion bill, but it was not  considered by the full Senate prior to the adjournment of the 114th  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, there are few, if any, historic sites in the United  States that have evidence of continuous human habitation from so long  ago when the first nomadic people came to North America to hunt ice age  mammals and again to settle the Macon Plateau. It is what makes the  Ocmulgee National Monument so unique. On its 702 acres, one can find  archaeological evidence from these first nomads, the mound builders of  the Mississippian Period, British traders of the late 17th century, as  well as the Civil War period.   Our bipartisan legislation consists of three parts. First, it will  expand the boundaries from approximately 702 acres to over 2,800 acres,  providing protection to additional archaeological resources, linking  two currently noncontiguous areas and improving the site's connection  to the city of Macon, Georgia. Most of the land will be donated from  nonprofit associations and government agencies. Property will also be  acquired only from willing donors or willing sellers, subject to the  availability of funding.   Second, the bill would change the name from Ocmulgee National  Monument to Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic Park, which would  increase name recognition and draw additional visitors.   Finally, H.R. 538 would authorize a resources study to explore the  possibility of expanding the park even further and include additional  opportunities for hunting, camping, fishing, and other recreational  activities.   The legislation enjoys widespread local support, including Macon  mayor Robert Reichert, the Macon Chamber of Commerce, the Macon-Bibb  Visitors Bureau, the Macon-Bibb Commission, the Macon-Bibb Economic  Development Commission, the Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve  Initiative, and the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes:  Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole.   In short, I believe that H.R. 538 will strengthen the current  Ocmulgee National Monument and bolster the economy and cultural life of  Georgia and beyond. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to support the legislation and urge its passage.
