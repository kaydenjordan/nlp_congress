 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding,  who is a great friend of mine.   I think the pictures you have up there speak a loud picture of the  other side of the 21-day shutdown, of what is really going on.   Yesterday and today, we have heard a lot from our Democratic  colleagues about what 20 days was, what 21 days was. And, yes, there  are people who have been furloughed; and, yes, it is tragic for them if  they can't pay their bills. But we know this is a temporary  inconvenience.   We passed a bill today, in this Chamber, that will be signed into law  that these people will be made whole. So it is a temporary  inconvenience, and we don't like it. Neither side likes this.   But when you look at the cause of this, when we go back to the cause  of this--and we saw that meeting in the White House with Chuck Schumer,  Nancy Pelosi, and President Trump. After that, there was a press  conference where she said not one penny will go to a wall.   As you have illustrated so eloquently, how many times have  President--or Senator Obama at the time, Senator Feinstein, Senator  Schumer, and Ms. Pelosi supported a wall, border security, and the  hypocrisy that it is okay then but it is not okay now because they want  to label it ``Trump's wall.''   What this President is trying to do is fulfill all of our obligations  to the Constitution, to uphold the Constitution from foreign and  domestic enemies.   Border security is something we all do, border security at our homes.  I imagine 90 percent of Americans lock their doors at night because of  security to protect their families. Mayors and police chiefs of towns  protect their citizens. That is their job.    No, not at all. They do it because they want to protect the  people whom they have been tasked to do. That is all we are asking for  here is border security.   So 21 days ago the government shut down, a partial shutdown: 76 to 80  percent of the government is funded. There is a small portion that is  not funded.   And again, I feel bad for the people who have been furloughed, but  today, the legislation passed, as I said, where they are going to be  made whole.   Since 21 days ago, the government has been shut down, making this the  longest--or we are tying the previous record for the longest shutdown  in U.S. history?   Why has it been this long? Because the Democrats refuse to come to  the table and negotiate a solution.   When you have two sides, where one is willing to work and compromise  and the other one says not one penny, you are not even at a starting  point to compromise. Instead, they would rather bring up messaging  bills that don't fund the vital programs. Also, that they can say: We  didn't support President Trump's border security.   This is hatred at the highest level, yet they talk about tolerance  and all this other stuff. They have such a disdain for this President.  And again, all he is trying to do is secure this Nation.   Well, let's take a look at the last 21 days; on the other side, as  you have brought up here, 21 days.   On average, 2,000 inadmissible migrants arrive at our southern border  daily. This means that in the last 21 days, without a secure border,  approximately 42,000 migrants have sought illegal entry at our border  without going through the proper channels.   If they come through the proper channels, as you said, we allow over  a million people in this country, to immigrate here. We have proper  channels for people to come through. But over 42,000 immigrants have  sought illegal entry at our border without going through the proper  channels.   Additionally, in December, 27,518 family unit aliens were apprehended  for crossing the border illegally. If those numbers remain consistent,  that means over 18,000 family unit aliens have been apprehended for  illegal crossings in the last 21 days.   In fiscal year 2018, 2,028 illegal aliens arrested had homicide  charges already. If this number remains consistent, that is 115  homicide charges for illegal aliens in the last 21 days.   Further, on an average, 300 Americans die per week from heroin.  Ninety percent of all the heroin in the U.S., and marijuana and  cocaine, 90 percent of that comes from our southern border.   Secure the border, Ms. Pelosi.   That means that in the last 21 days, if we have 300 dying a week--21  days is 3 weeks--that means at least 900 Americans have died because of  heroin illegally crossing our border.   Secure the border, Ms. Pelosi.   This doesn't even include the amount of fentanyl that crossed our  southern border in 2017, which the amount that has come in is enough to  kill every single American via overdoses.   If you talk to the Democrats, they will tell you that $5.7 billion is  too  [[Page H515]]  much to pay for protection at our southern border. But what they won't  tell you is how much more it costs the Federal Government and Americans  by not securing our borders.   And again, we want to be sensitive to the people who have been  furloughed. As I said, and I know I am going to take some heat for  this, it is a temporary inconvenience. But for these people that you  have on this picture, for the countless other people we can talk  about--Kate Steinle in San Francisco, Mollie Tibbetts, Peter Hacking-- all were killed by illegal Mexicans who have come into this country,  and I find this very egregious.                                time  1400    Peter Hacking, a father of nine, a blended family, had been married  to his wife approximately a year. He and two of his children were  killed by a Mexican that came into this country illegally. That person  that killed these people, a person who should not have been in this  country, got 2 years in prison. It is a sham that the Democrats want to  use politics to say this is not about security of this Nation. Ask  those people.   For the people who have been furloughed, it is a temporary  inconvenience. They are going to be made whole. But for these people,  it is a permanent damage, not just to their families, but to their  communities and to this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I will be  here if he needs me to weigh back in.    Absolutely. And we are going to continue this on--it will  be 22 days, 23 days, hopefully, not long, but we are going to highlight  what is going on. The compassionate thing is--and as you brought up,  this is not anti-immigration. This is not anti-Mexican.   I made reference to three people that were killed by people from  Mexico who were here illegally. That doesn't mean all Mexicans are bad.   I have worked with a lot. I come from an agricultural background.  They are hardworking people, just like Americans are. This is something  that if we don't have rule of law, you can't have a law-abiding  society.   I want to address one other point, if you will allow me.    President Trump has taken a lot of heat about Mexico paying  for the wall. I talked to the President about this when he was a  candidate, and I think that is an issue that we do need to talk about.   When you look at the facts, Mexico, since 2008, has received $3.2  billion, with a B, in foreign aid. That comes to about $320 million a  year in foreign aid.   I am a proponent of foreign aid. They had also started the Merida  Initiative  [[Page H516]]  in 2008. Since that period of time, $1.6 billion has been invested into  that program. That is strictly counterdrugs. It has been $1.6 billion  since 2008, and I ask you: Is the drug problem today better in America  or worse?    Mr. Speaker, it is worse. So my proposal is that we, as a  body, start looking at rerouting that money. If 90 percent of those  drugs are coming through legal ports on our southwest border, in  addition to the open, porous border, would it not make more sense to  secure our borders, whether it is more screening at the legal entries,  but let's also take care of the illegal ones.   And so in reality, that money that was earmarked for Mexico in  foreign aid and drug initiatives, I propose that we reroute that and  let's do those things that we know we can do. That will stop the amount  of deaths, the 300 deaths a week that are happening from fentanyl, or  heroin, and then the cocaine and the marijuana coming in. A border wall  and beefed up border security will do that.   And I ask Ms. Pelosi to please negotiate and get off the moral high  horse that you are caving into the President. This is not a partisan  issue. This is an American issue, and it deals with our constitutional  responsibility.   I thank Representative Gohmert for his leadership on this.
