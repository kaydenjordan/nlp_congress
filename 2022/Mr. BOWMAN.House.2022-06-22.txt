 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean  American Heritage Month.   New York's 16th Congressional District is a rich bastion of many  Caribbean communities and cultures. I am proud to represent  constituents from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Puerto Rico,  Grenada, Haiti, Saint Lucia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad  and Tobago, and many more.   The vibrancy and brilliance of this community have shaped the essence  of our district and this Nation. The impact of Caribbean heritage on  the State of New York and our country is tremendous.   I specifically recognize the impact of three organizations that  celebrate Caribbean culture in our district. The All Islands  Association, the Jamaican Progressive League, and the Dominican  Cultural Association of Yonkers have been critical in empowering  neighbors and delivering critical resources and services.   I am proud to represent such a diverse community of people and  honored to continue making New York 16 a better place for all as we  work for better housing, immigration, workers' and care rights, and  entrepreneurship opportunities.                            ____________________
