 Mr. Speaker, I started in this business as a college  student. Inspired by what was happening with the civil rights movement,  I worked on the campaign to lower the voting age to 18 in my home State  of Oregon and on the national campaign.   After that, I had the privilege to work on a series of nonpartisan  efforts to expand the franchise, to improve voting rights, to  streamline access--bipartisan, not particularly controversial.   It has been one of the biggest disappointments of my life to find  that the issues that I worked on as a college student continue to vex  us. But I am pleased today that we are in the process of advancing H.R.  1, the most significant democratic reform package in a generation.   H.R. 1 will make it easier to vote, regardless of income, ability,  geography, or race. It fights to end the dominance of big money in our  politics and enacts tougher ethics standards to ensure public officials  actually work for the public.   I am particularly proud of three provisions that I helped incorporate  into the bill from our Oregon experience.   Oregon is a pioneer of vote by mail, and bringing that model  nationwide paves the way for all States to be able to offer vote by  mail and early voting that is secure and verifiable. It even saves  money for State and local governments.   We have a provision that has automatic voter registration for  individuals interacting with State agencies. They are automatically  registered to vote.   And it mandates that paper ballots ensure election integrity and the  ability to audit.   I look forward to our moving forward, Mr. Speaker, to be able to deal  with this significant conversation to make sure that we meet our  responsibility for the democratic process to function.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  courtesy and my friend, Congressman Price, in bringing us together.   I am standing in front of the chair here on the floor that I  routinely occupied, and Walter sat next to me hundreds of hours. It was  fascinating watching the dynamic on the aisle. I think some people like  to be on the aisle because it is a place where people come together.   I watched a parade of people in both parties who would stop, greet  him, and talk about issues large and small, radiating a sort of  humanity that at times is in short supply around here.   Walter epitomized what I think politics should be.   We talked often about how he was creating problems for himself at  home. There is probably not a district in the United States that is  more oriented towards the United States military, as we have heard  already.   He comes from a district that is intensely patriotic and more than a  little Republican. Yet, he charted a path--once he had determined that  he had made a mistake--he charted a path to try and make it right, not  just to the Gold Star families, but to having that interaction here on  the House floor, not in an accusatory fashion for people who may have  disagreed with him, but just humbly focused on the human consequences  on the political foibles of Congress.   He willingly took that burden on; even though he knew that it could  have cost him his position in Congress. And this is family tradition,  as is mentioned, I mean his father before him. It mattered a great deal  to Walter to carry that banner, to serve his constituents and his  State, but he walked into that storm willingly because he thought it  was the right thing to do.   We don't see a lot of that around here, people who can face up to  mistakes--which we all make. How many of us have as graciously and  publicly acknowledged our mistakes, attempted to make them right, and  accept the consequences?   Walter was a singular human being, and I feel privileged to have sat  next to him all those hours.
