 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, right now,  experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are  continuing to update their mask requirements based on the latest  developments, including requirements related to travel. They need us to  be reinforcing their science-based work to keep people safe, not  overruling it.   We cannot pretend this pandemic is over. This virus is still  spreading; it is still mutating; it is still costing lives; and it is  still leaving survivors with long-haul symptoms. And the new Delta  variant is more contagious, more likely to send people to the hospital,  and already in our country.   We have made great progress on vaccinations, but there are still  people who are not vaccinated, as well as people who cannot yet get  vaccinated. We know masks remain a simple, effective way to protect  everyone, especially in small crowded spaces--in an airplane, on a bus,  or a train.   Getting rid of mask requirements for travel before the experts tell  us it is safe to do so is not going to get people to their destinations  any faster, and it is not going to end this pandemic any faster.  Instead, it will draw things out. It will cost time, and it will cost  lives. To get everyone safely through this pandemic, we need to listen  to the experts and let them do their jobs; therefore, I object.
