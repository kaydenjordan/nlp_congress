 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 15th  anniversary of the Warrior's Weekend Field of Honor.   The mission of the Field of Honor has always been to honor our  Nation's veterans and encourage our wounded warriors. This all began in  May 2009 when Warrior's Weekend president, Ron Kocian, a Texas Army  National Guard veteran, gave retired Colonel Mike Petrash of the U.S.  Army the approval to conduct the first Field of Honor in Victoria,  Texas, in support of Warrior's Weekend. It became an instant success  during which 550 sponsored flags were posted by local area sponsors,  patriots, and families, touching the hearts of over 300 visiting  warriors from all over the United States.   In 2011, the Field of Honor expanded its army of volunteers, so to  speak, and encouraged faith-, civic-, veteran-, and youth-based  organizations to partner with them as a way of raising funds for their  own community programs in a way that is honorable and noteworthy.   As the Field of Honor matured and the mission of honoring veterans  for their service continued to thrive, it eventually led to the  inclusion of the third pillar of the Warrior's Weekend mission: to  build a community of honor and excellence.   Throughout the lifetime of the Field of Honor, over 30,000 flags have  been sponsored, prepared, and posted in honor of our veterans, wounded  soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen who come to Victoria from all 50  States and Puerto Rico to enjoy a weekend of respite from their wound  care.   Warrior's Weekend and the Field of Honor are truly a nationwide  ministry that has a positive impact on the thousands of cities and  towns across America. The warriors go back and live more complete,  productive lives for themselves, their families, and their communities.   On this day, we recognize the service and sacrifice of all those  thousands of patriotic servant leaders who have strived for 15 years to  honor veterans, encourage warriors, and build a community of honor and  excellence.   Warrior's Weekend Field of Honor has shown this Nation what ``right''  looks like, and it is through the great work and leadership of  volunteers demonstrating a true commitment to honoring the United  States of America as one Nation under God.                            ____________________
