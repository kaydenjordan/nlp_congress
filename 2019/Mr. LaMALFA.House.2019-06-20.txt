 Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight in support of increasing  the productivity of our national forestland. Somehow, America is the  world's number two importer of lumber, and at the same time our forests  continue to burn at an unprecedented rate. We need to get our forests  back in working order.   The majority provided $276 million for forest products, which is an  increase of $7 million above the enacted level and $4 million below the  President's budget request.   My amendment would support job growth and increased timber production  to support forest health and promote safe communities. This funding is  critical to support the President's executive order on forest  management that involves a plan to sell 3.7 billion board feet of  timber and improve over 1.1 million acres of national forestland to  mitigate wildfire risk.   Right now there are 150 million dead trees just in my home State of  California. If we don't act now to dedicate more resources toward  timber management, we won't have any forest left to manage. Instead, we  will be watching them burn, foul the air, and foul our water with ash;  and in the meantime, we are still importing wood products.   For example, as a result of the 2018 Carr fire in West Redding,  California, which burned approximately 230,000 acres and eight people  lost their lives, we also lost the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area  encompassing 318 square miles which burned to the ground.   We need to increase the pace and scale of forest production and  wildfire mitigation in a way that makes business sense and includes the  private sector.   Mr. Chairman, 62 percent of forestlands in my district are federally  owned. The remaining private forests in my district generate 73,000  jobs, contribute $4 billion in manufacturing and sales and supports  $1.7 billion in payroll.   There should be no reason our Federal forests cannot produce the same  benefits and results to its employees and community as the private  sector can.   Let's focus on protecting public health, creating jobs, enjoying the  great outdoors by reducing fire risks, and generating economic growth  to rural communities across the U.S.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the House for passage of my amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise to join my friends and colleagues  in celebrating Juneteenth.   Madam Speaker, 154 years ago, on June 19, 1865, Texas became the  final State in the U.S. to officially abolish slavery. This was a  pivotal day in American history, one that represents both the checkered  past of our Nation as well as the rising above it.   September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation  Proclamation, and it took effect on January 1, 1863, throughout all the  formerly Confederate States.   Madam Speaker, 2 years later, Texas was the last stop on the road to  the abolition of slavery in America on June 19, known as Juneteenth.   On a day like Juneteenth, we encourage everyone to come together and  celebrate this occasion and recognize not what makes us different from  one other, but what we all have in common, all that we share: the love  of freedom and individual rights that we are one people.   There is still more to be done, but a lot of progress has been made  the last 150 years, and we will continue to make that together as a  society.                            ____________________
