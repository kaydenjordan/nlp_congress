 Mr. Speaker, we begin an unusual week here on Capitol  Hill, although unusual is sort of the new usual in Washington, D.C.   The Senate begins deliberations on an 8-year Republican mission to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they don't fully know what it is  exactly they are voting on.   There is uncertainty in the House over both the budget and  appropriations, but, you know, there is an opportunity for Congress to  take a step back, to do something that will make a huge difference for  everybody from coast to coast, something that can bring together a wide  coalition of support and meet unmet needs.                                time  1015    I am talking about addressing the unmet infrastructure needs for a  country that is falling apart as we fall behind.   We haven't raised the gas tax in 24 years. And in the course of that  24 years, we have watched the value of the Federal gas tax actually  erode 40 percent, due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency, while  our needs continue to go up each and every year.   Congress has put together a series of stopgap measures--gimmicks here  and there--which have not adequately met those needs, and they have  actually increased the budget deficit.   I think back to Ronald Reagan making his Thanksgiving Day speech in  November of 1982, when he called on Congress to come back from their  recess and more than double the gas tax because, he pointed out, it  would put people to work and improve road conditions that were actually  damaging people's cars more than what modest increase they would pay.  Well, Congress did it, and we were better off as a result. I think each  of us would do well to look back at that speech that Ronald Reagan  gave, calling on Congress to step up and do its part.   The States are not sitting back. Since over the last 5 years, more  than half of the individual States have gone ahead and raised their  transportation funding. So far in 2017 alone, California, Indiana,  Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina raised  the gas tax. In fact, South Carolina raised the gas tax by overriding a  Republican Governor's veto.   There are opportunities here for us to be able to step forward and  build on this vast coalition. It really isn't a profile in courage to  support legislation that is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the AFL-CIO, contractors, a variety of labor unions, road builders,  engineers, trucking companies, and AAA. The widest coalition of people  supporting any major issue before us deals with increasing the fuel  tax.   And it is interesting, for those who are worried that maybe there is  some political downturn, despite the fact that the States have been  able to summon the courage. The American Road and Transportation  Builders Association did an extensive survey about who were those  intrepid legislators that voted to raise the gas tax since 2012. What  they found is that those legislators who had the courage and the vision  to do what was right for their States were reelected by an over 90  percent rate.   But this shouldn't be about elections. It should be about what is  right for the American people. Stepping up, meeting our obligations, so  that the Federal Government is a full partner, working with State and  local governments, working with the private sector, to be able to meet  the over $1.1 trillion of critical transportation needs between now and  2025 ought to be the order of business.   I would hope that my friends in Republican leadership would allow us  to have just 1 week of hearings on this issue so that we can hear from  the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president of the  AFL-CIO, the truckers, AAA, Republican legislators of principle, people  across the country who talk about the need to rebuild and renew  America, make our communities more livable, our families safer,  healthier, and more economically secure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I voted for H.R. 3364, the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Roll no. 413).  This legislation is an important step forward in punishing Russia for  its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and for the country's alleged  interference in the 2016 United States presidential election.   The bill also updates and expands sanctions on North Korea at a time  when the country continues to pursue dangerous weapons programs.   Further, I commend leadership and committee members in the House and  Senate for ensuring that the Iran sanctions portion of this legislation  does not violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached  between Iran, the United States, and five major world powers, including  Russia and China. While the Iranian ballistic missile program is deeply  concerning and must be addressed, undermining the nuclear agreement,  which has forced Iran to remove thousands of centrifuges from service  and halt all uranium enrichment, would be a mistake of tragic  proportions.   The bipartisan support for the bill should be a signal to the  administration to refrain from taking action that would encourage Iran  to change course.   To be sure, Iran has some unsavory hardline people in key positions  of leadership, but these hardliners just suffered a major defeat in the  Iranian elections. President Hassan Rouhani has been a voice of and a  force for moderation--and people voted for him.   We must proceed with the utmost caution and develop a thoughtful  approach to ensure we continue to keep Iran away from the nuclear  threshold, while also countering the regime's nefarious activities.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364--but with  reservations.   I strongly support the section of this bill that provides a role for  the Congress before any president may waive sanctions or provide relief  from sanctions against Russia. Russia sought to undermine America's  2016 election. It attempted to subvert our democracy. It did so  deliberately, methodically, and ruthlessly, spreading lies and  misinformation and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and  records to steal private information and release it in sensationalistic  fashion.   These attacks against our democracy were and are totally unacceptable  and must be condemned. I remain bewildered that the current president  of the United States still fails to acknowledge that these actions  happened and that the Russian government, at the very highest level, is  responsible--even though there is a consensus among all U.S. domestic  and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies that this  is the case.   Sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration in response to this  multifaceted operation were lifted by President Trump. This legislation  rectifies that situation by re-imposing those sanctions and ensuring  that they cannot be removed without congressional consultation and  consent.   In addition, Russia continues to threaten its neighbors, especially  Ukraine, for which economic and military sanctions are now in place.   But I am somewhat reluctant in my support for this legislation  because of the provisions included on Iran. Like all my colleagues, I  am worried about Iran's continued testing and development of ballistic  missile technology. It is threatening and provocative to Iran's  neighbors and the region. I also oppose Iran's support for regional  militant and terrorist organizations, and for choosing to side with the  brutal regime of Bashir al-Assad in the Syrian conflict, as did Russia.   I do support, however, Iran's continuing compliance with the terms of  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)--or the Iran nuclear  deal. I worry that the sanctions against Iran included in this bill  will be used and manipulated to undermine the JCPOA. I am worried that  we now have a president and an Administration actively seeking to  abrogate this international nuclear agreement. And I strongly oppose  any action that would violate, let alone abandon, the JCPOA.   The Trump Administration--and the White House in particular--seem  hell-bent on putting us on a path that leads to yet another costly war  in the Middle East and to a nuclear-armed Iran. This would be a  calamity of the greatest order, one that would place our friends and  allies in the region in even greater danger than what they now face. We  must not go there.   While I will vote in favor of H.R. 3364, I do so with grave  misgivings about how President Trump will seek to exploit the sanctions  against Iran provided in this bill to violate U.S. obligations under  the JCPOA, which will, in turn, give permission to Iran to develop a  nuclear weapon, and bring us all to the brink of war in the Middle  East.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3364.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
