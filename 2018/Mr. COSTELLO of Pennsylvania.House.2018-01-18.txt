 Mr. Speaker, we need to keep the  government open, and we need to keep the government funded, and we need  to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. Now, in the  Energy and Commerce Committee, we passed CHIP, reauthorized for 5 years  out of committee in October. We passed it out of the full House in  November. We are now back to authorize it for a full 6 years. We do not  need any additional pay-fors.   This will help 177,000 children in Pennsylvania and millions across  the country. CHIP funding will be exhausted next month in Pennsylvania.  Right now, some States already face a shortfall in their funding as the  program has not yet been fully reauthorized for all of fiscal year  2018.   It is past time that we provide a long-term solution and stability  for families who depend on this quality, affordable coverage. I have  heard from so many constituents--I have heard from many Democrats-- urging us to reauthorize CHIP. Tonight, we have a vote to keep the  government open and to reauthorize CHIP. The right vote on this bill is  a ``yes'' vote. That is the vote I will be taking on behalf of my  constituents and this country.
