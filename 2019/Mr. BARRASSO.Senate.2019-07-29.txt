 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, each year, I come to the floor to  recognize someone from Wyoming whose commitment and service have made a  real and lasting difference to the State's agricultural community. This  year, I would like to tell you about Jim Wilson.   Many people know Jim as a rancher. Together with his wife Terry and  his daughter Billie Jo and her family, Jim raises high-quality Wyoming  beef in Hot Springs County. If you ask Jim, however, he will tell you  he works to grow better grass to grow better beef. Like his mother and  father, Willard and Maycle, before him, Jim and his wife have built a  thriving operation that sets the bar high for other Wyoming producers.   Most people know that Jim wears many other hats too. After developing  a strong herd of Saler-cross beef cattle, Jim went on to lead the  national breed association. He served for a decade on the Hot Springs  County Hospital Board, was part of the Wyoming Livestock board at a  pivotal time for the State, and has spent countless hours leading  meetings for local agricultural and conservation district groups. His  work has not gone unnoticed. The list of awards recognizing the Wilson  family and their incredible stewardship of Wyoming's precious natural  resources is long, and the awards are widely varied. Jim has spent his  life improving water, soil, forage, and genetics for the future.   Not all of the accolades, however, belong solely to Jim. For many  years, Jim has supported and mentored young people across the State to  learn, live, and grow in their agricultural pursuits. He has inspired  many and has watched them achieve great success. Like his father,  Willard, Jim volunteers to judge at county fairs and encourages young  producers to be engaged in State associations. Put simply, Jim is a  mentor who leads by example.   When he served as president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association,  Jim kept his sights set firmly on the future. As the association  approached its 150-year anniversary, Jim knew the association would  soon be in the hands of the next generation of producers. He worked to  draw younger producers in to build an association that combines  experience and innovation to make the association stronger. When Jim's  presidency concluded, he became chairman of the 150th anniversary  campaign that sought to raise $1.5 million before 2022. We all know  that, when Jim Wilson sets his sights on something, he cultivates and  leads an unstoppable team to get the job done.   Working in agriculture is not simply a job. It is a vocation, a way  of life, a calling for which Jim, his wife Terry, their daughter and  her family are incredibly effective ambassadors. They share their  struggles and their victories, they look for creative solutions,  [[Page S5138]]  and they inspire others to act purposefully. They know there is a  better future ahead, as long as good people are willing to put in the  work to make it happen. There is no question Jim has put in the work.   In a few short days, Jim Wilson will be honored as one of the 2019  inductees to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. He joins the elite  ranks of other incredible individuals who have forever changed the  future of this way of life in the great State of Wyoming. Thea Nuckolls  said it best when she said her late husband JW ``saw Jim as a model of  integrity, having a spirit of generosity, the heart of humility, and a  devoted family man.''   It is with great appreciation and honor that I rise today to  recognize the incredible contributions of Jim Wilson. My wife Bobbi  joins me in congratulating Jim and his family on this well-deserved  honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here today to talk about America's  highway infrastructure. It is important to every State. I have just  come back from Wyoming, and it clearly is important in my home State.  It is important in every community. It is important in every Tribe in  the country. I see that week after week in Wyoming. Our roads, our  bridges, our highways, our tunnels support America's economic growth  and our competitiveness. The Presiding Officer, from his home State of  Missouri, knows this as well. These are an essential part, really, of  everyday life for all of America.   We use the infrastructure. We use the roads, the bridges, the  tunnels. We use them when we drive to work, when we head to school or  we head off to summer vacation. Our economy is built on a well- functioning road system that allows products from rural areas to get  transported to population centers. They are used to ship American-made  products and goods from one coast to the other.   Certainly in Wyoming, we see a lot of goods coming in then being  transported from the coast in California to Chicago, with truck after  truck going  [[Page S5144]]  through Wyoming. Interstates, like I-80 in my home State of Wyoming,  are critical arteries for commerce in this country. Our roads create  jobs. They move products, and they keep our country running and going  strong.   In 2015, the U.S. transportation system moved a daily average of  about 49 million tons of freight; that is, a daily average of 49  million tons of freight worth more than $53 billion--every single day.  Our roads and our bridges have to keep pace. These systems are vital to  our country, and they need to be taken care of. We must maintain,  upgrade, and, when necessary, build new ones.   Since his election, President Trump has called on Congress to act on  infrastructure. Last year, Congress answered the President's call by  passing America's Water Infrastructure Act. He signed it into law. It  passed this body 99 to 1. The legislation helped streamline major  projects and helped keep communities safe. It made a significant  investment in our Nation's dams and our locks and our ports and in  drinking water systems.   Now is the time to do the same for our roads and for our bridges.  That is why, today, I am introducing America's Transportation  Infrastructure Act, and I am doing it along with my fellow leaders of  the Environment and Public Works Committee, Ranking Member Carper and  Senators Capito and Cardin.   This legislation will make a historic investment in our roads. It  will cut Washington redtape. It will improve safety and will help grow  our economy. America's Transportation Infrastructure Act authorizes  $287 billion over 5 years from the highway trust fund. Of that money,  $259 billion will go directly to the States through the highway formula  funding process. This is the largest investment in America's roads in  any highway bill ever passed by Congress. The legislation will help the  entire country. It will ensure both rural and urban areas have access  to funding.   Formula funding gives each State the flexibility it needs to address  specific surface transportation needs. The formula-based approach has a  proven track record of efficiently delivering infrastructure money  directly to the States. America's Transportation Infrastructure Act  maintains this important approach so that States will get the funds  they need faster.   America's Transportation Infrastructure Act also continues successful  Federal loan programs, such as the Transportation Infrastructure  Finance and Innovation Act, which many people in the business know as  TIFIA. TIFIA and programs like it get taxpayers significant bang for  their buck. A single taxpayer dollar in the TIFIA program can be  leveraged 40 times that much in terms of infrastructure spending.   Between new authorizations, leveraging within Federal loan programs,  with State-match requirements and likely additions from the Commerce  and Banking Committees, our bill's total impact on infrastructure will  be nearly one-half trillion dollars--a historic high. With these  investments, it is critical for us to speed up government approvals for  important projects.   Last Congress, the Environment and Public Works Committee heard  testimony about a highway safety project that I am very familiar with  in Wyoming--and not too far from where the Presiding Officer lives-- near the interstate north of Sheridan, between Sheridan and Montana. It  took a decade to get the permits but actually took only months to  build. That has to stop. This was a safety project linking our States  together. It was held up for 10 years because of Washington permits. It  is unacceptable. America's Transportation Infrastructure Act cuts  Washington redtape so projects can get done faster, better, cheaper,  and smarter. President Trump has set a goal for his administration of  completing environmental reviews for projects within 2 years. It is a  goal that I applaud, and the policy is called One Federal Decision.    Our legislation makes key elements of that policy into law. Instead  of several Federal agencies having duplicate requirements on the same  project, the process is simplified because it needs to be simplified.  Our bill gives States increased flexibility so that Federal approvals  can get moving and so that project construction can get started. It  also reduces the amount of paperwork that is needed from the States to  complete a project. Our legislation gets long delayed safety projects  moving faster. Washington shouldn't prioritize paperwork over people's  safety, but that has happened in the past, and it is unacceptable.   America's Transportation Infrastructure Act makes road safety a top  priority. It supports innovative research and technology deployment,  including new construction technologies that will make roads safer and  will expedite project delivery. For example, the bill supports  technologies that allow construction projects to be managed digitally.  That will enable project managers to better track projects from design  through operation.   The Presiding Officer knows this and sees it, and I saw it this past  weekend. When a car collides with an animal on a highway, the results  can be dramatic and sometimes even deadly for both the animal and for  the driver. Our bill creates a pilot program to build wildlife highway  crossings to minimize the danger of vehicle-wildlife collisions.   Across the country, aging bridges are in need of maintenance. Our  bill establishes a competitive grant program to help address the  backlogs of bridges that are in poor condition. Our bill establishes a  new program to incentivize States to lower the total number of  fatalities with there being a special focus on pedestrian deaths, which  are on the rise.   Of course, the climate is changing, and humans have a collective  responsibility to do something about it. I believe that American  innovation, not government regulation and taxation, is the answer to  our addressing a changing climate. Our bill includes a climate change  title that ensures the durability of our transportation infrastructure,  and our bill provides flexible resources to help States reduce carbon  emissions. It helps States build more resilient highways. We want to  make sure that our roads and our bridges are built to withstand extreme  weather events, like hurricanes and floods, or natural disasters, like  wildfires, earthquakes, and rockslides.   The legislation also helps to reduce transportation-related carbon  emissions. The very successful bill that had been signed into law  previously and is expiring, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, is a  program that has helped communities in Wyoming and Montana to replace  aging school buses and public equipment. The Diesel Emissions Reduction  Act helps to reduce black carbon emissions. This is one of the biggest  contributors to climate change. Our bill reauthorizes this program, and  it supports innovation. Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration  technologies hold the key to major emissions reductions. I have  introduced the USE IT Act, along with my colleagues in the Senate, to  support this important research, and it is included in this bill.   As I have stated, this is bipartisan legislation. It doesn't just  include Republican priorities; it includes Democratic priorities as  well. For example, this legislation establishes grant programs to help  fund the construction of electric vehicle charging stations and  infrastructure for other alternative fuel vehicles, such as natural  gas. This provision has been a priority for several Senators, including  for Ranking Member Carper.   My priority is to make sure these vehicles are actually contributing  to the maintenance of our roads. With a rapidly growing electric  vehicle market, it is necessary to make sure drivers of these  alternative fuel vehicles are contributing to road maintenance. Nearly  every automaker is ramping up electric vehicle production. Right now,  none of these vehicles pay to maintain America's roads. How can that  be? The highway trust fund is funded through fuel taxes. Because they  don't buy gasoline, these vehicles simply do not contribute. Yet  electric vehicles do as much damage to our highways as do traditional  gas-powered vehicles. Everyone who drives on our Nation's roads should  contribute to the cost of road maintenance.   Our bill is bipartisan, substantial, and needs to be paid for. As the  Presiding Officer knows, the Committee on Environment and Public Works  doesn't have jurisdiction over revenues for the highway bill. Ranking  Member Carper and I are going to work closely  [[Page S5145]]  with Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Ron  Wyden to responsibly pay for this legislation.   In the process of writing this legislation, we have received  extensive feedback from experts from our home States and from other  Senators. The bill has already received broad support from groups like  the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of  Manufacturers, the American Highway Users Alliance, the American Road &  Transportation Builders Association, the American Council of  Engineering Companies, the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association,  the North American Concrete Alliance, and many more.   We have planned to mark up America's Transportation Infrastructure  Act this week. The business meeting will be a great opportunity in  which to strengthen the legislation and move this important process  forward. I am thankful to Ranking Member Carper and to all of the  members of our committee for working with me on this important piece of  legislation. America's Transportation Infrastructure Act will grow the  Nation's economy, will improve the safety of our roads, and will  enhance the quality of life for the American people.
