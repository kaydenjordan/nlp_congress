 Mr. President, at 4:20 p.m. today, which is in about 5  minutes, we are going to vote on a Federal judge. We are going to vote  on whether to confirm Judge Michael Newman to be the next Federal judge  for the Southern District of Ohio.   I have known Mike Newman for over three decades, and he is an  excellent choice for this role. He is an active member of the legal  community in Ohio and is particularly active in his community of  Dayton. He is also involved nationally. He was the first magistrate  judge ever to be appointed national president of the Federal Bar  Association, through which he created an impressive national civics  program to allow young people, including a lot of young people in the  Southern District of Ohio, to meet with Federal judges. He started and  presides over the Southern District of Ohio's Federal Veterans  Treatment Court, which has helped more than 70 veterans with PTSD and  opioid addiction. I have seen the court in action.   Mike is doing a great job. In fact, this year, he was selected to  receive the Ohio State Bar Foundation's Ritter Award, which is a  lifetime service award given to one lawyer or judge in Ohio every year  to recognize a long-term commitment to ethics, professionalism, and  integrity. That is Mike.   Judge Newman is the right choice for this important seat in his  having served the community of Dayton with honor and distinction, and I  am confident he will do the same in this new role. I urge my colleagues  to, in a moment, strongly support his confirmation.                       Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett    Mr. President, of course, this week, we are also continuing to  consider an important nomination of another Federal judge--Seventh  Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett--to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.   Yesterday, I had the chance to sit down one-on-one with Judge Barrett  to ask her questions and follow up on what I thought was an impressive  performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Even before our  meeting, what I knew about Judge Barrett suggested she would be a good  candidate for this important role. Based on what I heard in our  meeting, it is clear to me she is not only well qualified to serve on  the Court but that she is also a great listener and has the right  understanding of what the Court's role is. She will be a terrific  Supreme Court Justice. I believe she also understands the need to  address the lack of faith in our institutions in this city, including  the Court, and is willing to play an important role in helping to  rebuild trust.   Importantly, she reiterated to me what she said in the committee,  which is that she has a commitment to interpret the text of the  Constitution and the laws as they are written rather than through the  lens of her own policy and personal preferences. I appreciate that  modest approach. It leaves the legislating to the representatives, who  have been elected by the people, rather than to the unelected judges.  Of course, we are also all inspired by her personal story and her  commitment to her faith, to her family, and to her profession.   Let's be honest. During normal, less partisan times, this woman would  be confirmed overwhelmingly. I believe she is an excellent choice. I  commend the President for nominating her, and I strongly support her  confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, while we have another minute, let me just  say on another topic, which is the coronavirus pandemic, I am deeply  disappointed that yesterday we had another vote here on the floor of  the Senate wherein we offered legislation which passed by a majority of  the Senators but not the supermajority needed that simply focused on  the coronavirus  [[Page S6397]]  pandemic and the economic consequences of it. Unbelievably, it was  blocked. In other words, we were not able to move forward because the  Democrats were not willing to at least get on the issue and begin to  discuss and debate the issue. This is sad to me.   We are not out of the woods yet either in terms of the economy or in  terms of the pandemic. In fact, we are in the third phase now of the  pandemic in many of our States, including in mine, Ohio. We need help.  This legislation had that help--as an example, $30 billion-plus for a  vaccine. We need that funding to be able to get a vaccine as quickly as  possible. We need money for therapies, money for our schools, and money  for small businesses to be able to keep their doors open.   I am concerned that we are not using the same bipartisan approach we  used four other times in this Chamber to help deal with the coronavirus  pandemic.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Newman Nomination
