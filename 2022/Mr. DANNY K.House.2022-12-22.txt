 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman  for putting this bill together.   We live in a country that is governed by a Constitution, laws, rules,  and regulations. There are no exemptions, there are no people who could  be let off because of a position that they hold.   Tradition has it that we have seen the public is desirous of  information. They want to know, and I think it is our responsibility to  make sure that they do.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation.
