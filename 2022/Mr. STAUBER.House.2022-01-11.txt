 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Agnes Turk, a  constituent from the great Eighth District of Minnesota, who is  celebrating her 108th birthday this week.   Born in Pennsylvania, Agnes soon after moved to the Twin Ports area  and has lived there ever since.   As a young woman, Agnes valued her education so much that she walked  2 miles to school every day, rain or snow. She later went to business  school, showing the spirit of hard work instilled in her.   Since the 1930s, Agnes has lived a beautiful life in Duluth,  Minnesota, where she and her husband, John, raised three boys.   While John worked for U.S. Steel and the family operated a theater  and an oil service station together, they happily lived out their  American Dream.   Additionally, Agnes is a dedicated mother; a patriotic citizen, who  has never missed voting in an election; and a faithful churchgoer.   She has touched the lives of so many people in the Northland, and her  impact on Duluth will always be remembered.   I am proud to wish my good friend Agnes a happy 108th birthday and  another year of health and happiness.                            ____________________
