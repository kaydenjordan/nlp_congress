 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to ask a simple yet important question, a  question more and more Americans are beginning to ask: What have the  Democrats done with their majority?   This Friday marks the 100th day of the new Democratic majority, 100  days of Democratic disappointment.   Today, we were supposed to debate the Democrats' shell budget, but  Speaker Pelosi pulled it. So here we are, debating another bill that is  dead on arrival in the Senate.   The numbers speak for themselves. At this point in the last Congress,  Republicans had passed 141 bills out of committee and 132 out of the  House.   We all believe in accountability, so what do the numbers say now? By  contrast, Democrats have passed 68 bills out of committee and 97 out of  the House, considerably fewer bills out of this House than before.   But think about this: Democrats have passed more bills out of the  House than they have out of the committee. So much for doing the job of  the people's House. No. It is whatever leadership decides.   Mr. Chairman, we have been lectured countless times by Speaker Pelosi  over the years, and you all know the comments: Show us your budget,  show us your values.   It hasn't been said once, it has been said hundreds of times: Show us  your budget, show us your values.   The Speaker and I have disagreements, but I agree that passing a  budget is the fundamental responsibility of the majority. That is not  what we are doing today. Unfortunately, it looks like we will never  know the true values of this majority because there is no budget.   Mr. Chairman, the problem goes beyond the Democrats' lack of results.  As a majority, the Democrats have focused on three principles above all  else: resolutions, radicalism, and resistance.   One in five votes in this House that has been taken since the end of  January were nonbinding messaging resolutions. Just last week, we  wasted time debating a symbolic resolution on healthcare. Imagine for a  moment if we had instead spent one-fifth of our time actually working  to lower premiums, expand choice, or improve quality. Imagine all that  we could have achieved.   Right now, we have a humanitarian crisis along our southern border.  What if we spent one-fifth of our time working to improve border  security and fix the loopholes in our immigration system?   No, Mr. Chairman. Democrats would rather consider another nonbinding  resolution.   I have never known anybody who has run for office who was asked to  make sure you go to Congress to waste time on votes that do not matter.  They send us here to deliver solutions, not resolutions.   Mr. Chairman, the American people deserve better.   Perhaps the Democratic majority is so focused on resolutions because  they don't want the American people to understand the consequences of  their radical, extremist policies.   The Wall Street Journal wrote: ``Democrats are embracing policies  that include government control of ever-larger chunks of the private  American economy.''   Or, as I like to say, if you like the welfare state, you will love  the Democratic agenda.   Take the Green New Deal. Under the guise of fighting climate change,  it will lead to government control over nearly every element of our  lives. What it wouldn't do is make housing more available or even  energy more affordable for hardworking families.   How about Medicare for All? How do you like a one-size-fits-all  healthcare system where government bureaucrats, not consumers, decide  what benefits you are going to receive?   Mr. Chairman, do you know that more than 100 Democrats in the  majority have cosponsored this bill? So not only do they support it,  they crave it to come to the floor.   What would it do? It would end private insurance. That means 158  million Americans would lose their insurance. And everybody on Medicare  Advantage? Gone.   That is what they worked on these first 100 days.   Your doctor? Gone.   Your hospital? Gone.   Your healthcare plan? Gone.   On issue after issue, Democrats seem to have but one solution: more  spending, more bureaucracy, and more government control.    Mr. Chairman, the American public deserves better.   Finally, you can learn a lot about this majority by seeing the bills  they refused to consider these first 100 days.   After spending weeks unwilling to condemn anti-Semitic remarks, you  would think House Democrats would rush to schedule real legislation. We  have a bill sitting at the Speaker's desk right now that would take  concrete steps to counter the growing boycott, divestment, sanctions  movement  [[Page H3229]]  against our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. You would think  that, Mr. Chairman, but that would be wrong.   You would think that after the Virginia Governor made comments that  seemed to support infanticide, House Democrats would rush to schedule  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Remember, this bill  simply ensures that all babies, regardless of when they are born,  receive the medical care they deserve as human beings. Yet for the 31st  time--no exaggeration, 31 times we have asked on this floor for  unanimous consent to bring that bill up--Democrats have refused.   That is what they spent 100 days on. They refuse to defend newborns  from infanticide because they are beholden to the most extreme factions  of their own party.   Mr. Chairman, the American people deserve better.   The only unifying theme of the Democrats' 100 days has been their  nonstop resistance to President Trump. For 2 years, Democrats insisted  that the President colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. Their  own chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,  the one who is supposed to see and protect us, told the American public  in 2017 that there was more than circumstantial evidence to prove it.   Yet when the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion, Democrats  refused to accept the conclusion. They refused to do anything to Adam  Schiff who had lied to the American public for the last 2 years. They  didn't apologize for misleading the public either.   No, without missing a beat and aided by the liberal media, they  simply opened up new investigations. That is what they did for their  100 days.   Who pays for these endless investigations? You, the hardworking  taxpayer. The Democrats are happy to continue to run up the tab and  never bring a budget to the floor to show their values.                                time  0945    Mr. Chair, the American public deserves better.   Today, the Democrats are leaving for their Member retreat and then a  2-week spring break. Let's hope they come back with more than a tan.  Let's hope they come back with a new game plan. Let's hope they come  back ready to work for the common good, not simply to appease their  extremist, radical base.   Now, we are ready and eager to work with Democrats. We are ready to  work with Democrats to secure our border. We are ready to work with  Democrats to upgrade our infrastructure. We are ready to work with  Democrats to lower the cost of prescription drugs and address the  opioid crisis.   We stand ready to work with anyone to solve the problems our country  faces, in the next 100 days and beyond. After 100 days, please, Mr.  Chair, let's get to work. The American people deserve nothing less.
