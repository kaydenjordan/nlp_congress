 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6  minutes regarding the Schumer-Leahy amendment. I realize this will put  off the time slightly for the vote.    Mr. President, I am sorry that the Republicans objected to  the earlier legislation we brought up, which would have helped the  Midwest. It had money in it. Of course, we are not, by any means,  asking for billions more for Puerto Rico in this amendment. In total,  this amendment would add $3.2 billion, of which only $462 million is  for Puerto Rico. The rest is for the Midwest floods, Alabama tornado,  Florida, California, Georgia and other states.   I think it is unfortunate we have reached an impasse on the emergency  disaster supplemental appropriations bill.   For months, I urged Senate Republican leadership to take up and pass  H.R. 268. For nearly 3 months, it wouldn't. During those 3 months,  American communities suffered, and new disasters struck the Midwest and  the Southeast. The new criticism from the Republican leadership was,  with the Democrats' pushing for more comprehensive aid to Puerto Rico  in H.R. 268, that they must not care about the American communities  that have been affected by more recent disasters.   But I would remind the Chamber that it was the Republican leadership  that rejected my amendment to H.R. 268 that would have accommodated all  of these other communities.   I would also remind the Chamber that the Trump administration has not  asked for one dime for Hurricanes Michael and Florence, the Alabama  tornadoes, or the Midwest flooding. To the Trump administration, it is  as though they never happened.   I have always stood with victims of disaster around this country.  When my own State of Vermont was devastated by Tropical Storm Irene,  Members of this body came to me, not as Republicans or Democrats but as  concerned American citizens looking to help, just as I always have,  whatever State it might be. Red State, blue State, or purple State, I  have always voted to support them, and today this Vermonter is here to  stand with all the American communities affected by recent natural  disasters.   I have not given up on finding a path forward. Today Leader Schumer  and I offered a substitute that would provide $2.5 billion in new  funding to address the needs of communities affected by the 2019  disasters, such as flooding in the Midwest and tornadoes in Alabama. It  would also accommodate the needs of the American citizens--remember  that they are Americans--in Puerto Rico and other Territories by  including increased funding for the community development block grant  and grants to help rebuild damaged water systems. It also includes  Medicaid funding for the Northern Mariana Islands and cost match  waivers for the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.   Finally, it mandates that HUD speed up the release of billions in  previously appropriated CDBG funding which the Trump administration has  unnecessarily withheld from disaster-stricken communities in Puerto  Rico, in Texas, in Louisiana, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in Florida,  in South Carolina, in North Carolina, in West Virginia, in California,  in Missouri, and in Georgia. We want to get help to all of those  States.   I am disappointed that once again Senate Republicans have objected to  this critical assistance. We are the United States of America. We are  all Americans. We cannot pick and choose which American citizens to  help in times of crisis.   Frankly, I was offended when the White House referred to Puerto Rico  as ``that country'' that ``only takes from the U.S.A.'' I would remind  the White House to look at a history book. Puerto Rico is part of the  U.S.A. These are our fellow American citizens. We in the Senate must be  better than that. We must stand with all American citizens in times of  crisis.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
