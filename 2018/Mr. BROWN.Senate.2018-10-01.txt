 Mr. President, last month, we were reminded again of the  important work journalists do in our communities, bringing Ohioans,  Oklahomans, people from Kansas, or wherever the information they need  in an unfolding crisis.   In September, we got one of the worst news alerts any of us can  imagine. There was an active shooter in Cincinnati. We hugged our loved  ones a little tighter that night as we prayed for everyone affected by  the latest senseless shooting that took the lives of three innocent  Ohioans.   We thank the first responders who rushed to the scene. We thank the  law enforcement officers who have spent the week investigating. We  thank everyone caring for the injured. We also thank the local  reporters who rushed to the scene, doing their job to keep our  community informed in a crisis.   Reporters gave Ohioans real-time information online and on TV,  immediately getting the word out to warn people to avoid the area where  the shooter was active. They talked to law enforcement, and they talked  to witnesses on the scene. From firsthand accounts, they established  the first shots were heard just before 9:11 a.m.   One reporter talked to a witness who told of the heroism of the  Cincinnati police officer, saying he saw a lady down. A Cincinnati  police officer dragged her out of the bank. She was talking. She was  bleeding. Her shirt was red.   It is yet another horrific scene among far too many we have endured  in this country. At every one of these tragedies--every single one-- courageous journalists and citizens of our country, not enemies of the  people, are among the first on the scene. They tell us the stories  behind the victims, and they help us honor the memories of those we  have lost.   After the incident is over, after the immediate danger has passed,  reporters keep working, interviewing loved ones, giving us a full  picture of what yet another shooting has cost our country. They  reported that Cincinnati lost a father, a grandfather, and a son. They  brought us stories of a young programmer just getting started in his  career whose life was cut short, of a father of two teenagers who will  forever have to live with the scars of losing a parent, and of a  grandfather of eight who helped build the Queen City as a construction  supervisor.   It is despicable that Congress refuses to pass commonsense gun safety  laws to protect Americans from yet more gun violence. As these  tragedies keep happening, we keep pressing for change. We will keep  thanking law enforcement and our medical professionals who deal with  the unthinkable of a mass shooting. We will keep thanking the reporters  who are just doing their jobs--newspaper, radio, television, online--to  bring us the facts and who deserve our respect no matter the comments  of some people in elected office.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week we learned from investigative  reporting that a senior political appointee--a political appointee at  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Eric Blankenstein, has  written hateful, bigoted blog posts.   This is a man handpicked for the job--and paid very well from tax  dollars--by Mick Mulvaney, the head of the CFPB, the sort of part-time  head of the CFPB. He is tasked with enforcing laws to protect  consumers, laws protecting Americans from discrimination and lending.   The Consumer Protection Bureau is supposed to be on the frontlines,  fighting for families getting ripped off by shady payday lenders and  big banks.   The person with Blankenstein's job should be fighting and preventing  the very real financial discrimination that everybody in this body  knows happens all too often today in Ohio and Oklahoma and across this  country.   Instead, now, because of news reports, we know the person tasked with  this job has written that most hate crimes ``are hoaxes.'' These blog  posts are filled with disgusting, bigoted language that I will not  repeat on the Senate floor because we have a better decorum than that  and this language is so offensive.   But this is the man Mick Mulvaney wants going after big banks that  discriminate. How is it that the Director of Management and Budget  failed to look into the background of such a senior, well-paid  political appointee? Placing Blankenstein in charge of fair lending was  a moral mistake, a managerial failure, and he should be fired  immediately. It has been a week now since reporters found those hateful  writings. The fact that he is still in the job is a disgrace. The  President should act; the CFPB head should act.   We have seen no contrition from Blankenstein--no contrition from him,  no apology for the hateful posts, no acknowledgement that these are  totally inappropriate and immoral views for someone whose job it is at  the agency to root out discrimination.   How can you expect to lead a staff dedicated to that mission after  these revelations, after this attitude, after expressing these kinds of  views? There should be no place in the Consumer Protection Bureau for  people who don't believe discrimination is real or don't believe  discrimination is a serious problem.   Too many Americans are turned down for loans or charged higher rates  based on the color of their skin. We know that. That is proven. That is  documented.   A report this year from the Center for Investigative Reporting  analyzed tens of millions of mortgage records. They found that across  the country, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for  a loan, even when you take into account factors like their income and  the size of the loan. Someone who is African American or Latino with  the same income, the same size of loan, the same financial  information--the person of color is more likely to be turned down than  the person who looks like me.   In the runup to the 2008 crisis, faulty mortgages were often  targeted--we know this--to people of color. Even African-American and  Hispanic borrowers with higher incomes than other borrowers found  themselves in subprime products, and then they had to pay for it later.  These practices of discrimination stripped--stripped--a generation's  worth of equity from communities that had fought hard for equal access  to home ownership.   Borrowers with these higher cost loans were foreclosed on at almost  triple the rate of borrowers with standard 30-year fixed rates--almost  triple the rate.   It is important, when you talk about statistics and you think about  these foreclosures, to think about the family that is foreclosed on, to  think about the conversations at the kitchen table, to think about the  discussion with sons or daughters who are teenagers about what is going  to happen to them in school, changes in the school that they are going  to go to, the different neighborhood, the different sets of friends.  All of these are about foreclosures. All of these are about evictions,  and that is just in the housing market.   We know discrimination is a serious problem in all sorts of lending  markets. It is why we created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  to look after bank customers, to root out discrimination.   But under Mick Mulvaney, the agency has been doing the opposite.  Rather than policing shady corporations trying to get away with ripping  off and discriminating against consumers, Mulvaney gutted the office of  the CFPB that was supposed to stop discrimination in lending. He  disbanded the team that protected student loan borrowers. He canceled  an investigation into the payday lending industry that preys on  consumers and traps them in a downward spiral of debt. He exhorted a  group of bank lobbyists saying: You have to lobby harder. You have to  go to people; you have to give campaign money so that they will listen  to you.   He has hired a bunch of political cronies, people like Eric  Blankenstein, and has given them enormous salaries to run the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau into the ground, and we now know  specifically of one. The abuses look pretty common, but we know of  one--again, Eric Blankenstein--who has a history of spewing disgusting,  bigoted views. He is still collecting a $260,000 paycheck from  taxpayers. That is unacceptable.  [[Page S6411]]  It is past time that Eric Blankenstein--I don't think I have ever gone  to the floor and personally called out somebody and their salary and  asked that they be fired, but when he has these kinds of positions and  this kind of background and has spewed this kind of hatred, and we are  paying him $260,000 of taxpayer money, that is morally outrageous.   Mick Mulvaney, do your job. President Trump, do your job. He should  not be employed there.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
