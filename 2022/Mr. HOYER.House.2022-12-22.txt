 Madam Speaker, as majority leader, there has been no  benefit of this job that I have appreciated, very frankly, more than my  magic 1 minute. I intend to take it now.   My friends on both sides of the aisle may be glad to know that this  is the last time, perhaps, that I will be able to avail myself of that  privilege. I intend to use this extended minute to reflect on what we  have achieved together during recent years and on a principle that I am  eager for us to continue to apply in the years ahead.   As Democratic Caucus vice chairman and chairman, as cochair of the  Democratic Steering Committee, as Democratic whip, and as majority  leader, I approach my work in leadership with one principle in mind:  the psychology of consensus.   What is this psychology of consensus?   It means having a greater sense of our being in this work together  than apart.   It means waking up and saying: I am on the team, the American team,  privileged as citizens to serve in this body on behalf of all our  fellow citizens.   It means setting out with the intention to make progress, not to  block it; and it means focusing on what unites us as Americans.  Democrats have put this ethos into practice to hold the party line when  we needed every vote or nearly every vote. Our Members remind one  another: Consider how you can be with us before deciding whether to  have to vote the other way.   Let me share some examples of this success.   In 2008, President Bush asked us to take emergency action to prevent  a financial catastrophe. He was joined by the Secretary of the Treasury  and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Sadly, in our first effort,  upon being asked by President Bush, less than one-third of the  President's party was initially willing to take that action. We needed  to ensure that we had enough Democratic votes to work with President  Bush and the Senate to enact that legislation. And we did.   Not long after, in 2009, our economy was in free fall, the American  people were struggling, and Congress was divided on how to respond. But  despite that challenge, Democrats came together to pass the American  Rescue and Recovery Act. That legislation set our economy on a path to  recovery, saved and created millions of American jobs, and restored  confidence in the American Dream.   The psychology of consensus also helped Democrats deliver a major  victory for the people in 2010: the Affordable Care Act; for all  Americans, irrespective of party, giving access to affordable, quality  healthcare.   Although there were disagreements on the specifics of how best to  reform our healthcare system to make it more accessible and affordable,  we all recognized the urgent need to take action.   We worked together in good faith to secure the votes for that  landmark law which made affordable health coverage attainable for 35  million more Americans, banned discriminatory practices, and  dramatically slowed the growth of healthcare costs.  [[Page H9989]]    Interestingly, the model for that was a bill signed by Mitt Romney,  then-Governor of Massachusetts, now a United States Senator  representing Utah. Seven years later, consensus among Democrats also  proved essential as we defended the Affordable Care Act against a  President and congressional Republicans who were determined to repeal  it.   The psychology of consensus benefits not only our Democratic Caucus,  but I would suggest the entire Congress. We are seeking the psychology  of consensus as we speak.   If we focus on what unites us as Americans who serve in the people's  House, then surely, we can carry out better the people's work. Surely,  we will not achieve consensus on every issue. If we search, however,  for common ground before running to our respective corners, then  compromise and progress become far more likely.   I learned this lesson early, not only as president of the Maryland  State Senate but also working together with Democratic and Republican  House colleagues to achieve bipartisan victories.   The Americans with Disabilities Act, one of the most consequential  pieces of legislation in our lifetimes, shines for me as an example of  that working together. In 1990, I joined with Tom Harkin, Bob Dole, Ted  Kennedy, Steve Bartlett--a Republican who was the mayor of Dallas after  he left here--and others as then-President George H.W. Bush signed that  law into being.   As a result, those with disabilities must now receive reasonable  accommodation, have greater access to opportunity, and are treated with  greater dignity. All of us in this House can take credit for that on  both sides of the aisle. We achieved that by asking ourselves how we  could get to ``yes'' on legislation that would benefit literally  millions and millions of Americans.   We did it again after the 2000 election revealed serious problems  with our voting infrastructure. Colleagues from both parties, skilled  legislators like Bob Ney, my dear friend; Chris Dodd; my good friend  and still to this day one of my best friends, Roy Blunt; and others sat  down together. We ultimately secured the Help America Vote Act of 2002.   The psychology of consensus--coming together, working together, being  together, and making it happen together--made it possible. It has also  led many of us to cooperate to promote freedom and human rights around  the world.   As a former cochair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I have been  honored to meet with those who risk everything to promote freedom and  democracy in our countries. Democrats and Republicans have worked  together successfully to support them in that effort and to ensure that  America remains a bright beacon to all those living in darkness. As  Reagan pointed out, we are the shining city on the hill. The psychology  of consensus is needed to keep that city and that beacon shining.   As part of that commitment to democracy and human rights, I have been  proud to be a leader of the broad, bipartisan coalition supporting the  U.S.-Israel relationship and Israel's pursuit of security and peace in  that region. That effort exemplifies how to build and sustain consensus  in this House. This bipartisan approach must continue, and I will keep  working next Congress to ensure that both parties stand firmly with  Israel.   Recently, the pivotal 117th Congress gave us example after example  after example of how this philosophy helps cultivate bipartisanship.  Both of our parties ought to pursue that. Frankly, we are seeing an  example of that being elusive for our friends on the other side of the  aisle as they try to elect a Speaker.   We came into office facing a cratering economy, a deadly pandemic,  and grave threats to American democracy. Halfway through, we also had  to respond to the most serious threat to global security since the  Second World War: Vladimir Putin's criminal, unjustified, and  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.   The margin of our majority was slim, 222-213. Many predicted the math  would make our efforts to govern unworkable. Two weeks after the  election in 2020, the Republican leader told reporters: We might not be  able to schedule the floor, but we are going to run the floor.   On our side, our psychology of consensus, however, made this one of  the most productive Congresses in recent history and in which I have  served.   Not only by striving for consensus among our caucus, which proved the  naysayers wrong, but by reaching across the aisle to Republicans--to  fellow Americans--when we needed their help to deliver results. Indeed,  however, we ran the floor because of the psychology of consensus.   Coordinating with the Senate and the Biden administration, our House  majority enacted major legislation even against unified Republican  opposition. Our Members stuck together on very tough votes. The  American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act were the result.  These laws arrested the economic free fall, deployed hundreds of  millions of lifesaving vaccine doses, reopened businesses and schools,  created a historic number of new jobs, and set us up to tackle the  climate crisis head-on while enabling American workers and  entrepreneurs to Make It In America.   Much of our success in the 117th Congress, however, resulted from  bipartisanship. We encouraged Republican colleagues to ask themselves  how they could get to ``yes.'' And enough did that we enacted a  bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Respect for Marriage Act, and  other crucial legislation for our country.   We also resoundingly expressed Americans' support for the people of  Ukraine by providing critical military and humanitarian aid during  their hour of danger, our hour of danger, and the world's hour of  danger.   Last night we welcomed and cheered Ukraine's courageous President who  guards the front door of freedom, international order, and a peaceful  global community based on the rule of law. We must continue to support  the Ukrainian people for however long it takes to ensure that they  remain democratic, free, and sovereign.   John Kennedy--a great hero of mine and an inspiration for my entering  politics--said at an inaugural address that goes down in history as one  of the greatest: We will pay any price and bear any burden to defend  freedom here and around the world.   That psychology of consensus made the 117th Congress a success. The  same ethos ought to characterize the next Congress as well, and I will  work towards that end with my Republican colleagues.   Our majority will soon come to an end--or, as I believe, a 2-year  hiatus. The time has come, as President Kennedy said to my generation  when we were ready to step up and serve, for the torch to be passed.                                time  0930    I will not be in the elected leadership of my party next Congress. I  will, however, remain here, serving the country and this institution  that I love.   I will keep urging bipartisanship wherever possible and work to unite  Democrats in opposition whenever circumstances demand.   I offer Mr. Jeffries, Ms. Clark, and Mr. Aguilar my strongest  support, the counsel of my experience, and whatever assistance they may  seek.   I am excited for them to take the helm. I know they are ready to lead  us back to the majority and help our Members deliver for the people.   My colleagues still will see me on the floor regularly as I speak-- albeit more briefly, sadly--on behalf of the people I proudly represent  in Maryland's Fifth District.   It is because of their support, their encouragement, and their  allowance that I have been able to serve in the leadership since 1989  and serve in this body for over four decades. I am so thankful to them  and look forward to continuing our work to make Maryland's communities  safer, stronger, and more prosperous; to make America safer, stronger,  and more prosperous; and to make our alliance with the rest of the  world and freedom-loving peoples stronger, safer, and more prosperous.   We still have much more to do on projects that will benefit our  districts and our State, and I look forward to returning to the  Appropriations Committee as a senior member to advance those efforts.   My work in the House will continue with the same energy, enthusiasm,  and dedication as I hope I have demonstrated over the last 42 years.  [[Page H9990]]    I also thank my Democrat colleagues who have supported me in  leadership. I hope that I have kept the faith. I hope that I have done  as they would have hoped.   I hope they believe I have represented our Congress, this  institution, America, and, yes, my party as they would have expected.   I am proud to serve with the first woman to be Speaker of this House,  the indefatigable Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi.   Our journey of service together began as interns more than five  decades ago after we heeded President Kennedy's call. We sat together  in a small office in the Russell Building, working for Maryland Senator  Daniel Brewster.   We end two decades of partnership and leading the House Democrats,  along with our good friend  Jim Clyburn, who I have known for 50 years.   I salute Speaker Pelosi and her trailblazing tenure.   We, my colleagues, have had the great privilege of serving with two  historic Members of this House: John Lewis and Nancy Pelosi.   Throughout my years in House leadership, I have had the honor of  employing those I believe are the finest, most capable, and most  professional staff on Capitol Hill. Nancy said the same of her staff.   America--we, yes, but America--is blessed by the extraordinary  patriots that serve as staff of this institution and of individual  Members. They are extraordinarily able people, and they are great  patriots.   Whether with me for two decades or just a few months, they have  displayed unrivaled dedication, ability, and integrity. I thank each  and every one of them. They have my gratitude and my deep affection.   If I sang the praises individually of each member of my team, my  magic minute would turn into a magic day, so I won't do that. Suffice  it to say any praise earned by me belongs equally to them.   A number of them were here in the Capitol on January 6, 2021, a day  like December 7, 1941, that will live as a day of infamy in the history  of this Nation.   They were housed in a small, insular office in my office, terrified  by those without and in our hallways who called for the death of the  Speaker and of the Vice President of the United States of America.   They are an extraordinary group of talented public servants.  Notwithstanding that terror, they came back the next day to do  America's work. I thank them for who they are and for what they have  done.   Another group of individuals who I have come to know well and who  have been at my side deserves recognition. The men and women of the  U.S. Capitol Police who have served on my protective detail are among  the finest law enforcement professionals in our country.   They are my friends. They are part of my family. I will love them  always. I have been privileged to get to know them and their families.  They are dear, dear friends, and like so many, they are great patriots.   They are part of a department that has faced enormous strains over  the past 2 years. We must never waver in our support for the U.S.  Capitol Police officers, who every day protect all who work in and  visit this Capitol complex.   They are the frontline defenders of our legislative branch. They are  the frontline defenders of our great democracy. We owe them more than  gratitude; we owe them support.   Most of all, I thank my family, my wife, Judy, who died much too  soon; my daughters, Anne, Susan, and Stefany; my son-in-law, Loren; my  grandchildren, Judy, James, and Alexa, along with Judy's husband, Chris  Gray. They are the parents of my four great-grandchildren, Ava,  Braedon, Brooklyn, and Savannah.   Your love and support have sustained me throughout these years.   I hope the lessons of my time in leadership and the victories we  achieved together, Republicans and Democrats, Members of Congress, 435  people sent here by their neighbors and friends to represent them on  issues directly affecting them, their families, and their country, I  hope that those lessons achieved together under our Democratic majority  will guide the House in meeting the challenges still ahead.   The psychology of consensus provides us with a blueprint for success.  We in this House are, after all, all Americans whose common heritage  should drive us to a common purpose.   In 2 weeks, there will be a new majority. It will be like ours, a  very narrow one--indeed, the same margin we have had, 222-213. The  challenge it poses to both our parties and to each of us and to the  next Speaker and majority whip is all too familiar.    Democrats overcame it through the psychology of consensus. All of us,  all 435 of us, ought to overcome it with that same kind of psychology:  One Nation under God, indivisible.   Guided by a dynamic new leadership team of shared vision and  experience, House Democrats will approach our brief time in the  minority the same way, ready to continue standing up for our  principles, for our ideals, and for America with a united front-- hopefully, not just a partisan united front but a united front,  indivisible.   Republicans would be wise, I think, to take the same approach and  seek common ground with Democrats. Did we do it often enough? Maybe  not. Did we do it successfully? Not always. But together, we must  achieve consensus.   Democrats may not schedule the floor next year, but I hope that the  successful approach we modeled will continue to run the floor.   Madam Speaker, as we close this 117th Congress, let us look ahead  with determination and dedication to the cause that brought each of us  to this Capitol: to serve our constituents, our communities, and our  country; to preserve and defend our Constitution and our democracy; to  keep faith with those who protect our Nation and the allies who stand  alongside us; to represent the American people, to effect their will,  to reflect their generous spirit and deep sense of justice to the best  of our ability--in short, to work together to create a more perfect  Union.   With great reluctance, and even greater hesitation for this special  privilege I am about to lose, though with great hope that, in the  future, I will at least be able to talk, but for all your sakes, not as  long, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as the Members know, the Senate has now  passed the omnibus which will fund government. As the Members also  know, the government will be shut down at midnight tomorrow if we do  not pass additional legislation here.   I have been over in the Senate talking to those who will prepare the  bill to be sent to this Chamber. Unfortunately, the process takes a  long time to do, and it will not be to us for a significant period of  time, meaning it will not be to us before midnight tonight.   As a result, I will announce to Members that I believe we will have  no recorded votes until at the earliest 9 a.m. tomorrow, and Members  need to be available at 9 a.m. and thereafter.   As soon as we get the documents to process on the floor, we will  proceed as quickly as possible, and in addition, the Senate has passed  and we will pass, as well, a short-term CR so that the bill can be  enrolled and sent to the President for signature so there will be no  termination or closing of the government's operations.   So, again, we will be having no further votes tonight. We will  reconvene at 9 a.m., and votes will be conducted as soon thereafter as  we are ready to do so.                            ____________________
