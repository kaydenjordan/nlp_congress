 Mr. President, first, I understand there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, the Asian-American community is still  reeling from the senseless murder of eight people near Atlanta, six of  whom were women of Asian descent. It will be some time before we  understand what drove the madman who perpetrated this crime, but there  is no doubt that abuse, prejudice, and violence against Asian Americans  is on the rise, and it is so un-American and so despicable that we all  must be speaking out about this.   The same day that six Asian women were killed in Georgia, the Stop  AAPI Hate organization released a report naming 3,800 incidents of hate  against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and that is just in 1  year alone.   The fear in the Asian-American community and the threat of violence  against its members should be a topic of national conversation.   In the last 4 years--you know, we all know there have been forces of  racism, dark forces, that have been often seen in America, but the last  4 years, where Donald Trump, at the very minimum, refused to condemn  the bigotry in the instances when he should, have allowed them to come  far more up to the surface. It is as if the society's superego that  keeps these dark forces down has been greatly diminished or even  removed.   It is up to us, particularly under the new President, who fights  bigotry at every step of the way--but it is up to all of us to speak  out against it and to act against it.   The story of the Asian-American community is quintessentially an  American story, and we cannot allow the rising tide of bigotry against  them, the intolerance against them, the prejudice against them to go  unchecked because in a multicultural society like ours, an attack on  any one group is an attack on everyone.   I love the Asian-American community. They are such fine, good  American people. The story of the Asian-American community is  quintessentially an American story. It is a story of coming here,  building strong communities, opening local businesses, churches, civic  organizations, and slowly but surely gaining the political  representation they so deserve.  [[Page S1624]]    Just yesterday, we confirmed a nominee whose parents emigrated from  Taiwan to become the U.S. Trade Representative. That is notable and  important progress. But, unfortunately, the past few years have shown  us that America has not excised the age-old demon of racism, and to too  many it has become acceptable, permissible, or just shrug your  shoulders. That cannot be.   With respect to the Asian-American community specifically and all  communities, we must condemn rhetoric that is racist. In this case, we  must condemn any rhetoric that blames the Chinese people for the  coronavirus. President Trump did that, despicably, and that notion was  too often encouraged by others who repeated his harsh, nasty, and  bigoted words.   We must stand beside and stand up for our Asian-American brothers and  sisters. Americans of every faith, every color, every gender and sexual  orientation must band together against these dark forces of hate. As I  said, they are always with us, but somehow after the 4 years of the  Trump Presidency, they are rising to the surface and seem too  acceptable to too many people. Fight them, fight them, fight them we  must.   As we mourn with the people of Georgia, let us recommit ourselves to  that most American of creeds that is right above the mantle where you  sit, Mr. President, ``e pluribus unum.'' Out of many, one.   America: ``e pluribus unum.'' Out of many, one.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on nominations, today, the Senate will  vote to confirm another member of President Biden's Cabinet, Xavier  Becerra, to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services.   In truth, Attorney General Becerra's nomination should not have taken  this long. From the moment the Attorney General Becerra was announced  as President Biden's pick for HHS, Senate Republicans have tried to  derail his nomination. Their arguments almost verge on the ridiculous.  They complain loudly that he had no direct experience as a medical  professional, even though Republicans voted in lockstep to install Alex  Azar, a pharmaceutical executive, who raised drug prices and tried to  undermine our Nation's health law as the previous HHS Secretary.   Becerra, by contrast, has decades of standing up for working and  middle-class Americans in Congress, fighting to protect and expand  Medicare and Medicaid and working to safeguard our healthcare system  from attacks by the Trump administration.   As the Biden administration works to defeat this pandemic, the  President deserves to have his Cabinet confirmed, especially a post as  important as HHS Secretary. I look forward to completing his nomination  today.   A few days after Democrats gained control of the Senate, we had big  tasks ahead of us right away. I said that we had three important  priorities to do quickly: One, the impeachment trial of Donald Trump;  two, big and bold COVID relief; and, three, President Biden's Cabinet.  We have already finished the first two priorities, and very soon we are  going to finish the third.   I want to thank my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues, for working  so quickly, so hard, and in such a unified team effort to allow all of  this to happen. I am very proud of what we have done in these first few  months.   Later today, the Senate will take its first vote on the nomination of  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to be our Nation's Labor Secretary. Early next  week, after we confirm him, the Senate will have confirmed every  available Cabinet Secretary and many more Cabinet-level appointments  besides. That is excellent progress, and, again, I want to thank my  colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle for their votes in  supporting these fine nominees.   What does it mean? It means the Biden administration will have the  personnel in place to implement the American Rescue Plan, finish the  fight against COVID-19, and bring our country roaring back. In the  meantime, the Senate must continue to work to get the rest of the  President's team in place.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the American Rescue Plan. As  Americans learn more and more about ARP, the American Rescue Plan, the  more popular it becomes and the more optimistic Americans feel about  our economic recovery.   Across the country, the support for the rescue plan has risen to over  70 percent. In January of this year, before President Biden took office  and Democrats assumed the majority of the Senate, more than four in  five Americans believed America was on the wrong track; less than one  in five said it was on the right track.   Now a majority, 55 percent, believe the country is headed in the  right direction. It is back on the right track. That is a dramatic turn  rather quickly, but I think it is, in part, because of the good work we  have done here in the Senate.   Now we have learned something else: Consumer confidence has increased  faster after the passage of the American Rescue Plan than after any of  the other stimulus bills passed by Congress, particularly among low-  and middle-income Americans, who have suffered the most.   That is fantastic news. Americans at the top have been able to  survive the pandemic much more easily than Americans at the lower end  of the ladder. For that reason, economists have long feared a K-shaped  recovery in which high-income earners recover quickly, while middle-  and low-income earners are left behind.   The American Rescue Plan is finally restoring confidence and support  for Americans at the middle and at the bottom, helping drive a robust  recovery for everyone.   One crucial aspect of that recovery is support for housing. As we all  know, during the pandemic, tens of millions of Americans were out of  work and drained family incomes. Americans were forced into impossible  choices: Do I pay the rent and utilities this month or do I buy another  few weeks of groceries?   Sadly, more than 13 million Americans report that they have fallen  behind on the rent, especially Black and Brown Americans.   So when Senate Democrats put together the American Rescue Plan, we  made one of the most significant investments in housing assistance in  recent history: more than $20 billion in emergency aid for low-income  renters, those at the greatest risk of eviction; $10 billion to help  homeowners behind on mortgages and utilities to avoid foreclosure.   We include crucial support for rural America, homeowners struggling  with the mortgage, and Americans, particularly veterans, who have  recently fallen into homelessness or at risk of homelessness.   The American Rescue Plan goes further in delivering housing  assistance to Tribal Nations and Native Hawaiians, more than any other  housing bill in history.   The American Rescue Plan, quite literally, will keep a roof over  Americans' heads. It is just one of the many ways the ARP delivers  relief to struggling Americans and sets the stage for a supercharged  economic recovery.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Walsh nomination be considered expired and the  Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination at 5:30 p.m., Monday,  March 22.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 32.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  March 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the nomination of Martin Joseph Walsh to be Secretary  of Labor as provided under the previous order; further, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of Senators, on Monday, after the  Senate convenes, we expect to swear in Karen Gibson to be Senate  Sergeant at Arms.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Cornyn.
