 Mr. Speaker, this is about harassing the President, and  it is about delaying the inevitable.   I would have hoped that my friends across the aisle, especially in  the Judiciary Committee that had concerns in 2005 and 2006 about the  overreach that was possible through the FISA procedures, would have  seen that there was no collusion, that the Russians did try, but nobody  with the Trump campaign bought.   So we are left with the fact that the real collusion here was between  the Clinton campaign, with Fusion GPS hiring a foreign agent,  Christopher Steele, who talked to people he now admits could well have  been agents of Vladimir Putin, who gave false information about Trump,  the candidate, that was used in a dossier that was used to manipulate  the FISA court into giving a warrant to start spying on the Trump  campaign. That is what this was about.   And what people are calling obstruction of justice is exactly what  you have when you have somebody falsely accused of colluding,  conspiring with the Russians, and he knows he didn't do that, and he  sees his family being harassed, and everybody that worked with the  campaign that can be pushed and shoved and blackmailed, as happened,  and bankrupted, you want to bring it to an end. You want to see justice  done.   But instead of my friends in Judiciary coming together with us who  have been concerned about the abuses of the FISA system so that it  doesn't happen to other Americans, instead, they come with this  resolution to push the matter down the road a little further to the  2020 election.   It has got to stop. Let's stop now.
