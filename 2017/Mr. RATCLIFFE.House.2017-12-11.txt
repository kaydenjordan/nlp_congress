 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to take action on what I believe is  the defining public policy challenge of our generation: the  cybersecurity posture of the United States.   We have seen cyber attacks hit every sector of our economy with  devastating impacts to both government agencies and to the private  sector alike. It is our duty to ensure that we are doing our very best  to defend against the very real threats that our cyber adversaries now  pose.   The Department of Homeland Security is the Federal Government's lead  civilian agency for cybersecurity. Within it, the National Protection  and Programs Directorate, or NPPD, leads our national effort to  safeguard and to enhance the resilience of our Nation's physical and  cyber infrastructure, helping Federal agencies and, when requested,  also helping the private sector to harden their networks and to respond  to cybersecurity incidents.    As the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, Mr. Speaker, so  should the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 3359 elevates the  cybersecurity and the infrastructure security missions of NPPD to  strengthen the Federal Government's ability to act and react to the  changing threat landscape.   The cybersecurity mission today is extremely challenging due to a  number of factors: the ability of malicious actors to operate from  anywhere in the world now, the linkages between cyberspace and our  physical systems, and the difficulty of reducing vulnerabilities and  consequences in complex cyber networks.   The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Act of 2017 rises to  this challenge and prioritizes the Department of Homeland Security's  vital role in cyberspace. By authorizing the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency within the DHS, this bill establishes  the structure, the nomenclature, and the flexibility to best serve the  American people.   The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will be  structured to best work with partners at all levels of government, from  the private and the nonprofit sectors, to share information and to  build greater trust in order to make our cyber and our physical  infrastructure more secure.   This bill provides the necessary overarching structure and the  interdepartmental flexibility to best allow the DHS to execute its  mission in both cybersecurity and the infrastructure security space.   Mr. Speaker, we consider this legislation at a great time of  transition and opportunity for the DHS. Just last week, Kirstjen  Nielsen was sworn in as the Secretary of Homeland Security. In addition  to an impressive record of public service, Secretary Nielsen brings  unprecedented cybersecurity experience and savvy to the agency,  qualifications fitting the threat landscape that she now inherits.                                time  1645    We owe it to her and to the dedicated women and men working alongside  her to ensure that DHS has the proper organization and resources to  carry out its mission as the lead civilian cybersecurity agency in our  Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman McCaul for his leadership and  his dogged determination in this effort and getting this bill to the  floor, as well as the other committees of jurisdiction who worked  closely to craft this compromise.   Mr. Speaker, the cybersecurity challenges we face are about more than  protecting bottom lines or intellectual property or even our Nation's  most sensitive classified information. Ultimately, our obligation as  lawmakers to be protective cybersecurity stewards stems from a  fundamental obligation to safeguard the American people. This is what  we aim to do with this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting it.
