 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2  minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in the 11:45 a.m.  vote series this morning.    Mr. President, we have an opportunity today to give  ourselves the tool to pass a tax reform bill that will absolutely mean  tax relief for middle-income and working-class families and will  promote the kind of economic growth that we have been waiting for, but  to do it, we are going to have to defeat this amendment and pass the  underlying budget.   What my friend from Oregon is suggesting is that we give a minority  in the Senate the opportunity to defeat tax reform by filibuster. That  is what would happen if we were to pass this amendment.   I have to disagree strongly with the notion that somehow this is not  a bipartisan exercise. There is nothing about reconciliation that in  any way discourages or prevents full Democratic participation. We are  going to have a markup in the Senate Finance Committee, and there will  be unlimited amendment opportunities. If we are able to report  something out, then there will be unlimited amendment opportunities on  the floor. There is nothing that we could do to stop it if we wanted to  because those are the rules of reconciliation. Every Democrat in this  body will have an unlimited opportunity to weigh in on this, to  influence this, and to amend this, and it will be a fully bipartisan  exercise.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record the GAO opinion letter dated October 19, 2017, related to  the Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending of March 22, 2013,  Federal Register citation 78 FR 17766.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     U.S. Government                                           Accountability Office,                                   Washington, DC, October 19, 2017.      Subject: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of           Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit           Insurance Corporation--Applicability of the Congressional           Review Act to Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending       Hon. Pat Toomey,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Senator Toomey: You asked whether the final       Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending (Interagency       Guidance or Guidance), issued jointly on March 22, 2013, by       the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the       Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board),       and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is a       rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). CRA       establishes a process for congressional review of agency       rules and establishes special expedited procedures under       which Congress may pass a joint resolution of disapproval       that, if enacted into law, overturns the rule. Congressional       review is assisted by CRA's requirement that all federal       agencies, including independent regulatory agencies, submit       each rule to both Houses of Congress and to the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) before it can take effect. For       the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the Interagency       Guidance is a general statement of policy and is a rule under       the CRA.                                  BACKGROUND                          Congressional Review Act         CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies,       including independent regulatory agencies, to submit a report       on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General before it can take effect. The report       must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise general       statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed       effective date. In addition, the agency must submit to the       Comptroller General a complete copy of the cost-benefit       analysis of the rule, if any, and information concerning the       agency's actions relevant to specific procedural rulemaking       requirements set forth in various statutes and executive       orders governing the regulatory process.        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), which states in relevant part that a       rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' CRA excludes three categories of       rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular applicability;       (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3)       rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do       not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-      agency parties. The Agencies did not send a report on the       Interagency Guidance to Congress or the Comptroller General       because, as they stated in their letters to our Office, in       their opinion the Guidance is not a rule under the CRA.                 Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending         On March 22, 2013, OCC, the Board, and FDIC (referred to       collectively as the Agencies) issued the Interagency       Guidance, which forms the basis of the Agencies' review of       the leveraged lending activities of supervised financial       institutions. Leveraged lending generally encompasses large       loans to corporate borrowers for the purposes of ``mergers       and acquisitions, business recapitalization and financing,       equity buyouts, and business . . . expansions.'' Leveraged       loans raise risk concerns because of the size of the loans       relative to the borrower's cash flow, and are generally used       to finance one-time business transactions rather than a       company's ordinary course of business activities. The       Guidance outlines the Agencies' minimum expectations on a       wide range of topics related to leveraged lending, including       underwriting standards, valuation standards, the risk rating       of leveraged loans, and problem credit management.        The Interagency Guidance is ``designed to assist financial       institutions in providing leveraged lending to creditworthy       borrowers in a safe-and-sound manner.'' It does so by       describing expectations for the sound risk management of       leveraged lending activities and lists a number of       considerations for financial institutions: (1) the ratio of a       borrower's debt to the company's earnings before interest,       taxes, amortization and depreciation; (2) the ability of the       borrower to amortize its secured debt, and (3) the level of       due diligence performed in evaluating the loan. The Guidance       explains the types of actions that concern the Agencies and       that might motivate them to initiate a supervisory action       that would require an independent finding that an unsafe or       unsound action has occurred.                                   ANALYSIS         As an initial matter, one argument raised by the Agencies       is that since the Guidance explicitly states that it is not a       rule or a rulemaking action, it should not be considered a       rule under CRA. However, although an agency's       characterization should be considered in deciding whether its       action is a rule under APA (and whether, for example, it is       subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements), ``an       agency's own label . . . is not dispositive.'' Similarly, an       agency's characterization is not determinative of whether it       is a rule under CRA.        The focus of the arguments made by the Agencies is that the       Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy and is       not subject to the CRA. They assert that the Guidance is a       statement that explains how they will exercise their broad       enforcement discretion. They maintain that it does not       establish legally binding standards, is not certain or final,       and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations       of third parties. As a result, they claim, the Interagency       Guidance is not a rule under CRA.        The Supreme Court has described ``general statements of       policy'' as ``statements issued by an agency to advise the       public prospectively of the manner in which the agency       proposes to exercise a discretionary power.'' In other words,       a statement of policy announces the agency's tentative       intentions for the future:        ``A general statement of policy . . . does not establish a       'binding norm.' It is not finally determinative of the issues       or rights to which it is addressed. The agency cannot apply       or rely upon a general statement of policy as law because a       general statement of policy only announces what the agency       seeks to establish as policy.''        The Interagency Guidance provides information on the manner       in which the Agencies  [[Page S6637]]       will exercise their enforcement authority regarding leveraged       lending activities, does not establish a ``binding norm,''       and does not determine the outcome of any Agency examination       of a financial institution. Rather, the Guidance expresses       the regulators' expectations regarding the sound risk       management of leveraged lending activities. We agree with the       Agencies that the Guidance is a general statement of policy.       However, the issue presented here is whether this general       statement of policy is a rule under CRA.        GAO has previously held that general statements of policy       are rules under CRA. For example, in B-287557, May 14, 2001,       we decided whether a ``record of decision'' (ROD) issued by       the Fish and Wildlife Service in connection with a federal       irrigation project was a rule under CRA. We found that the       ROD was a general statement of policy regarding water flow       and ecosystems issues in both the Trinity and Sacramento       Rivers. The ROD modified prior policy in an attempt, in part,       to restore fish habitat.        We cited to the APA definition of ``rule,'' which includes       ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or       particular applicability and future effect designed to       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or       describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' This definition includes three       key components: (1) an agency statement, (2) of future       effect, and (3) designed to implement, interpret, or       prescribe law or policy. We stated that this definition is       broad, and includes both rules requiring notice and comment       rulemaking and those that do not, such as general statements       of policy.        We noted that, since CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''       from APA, it too covers both those requiring notice and       comment and general statements of policy, which do not. We       decided that the ROD fell squarely within CRA as an agency       action that constituted a ``statement of general . . .       applicability and future effect designed to implement,       interpret or prescribe law or policy.'' We also noted that       Congress intended CRA to cover, not only formal rulemaking,       but also rules requiring notice and comment under 5 U.S.C.       553(c), rules that are not subject to notice and comment       requirements, including rules that must be published in the       Federal Register before taking effect (5 U S C. 552(a)(1) and       (2)), and other guidance documents. Since a general statement       of policy is specifically included among the types of agency       actions subject to the requirements of Sections 552(a)(1) (D)       and (a)(2)(B), it is clear that CRA covers general statements       of policy.        Additionally, in B-316048, April 17, 2008, we considered       whether a letter issued by the Centers for Medicare and       Medicaid Services (CMS) to state health officials concerning       the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was a       rule under CRA. We concluded that the letter was subject to       CRA because it was, in fact, a rule subject to notice and       comment rulemaking requirements. However, in that decision we       also discussed general statements of policy under CRA. CMS       had argued that the letter was a general statement of policy       ``announcing the course which the agency intends to follow''       in future adjudications, i.e., what the agency seeks to       establish as policy. We explained that the definition of       ``rule'' under both APA and CRA includes ``a statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or       policy.'' As a device that provides information on the manner       in which an agency will exercise its authority or what the       agency will seek to propose as policy, we noted that a       general statement of policy would appear to fit squarely       within this definition of a rule subject to CRA.        In deciding that a general statement of policy is a rule       for CRA purposes, our prior decisions cite to the legislative       history of CRA, which confirms that rules subject to CRA       requirements include general statements of policy. A       principal sponsor of the legislation that became CRA made       clear that general statements of policy are covered by CRA,       stating that ``[t]he committees intend [CRA] to be       interpreted broadly with regard to the type and scope of       rules that are subject to congressional review.'' The sponsor       added that documents covered by CRA include ``statements of       general policy, interpretations of general applicability, and       administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that       affect a member of the public.''        Additionally, in a floor statement during final       consideration of the bill that became CRA, another principal       sponsor of the legislation pointed out that rules subject to       CRA include agency general statements of policy.        ``Although agency interpretive rules, general statements of       policy, guideline documents, and agency policy and procedure       manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment       provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code,       these types of documents are covered under the congressional       review provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5.        ``Under section 801(a) [CRA], covered rules, with very few       exceptions, may not go into effect until the relevant agency       submits a copy of the rule and an accompanying report to both       Houses of Congress. Interpretive rules, general statements of       policy, and analogous agency policy guidelines are covered       without qualification because they meet the definition of a       'rule' borrowed from section 551 of title 5, and are not       excluded from the definition of a rule.''        We note that legal commentators also support the conclusion       that CRA's requirements are applicable to general statements       of policy. They have pointed out that federal agency actions       fitting CRA's definition of a rule include ``such items as .       . . general statements of policy,'' and that ``the       legislative history of the Act . . . makes clear that this       scope was understood and intended.''        Nonetheless, the Agencies assert that because the Guidance       does not establish legally binding standards, is not certain       or final, and does not substantially affect the rights or       obligations of third parties, it is not a rule under CRA.       They cite to our decisions in which we found that agency       actions that imposed binding requirements that were ``both       certain and final'' were rules for CRA purposes. However,       while our decisions recognize those characteristics as       indicative of certain types of rules subject to CRA       requirements, they do not suggest that the absence of those       characteristics requires a determination that an agency       action is not a rule under CRA. Moreover, when GAO has       examined the issue whether an agency's action substantially       affects the rights or obligations of third parties, it has       been in the context of analyzing whether the action falls       within the CRA exception for agency rules of practice or       procedure, not in deciding whether it meets the definition of       rule.        The Agencies also cite to language in certain court       decisions to suggest that policy statements are not rules       under APA. However, those decisions do not support such a       conclusion. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that       rules under the APA include ``'substantive [legislative]       rules' on the one hand'' as well as ``general statements of       policy'' and other non-legislative rules on the other.        We can readily conclude that the Guidance does not fall       within any of the three exceptions in CRA. We note here that       the Interagency Guidance is of general and not particular       applicability, does not relate to agency management or       personnel, and is not a rule of agency organization,       procedure, or practice.                                  CONCLUSION         The Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy       designed to assist financial institutions in providing       leveraged lending to creditworthy borrowers in a sound       manner. As such, it is a rule subject to the requirements of       CRA.            Sincerely yours,                                                   Susan A. Poling,      General Counsel.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
