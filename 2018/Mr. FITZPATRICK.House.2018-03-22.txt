 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  issue of food insecurity, affecting nearly 1.6 million people in my  home State of Pennsylvania. In our district, that is 1.6 million too  many.   I am proud to recognize the efforts of Mary's Cupboard in Levittown,  Pennsylvania, a food pantry which has served nearly 86,000 individuals  since its inception in 1976. Operating in conjunction with Catholic  Social Services, Mary's Cupboard offers both perishable and  nonperishable food items. Their standard practice is to provide a  family with 5 days' worth of food.   I would like to recognize founder Marion Slack and operations  coordinators Betty Rommet and Ann Hyjurick, who, along with the  assistance of partnering parishes St. Ignatius in Yardley, St. Andrew  in Newton, St. Cyril of Jerusalem in Jamison, and St. Michael the  Archangel in Levittown, bring hope and peace of mind to their neighbors  on a daily basis.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of us to follow their lead and work to  eradicate hunger in all of our communities.                            ____________________
