 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, as we come back into session after a 2- week State work period, I think we need to take stock of what we have  been able to accomplish in working together during the last few months.   Through the efforts of the administration and in working with  Congress, we have been able to greatly lessen the regulatory burden on  many American job creators, which is something sorely needed while our  economy has been bumping along at, roughly, 2 percent growth of our  gross domestic product since the Great Recession of 2008. We have  confirmed a ninth Supreme Court Justice, and we have seen strong,  credible action taken against people like the terrible Assad regime in  Syria.   It is important to remember, as folks continue to judge the current  administration and its foreign policy in particular, how we got here  and what this White House inherited after 8 years of the Obama  administration.   As President Obama left office, he left in his wake fires burning  around the world. There is no better example than the Middle East.  President Obama celebrated the Arab Spring as a testament to the power  of a democratic voice, but he did little to help our partners across  the Middle East and North Africa find stability and prosperity. Along  the way, he made the world a lot more dangerous for all of us by his  inaction or, in some cases, by his actions. Libya is one of the most  tragic examples.   Without his coming to Congress but instead going to the United  Nations for a resolution, under President Obama's watch, the country  fractured after he helped to launch a poorly conceived military  campaign that helped depose Muammar Qadhafi, with no plan at all as to  what to do afterward to stabilize the country. Apparently, despite all  of President Obama's criticisms of President Bush's 2003 invasion of  Iraq, he learned very little from it, and terrorists, including ISIS,  jumped at the opportunity to fill the vacuum in Libya.   Later, the American Consulate in Benghazi would be attacked,  resulting in the deaths of four Americans, including that of Ambassador  Christopher Stevens. That was the result of President Obama's failed  strategy in Libya.   To the east, as 2016 came to a close, Syria was embroiled in even  more disarray, more bloodshed, and more violence than when the civil  war initially broke out. President Obama promised the world--now  infamously--that should the Syrian Government use chemical weapons that  at that point a red line would have been crossed. We know how that  turned out and so do the citizens of Syria and so do, importantly,  other thugs, autocrats, and dictators around the world--red lines  crossed but not enforced.   President Obama's threats went unanswered. Russia became bolder in  its support of Assad as it became clearer that the United States would  not intervene. Now, in light of years of inaction by the previous  administration, we have a refugee crisis in the Middle East and  throughout Europe. Millions of people have been displaced both  internally and externally across Europe. We have a war criminal leading  the Syrian Government who has repeatedly used chemical weapons and  indiscriminately killed civilians, including children, in a region even  further from any measure of stability than when President Obama took  office.   Yet, instead of developing a strategy, instead of listening to his  own military and national security leadership, President Obama and his  team perversely opted to strengthen our adversary Iran. The ill- conceived JCPOA deal cemented the status of this state sponsor of  terrorism as a future nuclear power as it released billions of dollars  in sanctions relief to the regime and empowered our enemy to engage in  even more terrorist activities abroad and around the world. After 8  years of the Obama administration, the bottom line is, our foremost  enemy in the Middle East became stronger, not weaker.   On top of all of that, President Obama pushed aside our strongest  ally in the region--Israel--time and time again to appease nations that  were working against us. That is simply not how the United States  should operate in its leadership role around the world.   I could go on and on about the foreign policy failures of the last  administrations with respect to the Middle East, but it is not the only  region in worse shape. Under President Obama's watch, Russia invaded  Crimea and eastern Ukraine. It repeatedly threatened NATO member states  and ramped up its cyber espionage to influence and undermine public  confidence in free and fair elections both in the United States and in  Europe. Along the way, our allies in Europe were cast aside rather than  assured of our support--all with Russia's mounting aggression close by.  [[Page S2505]]    In the Pacific, China continued to advance its regional dominance by  making claims to islands disputed by our allies, going so far as to  convert sand bars and reefs into island military bases--some with  10,000-foot military-capable runways right there in the South China  Sea.   Finally, North Korea continues to develop and test its nuclear and  ballistic missile capabilities with the threat of soon being able to  use both to reach the continental United States. North Korea carried  out four nuclear tests during the Obama administration. That is simply  unacceptable.   The truth is, after two terms of inaction, no coherent strategy, and  leading from behind, our allies and partners around the world  questioned the commitment and power of the United States and our  ability to defend our national interests around the globe.   I, personally, am thankful for what we have seen President Trump  accomplish so far, even in a short period of time. His tough but honest  discussions about America's role in the world are appreciated not only  by those of us here at home but by our allies and friends around the  world who have been hungry for American leadership.   When Assad crossed a line the entire international community deemed  abhorrent, President Trump, unlike President Obama, took action.  Unfortunately, President Trump has inherited foreign policy  predicaments that were created by both the action and inaction of his  predecessor around the world. My hope is, President Trump will continue  to work with the great team he has assembled to make sure U.S.  interests are put first and that America continues to exert its  leadership role around the world.   The truth is, a strong America and an America that leads is a  stabilizing and peacekeeping influence around the world. Just the  opposite is also true. As America retreats, there is no other country  that can fill that leadership vacuum. It is inherently destabilizing,  and it is an invitation for bad actors around the world to take  advantage of that power vacuum.   I look forward to working with the administration, as well as all of  our colleagues in the Congress, to help keep Americans safe by making  clear that we will back up and support our allies and partners abroad  and send a powerful message to those who threaten our interests.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 138         Whereas, throughout United States history, United States       servicemen and servicewomen held as prisoners of war have       endured unimaginable cruelty and unspeakable treatment at the       hands of their captors in--        (1) British prison ships floating in the harbor of New York       City;        (2) tiger cages in North Vietnam;        (3) coal mines in Omuta, Japan; and        (4) mine shafts in Berga, Germany;        Whereas many of these servicemen and servicewomen, while in       service to the United States, lost their lives as prisoners       of war under cruel and inhumane conditions;        Whereas United States service members held as prisoners of       war have--        (1) endured situations few people of the United States can       imagine; and        (2) found courage in a darkness that other people of the       United States will hopefully never experience;        Whereas National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day was       established to memorialize the surrender by General Edward P.       King of 80,000 United States and Filipino troops on the       Bataan Peninsula on April 9, 1942, which led to--        (1) the infamous Bataan Death March; and        (2) nearly 4 years of brutal imprisonment and slave labor       for the survivors;        Whereas, by May 10, 1942, over 11,500 soldiers from the       United States and the Philippines surrendered on Corregidor,       a fortress island in Manila Bay, and at various bases on       islands in the southern Philippines, which resulted in the       largest surrender of United States soldiers in United States       military history;        Whereas, during World War II, over 26,000 prisoners of war       from the United States were held by Imperial Japan, of which       an estimated 40 percent died, and nearly \1/3\ of those       deaths occurred on ``hell ships'' that carried the prisoners       of war to Japan to become slave labor in Japanese companies;        Whereas the productive peace between the United States and       Japan has produced a model of reconciliation between former       combatants;        Whereas, in 2009, the Government of Japan offered an       apology to the United States prisoners of war for the damage       and suffering of the prisoners of war in Imperial Japan;        Whereas, in 2010, the Government of Japan established a       program for former prisoners of war and their families to       visit Japan and the former prisoner of war camps; and        Whereas the former prisoners of war who have participated       in the program described in the ninth whereas clause have       encouraged the Government of Japan to partner with Japanese       companies to continue the program as--        (1) an international model of reconciliation; and        (2) a permanent fund to support projects for remembrance,       documentation, education, and exchange: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) honors National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day       on April 9, 2017;        (2) commemorates the 75th anniversary of the fall of Bataan       on April 9, 1942; and        (3) applauds the efforts of the Government of Japan toward       a historic apology for the maltreatment of United States       prisoners of war by Imperial Japan.                            ____________________
