 Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have claimed that they  responsibly passed a debt extension proposal. They did not. They passed  a default on America act, which they wrongly called the Limit, Save,  and GROW Act. It was, however, a fraud on America act.   Today, the Republicans canceled the scheduled markup on the bills  pretending to carry out their pretended policies.   Today, Republicans demonstrated what they have displayed so very  often that they are unable to govern and simply use political  demagoguery to propose policies that are harmful, unreasonable, and  unpassable by their own party. The country needs a responsible and  honest opposition party. It does not have one.   The inability of Republicans to move forward on their appropriation  bills proves that point. I urge our Republican colleagues to stop  pandering, pass the debt extension. Be responsible. Give confidence to  the American economy.                            ____________________
