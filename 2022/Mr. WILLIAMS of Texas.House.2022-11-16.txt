 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  United Way of Tarrant County's 100th anniversary.   United Way has supported the community in many ways and has enriched  the lives of the people in the area. They have helped residents,  volunteers, donors, businesses, governments, nonprofits, and community  stakeholders and brought them together to solve some of the toughest  issues affecting Tarrant County.   I join in proclaiming November 17, 2022, as Get United Day, and I am  proud of their work to encourage unity among all residents and  commitment to building a stronger community.   I congratulate the United Way of Tarrant County for this significant  milestone. I am confident they will continue their exceptional service  to the community for the next 100 years.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
