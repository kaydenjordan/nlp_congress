 Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Johnson, Mr.  Cicilline, and Chairman Nadler for their leadership on this issue.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Forced Arbitration Injustice  Repeal Act, or the FAIR Act.   Companies are increasingly using forced arbitration clauses to shield  themselves from accountability for many forms of wrongdoing, including  civil rights violations, labor abuses, and unfair consumer practices.  For example, 60 million workers are now subject to forced arbitration  clauses that deny them their day in court.   Forced arbitration is a rigged system. That is because the  arbitrators are essentially hired by the companies and consumers never  have a chance. Workers and consumers should not have to sign away their  rights as a condition to their employment or as a condition of a  contract, and they should not have to give up their day in court.   Often, arbitration is a desirable alternative to litigation. Under  the FAIR Act, arbitration would now be a voluntary option, not the only  option.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  0945
