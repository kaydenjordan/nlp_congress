 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the amendment  offered by my friend Mr. Cuellar and our colleagues from Texas.   This amendment amends the Slot and Perimeter rules at Washington  National Airport.   It provides a special carve out for airports in two cities.   It upends the current regime which was carefully crafted by Congress  to maintain operational stability between the three DC-area airports-- National, Dulles, and BWI.   As a longtime representative of the area around Dulles and as someone  who fought for an extension of Metro to Dulles, I have to admit I am  offended by this effort which would do harm to commercial domestic  passenger volume at Dulles--Northern Virginia's premier international  airport.   Since Congress amended the Slot rule in 2000, passenger traffic at  National has increased by 50 percent and traffic at Dulles has declined  by 9 percent.   I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment and refrain from  inflicting harm on the area economies of their colleagues' districts.
