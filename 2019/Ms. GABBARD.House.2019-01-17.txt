 Madam Speaker, burn pits are the Agent Orange of post-9/ 11 veterans. Over 165,000 veterans have registered their names into the  burn pit registry, something that is voluntary, but there are millions  more of our troops who have been exposed to these toxic burn pits  during their deployments.   They deserve recognition. They deserve care. And they deserve the  services they have earned.   So far, our government has failed to fulfill its responsibility to  them and to recognize the toxins that they have been exposed to, just  like what happened to our Vietnam veterans decades ago, when our  government ignored their exposure and the ensuing illnesses that came  from Agent Orange.   When I was deployed to Iraq, the cloud of toxic smoke and fumes from  the massive burn pit in our camp was a daily reality. I know the damage  they cause. I have seen the devastating toll they have taken on my  brothers and sisters in arms who survived combat, came home, but are  now suffering from rare cancers, lung diseases, neurological disorders,  and more.   Today, my colleague and fellow veteran, Brian Mast, and I are  reintroducing our burn pit legislation to address this travesty, joined  by Senators Klobuchar and Sullivan, to make sure they get the treatment  services that they earned.                            ____________________
