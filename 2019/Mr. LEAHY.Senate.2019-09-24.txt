 Madam President, I agree with my distinguished colleagues  from Washington State and New Mexico for what they have said.   Sometimes casting a vote on the Senate floor is just a matter of  course. It is something we do routinely, often without considering the  impact of that vote on the Senate as an institution, let alone our  constitutional Republic as we know it, but this week's vote on  President Trump's national emergency declaration is different. It is a  pivotal moment in this body's history. It is a stress test of the very  notion of separation of powers. The Constitution speaks of Congress as  being a coequal branch of government. Well, this is going to be viewed  as a moment when Congress either asserted itself as a coequal branch of  government or surrendered as a subordinate to the will of a President  who now claims his powers are absolute.   This is a President who has said out loud that the Constitution gives  him the right to do ``whatever I want as  [[Page S5657]]  President.'' It makes one wonder if the President has ever actually  read the Constitution of the United States. This President is  attempting to ignore the explicit will of Congress by simply declaring  a national emergency to fund his ``big, beautiful'' wall. That is  after, time and time and time again, he gave us his word that Mexico  would pay for the wall.   For 3 years, he failed to convince Congress that the wall was a good  idea. Even when his own party controlled both the House of  Representatives and the U.S. Senate, his tweets and tantrums could not  convince enough Members that his cynical campaign promise was worthy of  tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. He could not convince  anybody, Republican or Democrat, that he was telling the truth when he  said Mexico would pay for it.   So when Congress did not comply, he directed his yes-people to tell  them he could fund his pet project, nonetheless, by declaring a  national emergency out of thin air and stealing the money from our  troops and their families.   He even admitted his national emergency declaration was a matter of  political expediency rather than justified by facts. I remember him  standing in the Rose Garden. He said he did not ``need'' to invoke a  national emergency; he could ``build the wall over a longer period of  time,'' but he just wanted to do it ``faster.'' Once again, the whims  and tweets of the President were used to trample our Constitution.   President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build his  wall should offend all 100 Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike-- in this body. First and foremost, he is using it to steal $3.6 billion  from critical military construction projects that would benefit our men  and women in uniform and their families. This impacts 127 military  construction projects, including a child development center, an  elementary school, a fire and rescue station--all falling victim to his  fixation on the wall. He is telling the families of our military who  are living in substandard housing--some of it with mold and other  damaging health conditions--that, no, you are not going to get that  money you need to fix that up. I am going to put it toward my wall.    We already ask our military families to sacrifice so much to keep our  country safe. Now they have to sacrifice, yet again, and to what end?  To keep this President's ego safe.   Furthermore, I would note that his national emergency declaration is  a transparent end-run around Congress's constitutional power of the  purse. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution, which I doubt the  President has ever bothered to read, states that Congress--and Congress  alone--decides how to spend Americans' hard-earned tax dollars. That  has been the case from the time of the founding of this country until  today. It is one of the most critical checks and balances in our  constitutional system. In our democracy, Presidents must respect--and  normally do--the appropriations decisions of Congress but, for the  first time, not this President.   I was here when Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of  1976. When we passed it then, we assumed that any President would have  enough respect for the office to invoke the extraordinary powers  granted under it judiciously and only in times when there was, in fact,  an emergency to be addressed.   But not this President. Where the world sees women and children  seeking refuge at our southern border, he sees criminals and terrorists  invading our country. Where the world sees declining border crossings-- crossings have dropped steeply since June--he sees an escalating border  crisis that only his wall can fix. Facts may not matter to a President  willing to invent a hurricane path with a sharpie marker, but they  should matter to us. We must not allow this President to invoke such  sweeping powers--powers we granted to him for real emergencies--simply  to address some emergency he has concocted in his head.   So this week I hope all Senators, no matter what their political  background is, will think carefully about their vote on the President's  national emergency declaration. I hope each of us thinks long and hard  about what it would mean for our role as a coequal branch, for the  separation of powers, for the Constitution, which has protected our  country all these years, and what would it mean if we fail to reject  this naked power grab by President Trump.   In March, 12 of my Republican friends joined Democrats in rejecting  the President's emergency declaration, forcing him to override our vote  with a veto. I hope every one of us tonight will go home and read the  Constitution and realize what we must do. I hope more Republicans will  join Democrats this time in voting aye on the joint resolution of  disapproval. We must send this President a veto-proof message that  Congress will rise above party to protect what is most precious in our  American democracy; the Senate will stand for the Constitution above  all else; that the Senate will be the conscience of the Nation, as we  should be.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, killings of environmental defenders are  shockingly common in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The assassination  of Berta Caceres in Honduras 3 years ago, orchestrated by top officials  of a hydroelectric company and carried out by retired and Active-Duty  soldiers who had received training from the United States, was  emblematic of the widespread use of harassment, threats, and murder to  silence those who courageously call for changes in policies and  practices to protect the environment.   According to a report released today by Global Witness, the  Philippines has the highest number of killings in Asia of people who  oppose illegal logging, destructive mining, and corrupt agribusiness,  with at least 30 cases documented in 2018. The total number is likely  higher, as some investigations are ongoing. Many of the victims simply  wanted a say in how their land and the country's natural resources are  used. The perpetrators are almost never arrested or prosecuted.   On July 25, 2016, the Philippines' newly elected President Rodrigo  Duterte delivered his first state of the nation address. He promised to  safeguard the country's rural and indigenous communities, tackle  corruption, and protect the environment. The results since then paint a  very different and distressing picture. If President Duterte meant what  he said, he has failed miserably. According to Global Witness, in the 3  years before Duterte took office at least 65 land and environmental  defenders were murdered. That was appalling enough. But in the 3 years  since he came to power, that number rose to 113. At least 31 of those  murders were reportedly committed by the Philippine Armed Forces, whose  soldiers and officers act with near total impunity.   The Philippines is a major recipient of U.S. military aid, and we are  perceived by the families of the victims to be enablers of these  crimes. In addition to increasing support for local environmental  defenders, the Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency  for International Development should urge the Duterte government to  ensure that the right to free, prior, and informed consent of those  impacted by policies and practices that threaten their land and natural  resources is respected. This is necessary not only to prevent the  destruction of forests and farms, the pollution of watersheds, and the  extinction of species, but to avoid confrontations and violence that  result when extractive industries, supported by the Armed Forces and  police, run roughshod over local communities.   The Secretaries of State and Defense should also ensure that those in  the Philippine Armed Forces who receive our aid respect the rights of  civilians and are accountable to the rule of law. When abuses occur  they should be thoroughly investigated and the individuals responsible  brought to justice. The Leahy Laws require that, and it is the  responsibility of U.S. officials to ensure that they are enforced.                            ____________________
