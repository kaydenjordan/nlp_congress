 Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day for our water  resources and for bipartisan and bicameral work in the Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a joint explanatory statement to  accompany the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 and a letter to  Chairman Smith.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, December 8, 2022.      Hon. Adam Smith,      Chair, House Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to further explain the       intentions of Section 11252, Strategy for Retention of       Cuttermen, of the James M. Inhofe National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.        In 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in       Bostock v. Clayton County (590 U.S._(2020)) that the term       ``sex'' included sexual orientation and gender identity for       purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.       Specifically, the Court determined that ``homosexuality and       transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex. Not       because homosexuality or transgender status are related to       sex in some vague sense or because discrimination on these       bases has some disparate impact on one sex or another, but       because to discriminate on these grounds requires an employer       to intentionally treat individual employees differently       because of their sex.''        This rationale is applicable to a range of laws that       prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.       Indeed, federal courts both prior and subsequent to the       Court's decision in Bostock have determined that our nation's       federal laws that prohibit sex or gender discrimination also       prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity       including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,       Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the Fair Housing       Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Supreme Court       in numerous decisions, such as United States v. Virginia (518       U.S. 515 (1996)), has used the terms sex and gender       interchangeably.        Our nation's nondiscrimination laws must be construed       broadly to achieve Congress' aim of eradicating       discrimination. In keeping with these cases and the current       understanding of gender, I want to explicitly state on the       record that the reference to discrimination based on gender       in Section 11252(c) of the James M. Inhofe National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 also includes       discrimination on the basis of gender identity. I understand       that the Coast Guard shares this view and understanding of       Section 11252(c).        It is critical that the Coast Guard attract and retain a       qualified workforce serving on Coast Guard cutters and that       such a workforce includes underrepresented minorities and       servicemembers from rural areas. I thank you for including       this important section in the NDAA and look forward to       reading the Commandant's strategy for retention of cuttermen.            Sincerely,                                                     Peter DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____    Joint Explanatory Statement to Accompany Title LXXXI of Division H of   Senate Amendment to H.R. 7776, With An Amendment, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2022--James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization                          Act for Fiscal Year 2023         H.R. 7776, the Water Resources Development Act of 2022       (WRDA 2022) as passed by the House of Representatives and       amended by the Senate is the legislative vehicle for the       National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2023. This       joint explanatory statement, submitted on behalf of Chair       Peter DeFazio and Ranking Member Sam Graves of the House       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and Chair Tom       Carper and Ranking Member Shelly Moore Capito of the Senate       Committee on Environment and Public Works, reflects the view       of the bicameral Chairs and Ranking Members responsible for       managing negotiations to develop a final version of WRDA       2022, hereafter in this statement referred to as ``the       managers.'' This statement of the managers describes the       intent of the final legislation and the manner in which       provisions in disagreement between the House of       Representatives and the Senate have been resolved.                                  Background         WRDA 2022 primarily addresses the Civil Works program of       the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The bill supports       the nation's global economic competitiveness and       environmental resilience by authorizing the Corps to       undertake projects, programs, and initiatives in their Civil       Works program relating to navigation, ecosystem restoration,       flood and coastal storm risk management, hydropower,       recreation, emergency management, and water supply.        A water resources development act (WRDA) is the authorizing       legislation for the programs and projects of the Corps' Civil       Works program. Ideally enacted every two years, such an act       is the main vehicle for authorizing water resources       development projects to be studied, planned, and developed by       the Corps. WRDAs typically authorize new water resources       development projects pursuant to completed feasibility study       reports from the Chief of Engineers, modifications to       existing projects pursuant to reports from the Director of       Civil Works, other modifications to existing projects, study       authorizations for new projects, the authorization of       miscellaneous projects consistent with the Corps' programs       that also demonstrate a Federal interest, and other       programmatic changes to the Corps' authorities. Projects and       programs contained in WRDAs fall within one or more of the       Corps' Civil Works' missions and authorities, which include       navigation, ecosystem restoration, flood and coastal storm       risk management, hydropower, recreation, regulatory,       emergency management, and water supply.                          General Overview WRDA 2022       Title LXXXI of Division H is broken down into four subtitles:         Subtitle A addresses general policy changes to the Civil       Works program authorities. These changes include, among       others:  [[Page H8845]]       increased support for coastal-related restoration and       infrastructure; enhanced authority for the Corps to modernize       projects during the performance of maintenance and emergency       repair activities; greater flexibility for non-Federal       sponsors of Corps projects; changes to ensure the efficient       and effective delivery of water resources development       projects, programs, and other assistance, including       assistance to Tribal communities, economically disadvantaged       communities, and states with water supply concerns; improved       accessibility to Corps expertise and increased affordability       of Corps projects for economically disadvantaged, rural, and       Tribal communities; and increased support for research and       development, technical assistance, and planning assistance to       states.        Subtitle B authorizes critical new feasibility studies to       be conducted by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil       Works (Secretary), who jointly implements the projects and       programs of the Corps with the Chief of Engineers and directs       certain existing studies to be expedited to completion. The       Secretary is also authorized or directed to complete       assessments or reports pertaining to, among other things,       dredge capacity, reservoir sedimentation, socially and       economically disadvantaged small business concerns, and the       economic valuation of preservation of open space,       recreational areas, and habitat associated with project       lands.        Subtitle C identifies antiquated or outdated projects, and       parts of projects, that are no longer needed for a Federal       purpose for deauthorization. This subtitle also modifies       existing projects and related provisions, including       environmental infrastructure authorities, and calls upon the       Secretary to expedite the completion of specified projects       and studies.        Subtitle D authorizes 25 new projects and six project       modifications based on reports submitted to Congress by the       Secretary or the Chief of Engineers. These projects address       various mission areas of the Corps, including ecosystem       restoration, flood and coastal storm risk management,       navigation, and water storage for water supply.                 Discussion on Specific WRDA 2022 Provisions         2. The transformative nature of the last four WRDA bills on       the Corps' Civil Works program has provided the Corps and       non-Federal interests (sponsors) with a tremendous number of       new opportunities for advancing projects more quickly. The       managers expect the Corps to issue implementation guidance on       the new provisions contained within WRDA 2022 in an       expeditious and transparent manner, and where appropriate, to       solicit the views of, and consult with, a wide array of       stakeholders in the formulation of implementation guidance.       In that light, the managers direct the Corps to provide       periodic, bipartisan briefings to the staffs of the House       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate       Committee on Environment and Public Works on the status of       implementation of WRDA 2022, and any other unimplemented WRDA       provision enacted by Congress since 2014, with the first       briefing to be hosted no later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of WRDA 2022.        Generally, WRDA 2022 authorizes or directs the preparation       of several assessments. The managers intend for the Secretary       to conduct these assessments at Federal expense.       Additionally, it is the managers' expectation that studies       included in WRDA 2022 to modify authorized projects prior       to or during construction, including studies to extend       Federal participation in periodic nourishment, will       continue to be initiated without a new start designation,       in accordance with well-established budget policy.        WRDA 2022 includes several provisions intended to increase       support for economically disadvantaged communities in both       rural and urban areas. The managers included this direction       to ensure that the Secretary gives equal consideration to       economically disadvantaged communities in rural areas and in       urban areas when implementing the applicable authorities. The       managers do not intend for this direction to affect the       Corps' ongoing rulemaking to define the term ``economically       disadvantaged community.''        In addition, in each of the last few WRDAs, Congress has       directed the Corps to make greater use of natural and nature-      based features and other measures to enhance resilient       solutions through all the Corps' missions and authorities.       However, despite this clear direction, which is enhanced       through additional policy provisions authorized in WRDA 2022,       the managers are concerned that these enacted provisions are       not being fully implemented by the Corps and directs the       Secretary to ensure that the availability and suitability of       these approaches are explored in each of the Corps' Districts       and Divisions.        WRDA 2022 includes several significant provisions intended       to enhance the Corps' authority to formulate, construct,       maintain, and repair projects in a manner that holistically       addresses the impacts of sea level rise and increasingly       frequent and severe extreme weather events. Section 8102 of       WRDA 2022 provides the Corps with increased flexibility to       modify federally authorized hurricane and storm damage       reduction projects during the performance of emergency repair       and restoration activities to ensure that they perform       adequately in response to changing conditions. In relation to       this provision, the managers note that they received a       request to authorize the construction of enhancements,       including additional gulf side breakwaters, to improve the       performance of the Grand Isle and Vicinity, Louisiana Beach       Erosion and Hurricane Protection Project, Jefferson Parish,       Louisiana. Accordingly, the managers direct the Secretary to       consider the changes to section 5(a)(1) of the Act of August       18, 1941 (commonly known as the Flood Control Act of 1941)       made by this section when repairing or restoring this project       to account for increased storm damage.        Section 8103 of WRDA 2022 includes amendments to section       212 of WRDA 1999 that streamline the authority and       incorporate shoreline protection and restoration into its       scope. The managers intend for the Secretary to use this       authority to give priority consideration to the protection       and restoration of shorelines, riverbanks, and streambanks       from erosion and other damaging impacts of extreme weather       events. While the managers intend for the Secretary to       address these hazards using nonstructural measures, natural       features, and nature-based features to the maximum extent       practicable, the formulation of projects that rely primarily       on structural solutions is not precluded. Such solutions,       however, must meet traditional economic or life safety       justification standards if they do not otherwise satisfy the       alternative standard in section 212(d) of WRDA 1999. Finally,       while section 212, as amended, provides general authority for       the Secretary to initiate studies, the managers do not intend       for individually authorized studies, or studies carried out       under programmatic authorities such as section 118(b) of WRDA       2020, to be excluded from implementation under the terms of       section 212 if such studies otherwise fall within the scope       of the section.        Section 8106(a) of WRDA 2022 requires the Corps, when       requested by a non-Federal sponsor for a study for flood or       hurricane and storm damage reduction, to expand the scope of       the study to include the formulation of measures to address       damages attributable to all drivers of flood risk in the       study area. When section 8106(a) is applied to a study for       flood damage reduction, the federal interest in the       formulation of measures to address flood risk in the study       area will no longer be limited by the Corps' policy on       minimum flows. When section 8106(a) is applied to a study for       hurricane and coastal storm damage reduction, the Federal       interest in the formulation of measures will extend to       drivers of flood risk that do not coincide with coastal storm       events, including flooding and erosion associated with sea       level rise and so-called ``sunny day tides.'' Further, the       managers expect the Secretary to continue to account for the       effects of sea level rise, including an increase in the       extent, magnitude, and frequency of tidal flooding, in the       formulation of both flood and coastal storm risk management       and ecosystem restoration projects by fully implementing       existing authorities such as section 113 of WRDA 2020.        Additionally, section 8106(b) of WRDA 2022 expands the       Secretary's authority to formulate alternatives for any water       resources development project, at the request of the non-      Federal sponsor for such project, in a manner that increases       a community's resilience to drought conditions. This       provision will allow the Secretary to include individual       measures for water supply and water conservation in a       recommendation for a water resources development project as       well as to design the water resources development project       itself in a manner that maximizes the project's incidental       benefits for those purposes.        WRDA 2022 includes several provisions to enhance support       for Tribal communities. Section 8111 of WRDA 2022 amends the       Tribal Partnership Program established by section 203 of WRDA       2000. The amendments clarify that coastal storm risk       management and erosion control projects fall within the       program's scope. Additionally, section 8111 provides an       alternative standard for justifying flood and coastal storm       risk management projects, including erosion control and       streambank stabilization projects, when such projects do not       otherwise satisfy traditional standards for justification on       the basis of economics or life safety.        Section 8113 of WRDA 2022 clarifies the Secretary's       authority to develop a comprehensive plan to replace Indian       villages, housing sites, and related structures impacted by       construction of The Dalles Dam, Bonneville Dam, McNary Dam,       and John Day Dam in Washington and Oregon. The managers       intend for the Secretary to work with the affected Tribes to       develop the plan. With the clarifications made in this Act,       section 204 of the Flood Control Act of 1950 should no longer       be interpreted as restricting the Corps' authority to provide       housing assistance at multiple village sites to mitigate       impacts from construction of The Dalles Dam or from the       construction of any of the other three dams.        Further, section 8114 of WRDA 2022 amends section 1156 of       WRDA 1986 to clarify that the cost share waiver for Tribes       and territories is to be applied to reduce only the non-      Federal share of study and project costs. In response to this       amendment, the managers intend for the Secretary to correct       the implementation guidance for section 1119 of WRDA 2016,       which mistakenly provides for the waiver amount to be applied       to shared study costs instead of the non-Federal share of       study costs.        Section 8130 of WRDA 2022 directs the Secretary to develop       a strategic plan that identifies opportunities and challenges       relating to furthering the policy of the United States to       maximize the beneficial use of sediment  [[Page H8846]]       obtained from the construction and operation of the Corps'       water resources development projects. In carrying out this       section, the managers are aware of ongoing scientific       research into the use of nutrient-rich dredged materials as a       potential source of fertilizer for plant growth. The managers       encourage the Corps, through its Engineer Research and       Development Center (ERDC), to undertake an assessment on       the beneficial use of sediment for such purposes,       including an assessment of whether such use is cost-      effective, sustainable, and safe for human health and the       environment.        Section 8146 of WRDA 2022 authorizes the Secretary to carry       out capital improvements for the Washington Aqueduct. The       managers intend that the definition of customers found in       this section means the existing legal entities that purchase       potable water from the Washington Aqueduct, namely the       Fairfax County Water Authority, the District of Columbia       Water and Sewer Authority, and Arlington County, Virginia.        Section 8152 of WRDA 2022 authorizes the Secretary to       provide assistance to pump stations when the failure of such       pump stations would demonstrably impact the function of the       federally authorized flood or coastal storm risk management       project, which includes the impairment to water drainage from       areas interior to a federally authorized flood or coastal       storm risk management project. Congress directs the Secretary       to consider this authority to provide such assistance to the       Pointe Celeste Pump Station in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.        Section 8154 of WRDA 2022 authorizes the Secretary to carry       out a pilot program to evaluate the extent to which the       provision of temporary relocation assistance enhances the       completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, acceptability, and       equitable implementation of nonstructural flood and coastal       storm risk management projects involving the elevation or       modification of residential structures. The managers intend       for the Secretary to offer the non-Federal interest for each       project covered by the section an equal opportunity to       participate in the program.        Section 8155 of WRDA 2022 directs the Secretary to continue       construction projects that exceed or are expected to exceed       maximum project cost limits during the period beginning on       the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31,       2024. Though the Corps is still required to submit all       relevant documentation to the House and Senate as required       under section 902 of WRDA 1986, section 8155 ensures that       supply change disruptions, inflation, and other factors       contributing to rapid and unavoidable cost increases do not       jeopardize the Corps' ability to execute the increased       amounts of funding provided to the agency during this       Congress to reinforce the nation's water infrastructure.       Finally, in light of the number of Corps projects potentially       requiring statutory cost increases that have only recently       come to the attention of Congress, section 8155(b)       establishes a new, permanent requirement that the Corps       notify the House Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and       Public Works of any water resources development project that       exceeds or is expected to exceed its maximum cost under       section 902 of WRDA 1986.        Section 8158 of WRDA 2022 directs the Secretary to       establish a Western Water Cooperative Committee to help       mitigate the potential for conflict between the operation of       Corps projects and state water rights. A bipartisan coalition       of 19 Western Senators wrote to the Office of Management and       Budget on September 17, 2019, in opposition to the proposed       rulemaking entitled ``Use of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers       Reservoir Projects for Domestic, Municipal & Industrial Water       Supply'' (81 Fed. Reg. 91556 (December 16, 2016)), describing       the rule as counter to existing law and court precedent. On       January 21, 2020, the proposed rulemaking was withdrawn. The       Corps should consult with the participating Western States to       ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that operation of       flood control projects in such States is consistent with the       principles of the first section of the Act of December 22,       1944, and section 301 of the Water Supply Act of 1958.       Furthermore, the Western Water Cooperative Committee shall       make recommendations that only apply to the defined list of       Western States and ensure that any recommended changes or       modifications to policy or regulations for Corps projects       would not adversely affect water resources within other       states.        Section 8160 of WRDA 2022 modernizes the Corps' authority       to carry out research and development activities. Included in       this section is a temporary authority for the Corps to       utilize transactions other than contracts, cooperative       agreements, and grants for purposes of prototype projects.       The managers intend for the Corps to expedite implementation       of this authority by relying on, to the maximum extent       practicable, existing U.S. Department of Defense guidance on       other transaction authority.        WRDA 2022 includes several provisions to support and       enhance the delivery of public recreation benefits at Corps       projects. The Corps operates more recreation areas than any       other Federal or State agency, apart from the U.S. Department       of the Interior. Nationally, visitors to nearly 600       Corpsmanaged dams and lakes spend an estimated $12 billion       per year and support 500,000 jobs. Lakes managed by the Corps       are economic drivers that support local communities. The       managers remain concerned with the costs of ongoing operation       and maintenance of these public recreation sites, which       provide an enormous benefit to the country. Specifically,       section 8161 of WRDA 2022 expresses the sense of Congress       that the Secretary spend at least 80 percent of the revenue       generated by each site on activities for the operation,       maintenance, and upkeep of such site to encourage their       continued use and economic benefit.        Section 8212 of WRDA 2022 directs the Corps to provide the       County of San Luis Obispo, California, with right of first       refusal for any potential conveyance of the project for       Salinas Dam, California. The managers are aware that the       County and the Corps have engaged in negotiations for several       years regarding the disposition of the Salinas Dam project       and associated infrastructure and reservoir. The managers       direct the Corps to engage in a collaborative process with       the County with the goal of transferring the facility to the       County as expeditiously as possible under conditions that are       acceptable to all parties. Further, the managers direct the       Corps to not take any action that would preclude the Corps       from serving as the Federal agency solely responsible for       disposal of the facility unless the County agrees with an       alternative approach and the managers are satisfied that all       parties are best served by the alternative approach. In       addition, the managers direct the Corps to not take any       action that would in any way assign responsibility for the       facility to any military installation or other Federal agency       until collaborative negotiations are complete, and all       parties are in agreement with a disposal plan.        Section 8303 of WRDA 2022 includes additional locations to       an existing pilot program to utilize forecast informed       reservoir operations (FIRO) at Corps owned dams and       reservoirs. Additionally, the section authorizes a new pilot       program in the North Atlantic Division. The managers urge the       Secretary to ensure that sufficient budgetary resources are       allocated to FIRO projects to more fully utilize this process       in appropriate situations and to provide for the update of       existing water operations control manuals to incorporate FIRO       at reservoirs identified under the two pilot programs.        The final version of Section 8327 of WRDA 2022       substantially incorporates the language contained in the       original section 309 of the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776.       Although an authorization of appropriations has been added to       subsection (c) of section 8327 for future major maintenance,       the managers do not intend for this paragraph to impose a       requirement for additional funds to be appropriated to       implement this subsection for the currently planned major       maintenance if sufficient amounts are available in the       existing allocation for major maintenance of the Indian       River Inlet navigation project.        Section 8346 of WRDA 2022 authorizes and directs the Corps       to carry out water level management activities as part of the       operation and maintenance of the navigation channel projects       on the Upper Mississippi River and on the Illinois River       (also called the Illinois Waterway) to help redress       sedimentation and to improve the quality and quantity of       habitat available for fish and wildlife. Because studies have       shown that water level management activities carried out by       the Corps produce important ecosystem benefits, the managers       intend that such activities be routinely carried out and       conducted as part of the operations and maintenance of the       navigation channels as quickly as possible, and prior to the       routine update of water control manuals for the covered       projects.        Section 8363 of WRDA 2022 states that the non-Federal       interest for the project for hurricane and storm damage risk       reduction, Colleton County, South Carolina, may be eligible       to receive credit for construction and design work carried       out by the non-Federal interest before a partnership       agreement is executed for the specified project. The managers       have agreed to this language based on the understanding from       the Corps that all applicable laws and regulations, including       the Davis-Bacon Act, would need to have been complied with       for the work of the non-Federal interest to be creditable.        WRDA 2022 authorizes significant new Federal investments in       environmental infrastructure for communities across the       nation. The managers intend for the Secretary to interpret       all environmental infrastructure authorities to include, at a       minimum, assistance for water supply storage, distribution,       and treatment; wastewater collection and treatment; drainage;       stormwater management; surface water resource protection and       development; and water quality enhancement. Additional       purposes may be expressly authorized for individual programs.       With respect to implementation of specific programs, the       managers intend for the additional appropriations authorized       under section 8376(b)(8) for the environmental infrastructure       authority authorized under section 594 of WRDA 1999 to be       administered in a manner consistent with the previous funding       authorized under section 594. Further, the managers intend       for the Water Replenishment District of Southern California       to be eligible for assistance under Section 219(f)(93) of       WRDA 1992, as amended by section 8375(b)(2)(C) of the WRDA       2022.                             Other Policy Matters         Both the House and Senate committee reports on the       chambers' respective WRDA 2022 bills include direction on       implementation of previously enacted authorities. To the       extent consistent with the Act and this statement, the       managers intend for the Secretary  [[Page H8847]]       to follow the direction on previously enacted authorities       provided in those reports.        In addition to the direction in the House and Senate       committee reports on previously enacted authorities, the       managers encourage the Corps to continue to explicate       comprehensive documentation of benefits in project planning.       As the Secretary implements the Principles, Requirements, and       Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources       Implementation Studies, as directed by section 110 of WRDA       2020, the managers expect these agency-specific procedures to       foster a comprehensive, consistent, and clear assessment in       project planning documents that allows for full participation       by project sponsors.        Further, the managers seek to clarify the scope of existing       authorities for periodic renourishment and mitigation of       shore damages attributable to Federal navigation projects.        To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary is       directed to provide periodic nourishment in accordance with       subsection (c) of the first section of the Act of August 13,       1946, and subject to section 156 of WRDA 1976, for projects       and measures carried out for the purpose of restoring and       increasing the resilience of ecosystems to the same extent as       periodic nourishment is provided for projects and measures       carried out for the purpose of coastal storm risk management.        For all future projects to mitigate shore damage       attributable to navigation projects under section 111 of the       River and Harbor Act of 1968, the Secretary is instructed       that shores damaged by navigation features and projects for       which the Corps has assumed responsibility through any       method, including the Cape Cod Canal, are eligible for       assistance under the section. Although the Cape Cod Canal       jetties were initially constructed by private interests, the       Cape Cod Canal project has been under Federal control for       over 100 years. The Federal Government owns the project and       has reconstructed, operated, maintained, repaired, and       rehabilitated the project numerous times since acquiring the       channel. The project does not have a non-Federal sponsor.       This section provides clear authority for the Secretary to       implement mitigation measures to address the shore damage       caused by the Cape Cod Canal jetties at full Federal expense.       The Secretary is directed to exercise this authority without       further delay. Further, the Secretary is directed in the       future to apply this section in a manner that does not       preclude Federal participation in the cost to mitigate       damages caused by a navigation project or feature solely       because the project or feature was initially constructed by a       nonFederal entity.        The managers remain concerned about the impacts of drought       to the nation's water supply, including the current drought       in the State of California and other arid States. Section 221       of WRDA 2020 directed the Corps to submit a report to       Congress on the benefits and consequences of including water       supply and water conservation as a primary mission of the       Corps. Section 221 of WRDA 2020 directed this report be       transmitted to Congress by June 2022; however, the Corps has       now significantly missed this statutory deadline on an issue       of critical importance to communities concerned about long-      term water supply availability. The managers direct the Corps       to prioritize and expedite completion of this report, and to       provide a bipartisan briefing to the House Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on       Environment and Public Works within 90 days of the date of       enactment of this Act on the status of such report.        During consideration of WRDA 2022, the managers received a       request related to public safety at federally authorized       hurricane and storm damage reduction projects, such a the       project at Cape May Beach in Cape May, New Jersey. The       managers encourage the Secretary to work with the State of       New Jersey, the non-Federal sponsors of similar hurricane and       storm damage reduction projects in the region, and other       interested stakeholders and public safety officials to       examine whether the rate of head, neck, and spine injuries       sustained at Cape May Beach as reported by the New Jersey       Department of Health and the City of Cape May Beach Patrol is       similar to or differs from those reported at other federally       authorized projects in the region.        The managers received a request related to the Corps' use       of its existing authority to perform advance maintenance of       the nation's federally authorized navigation channels. These       channels are essential to keeping the international supply       chain open and operating efficiently during this period of       economic recovery. The managers strongly urge the Corps to       make optimum use of available authorities to ensure that       these waterways are adequately maintained and able to       accommodate global shipping needs and generate economic       benefits during this critical time. The use of advance       maintenance can be particularly impactful in channels with       high shoaling areas. Over time these areas naturally silt in       and are especially vulnerable to the advent of more intense       storms, and repeated advance maintenance efforts may be       necessary to guard against depth reductions which can lead to       draft restrictions for larger global vessels. The managers       encourage the Corps to maintain Federal channels at their       approved advance maintenance depth.        The managers are aware that the Corps utilizes a wide range       of platforms, sensors, and other technologies to conduct a       range of research and monitoring activities, including the       use of uncrewed platforms and sensor packages. The managers       encourage the Secretary, in coordination with the Corps'       Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), to consider       establishing an Uncrewed Systems Innovation Center to ensure       the appropriate development and utilization of innovative       uncrewed technologies, including autonomous, remotely       operated airborne, terrestrial, and maritime vehicle systems.        The managers received a request to consolidate the       management of all active Miami-Dade County water resource       projects into the Jacksonville District. The managers       encourage the Corps to transfer project management of the       Miami-Dade Back Bay Coastal Storm Risk Feasibility Management       from the Norfolk District to the Jacksonville District.        The managers received several requests related to the       potential modification of lock and dam structures on the       inland waterways system to allow for remote operations,       including concerns with the vulnerability of remote       operations to cyber-attacks and the potential impact of       remote operations on current Corps' employees. The managers       remind the Secretary that section 222(b)(1)(B)(V) of WRDA       2020 set forth a security framework for studies carried out       by the Corps. Results from that effort should be used to       address cyber security concerns for Corps structures,       particularly locks and dams, that utilize remote supervisory       control and data acquisition (SCADA) type products for       automation control systems as part of the Corps' national       security interests. The managers request a bipartisan       briefing on these activities. The managers also recognize       that remote lock operations along commercial and recreational       waterways can increase the availability and capacity of the       locks, especially in lower-use waterways, and can support       other economic drivers in counties throughout America. The       managers received a request to consider potential expansion       of remote operations to additional locations, such as in the       Upper Allegheny Locks in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.       However, the managers remind the Secretary of recent       Congressional action to statutorily declare Corps' lock and       dam employees as inherently governmental and direct the       Secretary to report to the managers on any potential       workforce impacts of any proposed automation and remote       operations activity before they are carried out, and to       ensure that any recommendations in a completed study will not       result in the loss of jobs for current lock and dam       employees.        As part of the Isabella Lake Dam Safety Modification       Project in Kern County, California, the Corps is building the       U.S. Forest Service a new visitor center to replace a       facility that was demolished due to this project. The       managers note discussion on this visitor center started a       decade ago, but understands the Corps is now in the process       of acquiring private property on which to build this facility       from a willing seller. Accordingly, the managers support the       Corps efforts on this project and direct the Corps to       continue to work expeditiously to bring this visitor center       to fruition.        The managers direct the Corps to consult with the Indian       Wells Valley Groundwater Authority and the Naval Air Weapons       Station China Lake to validate proposed solutions to resolve       water supply needs and eliminate overdraft in the Indian       Wells Valley groundwater basin in California. This validation       effort shall review and develop measures needed to provide       water supply resiliency in the basin and for the critical       Federal defense assets that overlie it, including, but not       limited to, the preparation of comprehensive plans for the       development, implementation, utilization, conservation, or       importation of water, infrastructure needs, and related land       resources in the basin. Such plans shall consider the       potential and projected water supply needs of the critical       defense assets and future growth within the basin. The Corps       is directed to report to the House Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on       Environment and Public Works within 180 days of enactment of       this Act on the validation effort.        The Success Reservoir Enlargement Project was authorized by       section 101(b)(4) of WRDA 1999 to improve both flood damage       protection and water supply in Tulare County, California. In       House Report 116-460, the managers previously encouraged the       Corps to advance this project. The managers note their       support for this project and continue to encourage the Corps       to expedite this project through completion.        The managers received a request related to completion of       the Comite Diversion project, Louisiana, authorized as part       of the project for flood control, Amite River and       Tributaries, Louisiana, pursuant to section 101(11) of WRDA       1992. The managers direct the Secretary and any other       relevant agencies to take all steps necessary to ensure       completion of the project as quickly as possible. The       managers request, within 90 days of the date of the filing of       this report, that the Secretary provide a bipartisan briefing       on the status of completion of the project.        The Port Fourchon, Belle Pass Channel, Louisiana,       navigation project, authorized in WRDA 2020, features as a       key component 100 percent beneficial use disposal of project       dredge material. The managers are encouraged that progress       has been made between the Corps and the non-Federal sponsor       in designating a beneficial use disposal site  [[Page H8848]]       that will meet National Economic Development goals, as well       as satisfy the local community's need for beneficial use       disposal at impacted coastal areas. The Corps is expected to       provide the non-Federal sponsor with a revised Project       Management Plan (PMP), delineating tasks and costs associated       with addressing remaining conditions contained in the Port       Fourchon, Belle Pass Channel, Louisiana, authorization,       including a revised dredge material disposal plan that will       designate the beneficial use disposal site. As such, the       managers direct the Secretary to negotiate and complete a PMP       that is satisfactory to the Secretary and the nonFederal       sponsor, including the selection of a beneficial use disposal       site agreed upon by the nonFederal sponsor, as soon as       possible.     Mr. Speaker, this bill makes history as the fifth  consecutive water resources development bill, the first time in the  history of the United States Congress this has been done.   It authorizes 25 construction reports of the Chief of the Corps of  Engineers, essential to Portland, Oregon; Tacoma, Washington; Selma,  Alabama; and right here in Washington, D.C.   The bill also meets the challenge of climate change, even though some  deny it exists, by rebuilding and maintaining critical navigation  jetties and breakwaters to dimensions necessary to address sea-level  rise and extreme weather events, impacts of coastal storms, and inland  flooding. It also addresses future water supply needs in the arid West  and works to make communities more resilient.   For the first time in over a decade, it significantly expands the  Corps' environmental infrastructure authorities to assist more  communities in addressing their drinking water and wastewater needs.    Finally, it also includes the Don Young Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2022, authorizing $13.6 billion and $14.5 billion  for the next year for much-needed shoreside infrastructure.   It also authorizes a third polar security cutter. The Russians have  20 icebreakers. The Arctic is opening up. We need a third cutter, and  then we need the smaller cutters.   I thank Ranking Member Graves, Chair Napolitano, Ranking Member  Rouzer, Chair Carbajal, Ranking Member Gibbs, and all of my staff for  their tremendous work on this committee.
