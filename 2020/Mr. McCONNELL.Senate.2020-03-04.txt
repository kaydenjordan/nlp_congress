 Madam President, last week I described how Congress  could quickly secure supplemental funding to combat the coronavirus.  The way to secure these urgently needed resources with speed and  certainty was to forgo partisan posturing, forgo micromanagement at the  leadership level, and let the bipartisan appropriators do their work.   Since then, Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy, and their counterparts in  the House have worked on bipartisan, bicameral discussions. Thanks to  their good work, we are close. The funding legislation appears to be  about at the 5-yard line. I hope to complete the legislation and  deliver this funding this week. We are close.   In order to finish up, both sides will need to continue doing what  has worked thus far and resist the temptation to impose any last-minute  ideological demands. In particular, I have heard that the Democratic  leadership may be contemplating a last-minute demand that this funding  legislation also test drive some untried, untested, and controversial  parts of their Medicare for All proposal that relate to the pricing of  new drugs and innovations.   So, look, everyone agrees that the potential diagnostics,  therapeutics, or vaccines that might come out of this new funding  cannot only be available to the ultrawealthy. We all agree on that.  Everyone agrees. We already have longstanding, tried-and-true  procedures so the government can buy and distribute new medicines in  scenarios like this to ensure accessibility. These mechanisms are  already in place. There is no need and this is no time to begin  experimenting with ideological proposals that could jeopardize  research, development, and innovation. Like I said, the accessibility  of treatments or vaccines is a priority for everybody, but before new  technologies can be accessible, they obviously have to be available.   This is a moment to empower innovators, to incentivize innovators. It  is a time to remove hurdles to innovation, not build new hurdles and  create new uncertainty through ideological experimentation.   So I hope these rumors do not prove true. I am optimistic we will be  able to close out the remaining questions and process this legislation  in short order. This moment calls for collaboration  [[Page S1450]]  and for unity. Our bicameral, bipartisan talks have made great headway.  It is time to give our public health experts and healthcare  professionals the surge of resources they need at this challenging  time.                            ____________________     Madam President, in the meantime, the Senate will  continue considering an important package of comprehensive energy  legislation. For the first time in more than a decade, we are looking  at a thorough update to the laws governing innovation, security, and  workforce development all across the American energy sector.   As Chairman Murkowski has noted, 12 years is a long time. The demands  we face in researching, producing, refining, storing, and protecting  our abundant domestic energy have evolved a great deal since 2007, so  it is high time for relevant Federal policy to evolve as well. I am  grateful the chairman was willing to take on this important task, and I  am glad she and Senator Manchin led their colleagues on the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee through an overwhelmingly bipartisan  process to produce this bill.   As I mentioned yesterday, the legislation aggregates 50 individual  bills. It contains input from more than 60 Senators. It covers an  exhaustive range of energy-related challenges, from power storage and  renewable technologies to carbon capture and electrical grid cyber  security.   It has earned the support of a similarly broad range of industry,  advocacy, and research organizations. In one joint letter, the  Bipartisan Policy Center, the American Nuclear Society, the Nature  Conservancy, and 36 other signatories endorsed it as ``the culmination  of extensive efforts to develop practical legislative solutions.'' That  is the American Nuclear Society and the Nature Conservancy--that ought  to tell you what you need to know about this bill. This is a bipartisan  piece of legislation done right. This is how you take practical steps  to build consensus on issues that affect every American in every State.   Around this time last year, you will recall we saw a high-profile  example of exactly what not to do. The far-left edge of the House  Democratic caucus rolled out a massive scheme to forcibly remake much  of our economy and our society according to their radical top-down  designs.   We all remember the Green New Deal--categorical bans on the most  affordable forms of American energy, a dim future for millions of  energy jobs, unprecedented Washington mandates on every subject from  building codes to personal transportation. We all remember what  happened next: This socialist fantasy did not stay confined to  ideological fringe; it quickly grew into a broader rallying cry. When  the Senate had the opportunity to vote on this wish list of central  planning, only four--just four--of our Democratic colleagues could  bring themselves to vote against it. That is quite a remarkable  commentary on the state of our politics.   Experts estimated the Green New Deal could have cost our government  more than the GDP of the entire world. The Green New Deal could have  cost our government more than the GDP of the entire world. Instead,  this bipartisan legislation will let us direct responsible and targeted  investment in a smart way toward key energy priorities.   The Green New Deal sought to have Washington micromanage everyday  life in this country to a degree that the 20th-century Socialists would  have drooled over. Instead, this bipartisan legislation will create  better policy and regulatory conditions for American workers, American  innovators, and American job creators to actually thrive.   Speaking as the senior Senator from Kentucky, I know firsthand that  many Americans in the middle of the country suffered badly during the  Obama era because Washington bureaucrats decided American energy had to  fit their ideological designs. The very last thing we want is to move  backward and expand those errors exponentially with radical leftwing  experiments that would make the last administration's War on Coal look  like child's play.   What Kentuckians and all Americans deserve is for the Federal  Government to make prosperity and domestic energy dominance easier-- easier--not harder. They deserve investment and support to help the  communities that have fueled this country for generations to prosper  once again, and that is what this bipartisan bill will actually  deliver.   I am proud to support this smart legislation. Clearly, I am not  alone, since only three Senators voted against advancing the bill this  week. So I would urge all of my colleagues to keep up their support,  and let's see this package through to the finish line.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1419.
