 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for  yielding and the gentleman from Missouri.   The Bible says: Greater love hath no man than this, to lay down his  life for his brothers and sisters.   On September 12, 1997, a little boy was born to a hardworking couple  and named Dakota Kyle Rigsby.   Dakota's father served in the military, and this would influence  Dakota's decision to one day follow in his father's footsteps and also  serve this great Nation.   Every young man and woman, and every parent who kisses a child good- bye, understands that the potential price for such a decision is to  make the ultimate sacrifice for something that is bigger and greater  than yourself, and on June 17, 2017, Dakota Kyle Rigsby did just that,  along with six colleagues: Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass;  Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc Truong Huynh; Gunners Mate 2nd Class  Noe Hernandez; Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan;  Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin; and Fire Controlman  1st Class Gary Leo Rehm, Jr.   I often joke that the United States is the worst country in the world  except for all the others.   When a slave owner named Jefferson articulated an idea for the world  that all people were created equal, it harkens to the preamble to the  Constitution that gives us not a perfect union, but asks us to work  towards a more perfect union, which means that there is always work to  be done.   Mr. Speaker, this work is invariably done in most instances by women  and men whose names we will never know. So we carry this bill so that  one of those heroes upon the backs of whom our Nation is built will be  remembered, even if only in a small place in a small way, for  sacrificing every single one of his tomorrows to help us continue to be  free.  [[Page H1353]]                                     time  1745    He joins the legion of Americans numbered in the millions who have  given the ultimate sacrifice. We know the name of Abraham Lincoln. We  know the name of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We need to remember the  names of people, heroes like Dakota Rigsby.   So this young man, devoted to service, demonstrated this from his  time in high school as a volunteer firefighter to that eventful night  when he executed his duties and went to bed for the day on the USS  Fitzgerald.   I understand that there is a lot that we still need to do in this  country, but please understand that we are where we are because better  people than us have given all of their tomorrows for us to be here.   I would submit that when you hear that national anthem, while I would  defend to my last breath your right not to stand, that you do stand.  Stand up for Dakota Kyle Rigsby because, by God, he stood up for us.
