 Madam Speaker, this week, we will commemorate the 75th  anniversary of D-Day, and I rise to honor two of our New Jersey  residents who participated in Operation Overlord.   William Brodish worked at Picatinny Arsenal for 3 years. He joined  the Army and was assigned to the 27th Ordnance Bomb Disposal Squad.   On the morning of June 6, Private Brodish landed on Omaha Beach and  got to work removing projectiles and rockets from the shoreline. He was  only 22-years-old when he died on the beach as a German artillery  projectile exploded over his position.   Herbert Terner enlisted in the Army in 1942, and on D-Day, he  parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne.   As a radio specialist, he alerted troops of landing positions, and he  continued to fight after D-Day in the Battle of the Bulge, and,  eventually, helped to liberate prisoners from the concentration camps.   I had the great honor of meeting Herb, now 98 years old and a  resident of Montville, over Memorial Day weekend.   Tonight, I honor William, Herbert, and all the New Jersey residents  who put their lives on the line to defend democracy and free Europe  from the grasp of the Nazis and totalitarianism.                            ____________________
