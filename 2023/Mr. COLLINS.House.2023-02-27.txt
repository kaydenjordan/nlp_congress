 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, to resign immediately.   The Secretary's priorities don't line up with what the American  people expect from him. Buttigieg has failed to execute DOT's mission,  which is to improve the quality and safety of our Nation's  transportation system.   Instead, he is laser-focused on wokeness at the agency and in our  culture. Think about it. He took 10 days to even acknowledge the  devastating train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.   During those 10 days, as Ohioans fled from their homes and feared for  their health, he did find time to say that there are too many White  people in the construction industry. I don't know about you, but when I  see the men and women who build the structures that house us and the  roads that connect us, I am not thinking about their race. I just  appreciate that they are doing the hard work that is necessary for our  society to thrive.   It is time for Pete to go back to Indiana so someone serious about  building infrastructure and transportation systems that are safe and  effective can start getting the job done.                            ____________________
