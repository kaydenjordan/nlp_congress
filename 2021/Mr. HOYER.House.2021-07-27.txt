 Madam Speaker, as everybody knows, I had the delightful  opportunity of serving on the Appropriations Committee as an active  member for 23 years. I am on leave, and I may be on leave forever, who  knows, but I care a lot about these bills. These are the only bills  that have to pass. They are the only bills that if they don't pass, the  government shuts down.   They are the bills that used to bring us together. It is relatively  easy to compromise on figures, but it is difficult to compromise on  other issues. Although, I will say, as I begin my remarks--and I am not  going to be that long, but as I begin my remarks, I voted for, in the  1980s and 1990s and over the last 20 years, for appropriations bills in  which there were contained issues that I severely disagreed with, and I  know Ms. DeLauro has as well.    But I know that overall we had to pass the bills, and that I thought  then, and I think now, that the bills were largely dealing with what  the American people wanted us to deal with.   So I rise today, Madam Speaker, in support of these bills, the seven  in this package, and hopefully, three to come, and the two thereafter,  whenever we bring them to the floor.   Last Congress, after Democrats took control of the House majority, we  passed legislation to fund nearly all of government before the end of  the summer. I was very proud of that. We passed it in June of 2019, and  we passed it in July of 2020. We have done that 2 years in a row now.  What we haven't accomplished, however, is the passage of these bills  prior to September 30. That is what we should be doing.   I know the chair feels that way, and I think the ranking member feels  that way. I haven't talked to her specifically about that, but I think  she does.   Moving the appropriations process along on time made it easier to  forestall shutdowns and fund the government for the American people.   Now we are doing so again and with a Democratic-controlled Senate and  White House, we are passing bills of which every Member of this body  can be proud. And I predict that every Member of this body will go home  and claim credit for something in these appropriations bills, whether  you voted for or against.   The appropriations bills we are bringing to the floor in this minibus  package deliver for all of our constituents. They invest in economic  growth; they expand infrastructure; they care for our veterans; they  make college more affordable; advance research into combatting the next  pandemic and curing rare diseases; protect America's public lands and  keeping our air and water clean.                                time  1600    They help farmers, small business, and large business. They help  farmers and invest in rural communities, and combat hunger and provide  housing, among other things.   These investments in the American people will help us build back  better from the pandemic and enable our businesses, workers, students,  and farmers to get ahead in the global economy.   One of the provisions I want to highlight in particular, of which I  am very proud, is the major increase in funding for full-service  community schools. I have been proud to advocate for this program since  we first launched it in 2008.   Full-service community schools help the youngest Americans and their  families--that is the key, ``and their families,'' the whole family.  Critical services are accessible all in one place, not only early  childhood education but also nutrition assistance, dental exams,  financial literacy courses, and more.   When children and their families have easy access to these resources,  it means greater success for students throughout their later years in  school, better preparing them for college and careers and helping us  close the achievement gap.   In my State of Maryland, we have had tremendous success with our  network of Judy Centers. Judy Centers are named after Judith P. Hoyer,  my wife, and in her memory. She was an early childhood educator in  Prince George's County and a pioneer in the development of this type of  program.   Like full-service community schools, Judy Centers are proving their  worth by narrowing achievement gaps and preparing more and more  students for success in kindergarten and later grades.   The minibus on the floor today would invest $443 million for this  critical initiative. Now, that is not a lot per child, but it is a lot  of effect per child, which will help States launch and expand their  full-service community school programs and serve many more children and  their families.   I thank Chairwoman DeLauro, not only for her strong support and her  leadership in making sure that funding was included, but also for her  leadership of this committee. She has been a very faithful steward, and  a steward who has acted in a very transparent, inclusive way so that  every Member knew what they could have and honor their initiatives and  their priorities.   All the members and staff of the Appropriations Committee for their  hard work should be thanked as well by all of us. These are tough bills  to put together, tough bills to move forward. I thank them for their  efforts together to ensure that the House is doing its job for the  people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this package of  appropriations bills.   Now, some may say, ``Well, the Senate hasn't acted,'' and that is a  lamentable fact. The Senate has not passed a single appropriations bill  out of committee, nor had they passed a single bill out of committee by  the end of the fiscal year last year.   I would hope that our colleagues in the United States Senate would  not keep treating the appropriations process as a backwater because  where we put our money is where our heart is, where our priorities are.  This bill, these bills--this bill, but these bills, all 10 of the ones  that we are going to consider hopefully this week--show where our  priorities are.   I hope that the Senate will begin its own appropriations process so  that we can complete our work together, perhaps not before the end of  the fiscal year but certainly before the end of the year, so we do not  have some either CR or omnibus, which is the product of just a few as  opposed to the many in this House and in the Senate.   I urge support of this minibus. I urge support of the three bills to  come, the State-Foreign Operations bill, the Commerce-Justice bill, and  the Legislative Branch bill. I thank all the cardinals and the ranking  members for their help and their work.    Mr. Speaker, I repeat my admiration for the chair and the  work that she has done and the staff has done. I thank them very much.   I might say that the ranking member, who is speaking on this bill,  is, A, a dear friend of mine, and, very frankly, a gentleman who has  added real quality to this institution and real collegiality to this  institution. And I want you to know, Mr. Simpson, how much I appreciate  your service in the House of Representatives. You are my friend and a  great Member of the Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I have offered is a result of my  sponsorship of the Help America Vote Act, in which I created a program  that we called the Help America Vote Act. However, when we got to the  end of the write-up of the bill, Bob Ney, who was the chairman of the  House Administration Committee, at that point in time I was the ranking  member, suggested that we use that phrase for the bill itself.   However, originally, the Help America Vote Act was a program which  would encourage colleges to have programs for their students so that  they would work on election day in polling places. No generation knows  these new electronic devices for voting better than the younger  generation.   And my thought was then, and is now, that we ought to encourage young  people, knowing not only the partisan politics that go on, but how  America runs its elections. So that is what I am trying to do here. I  have been encouraging, and we have appropriated money in the past for  this program.                                time  1930    I want to thank my friend from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), who is not on  the floor, but a good friend of mine for his leadership on this  subcommittee. I thank him and the rest of the subcommittee members for  ensuring that the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Act contains robust funding for the Election Assistance  Commission. Bob Ney and I worked on creating that commission. It has  relatively limited powers, but it is a very important ally of local  election officials.   This funding for the EAC is critical to ensuring secure elections for  the American people. My amendment would take a portion of that funding,  some $4 million, and use it for the purpose of supporting the Help  America Vote Act College Poll Worker.   This program has been a top priority for me for two decades. At a  time when our elections are under stress from record turnout, the  deployment of new technologies, and the realities of the pandemic, we  need to recruit more young Americans to volunteer as nonpartisan poll  workers.   I think any of us who go to the polls--of course, all of us in this  room go to polls on a regular basis--we see an aging coterie of poll  workers. This would add, I think, a real component to the volunteers  that are available to our local election boards.   I know my election board has a tough time recruiting sometimes. You  are there a 14-, 15-hour day, and it is not necessarily the most  glamorous job in the world.   Traditionally, many poll workers in this country are older Americans.  We continue to benefit from their experience and expertise, of course.  They have much to teach younger Americans about how best to staff  polling places and oversee ballot counting. But with COVID-19, many  have taken a step back and are looking to train the next generation in  these skills.   The HAVA College Poll Worker Program is a critical tool, in my view,  in helping communities bring more young Americans into this public  service. Very frankly, I expect them to go to their dorm or their  neighborhood with their peers and say: Hey, I am going to work the  polls. You ought to come down and see me.   That would be a way to encourage younger people to get out and vote.   As poll workers, young Americans will bring their energy, their  enthusiasm, and their technology know-how to help our elections run  smoothly. It will also instill a love of democracy and voting in a new  generation of Americans who will see firsthand--and I am a big  proponent of in-person voting. I am a big proponent of mail ballots as  well, but I think going to the polls, seeing others there, seeing them  exercise their democratic franchise is an exciting and, frankly,  enriching experience.   Last year, I met with the presidents of colleges throughout the  University of Maryland system and worked with them to encourage  students to sign up as poll workers and to have programs which may be  either a half of a credit or part of a democracy course or a history  course or some sort of social studies course saying: This is how we  technically run elections, not partisan. This is how we just do it  technically, how  Mike Simpson, Steny Hoyer, and Rosa DeLauro actually  vote on election day.   We don't know exactly how many more students volunteered in 2020  because there isn't funding for tracking that data and coordinating  these efforts. So, my concept is a college may  [[Page H4082]]  get a $20,000 grant to run a program for students on how to run an  election. It may be 3 hours in 1 week or something, not a long course.   With this program, more college students will have an opportunity to  learn how to get involved as nonpartisan poll workers so they can step  up and help make our country and our democracy stronger for years to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Quigley, Chair DeLauro, and Ranking Member  Simpson for their help in this effort.
