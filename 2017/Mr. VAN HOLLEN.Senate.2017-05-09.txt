 Mr. President, I join my colleague in opposing the  nomination of Dr. Gottlieb and thank him for laying out the case.   The FDA, of course, is an important part of our healthcare system,  and just last week we saw the House of Representatives jam through a  piece of legislation that would wreak havoc on the healthcare system.  In fact, many people are appropriately calling what they did  ``wealthcare'' because it represents a huge transfer of wealth away  from caring for patients to the very wealthiest in our country,  including many powerful special interests.   I think everybody understands--Republicans, Democrats, Independents  alike--the Affordable Care Act is not perfect and specifically that we  need to address the issues within the Affordable Care Act exchanges. We  need to address those issues to lower the deductibles, lower the  copays, and make it more affordable. There are some very  straightforward ways of doing that.   One good idea is to create a public option within the Affordable Care  Act exchanges, a Medicare-for-all-type choice. What will that do? It  will create more competition. That will drive down the price of  insurance within the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and it will ensure  that you have a provider everywhere in the United States in every  community of this country. Even better, the Congressional Budget  Office, the last time they looked at it, concluded that it would save  taxpayers $160 billion over 10 years, so it would reduce our deficit.   The House Republican wealthcare bill doesn't try to fix the  exchanges. What it does is blow up the Affordable Care Act and in the  process wreaks havoc on our entire healthcare system. You don't have to  take my word for it. Just take a look at the long list of groups that  have come out strongly opposed to the House bill, starting with patient  advocacy groups, such as the American Lung Association, the American  Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American  Cancer Society, and the list goes on. These aren't Democratic groups.  They don't have only Democratic patients. They have patients who are  Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and people who aren't  participating in the political process. These are groups that care  about patients, they don't care about politics, and they are strongly  opposed.   How about those who are providing care to those patients? Well, here  is a partial list of the groups that are strongly opposed: the American  Academy of Family Physicians; the American Medical Association, the  doctors; the American Academy of Pediatrics, the folks who look after  the care of our kids; the American Nurses' Association.   Let's look at the hospital groups. The American Hospital Association  strongly opposes this; the Children's Hospital Association opposes  this, and the list goes on. It is opposed by those who are spending all  their time advocating for patients and opposed by those who provide  care to patients.    Then you have a long list of senior groups, including AARP, that  strongly oppose this because the House bill discriminates against older  Americans--people over 50 years old--because it allows insurance  companies to charge them a whole lot more for their healthcare than  they currently have to pay.   These groups don't care about party. They don't care about politics.  They care about patients in our healthcare system, and it should tell  us all a lot that they are opposed and strongly opposed to this bill.  Now, why is that?  [[Page S2828]]    This House bill is rotten at its core. Its foundation was rotten when  the Congressional Budget Office first looked at it, and then they made  it even worse. Let's look at the foundation of this, which the  Congressional Budget Office did have a chance to look at. I do want to  remind the Presiding Officer that the head of the Congressional Budget  Office was selected by the chairman of the House Republican Budget  Committee, the House Budget Committee, the Republican chairman, and the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, a Republican chairman. They  took a look at that first foundation of the House bill, and here is  what they concluded. This is right in their report; that 24 million  Americans would lose their access to affordable healthcare. That is on  page 2 of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report.   Why is that? It is because they take a wrecking ball to Medicaid and  a wrecking ball to the exchanges. They don't make the exchanges better.  They don't drive down the prices. They make the exchanges worse, and  they take a big whack at Medicaid. In fact, they also take a cut at  Medicare. In fact, if you go to the table in this CBO chart, I will  just refer people to table 3. Sometimes you just have to dig deep in  these reports to get to the bottom line. There is an $883 billion cut  that consists of about $840 billion cuts to the Medicaid Program, $48  billion cut to the Medicare Program, and I should emphasize that will  actually make the Medicare Program somewhat more insolvent. You add it  up, you have $880 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid combined.   I remind people that the Medicaid funding not only went to provide  more access to people for healthcare through expanding Medicaid, which  many States have talked about and Governor Kasich has been talking  about recently, but this bill also cuts the core Medicaid Program to  the States, and two-thirds of that money goes to care for seniors in  nursing homes and people with disabilities. So it puts all of them at  risk. That is $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and people  who need healthcare.   What is the other big number in the House bill? Well, $900 billion is  the amount of the tax cuts in what is being described as a healthcare  bill. That is why people are calling this a wealthcare bill because you  are cutting $880 billion out of Medicaid and Medicare and transferring  those dollars that are currently being spent to provide healthcare to  tens of millions of Americans, transferring that money back primarily  to the wealthiest people in this country and corporate special  interests.   Under this $900 billion tax cut, if you are earning over $1 million a  year, you are getting an average tax cut of $50,000 a year. If you are  in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of income earners--we are talking  about the wealthiest people in this country--you are getting an average  annual tax cut of $200,000.   Do you know what they did for insurance companies? They used to say  the bonuses that were paid to the CEOs of insurance companies would be  taxed, but they took that away. So now insurance companies can  essentially pay bonuses and deduct those. They can deduct those now  from their bottom line, which drives up the profits of insurance  companies by allowing the deduction of CEO bonuses. So we have $900  billion in tax cuts that primarily go to the wealthiest, and $880  billion in cuts to the Medicaid Program and Medicare that goes to care  for people. That is why this bill is rotten at its core, because it is  going to hurt our healthcare system, according to all those patient  advocacy groups and all those patient provider groups, and for what? To  give this windfall tax break to the wealthy and powerful interests.   That is why it is probably no surprise that when the American people  were asked about that original House bill, only 17 percent said: Yes,  that is a good idea. Everybody else said: Uh-uh, we don't like what we  are seeing. That is the bill I was just describing.   Then the House took that rotten foundation and put even worse stuff  on top of it. They added a provision that would eliminate the essential  benefits package. These are the provisions that ensure that when you  are buying an insurance policy, you are getting something that will be  there when you need it rather than a junk policy--the policies people  used to get, where they found out after they got sick, ``Uh-uh, we are  not paying for that,'' said the insurance companies ``because look here  at the back of page 100, last paragraph, fine print, you are not  covered for that.'' That is why we had an essential benefits package  for things like maternity care, mental health care, coverage for  substance abuse.   I hear a lot of talk about the problems with the opioid epidemic.  Those are real problems that are hurting families around the country.  That was part of the essential health benefits--not there in the House  bill.   Then, to add insult to injury, they took out the requirement that you  have coverage for preexisting conditions in an affordable way. You  know, people can play word games all they want. You can say that you  have to provide coverage for someone with preexisting conditions, but  if the policy you propose is $200,000 a year, $300,000 a year, we all  know that is a false promise. That is a hoax. That is playing games  with the American people. So you can write in any kind of requirement  you want that preexisting conditions be covered, but if they are  unaffordable, it is not real. That is why the Affordable Care Act put  everybody into a pool together, to help reduce the costs so we could  make sure we protected people with preexisting conditions--asthma,  diabetes or whatever it may be. The House bill pulls the plug on that.  Maybe that is why the House didn't want to wait for the next  Congressional Budget Office report to tell them what their bill would  do to the American people.   I have already read a little from the original Congressional Budget  Office report that was based on the foundation of this House bill. That  hasn't changed. That bill is rotten at its core, and as the  Congressional Budget Office says, it is going to knock 24 million  people off of affordable healthcare, going to apply big tax breaks to  wealthy people, but then they added other provisions as well--getting  rid of the essential health benefits, getting rid of protections for  preexisting conditions. Then it was let's see no evil, let's hear no  evil. We are not even going to wait for the next Congressional Budget  Office report. I am looking forward to hearing what they have to say.    For the American people, I think the greatest danger is that here in  the Senate we are going to hear from a lot of Senators that they don't  like the House bill just as it is; yes, we are going to have to make  some changes. What I would say to the American people is to beware of  people who say they are going to make a change that is meaningful to  the Affordable Care Act that the House bill passed--their version of  the bill. Beware of people who say they are making a change that is  meaningful when it is really only a cosmetic change, when it is really  only a small change that then provides some kind of rationale or excuse  for supporting a House bill that is rotten at its core.   For example, someone may say: Well, let's do a little more by way of  covering opioid addiction. That would be a good idea. But that doesn't  salvage a bill that is fundamentally flawed. That doesn't salvage a  bill that at its core cuts $880 billion from Medicaid and Medicare to  provide a tax cut of over $900 billion, most of which goes to wealthy  people and corporate special interests.   I would say to all the other people who are on employer-provided  healthcare, which are the majority of Americans: Beware, because that  House bill will affect you too.   I just want to read a portion from something that appeared in  TheUpshot public health section of the New York Times--``G.O.P. Bill  Could Affect Employer Health Coverage, Too.'' They write:         About half of all Americans get health coverage through       work. The bill would make it easier for employers to increase       the amount that employees could be asked to pay in premiums,       or to stop offering coverage entirely. It also has the       potential to weaken rules against capping worker's benefits       or limiting how much employees can be asked to pay in       deductibles or co-payments.    So for someone who is getting coverage through their employer, beware  because this is going to have harmful effects on you.   I want to close with one of the many stories that I have received-- and I  [[Page S2829]]  know many of us have received from our constituents--about how that  House bill would wreak havoc in their lives. Here is one that I  received:         I'm 29 years old and was just diagnosed Feb. 24th with       breast cancer. . . . I buy insurance myself, and did so with       the assistance from the ACA. Without that program in place, I       might not have gone in when I felt this lump. I might have       waited much longer, just to be told that it was too late.       Without this program, I would be bankrupted by the screenings       alone just to find out I am dying. . . . Someone told me not       to make this political--but this is my life. It will       literally be life or death for so many of us.    This is a life-or-death issue for tens of millions of our fellow  Americans. I urge the Senate to flatly reject the House healthcare- wealthcare bill, which is rotten to its core.   Let's focus on fixing the issues in the exchanges. We can do that if  people of good faith want to work from scratch to address that issue,  but let's not blow up the Affordable Care Act and hurt our constituents  and tens of millions of other Americans in the process.   I yield the remainder of my time.
