 Madam Speaker, during National Police  Week, it is my honor to pay tribute to all of the men and women who put  their lives on the line to serve and protect all of our communities.   In Pennsylvania and around the country, including here in Congress,  dedicated law enforcement officers show up for work every day and  quietly do the job that we have entrusted to them. They uphold the law,  they promote safety, and, most importantly, they preserve human life.   Far too often these officers, unfortunately, do not come home. Today  I ask that the American people join me in remembering our Nation's  fallen police officers and honoring their service and their sacrifice.   More than a profession, law enforcement is truly a calling. Whether  on the streets of Pennsylvania, on our borders, or across our great  Nation, I thank our law enforcement officers for answering the call to  serve the American people.                            ____________________
