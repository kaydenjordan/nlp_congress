 Madam Speaker, I rise very proudly, the first Muslim woman  ever elected in the Congress, in support of H.J. Res. 79.   Madam Speaker, what is even more interesting is what I have been  hearing about this obsession to control and oppress women in the United  States of America. I cannot believe it is 2020, and we are still  debating the merits of the equal rights amendment. It is beyond time.   I want you all to know this is about women of color, women with  disabilities, transgender women, immigrant women. These women are  affected by issues like unequal pay, sexual violence, lack of access  for healthcare, and poverty.   So much of what we are doing here, in trying to promote women's  equality, is about gender, racial, and economic justice.   Madam Speaker, know this: A ``no'' vote today is condoning oppression  of women in the United States of America. I urge support.
