 Madam President, I come to speak about healthcare, and I  begin by paying tribute to our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain,  on his return earlier this week. I wish him the very best as he begins  a process of cure, treatment, and a bright future in his life. I  appreciate the remarks he indicated that were so heartfelt to his  colleagues here in the Senate. We welcome him back and thank him for  his service to the Senate, to the people of Arizona, to the people of  America, but I also thank him most especially for his service in the  U.S. military.   Another great hero in my life and in our country's history is my  predecessor in the Senate, Senator Bob Dole, who earlier this week  celebrated his 94th birthday. Service to Kansans and all Americans  exemplify Bob Dole's life. While I admire him for his time in the  Senate, I respect him even more so for his service to our country  during World War II and for his efforts ever since then to care for  those who have come into harm's way as a result of their service. I  often see him at the World War II Memorial when there is an Honor  Flight from Kansas or across the country, and he is such a role model  for so many people.    Again, I admire him for his commitment to other veterans and to  making certain that veterans receive the care and the gratitude that  they deserve.   Madam President, one of the most important ways we can demonstrate  that we honor those who served our country is by making certain that we  live up to our commitment--the commitment that was made to them--to  provide the benefits that they deserve, including access to timely and  quality healthcare. Unfortunately, today, we find ourselves in another  crisis moment in regard to veterans' healthcare and, in particular, the  Veterans Choice Program, which was designated to provide access to  veterans who were in danger of an inability to access that care because  the VA did not provide the service, could not provide it in a timely  manner, or the service was so far from where the veteran lived that he  was unable to obtain that service because of distance.   So, in 2014, this Congress passed and the President then signed what  has been labeled the Choice Act. It came about in the wake of a  scandal, particularly in Phoenix but across the country, in which we  saw fake waiting lists and the belief that there were veterans who died  as a result of not obtaining the care that they were entitled to in the  VA system.   The Choice Program has helped thousands of veterans across the  country, especially those in rural communities, where distance remains  a problem. I have heard from many veterans in my State as to how  important the Choice Program is to them. Instead of driving for 4 hours  to see a physician at the VA, they can drive 4 minutes to see a  physician in their hometowns.   This Choice Program is set to expire on August 7 of this year. Just a  few days from now, it is scheduled to come to an end. At the start of  2017, the VA estimated that there would be more than $1 billion  remaining in the Choice account that the VA told us would last until  January 2018. Rather than letting those funds expire, I joined Senator  McCain, Senator Isakson, Senator Tester, and others in a Choice  extension bill to remove that August 7 deadline and sunset the program  until the funds expired, which, as I said, was believed to be in  January of 2018.   The President signed that bill on April 19, but less than 6 weeks  later, we learned from the VA that the VA had made unfortunate  miscalculations. As a result of poor budgeting and finance, the dollars  for the Choice Program are not going to last until January and are soon  to expire, just within the next few days. Demand for the Choice Program  is up 30 or 40 percent, and it is clear by that increase in demand that  veterans need Choice, that they like Choice, that it is working for  them, and we now owe it to those veterans to make certain that the  Choice Program continues and that the funds are available to accomplish  that goal.   With Choice, the funds that they had anticipated would last until  January now will run out sometime in August--we think in the next  couple of weeks. Those depleted funds will mean that Kansas veterans  and veterans across the country who have been using the Choice Program  will no longer be able to, and it means that those who could use the  Choice Program into the future will be without that option. We run the  real risk--the likelihood is almost a certainty--that the Choice  Program will be discontinued in a matter of days.   I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of  Veterans Affairs, and when I learned of the budget miscalculations, we  immediately contacted the Secretary of the Department to get his  understanding of the circumstance that we were in. We only learned of  the shortfall after we learned that veterans at home were being denied  access to the Choice Program. The Secretary had made a decision to  reduce those veterans who are eligible. We asked him to withdraw that  guidance to his regional officers across the country, and he did.  However, when the Secretary then testified before our subcommittee, the  subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies, we learned that new guidance had been issued because of the  fear of depleting those dollars. It again limited the access of  veterans to the Choice Program.   We now hear of veterans who are forced to drive hours to get  appointments at VA facilities when, just 2 weeks ago, they were  receiving that care in their hometowns and in their neighborhoods-- nearby opportunities that no longer exist.   Dr. Shulkin of the VA recognized that their projections and budgeting  were off and must be fixed. I hope that turns out to be the result and  that we have a better ability at the Department of Veterans Affairs to  make the calculations necessary for Congress and the Department to make  wise decisions. The system has to be fixed, and it has to be fixed  quickly. There is an immediate crisis.   One of the things that now happens as a result of reduced use of  Choice is that the networks that were created to support Choice--the  third-party administrators of the Choice Program--because of a lack of  volume, are no longer financially viable to stay in the business of  being the network to connect the VA, the private sector, and the  veterans in a way that cares for those veterans, gets them their  appointments, and establishes the payment process by which the  provider--the physician or the hospital--is paid.   This is not just a circumstance in which the third-party  administrators can leave the business and return if we get our work  done here and the VA Choice Program is defunded. Those networks will  disappear, and we will not be able to easily restart the Choice  Program, so if we do not make a fix shortly--today, tomorrow, by the  weekend--and pass legislation in a timely fashion, it is not as if we  can come back in September and say: OK. Let's appropriate the money  now, and Choice can restart.   It will not happen. Choice will be gone.   There are big consequences at play for the future of community care.  The funding crisis and the inability to sustain Choice risk shutting  down--shuttering--the entire networks, and it will diminish the faith  that veterans and our providers were slowly beginning to have in the  Choice Program.  [[Page S4361]]    Early in the Choice Program, many veterans were discouraged because  of the bureaucracy and paperwork associated with Choice. Providers then  were not often paid in a timely fashion, and they became discouraged by  the program. In recent months, that confidence in the program had  returned as veterans were beginning to get their care at home, and  providers were being paid for the services that they provided veterans.  Now, if the third-party administrators--the network--go away, we will  send one more message to veterans and to those who wish to serve them-- the healthcare community--that the program is not a viable or a  valuable one.   Fortunately, both the House and Senate have been working to fix this  situation. Since June, my colleagues on the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee have joined me in working to find a solution that protects  access to community care for veterans. The Choice Program is funded by  mandatory spending. We have also been working with the House as they  have tried to develop a solution that maintains Choice and that is  fiscally responsible.   There has been a lot of back and forth, a lot of conversation, a lot  of talk, and a lot of negotiations going on, and I support the efforts  of our chairmen and ranking members of the Veterans' Affairs  Committees, both in the House and Senate, who are trying to work on an  agreement to come together for our Nation's veterans. I would hope and  I expect that a bill will come from the House yet this week.   My point to my colleagues here today is that we do not have the  luxury of then trying to figure out something different to do than what  the House sends us. We need to have our plan in place, and we need to  have something that can pass both the House and Senate in the next 2  days. I want to motivate my colleagues to do what is right for veterans  and set aside the differences that have prevented the necessary  cooperation to see that we have one bill that can pass both the House  and Senate and save Choice.   I stood here in 2014 to implore my colleagues to support the passage  of the Choice Act in the first place, and I stand here again today to  implore my colleagues to come together and support the passage of this  critical funding for the continuation of the Choice Program and  community care for veterans. I am here to make certain that we end the  delays and find a way to understand the differences and accept that we  must act quickly on behalf of veterans. It has to happen immediately.  We owe our veterans better than what we have been providing them.   I am, once again, partnering with the Senator whom I honored in my  opening comments--Senator McCain--and others to introduce legislation  that will put funds back into the Choice Program and make sure that our  veterans do not experience a lapse of care at home or a termination of  the program.   We are working hard with our colleagues across the aisle and in the  House to determine the future of this program and what community care  will look like. While we work to create that system that will serve  future generations of veterans for years to come--how we make Choice  better--we cannot allow the program to expire at this critical point in  time. Taking care of veterans must be a priority above any one specific  ``ask'' or ``must have'' in the funding. Not acting is not an option.   Upon his return to the Senate, Senator McCain's words remind us of  the importance of this task and many others before us. I am honored to  work with him on this effort to save Choice and to serve our veterans.  I ask my colleagues to help us save this important program that  benefits rural and urban veterans, that makes care more timely, that  provides care in the circumstances in which the VA does not have the  capabilities, either in a timely or a quality fashion, to provide the  services to veterans.   This does not diminish the role or necessity of the Department of  Veterans Affairs or their hospitals and clinics across the country.  Veterans continue to use VA hospitals, and they continue to use our  outpatient clinics, but we ought not allow for the elimination of the  third opportunity for veterans' care--the Choice Program--that serves  so many veterans in so many communities.   Again, I thank Senator McCain for his leadership and his bipartisan  work that originally created this program--this opportunity--with  Senator Sanders.   We seek bipartisanship to put veterans first and to put their  healthcare access above everything else. I am urging my colleagues  today to know that this issue exists, not to walk away from it, to make  certain that we accomplish our goals, and that this critical funding be  provided before we depart for the weekend.   Preserving this important benefit honors our heroes--Senator Dole,  Senator McCain, and the thousands of Americans who did not ask about  whether it was Republicans who served the country or Democrats who  served the country. They are those who believe that having served their  country is what motivated them to see that their families were safe and  secure and to see that America had a bright future. We ought not deny  them that kind of service today.   Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the  Senate.
