 Mr. Speaker, with the Congressional Budget  Office reporting that 22 million people would lose healthcare coverage  and premiums for those who keep their coverage increasing by more than  20 percent next year, it is not surprising that the Republican Senate  bill was pulled due to a pervasive lack of interest and support.   Hit hardest under the pulled Senate bill were low-and middle-income  Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 and people with preexisting  diseases like cancer and diabetes.   The time has come for this Congress to use the leverage of a massive  purchaser of healthcare--the Federal Government--and authorize a  Medicare buy-in for Americans between the ages of 50 and 64.   With the leverage of 60 million-plus beneficiaries and low  administrative costs, a Medicare buy-in option for the 50 to 64  population will drive down costs and drive up the quality of  healthcare. We have an obligation to the American people.                            ____________________
