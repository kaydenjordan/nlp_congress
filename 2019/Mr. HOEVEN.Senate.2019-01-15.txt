 Madam President, I extend my thoughts in regard to the  comments made by the senior Senator from Texas in the need for border  security. I appreciate his comments, and I, certainly, agree with them.             North Dakota State University 2018 FCS Title Victory    Madam President, I rise to take a minute to recognize the incredible  achievements of the North Dakota State University Bison football team  today.   On January 5, it earned its record seventh national championship  title. For 7 out of the last 8 years, it has been the national  champion.   In a hard-fought victory, NDSU defeated the Eastern Washington  University Eagles by a score of 38 to 24 in Frisco, TX. With that win,  the Bison have now won an unprecedented, as I say, seventh NCAA  Division I football championship series championship, setting a record  for the most FCS titles of all time. The Bison now have a total of 15  NCAA championship titles. In addition, the team completed the 2018  football season with a perfect record of 15 wins and zero losses,  displaying just an extraordinary resilience and skill.   This achievement puts the 2018 Bison in, truly, elite company as it  has become only the fifth team to cap off an undefeated season with a  national championship title. The 2018 team joins the 2013 NDSU team in  accomplishing this impressive feat.   Further, NDSU is one of only five FCS teams to have ever won back-to- back titles. NDSU is the deserved holder of the longest title winning  streak in FCS history, with its obtaining five titles in a row from  2011 to 2015. It has been victorious in every FCS title game in which  it has played.   After the title game, NDSU quarterback Easton Stick became NDSU's  record holder for the most passing yards, having a total of 8,693  passing yards in his college career. He also became the NCAA record  holder for the most all-time FCS wins by a quarterback, having a total  of 49 career wins.   I also recognize the impressive achievement of NDSU's head coach,  Chris Klieman. During his 5 years as head coach, he led the Bison to an  outstanding record of 69 wins and only six losses, winning four  national championships in the process. Coach Klieman's achievement of  four titles in 5 years equals the NCAA's FCS record for obtaining the  most titles as a head coach. Coach Klieman and his entire staff  instilled character and perseverance in the members of the NDSU Bison  football team.   While I know it is bittersweet, I am sure that Bison Nation will join  me in wishing Coach Klieman the best of luck in his continued career as  the new head coach of the Kansas State University Wildcats next season.  We welcome Matt Entz as the new head coach, who was formerly the  defensive coordinator. He has, certainly, been part of this great  dynasty.   Finally, I recognize all of Bison Nation for its vibrant and  unwavering support of the team during another successful season.   As they have grown accustomed to doing, the welcoming residents of  Frisco, TX, saw a mass of Bison fans flock to their town for the FCS  championship game. They were warm and wonderful in terms of their  hospitality. Approximately 20,000 fans traveled from North Dakota and  other areas to support our great team. They turned the stadium into a  sea of green and yellow as they passionately cheered on our beloved  Bison.   The Bison victory was not only a victory for the NDSU football team  but for our State as the team brought yet another trophy back home to  North Dakota. I congratulate the team, the coaches, and our great,  great fans on another national championship.   Go, Bison.   Again, I am so proud of our great team, and I appreciate the  opportunity to take this time to recognize its achievements.   I am pleased to yield the floor to my fellow Senator from North  Dakota.    Madam President, I would like to commend my fellow  Senator from North Dakota on his heartfelt comments today and express  my support and agreement with him and with those comments.   He mentioned a number of pieces of legislation that he is  cosponsoring. I am pleased to see that. I, again, have signed onto  legislation to support life in this Congress, as I have in previous  Congresses.   We will have the March for Life at the end of this week. I look  forward to that. Last year, my wife and her sister actually walked in  the March for Life. I have always made a practice of greeting our  participants in the March for Life from North Dakota, and I certainly  look forward to seeing them again here this year.   With that, I thank you for this time to make these comments, and,  again, to extend a warm welcome to my colleague from North Dakota. I  have worked with him for many years, and I very much look forward to  working with him now here in the Senate.   Thank you.
