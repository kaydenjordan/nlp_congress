 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2839) to amend the Siletz Reservation Act to address the  hunting, fishing, trapping, and animal gathering rights of the  Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2839         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SILETZ RESERVATION ACT AMENDMENT.         Section 4 of Public Law 96-340 (commonly known as the       ``Siletz Reservation Act'') (94 Stat. 1074) is amended to       read as follows:       ``SEC. 4. HUNTING, FISHING, TRAPPING, AND ANIMAL GATHERING.         ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Consent decree.--The term `Consent Decree' means the       final judgment and decree of the United States District Court       for the District of Oregon, in the action entitled       `Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon against       State of Oregon', entered on May 2, 1980.        ``(2) Indian tribe.--The term `Indian Tribe' has the       meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-      Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).        ``(3) Siletz agreement.--The term `Siletz Agreement' means       the agreement entitled `Agreement Among the State of Oregon,       the United States of America and the Confederated Tribes of       the Siletz Indians of Oregon to Permanently Define Tribal       Hunting, Fishing, Trapping, and Gathering Rights of the       Siletz Tribe and its Members' and entered into by the United       States on April 22, 1980.        ``(b) Hunting, Fishing, Trapping, and Animal Gathering       Agreements.--        ``(1) In general.--The Siletz Agreement shall remain in       effect until and unless replaced, amended, or otherwise       modified by 1  [[Page H6750]]       or more successor government-to-government agreements between       the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and the State of       Oregon relating to the hunting, fishing, trapping, and animal       gathering rights of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz       Indians.        ``(2) Amendments.--The Siletz Agreement or any successor       agreement entered into under paragraph (1) may be amended       from time to time by mutual consent of the Confederated       Tribes of Siletz Indians and the State of Oregon.        ``(3) Contents of new agreement or amendments.--The Siletz       Agreement or any successor agreement entered into under       paragraph (1) shall not provide for exclusive or primary       Siletz take opportunity outside the exterior boundaries of       the 1855 Executive Order Siletz Coast Reservation (as       described in section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Siletz Tribe Indian       Restoration Act (Public Law 95-195; 91 Stat. 1418; 130 Stat.       1364)) relative to any other federally recognized Indian       Tribe, and shall not provide for new or expanded take of       fishery resources in the Columbia River or in the Willamette       River from its mouth to the top of Willamette Falls.        ``(c) Judicial Review.--In any action brought in the United       States District Court for the District of Oregon to rescind,       overturn, modify, or provide relief under Federal law from       the Consent Decree, the United States District Court for the       District of Oregon shall review the application of the       parties on the merits without regard to the defense of res       judicata or collateral estoppel.        ``(d) Effect.--Nothing in this section enlarges, confirms,       adjudicates, affects, or modifies any treaty or other right       of an Indian Tribe.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2839, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2839 will amend the Siletz Reservation Act to  provide a process by which the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz  Indians and the State of Oregon may negotiate to amend or replace the  1980 agreement that currently serves as the final determination of the  Tribe's hunting, fishing, trapping, and animal gathering rights.   The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians is a confederation of more  than 27 different Tribes and bands of Indians who, beginning in 1856,  were removed throughout western Oregon and placed on the Siletz Coast  Reservation.   The Siletz Coast Reservation was repeatedly diminished by Federal  action until the Siletz Tribe's Federal recognition was terminated by  an act of Congress in 1954.   In 1977, Congress enacted a bill to restore the Tribe's Federal  recognition. This restoration was not without conditions. The Siletz  Tribe's hunting, fishing, trapping, and animal gathering rights were  limited through an agreement made with the State of Oregon.   This agreement was finalized on May 2, 1980, by the U.S. District  Court for the District of Oregon as a consent decree. The 1980 consent  decree was then incorporated into the Siletz Reservation Act of 1980.   The agreement provided limited allocations for salmon fishing and  deer and elk hunting while otherwise prohibiting Tribal hunting,  fishing, gathering, and trapping, except as authorized under Oregon  State law.   H.R. 2839 would allow the Siletz Tribe in the State of Oregon to  negotiate to amend, replace, or terminate the 1980 consent decree. That  consent decree remains in place until there is mutual agreement for a  new agreement between both the Tribe and the State.   The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon would also be  required to adjudicate any change in the consent decree on the merits  of the case. This prevents the modification from being dismissed by the  court because the matter had already been decided.   Additionally, the legislation includes language preserving all other  hunting and fishing treaty rights held by other treaty Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would amend the Siletz Reservation Act  to allow the State of Oregon and the Siletz Tribe to negotiate to  amend, replace, or terminate the Tribe's 1980s hunting, fishing,  trapping, and animal consent decree.   The current consent decree would remain in place until there is a new  agreement that is mutually decided on, allowing all parties to reach an  agreement before changes are made.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of the legislation for her work on  behalf of her constituents. I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 788) to amend the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013  to allow States to issue fully electronic stamps under that Act, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 788         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Duck Stamp Modernization Act       of 2023''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZING FULLY ELECTRONIC STAMPS.

(b) Contents of Electronic Stamp.--Section 2 of the       Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 (16 U.S.C. 718o)       is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Federal'' and all that       follows through ``that is printed'' and inserting ``Migratory       Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp required under the       Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C.       718a et seq.) that is printed''; and        (2) in paragraph (3)--        (A) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(F) may contain an image of the actual stamp.''.        (c) Stamp Valid Through Close of Hunting Season.--Section 6       of the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 (16 U.S.C.       718s) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1), by striking ``shall, during the effective period of the       electronic stamp--'' and inserting ``shall--''; and        (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``for a period agreed to       by the State and the Secretary, which shall not exceed 45       days'' and inserting ``through the first June 30 that occurs       after the date of issuance of the electronic stamp by the       State''.        (d) Electronic Stamps as Permit.--Section 1(a)(1) of the       Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C.       718a(a)(1)) is amended--        (1) by inserting ``as an electronic stamp (as defined in       section 2 of the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013       (16 U.S.C. 718o)) or'' after ``Conservation Stamp,''; and        (2) by striking ``face of the stamp'' and inserting ``face       of the actual stamp (as defined in that section)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 788, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 788, sponsored by my friend and  fellow Razorback, Senator John Boozman from Arkansas. This bill makes  commonsense improvements to wildlife regulations by modernizing how  waterfowl hunters across the country can purchase a Federal duck stamp.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who  had a companion bill in the House that went through our committee.   The Federal duck stamp was first created when President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act into law  in 1934. The law required waterfowl and other migratory bird hunters,  ages 16 and over, to purchase and possess a valid duck stamp prior to  taking migratory waterfowl.   Current law requires hunters to physically possess a signed duck  stamp while hunting for any migratory waterfowl. Even in States where  electronic licensing is used, a signed physical duck stamp is required.   Mr. Speaker, on my mobile phone, I have the Arkansas Game and Fish  Commission hunting app. Right here, front and center, I have my Federal  duck stamp electronically. Technically, I would be breaking the law if  a game warden approached me when I was hunting and this is all that I  had. I still have to carry my little duck stamps in my pocket that are  signed, both the State and Federal duck stamps.   This bill would modernize that program so that these electronic duck  stamps would suffice if you were approached by a game warden.   S. 788 modernizes the program by removing the 45-day requirement to  have a physical duck stamp and allowing States the option to sell  electronic duck stamps for the entirety of the hunting season.   Under this bill, purchasers would still receive the physical stamp at  the end of their State waterfowl season, therefore preserving the long  legacy of the Federal duck stamp for generations to come.   This is a good governance approach that will continue the unmatched  American tradition of wildlife conservation through sportsmen  participation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Garret Graves of Louisiana for his  tireless work on this issue. He sponsored the House companion to S.  788. After today, this legislation is one step closer to becoming law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  the great State of Louisiana (Mr. Graves), where I understand that if  you can't get to a hunt in Arkansas, it is not a bad place to go as a  consolation.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear that the gentleman  from Louisiana, even though he looks like a duck commander, he is not a  duck commander, but he does enjoy the outdoors.   The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, which is based on  a user pays system through the purchase of items like the Federal duck  stamp, is the envy of the world. In total, fees paid by the sportsmen  communities contribute over $1 billion in revenue annually that goes  toward wildlife conservation, which is truly a remarkable achievement.   S. 788 is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that underpins the Northern  American model by giving hunters certainty and modernizing the Federal  duck stamp process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
