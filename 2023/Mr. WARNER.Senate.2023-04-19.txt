 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the  retirement of Alan Kohler.   Alan leaves the FBI as Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence  Division, a challenging post he has held since 2020. Over his long and  impressive career with the FBI, Alan has continuously worked on our  most pressing national security issues. It is a career that has truly  lived up to the FBI's  [[Page S1248]]  motto of ``Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity.''   As part of its history, the Senate Intelligence Committee has worked  to ensure the intelligence community works seamlessly across its many  Agencies and with our allies to protect Americans. That is a goal Alan  Kohler committed his life's work to, whether he was serving overseas as  legal attache in the United Kingdom to coordinate efforts with our  closest ally or developing new means of integrating and cooperating  across Agencies like the Counterintelligence Task Force he established  during his time as Assistant Director, his accomplishments have  inspired junior agents and personnel to break through Agency stovepipes  in defense of our Nation.   Alan's faithful service to the Bureau spanned three decades, through  some of our Nation's darkest days. He joined the FBI in 1996 and was  assigned to work counterintelligence cases in the Washington field  office, right in the wake of and in the midst of some of the most  damaging espionage cases the U.S. has faced. In the days after the  attacks on September 11, Alan bravely served on the evidence recovery  team at the Pentagon in Arlington, VA.   After transferring to the New York field office in 2006, Alan Kohler  worked cases that led to the arrest of 10 Russian illegals in 2010,  earning the Attorney General Award for Exceptional Service and changing  the way Americans understood the intelligence activities of our  adversaries. He was also fortunate enough to be assigned as assistant  special agent in charge of the Norfolk field office where he was  responsible for all of the FBI's counterintelligence, counterterrorism,  and crisis management programs for that community.   In 2017, after Russia's unprecedented interference in our elections,  Alan established the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, an entity we  on the Senate Intelligence Committee continue to rely on to collect on  and report threats to the very foundation of our democracy.   As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I have relied on Alan's  integrity to provide the committee with honest and timely information,  even when it was not easy for him to do. He consistently demonstrated  professionalism in all our engagements and modeled a constructive  relationship between the executive and legislative branches. It was a  professionalism born of his commitment to safeguard our Nation. I am  certain Alan will find ways to continue to serve as he enjoys his very  well-earned retirement. I would also like to recognize his family who  has supported him throughout his tremendous career.                            ____________________
