 Mr. Speaker, as we were home over the Christmas  holiday break, so many calls that came into my office dealt with the  ObamaCare issue--the rise in premiums, the lack of affordability.   Here is one example. A 64-year-old man, his premiums $30,000,  deductible $12,000--indeed, too expensive to afford and too expensive  to use.   But we do have a plan for repealing and replacing. You will find it  at A Better Way. This will help lift the financial burden from many  Americans  [[Page H248]]  who are currently facing high costs due to ObamaCare. Our plan allows  patients greater access to affordable care and affordable insurance.   Our next step includes my legislation, H.R. 314. It is the Health  Care Choice Act of 2017. What it will do is allow greater access, more  choice, and more options by allowing across-State-line purchasing of  health insurance. You find the plan that is most suited to you and your  family at a price that you can afford.   It is time for us to repeal and replace with good patient-centered  options.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 288) to ensure that small business providers of broadband  Internet access service can devote resources to broadband deployment  rather than compliance with cumbersome regulatory requirements.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 288         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Broadband       Deployment Act''.       SEC. 2. EXCEPTION TO ENHANCEMENT TO TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS                     FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.         (a) In General.--The enhancements to the transparency rule       of the Federal Communications Commission under section 8.3 of       title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as described in       paragraphs 162 through 184 of the Report and Order on Remand,       Declaratory Ruling, and Order of the Federal Communications       Commission with regard to protecting and promoting the open       Internet (adopted February 26, 2015) (FCC 15-24), shall not       apply to any small business.        (b) Sunset.--Subsection (a) shall not have any force or       effect after the date that is 5 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (c) Report by FCC.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report       that contains the recommendations of the Commission (and data       supporting such recommendations) regarding--        (1) whether the exception provided by subsection (a) should       be made permanent; and        (2) whether the definition of the term ``small business''       for purposes of such exception should be modified from the       definition in subsection (d)(2).        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Broadband internet access service.--The term       ``broadband Internet access service'' has the meaning given       such term in section 8.2 of title 47, Code of Federal       Regulations.        (2) Small business.--The term ``small business'' means any       provider of broadband Internet access service that has not       more than 250,000 subscribers.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 288, the Small Business  Broadband Deployment Act. I am glad that the House is taking swift  action on this bill, which would protect small Internet service  providers from the enhanced disclosure requirements laid out in the  2015 Open Internet Order.   After adopting the Open Internet Order, the FCC recognized the  importance of exempting small ISPs from these enhanced transparency  rules and subsequently granted a temporary exemption to broadband  providers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. However, the Commission  failed to reach an agreement to grant another exemption before the  deadline last December and, as a result, has left hundreds of our  Nation's small providers vulnerable to cumbersome rules.   FCC Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly have taken action, since the  exemption expired, to reassure our small broadband providers that the  rules will not be enforced until the situation has been addressed by  the Commission, but Congress should go a step further and provide  certainty to our Nation's small businesses and pass this bill.   Rather than a 1-year exemption to the enhanced disclosure  requirements, this bill would exempt for 5 years broadband providers  with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from the enhanced reporting  obligations, providing them with the regulatory certainty to invest in  their business.   At our hearing last January, we heard from multiple witnesses just  how cumbersome and burdensome these rules are. One witness described  the difference to be as significant as the need to hire regulatory  counsel versus the ability to build another tower to provide service.  For a small business in a capital-intensive industry, that could be the  difference between getting more people connected to the Internet and  going out of business.   We cannot let our small businesses and hardworking taxpayers be  saddled  [[Page H269]]  with more onerous rules and the costs that they bring. In addition to  regulatory relief for small ISPs, the bill adds certainty for our  Nation's small ISPs by extending the exemption for 5 years.   It was disappointing to see the Commission fail to reach an agreement  at the end of last year to extend the exemption, and it is why we are  here today. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress and  President Obama's Small Business Administration, negotiations fell  short, and our Nation's smallest and most competitive Internet service  providers were left to bear the burden.   In today's 21st century economy, we need to do more to encourage  connectivity, and this bill embodies that spirit. Congress is poised to  provide the regulatory certainty small businesses are seeking in order  to invest in stronger networks and foster a better consumer experience.   I want to thank Chairman Walden and Mr. Loebsack for acting quickly  to reintroduce this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support the commonsense measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the author of this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a new member of our committee, the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I will just encourage my colleagues to  join us in passing H.R. 288.   As my colleague from California said, this is one of those  commonsense measures. When you talk about removing the burden of  regulatory overreach from our Nation's small business, and in this  case, our small Internet service providers, this is something that will  help get that job done. It is also something that will help extend  Internet service to more Americans, and that is a goal that we all  share.   So at this time, in closing, I encourage passage of H.R. 288.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
