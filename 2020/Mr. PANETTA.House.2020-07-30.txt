 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7617 and my  amendment for funding the Education for Homeless Children and Youth  Program.   This funding is necessary because homelessness affects students all  across our Nation, including in my district on the central coast of  California.   In Monterey County, nearly 10,000 students meet the formal definition  of homelessness. More specifically, in Salinas, over 3,500 students are  homeless. That is 40 percent of the school district.   We can and we must do better. And we can start with this bill and my  amendment that identifies homeless youth, funds local liaisons, ensures  support services, and coordinates with the community to meet the basic  needs of our children.   Let's pass this bill with my amendment so that we can give homeless  students greater support for a more promising future.
