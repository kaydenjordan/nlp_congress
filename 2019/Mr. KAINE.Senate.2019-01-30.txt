 Mr. President, today I introduced the End Shutdowns Act.  Enacting this bill would go a long way towards avoiding the pain and  suffering caused to families from government shutdowns, such as the  recent 35 day partial shutdown.   I have been outspoken against President Trump's use of a government  shutdown as a negotiating tactic, and--in an effort to take away that  option in the future--this bill would initiate an automatic continuing  resolution on October 1 if no appropriations bill is passed by that  date. The legislation would then stop the Senate from moving forward  with any other legislation, outside of an emergency scenario, until  Congress reached an agreement on a long-term spending deal.   I am advocating for my colleagues to consider supporting this bill,  especially those negotiating on the current spending bills set to  expire February 15, to include legislation to prevent future shutdowns  in any bipartisan deal reached by that deadline.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I introduced the End Shutdowns Act.
