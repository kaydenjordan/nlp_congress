 Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment will ensure that from the date a firearm purchase is  legally authorized under the bill, the firearm purchaser has 25  calendar days to pick up their gun, regardless of how much time has  elapsed since the background check was first initiated.   This would prevent a situation under the bill as it is written that,  although rare, would still be possible, where the maximum allowable  number of business days, 20 business days, that a purchaser would have  to wait for an approval could actually run longer, hypothetically, than  the 30 days.   That would be problematic because under a current ATF, Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulation, a gun cannot be  transferred after 30 days once a background check begins.   Where more than 30 calendar days have passed since the licensee first  contacted NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System,  the licensee must initiate a new NICS check prior to transferring the  firearm. My amendment would prevent an unnecessary background check do- over.   For those who get approved by the FBI after 3 business days, my  amendment would essentially nullify the 30  [[Page H2289]]  days ATF regulation, allowing prospective firearm owners the peace of  mind that they do deserve.   After this bill went through the Judiciary Committee, the point was  raised that an existing ATF regulation, if left unchanged, could result  in a situation where even after a background check was approved or a  petition process was followed, the lawful gun buyer would still not be  able to get the gun without doing a second background check because too  much time had elapsed since the first background check began.   This is clearly not the intent of the bill, and while I believe that  ATF would amend the regulation if this bill is passed, this amendment  removes all doubt. Anyone who is legally authorized to obtain a firearm  under the new process will have ample time, 25 days, to return to the  dealer and retrieve the gun.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I would just again emphasize that  this is 25 days after the approval, and also that law supersedes  regulation. There is no question that that 25 days would be in place  and that would give more than a sufficient amount of time, in fact, a  lenient amount of time, just to ensure that there aren't any problems  here.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the chairman, to speak in favor of this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the chairman, and just as a couple  of other points, on a personal level, I have always been a supporter of  Second Amendment rights and continue to be. The purpose of this  amendment is to, obviously, do so, support Second Amendment rights.                                time  1045    Secondly, I know that there is language in another part of the bill  that many people have asked me about which is not something that I am  amending or had to do with, but I know that there is a commitment from  leadership that that language is going to be completely redone and that  language will be totally appropriate and actually will be a major  improvement.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my  time.    Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to raise  awareness for Children's Dental Health Month.   Madam Speaker, I rise today because tooth decay is the number one  chronic infectious disease among children in the United States, and the  impact of untreated tooth decay goes far beyond oral health.   Having been a dentist for over 30 years, this issue is something that  I have witnessed firsthand, and it is something I have great concern  for. This is why the American Dental Association has dedicated February  as National Children's Dental Health Month. This annual celebration  allows dentists and volunteers to spread awareness and prevention tips  that help parents, teachers, and others.   Attitudes and habits established at an early age are critical in  maintaining good oral health and oral health that lasts throughout  life. Ensuring that children and adults get quality and accessible oral  health care should remain a priority for everyone throughout the year.   Remember, if you ignore your teeth, they will go away.                            ____________________
