 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of Bailey  Schweitzer.   Bailey was a kid at heart who loved playing around at her father's  speedway racetrack in Bakersfield, California.   Bailey was at the Route 91 Harvest festival on October 1 in Las  Vegas, attending the concert with her mother and other friends. She had  a smile that could light up the room and was capable of making everyone  laugh.   Bailey was a natural born leader and an amazing aunt to her brother  Dakota's two kids. Bailey is remembered as being a master at being  friends to everyday people and to everyone she met.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my condolences to Bailey Schweitzer's family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi) for organizing this hour to discuss a humanitarian issue  that we are confronted with right now here in the United States of  America. I thank him for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I just came back from the border this morning, and I am  heartbroken. I am emotionally drained, and I am saddened for this  country, the United States of America. Who would have ever thought, in  the greatest, most powerful, richest country in the world, that we  would be tearing kids apart from their mother and their father and  putting them in cages?                                time  2000    That is not the America that I know. I came to this country when I  was 8 years old. I crossed that same border that I visited. My parents  came here in pursuit of the American Dream. They came here because they  knew if they worked hard and sacrificed that they would have a shot at  the American Dream.   That is all these kids and these families want, and just being there  at the border and looking at those mothers straight in the eyes and  them looking back at you with watery eyes, asking for help, this is not  a Republican or Democrat issue. This is a humanitarian issue. This is  about the future of America. This is about humanity. This is about  kids. And it hurts me to see that in the United States of America we  are putting these same kids in cages.   We made a call to the President to rescind this zero tolerance policy  because we want to keep these families together. These are not  criminals. These are innocent families who are leaving persecution, who  are trying to achieve a better life for their kids.   Any family, any parent in the country or anywhere else seeking a  better life for their kids would do everything and anything to pursue a  better life for their kids.   So I am disappointed in our President. I am disappointed in my  colleagues who refuse to speak up when we are seeing these images on TV  of children in cages being treated like animals. That is not the  America that I know. That is not the America that gave me and my family  an opportunity to succeed.   So, Mr. Speaker, I got emotional yesterday being there at the border  and remembering very vividly those moments when my family crossed the  border. I remember it as if it was just yesterday. And I couldn't help  but think that if somebody were to take me away from my father and  mother at that precise moment, what would I do? Who would I trust?  Where would I go? I couldn't even speak a word of English. I was 8  years old. I needed that love and those hugs from my mother and my  father.   So today I came back and I made a promise that I would fight for  these  [[Page H5278]]  families, that I would fight for these kids, that I would fight for the  future of America; the principles and the values that make this country  strong. That is the reason why I ran for office in the first place.  That is the reason why we are serving in office in the first place.   So I am here to call on the President to rescind the zero tolerance  policy that is cruel, inhumane, and un-American.    I will.
