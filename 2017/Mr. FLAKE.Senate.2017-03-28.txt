Mr. President, border security is one of the Federal  Government's most important responsibilities, and the Federal  Government has no better partners than local law enforcement agencies  from border communities like those in my home State of Arizona. These  officers and deputies serve on the front lines. They provide critical  assistance to the missions of Federal agencies.   Unfortunately, these efforts are expensive and the locals end up  picking up most of the tab. For example, local law enforcement agencies  hold those facing immigration violations at county-operated jails, and  they provide medical care for the undocumented inmates while they are  in custody. In providing these services, Arizona's counties have  incurred more than $310 million in costs associated with criminal  undocumented immigrants since 2009. That is $310 million since 2009.   Despite these enormous costs, the Federal Government has left many  local jurisdictions to shoulder the burdens of illegal immigration on  their own. This is particularly frustrating when so many of our local  law enforcement agencies are already struggling to carry out basic  duties on overstretched budgets.   I hope we can all look forward to a time when we have the appropriate  resources for securing the border, the means for those seeking to fill  the needs of our economy to enter the country legally, a remedy for  those who are here already illegally, and also a way for employers to  ensure that those whom they hire are legally present.   These critical steps toward solving our immigration problems will  require Congress to act. However, in the meantime, we can't continue to  allow the Federal Government to pass off immigration responsibilities  onto cash-strapped local agencies.   That is why I wish today to introduce a bill to reauthorize and  reform the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, better known as  SCAAP. This bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague, John  McCain, and is supported by the Arizona Sheriffs Association.   SCAAP is a Federal program that reimburses State, local, and Tribal  law enforcement for the costs associated with incarcerating and caring  for criminal undocumented immigrants while in custody.   To ensure that local law enforcement receives sufficient  reimbursement under SCAAP, my bill would make some commonsense reforms  under the program. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality  Act to reauthorize SCAAP through fiscal year 2021. Reauthorizing this  program will provide local law enforcement agencies in Arizona and  across the country with the certainty that any costs incurred from  incarcerating criminal immigrants will be covered by Federal  reimbursements.   Our State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies are committed  to partnering with the Federal Government on immigration enforcement.  But that partnership can't succeed unless the Federal Government  provides the necessary reimbursements for those services.   As Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels said:         Arizona's counties continue to struggle under the fiscal       strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from       the State of Arizona. Housing criminal aliens without federal       assistance diverts needed resources away from our       communities' public safety priorities.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the  Arizona Sheriffs Association in support of my bill to reauthorize SCAAP  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Arizona Sheriffs Association,                                                     March 15, 2017.      Re State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP)           Reauthorization.       Hon. Jeff Flake,      U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Flake: On behalf of a majority of the Arizona       Sheriffs Association, I would like to express support for       Congress's proposed reauthorization of the State Criminal       Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).        County sheriffs maintain the shared responsibility of       enforcing Arizona's criminal laws. We also serve as the       keeper of Arizona's county jails, including paying for the       cost of medical care for inmates. While the federal       government continues to address the problem of illegal       immigration, Arizona's jails incarcerate undocumented       immigrants who have committed state and local violations,       incurring significant costs in custody and care of these       inmates, including medical costs. SCAAP provides critical       dollars to Arizona's counties that help pay for the cost of       housing and caring for these inmates while they are in our       custody.        Arizona's counties continue to struggle under the fiscal       strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from       the State of Arizona. Housing criminal aliens without federal       assistance diverts needed resources away from our       communities' public safety priorities. We understand that       federal dollars cannot fully supplant state costs for these  [[Page S2051]]       inmates. However, any financial assistance the federal       government can appropriate to help pay for the costs of       caring for these inmates will allow Arizona's sheriffs to       concentrate on other important priorities, such as drug       interdiction and search and rescue.        Since 2009, Arizona's counties have absorbed more than $310       million in costs. A SCAAP reauthorization that includes       reimbursement for medical costs would provide vital financial       resources to Arizona's sheriffs, allowing us to better serve       the public safety needs of our counties.        That's why on behalf of Arizona's county sheriffs, I write       to express support for the reauthorization of the State       Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). We encourage       Congress to pass the measure and for President Trump to sign       it if it reaches his desk.            Sincerely,                                                   Mark Dannels,                                             Cochise County Sheriff,                           President, Arizona Sheriffs Association.     Mr. President, the SCAAP program is the foundation of the  immigration partnership between local law enforcement and the Federal  Government for keeping our communities safe. I urge all of my  colleagues to support this legislation to reauthorize and reform the  SCAAP program.                            ____________________     Mr. President, border security is one of the Federal  Government's most important responsibilities, and the Federal  Government has no better partners than local law enforcement agencies  from border communities like those in my home State of Arizona.
