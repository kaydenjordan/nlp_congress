 Mr. Speaker, Americans see firsthand  Biden inflation at every turn and nowhere more than gas costs. The  Biden failed policies are obvious at every gas station with prices up  $1.50 per gallon over last year, an additional $20 per fill-up.   The $3.5 trillion Biden inflation spending bill would make it more  expensive to heat homes, drive cars, operate trucks, and keep the  lights on. The Biden tax increase on natural gas alone would raise  heating bills and destroy 90,000 jobs.   The Energy Information Administration forecasts home heating costs  this winter: Propane up 54 percent, heating oil up 43 percent, natural  gas up 30 percent. The Democrat elite think they are smarter than  anyone, and they believe Democrat voters are ignorant to believe that  $3.5 trillion in spending costs zero.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism which now  continues, sadly, from Afghanistan to America, as Biden ignored  military advice, leading to 13 murdered marines.                            ____________________
