 Mr. Speaker, today, I remind my colleagues of a  President who reminded us of the shining city on a Hill. I remind our  colleagues of a President who led us to a kinder and gentler society.  So I am stunned to hear the President speak of claiming to be asking  for the government to be shut down.   This is a season where many in our Nation draw together with families  and worship and celebrate. It is a very honored time. People of the  Christian faith are engaged in the recognition and acknowledgment of  the birth of baby Jesus. It is a holy time. It is a time when families  need resources. Government workers need to ensure that their families  are provided for, but also we must ensure that our government is  provided for. I thank the Speaker-elect and the Democratic leader in  the Senate, the other body, for recognizing that we do not want a  shutdown.   To those who speak of the necessity of a wall, let me speak as a  Representative of a border State who has been to the border so many  times, I cannot count. I count those on the border, among many of the  States, as friends, having been to every border State. I will say to  the American people: There is no foreign war or attack at the southern  border.   We have a northern border as well, and I have been there. There is no  wall there.   The only thing that is at the southern border are mothers and  children living in desperate, devastating, and disgusting conditions,  and unaccompanied children fleeing from the decapitation of their  brothers or fathers, fleeing politically because they disagree with the  viciousness of cartels and refuse to accept their membership.   That is where America's best angels come in, when we rise to the  higher occasion of giving refuge and opportunity to those who are  fleeing political persecution. Here is how we do it. We process asylum  seekers. We do not undermine their process. They are fleeing for their  lives.   To juxtapose a stagnant wall to the lives of those fleeing political  persecution is untenable. It is crucial that we design a comprehensive  immigration reform policy. It is crucial that the acknowledgment that  barriers of certain kinds--technology and personnel--can be a  successful formula to ensure the safety and security of the American  people. But at the same time, I insist that we regulate or bring into  regular order Dreamers, who are firefighters, soldiers, lawyers,  doctors, and family members throughout the Nation. Where is the call  for that?   It is important that we remain a nation that people flee to because  of the wonderful values of democracy, the underpinnings of the dignity  of all people. It is sad at this time that we have not come to that  conclusion in a bipartisan manner.   So I extend the olive branch. What are we doing for the Dreamers? Why  is it not reasonable to construct a funding process or scheme or  formula that ensures that kind of bipartisanship and security?   Let me also encourage my colleagues to join me in working in a  bipartisan way to pass the Violence Against Women Act. We are reaching  out. It is a crucial initiative. Right now, there are family members  dying at the hands of domestic violence.   There are law enforcement officers, including my own chief, who asked  me about the funding of the STOP grants that are utilized for  organizations that will protect these families subjected to violence,  such as Native Americans, with healthcare for VAWA victims and ensuring  that the person who has already been convicted of abuse does not have  random access to a weapon, which is the weapon of choice that kills a  family member.   Finally, let me say I hope that we can bring, Mr. Speaker, conclusion  to a sentencing and prison reform bill that I have worked very hard on.   Why not give a gift to the American people--not a shutdown, but a  bipartisan step, one by one, to make America an even greater country  than it already is                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last year, in Hurricane Harvey, many in  my community became food insecure. I cannot tell you how important  maintaining the current SNAP benefits are.   I thank the chairman from Texas and my good friend, to-be chairman  from Minnesota, for their coming together.   The importance of funding going to my land grant colleges is enormous  in training new farmers.   The work that is being added--as a member of the Homeland Security  Committee--on adding broadband in the rural communities is something  that is so dearly needed and has been promised for many, many years.   The fact that we are expanding access to FSA farm loans for veterans,  but, more importantly, for beginning farmers, creates a new pathway for  those who are providing for us as the breadbasket of the world.   And then, in the rural areas of my district, rural economic  development is crucial, and the rural development funds are vital. So  many things have been able to occur because of this funding.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill because this is a perfect  coming together. As former Congresswoman Shirley Chisolm said: A tree  grows in Brooklyn. It is a good coming together of urban and rural  supporting a dynamic bill and providing so that Americans are not food  insecure and our children have the nutrition that they need.   Let us vote for this bill.
