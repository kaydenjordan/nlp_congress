 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the recent 1-year  anniversary of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act  becoming law.   Dr. Lorna Breen was an emergency physician who tragically died by  suicide after enduring the trauma and burnout of the COVID-19 front  lines in New York City. She was, to put it simply, a hero. She is one  of the countless healthcare heroes who face mental health crises and a  suicide rate twice that of the public due to their demanding, all- consuming work.   The Dr. Lorna Breen law carries on her legacy, investing in support  for healthcare workers' mental health needs.   I pushed hard to pass this bill, and now I am pushing for its grant  programs to receive full funding through fiscal year 2024 because the  heroes who take care of us deserve to be taken care of, too.   Our work to bring mental health out of the shadows is far from over.  That work means meeting the mental health crisis among health  professionals with the resources it demands. It means fully funding the  programs within the Dr. Lorna Breen law.    Thank you to the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation for your  continued leadership in shedding light on this crisis. I remain by your  side in honor of Dr. Breen and all healthcare heroes whose mental  health devastatingly went unmet.                            ____________________
