 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  State Senator Sheila McNeill, who is retiring after many excellent  years in service to the city of Brunswick and to the State of Georgia.   Senator McNeill is a longtime supporter of our country's Armed  Forces, having served for 2 years educating citizens and elected  officials on the importance of seapower as the first woman to ever lead  the Navy League, but her support for America's sailors didn't stop  there.   In 1996, Senator McNeill played a key role in establishing St. Mary's  Submarine Museum, the largest museum of its kind in the South.   During her tenure as a State senator, Sheila sponsored legislation to  fight Georgia's human trafficking crisis and the pernicious effects of  homelessness and sponsored countless bills to improve our State's  educational infrastructure.   Sheila will be retiring at the end of her term this year to support  her husband of over six decades. We thank her for everything she has  done for our Armed Forces, for students, and for the many Georgians she  has served over the years.   Her career has been a long and impressive one, and we were so lucky  to have such a talented woman fighting for such important causes.                          Recognizing Ian Gallagher     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  bravery of Ian Gallagher, a Rincon police officer who stepped up when  help was needed most.   On a bright morning this June, the city of Rincon was hosting their  annual Let Freedom Ring Parade, which I was proud to be a part of. A  crowd of hundreds of people was gathered along either side of the  parade route to watch the spectacle.   Around this time, Officer Gallagher heard calls over the radio that  the roadblock, which had been set up, had been breached by an  erratically driving car. He looked and saw an SUV speeding down the  route, only just missing onlookers, including myself.   Shouting to those along the road to back up to safety, knowing that  he must do something to stop the driver, he kept his patrol car behind  a fire truck. Just before the suspect's car passed him, he pulled out  directly into its path, stopping the driver in a head-on collision. His  act of selfless bravery and split-second heroism undoubtedly saved many  lives that day.   While this head-on collision was dangerous and surely jarring, both  Officer Gallagher and his canine officer, who was with him at the time  of the incident, are on their way to a full recovery.   He has recently been awarded the Medal of Valor, the Nation's highest  award of valor for a public safety official.   I, alongside the people of the First Congressional District of  Georgia, thank him for his service and his selflessness.                       Honoring Ron and Sandra Elliott     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Ron and  Sandra Elliott, owners of Game Changers Running Company.   Since the store's founding in 2012, Game Changers has been so much  more than just a place to get your running shoes. Under the leadership  of Ron and Sandra Elliott, Game Changers has been committed to the  health and fitness of Georgia's coastal region.  [[Page H7974]]    As a physical therapist-owned establishment, Game Changers  understands the importance of community health and wellness. They have  heavily invested in their community through various educational  programs and running clinics, as well as financial contributions to  local charities.   Since their doors first opened, Game Changers has been able to donate  over $250,000 to local organizations to help transform coastal  Georgia's mindset about running and physical well-being.   Ron and Sandra's service to their community and their country began  long before Game Changers opened its doors, having both served in the  military.   Ron and Sandra, thank you for what you have done for our community  through Game Changers. You have more than earned a relaxing and restful  retirement.                      Recognizing and Honoring Don Hogan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor my good friend, Don Hogan, as he retires from public service.   Don graduated from Georgia Southern University and then attended the  University of Georgia, graduating with a master's degree in education.  He committed himself to a career in the rehabilitation field, where he  specialized in mental health, substance abuse, and developmental  disabilities.   In Brunswick and St. Simons, he has been known as a leader in civic  involvement and community service. During his 2-year term on the Glynn  County Board of Commissioners, he served as both vice chairman and  chairman.    Most recently, he has served in the Georgia State House of  Representatives, representing the 179th District.   Additionally, his philanthropic passions have impacted his community  in ways that will be felt for years. He has served as area commissioner  for Boy Scouts of America, as well as on the advisory council of the  Coastal Area Planning and Development Commission, Goodwill Industries,  and Glynn County School's special instruction.   The sacrifice that every public servant makes, alongside their  family, is admirable and has no small impact on their life. I am very  grateful for the inspirational leadership and servitude Don has  displayed throughout his life.   I, on behalf of the great people in the First Congressional District  of Georgia, take this moment to honor Representative Don Hogan and his  legacy.                            ____________________
