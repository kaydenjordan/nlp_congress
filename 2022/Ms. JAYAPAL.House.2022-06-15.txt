 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Preston  Phillips.   Dr. Phillips was a gracious and loving husband, father, and brother  who dedicated his life to his family, his community, and to saving  lives.   Earlier this month, Dr. Phillips was murdered during a tragic mass  shooting at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by a shooter who purchased  an AR-15 2 hours before the shooting and a handgun less than 2 days  before the shooting.   Nothing we say can bring back a devoted father who did so much to  save the lives of others as a doctor. Nothing will ease the pain of his  wife and his three children who have to bury him far too soon. My heart  goes out to all the families of the four people killed and the  community in Tulsa that still grieves.   This tragedy has also struck close to home for me. Dr. Phillips was  the father of Elise Phillips, a valued member of my staff here in D.C.,  a member of our House of Representatives family who has spent the last  year tirelessly serving the people of Washington's Seventh  Congressional District as my legislative counsel. I, and our whole  office, grieve with Elise and her family.   This past weekend, I was honored to attend Dr. Phillips' funeral  service in Tulsa at the invitation of the family. It was immediately  clear to me what an exceptional community Dr. Phillips and his strong  and courageous wife, Melody, have built around themselves over their  life together. Everyone I met described Dr. Phillips as a man of  extraordinary warmth, brilliance, and compassion.   Dr. Phillips came from humble beginnings, and his life is a testament  to what can be achieved with determination. He got his first job at the  age of 8 shining shoes and gathering shopping carts. He used this money  to pay for veterinary bills for his family's dog, Blackie.   In high school, he discovered his love for medicine and focused on  his studies with great dedication. Dr. Phillips was then granted  admission to Emory University where he graduated with bachelor's  degrees in religion and chemistry and a master's degree in organic  chemistry.   He continued his education at Harvard Medical School and then  completed his residency at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr.  Phillips began his formal medical career in my home district of Seattle  in 1997, and he practiced there for 8 years before moving to Tulsa,  Oklahoma.    As the Representative for Seattle's Seventh Congressional District, I  want to convey how proud we are of Dr. Phillips and his significant  contributions to our community.   During his career, Dr. Phillips emphasized giving back to community.  At Yale, he founded the Yale Minority Medical Association, which  focused on recruitment, mentorship, and retention of minority students  in the medical field.   His generosity was boundless, and he touched countless lives here and  abroad. A prime example were his annual trips to Togo in Africa to  perform pro bono surgeries for underserved communities and where a  clinic operating room still bears his name.   For many of his patients, Dr. Phillips was not just a medical  professional. He was family. Throughout his decades of orthopedic  practice, his patients became informal grandparents, aunts, uncles, and  lifelong friends for him and his three children, whose childhoods were  defined by these relationships. I am so honored to have met so many of  these people at the funeral service.   Even more so, his son and two daughters were defined by living in a  household where love, warmth, and patience were the norm from Dr.  Phillips and his wife, Melody.   I, and all those I represent, have benefited from their love and  warmth both during his time practicing medicine in Seattle and through  his brilliant daughter, Elise.   I am incredibly grateful to have Elise as part of my D.C. staff, and  I see in her the same virtues that made her father such a respected and  loved man in his community.   Those at Dr. Phillips' service asked me to ensure that Congress  passes sensible gun reforms to honor Dr. Phillips and to do all we can  to ensure that tragedies like this never happen again.   Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Protecting our  Kids Act, a lifesaving package of gun safety legislation to raise the  age of purchase for assault rifles to 21, control the sale of ghost  guns, limit the number of rounds in a magazine, and require the safe  storage of firearms.   Legislation won't bring Dr. Phillips back or the thousands of gun  violence victims back, but I hope that it brings a degree of comfort to  Dr. Phillips' family and to all the families of the ones we lost that  we, in Congress, will not stop until we bring an end to the gun  violence crisis that has plagued our country for far too long.   Rest in power. Rest in peace, Dr. Preston J. Phillips.                            ____________________
