 Madam Speaker, in large cities across America, violent  crime rates are skyrocketing. At the same time, many of our Democrat  colleagues are leading dangerous calls to defund the police and take  cops off the streets.   I can't believe this needs to be said, but demonizing law enforcement  will not make our streets safer. This kind of rhetoric makes it more  difficult for police officers to do their jobs and harder for local  departments to attract new officers.   Just look at the cities which are experiencing the largest spikes in  violent crime. Homicides are up 533 percent in Portland, 58 percent in  Atlanta, 37 percent in Philadelphia, and 22 percent in Los Angeles.  Each of these cities has embraced the same antipolice rhetoric that we  have heard from Democrats in this very Chamber. Now, in a bizarre twist  of logic, Democrats are trying to shift the blame to Republicans.   The only way to solve this problem is to reestablish respect for law  enforcement and make sure they have the support and resources needed to  protect themselves and our communities.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and co-Pennsylvanian  for yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question so that  we can amend the rule to immediately consider H.R. 751, the Protecting  American Energy Production Act, which would prevent the Biden  administration from unilaterally imposing a moratorium on hydraulic  fracturing.   Pennsylvania is home to some of the most abundant energy and natural  gas resources in the Nation, and our economy is proof of all the  benefits that come with it. On any given day, up to 10 percent of the  Nation's dry natural gas comes out of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District.   Energy producers have been critical partners in central and  northeastern Pennsylvania, investing in local communities, colleges,  generating countless job opportunities, and preparing the next  generation of workers for in-demand careers.   However, President Biden has made it clear that he is no friend of  American energy or the workers employed by this industry. He has  canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, rejoined the disastrous Paris  climate accords, and banned all new oil and gas leases on Federal  lands.   Meanwhile, the President lifted sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2  pipeline, thereby prioritizing Russian energy over domestic American  energy.   Overregulation, Federal mandates, and policies that will kill  American energy production ignore facts and, instead, increase energy  costs and weaken our national security.   These energy-killing policies are paving the way for the Green New  Deal. Democrats like to sell this package as a greener America when, in  reality, it makes our Nation more dependent on foreign nations for our  growing energy needs; I might add, foreign nations that don't protect  the environment and develop this energy as safely as we do here in the  United States.   These energy needs, what we do in the United States, would sustain  good-paying jobs, create prosperity for future generations, and secure  American interests around the globe. We must invest in critical  infrastructure like pipelines and refineries, and promote a regulatory  environment that cultivates innovation in the energy sector.   We must reject policies that place higher premiums on appeasing the  Democrats' Green New Deal ambitions than protecting the future of  America's energy sector and the thousands of American workers it  employs.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that  the House can immediately consider this important legislation.
