 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just came from speaking with several  Americans about how TrumpCare would affect them. Universally, these  folks were scared. They are worried their costs will go up. They are  worried their benefits will go down. One of the concerns that came up,  an issue that is on the minds of many Americans, was the high cost of  drug prices.   During the campaign, the President talked the talk on drug prices. As  President-elect, he said in December he would ``bring down drug  prices.'' In January, he said pharmaceutical companies were ``getting  away with murder.'' He repeated the refrain in his joint address to  Congress last week. ``We should,'' he said, ``work to bring down the  artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.''  Immediately.   Well, the immediate is here. TrumpCare, the repeal and replacement of  the ACA, has been introduced. TrumpCare does absolutely nothing to  address the high cost of drugs. In fact, drug prices might start going  up faster. Once again, the President is talking the talk, talking like  a populist, but not walking the walk, not helping average Americans. He  is helping the wealthy, special interests but not the average folks he  was talking to during the campaign.   The President met with a couple of Congressmen yesterday and talked  about drug prices. Why not put something in TrumpCare? Why not let them  negotiate, bring down costs? Instead, TrumpCare does the opposite.  TrumpCare eliminates a current requirement that insurers actually give  patients the value of the health insurance they are paying for. Under  the ACA, insurers had to pay at least 60 percent of the cost of care  provided--for some plans, more. That requirement would be gone. So  that, again, hurts average folks.   That provision in TrumpCare is a blank check to insurers to cover  less and charge more out-of-pocket for a whole host of services. Most  experts agree that insurers could charge much more for its prescription  drugs or even rationed care.   TrumpCare takes the shackles off the insurance companies and lets  them decide how or if they are going to cover your prescription drug  costs. Letting the insurance companies decide what to charge and cover  has never been, and never will be, a recipe to bring down prices. So on  drugs as well as other issues, TrumpCare: higher costs, less care.   What is particularly galling, of course, is the fact that the  President talks about reducing the cost of drug prices and negotiating  but does nothing.   He said he would do it immediately. The immediate is here. TrumpCare  is here. TrumpCare makes it very likely that the cost of drugs could go  up for average Americans. It is just another example of this President  doing one thing but saying another. He promises the Moon and the stars,  but his policies make them even further out of reach.   He says: ``I'll bring drug prices down.'' His bill does the opposite,  and it is just another way in which this is a healthcare handout for  the insurance companies and the wealthy but a raw deal for average  Americans.   TrumpCare is really just a tax break for the rich. It is not really a  healthcare program. Its No. 1 motivation is to reduce taxes on the top  0.01 percent. If you make above $250,000, your prices are going to come  down. If you are in that 0.01 percent, your average reduction in taxes  is $200,000--more than most Americans make. So this bill is not going  to help average Americans; it is going to hurt them, unless you are in  the top 0.01 percent.   As more and more people read the bill, the louder the chorus of  opposition grows. The AARP, a very cautious organization--usually they  don't like to take political stands--a few weeks ago, they had ads on  TV praising President Trump for saying he will not cut Social Security  or Medicare. They came out strongly against the bill yesterday. Why?  Because it would hurt seniors. They believe seniors--many average  seniors whose income is $15,000--could pay up to $8,400 more. The  people who might be hurt the most with this bill are average Americans  between 50 years old and 65 whose costs inevitably will go up, whose  healthcare will not be as good.   The AMA, another cautious organization, not known to be a big  Democratic organization, came out against the bill. Doctors know how  bad this will be for their patients and for America.   The Club for Growth, on the other side, has also opposed the bill.  Hospitals, doctors, senior citizen groups have all come out against the  bill. The hard right comes out against the bill, as do more moderate  and liberal groups. That is because this bill is one big mess, done  quickly in the dark of night. It is no wonder Speaker Ryan and Leader  McConnell don't want a lot of debate. They are embarrassed. This bill  is an embarrassment to those who put it in because it doesn't do what  it is supposed to do. That has led even Republican Governors such as  John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada to express concern  over the destruction of the Medicaid Program. As we know, it is  shifting the costs to the States.    Governor Kasich said that TrumpCare ``puts at risk our ability to  treat the drug addicted, the mentally  [[Page S1709]]  ill, and the working poor.'' It is almost certain that under this bill,  treatment for opioids will be less available because Medicaid is going  to be cut and Medicaid helps pay for it. It is almost certain that if  you are a young person, a young family--say you are 30 or 40 years old,  but you have mom or dad in a nursing home; Medicaid has been paying for  most of that, and it is going to be cut. What are you going to do?  Maybe they will have to move in with you. That is not so easy in a  growing family with kids. Maybe you will have to pay a lot of money out  of your pocket. So this bill hurts Americans up and down the line.   The ideological fervor of ``TrumpCare must cut back the role of  government, whether it hurts people or not'' is motivating this bill.  That in the abstract would be fine, but it hurts Americans. It hurts  middle-class Americans who are young, it hurts middle-class Americans  who are middle-aged, and it hurts maybe most of all middle-class  Americans who are 50 to 65 years old. As people learn about this bill  over the next few weeks, there will be rebellion in the land of Adam.   So I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle to listen to the  voices of the average Americans whom I met today, who care about  bringing down the unreasonable cost of drugs. They should listen to the  voices of experts who say just about the only winners in this bill are  the very wealthy, and they should listen to the voices coming from  their own party who say this bill will hurt their States and hurt the  country.   TrumpCare is a mess. If this Congress, if this House, if this Senate  is smart, they will defeat TrumpCare, keep the ACA, and then we can  work together on making it better--plain and simple.                          China and Trump Trademarks    Mr. President, on another matter, I am concerned about a recent  report that the Trump business interests have been granted approval on  a number of trademarks in China.   The President spent most of his campaign talking tough on China. He  said China was ``ripping us off . . . and killing our companies.'' He  promised to label them a currency manipulator, a cause near and dear to  my heart, on day one. The President promised many times over, saying:  We are going to label China a currency manipulator. There is nothing  stopping him from doing it. He could have done it with a stroke of a  pen.   My views on trade, particularly with respect to China, might be  closer to the views President Trump expressed in his campaign than  those of either President Obama or President Bush. But since the  election, President Trump has been remarkably soft on China.   As the Acting President pro tempore knows, I was the original  person--Senator Graham and I--who came up with the idea that China was  manipulating its currency. We discovered it. I did, when I went to  Crucible Steel near Syracuse and they told me how their business was  being hurt by China manipulating its currency. At first, when Lindsey  and I talked about it, people said: Oh, no, it is not happening. I was  sort of proud of the fact that in those days both the New York Times,  liberal, and the Wall Street Journal, conservative--their editorial  pages both stated that China doesn't manipulate its currency; Schumer  is off base. Now, of course, everyone knows they do. President Trump in  his campaign said over and over again he was going to label them a  currency manipulator which would have consequences to them on day one,  the first day he took office. Now he has backed off his threats. He has  been in office more than a month. He has not labeled China a currency  manipulator.   Amazingly enough, in his first week he said he was no longer going to  honor the One China policy. He was sending a shot over the bow to  Beijing, that they can't keep getting away with what they have been  getting away with in trade, in geodiplomacy, in cyber security,  stealing our intellectual property, and everything else. When he did  that, I was pretty pleased. Now he has backed off.   On the two issues where the President could have been really tough  with China, currency manipulation and backing off on One China, he  reversed himself within the last few weeks. Now, all of a sudden, we  learn that China has granted preliminary approval to 38 new trademarks,  allowing the Trump brand to market several different business ventures  there, including hotels and golf clubs. Before he assumed public  office, Donald Trump had been working to get trademarks from China for  a decade without success. These particular trademark applications,  filed during the campaign, just sailed through earlier this week.   It raises troubling specific questions: Did the Chinese Government  and the Communist Party, who likely had a hand in granting these  approvals, see some type of benefit from doing so now that Donald Trump  is President? Did the President and his network of businesses  personally gain from his office, and will that incline the President to  make policy decisions that benefit China and hurt American workers?   We don't know if there is a link between the two. We don't know what  was in the minds of the Chinese Government or the Communist Party when  they all of a sudden granted these 38 licenses. It surely raises  troubling questions.   It raises a bigger question. The wisdom of our Founding Fathers  proves true day in and day out. Over 220 years after they wrote the  Constitution, their wisdom is coming through now with President Trump  because they wrote in the Constitution that anything of value--any  emolument--to U.S. officials from foreign governments should be  prohibited. U.S. officials should not be allowed to accept anything of  value from any foreign government. In those days, one of the greatest  worries of the Founding Fathers was that they wanted to prevent foreign  governments from trying to curry favor with the United States by  offering potential financial gain to our officials. This issue has been  largely forgotten for a century or so, but the wisdom of the Founding  Fathers is shining through now because President Trump, unlike just  about any other President I can remember in recent history, has failed  to completely separate himself from huge financial interests.   Now the questions arise. Is there a relationship? Are foreign  governments seeking to curry favor? Is it affecting Donald Trump's  decisionmaking? No one knows the answers to these questions, but the  fact that the questions can be asked is extremely troubling.   The President has flouted all tradition and precedent, and I worry if  the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution has been broken when  President Trump retains a financial interest in his business empire. It  leads to troubling questions like the ones raised by these trademarks.   As my colleague from Connecticut, who is an expert on this issue, a  brilliant lawyer, Senator Blumenthal, said yesterday: I think the  circumstances surrounding the approval of these trademarks ought to be  looked into by this Congress for a potential emoluments clause  violation. He is right, and I am glad he is going forward.   Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time consumed during a  quorum call be charged equally to both sides.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
