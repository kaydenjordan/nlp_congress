C. Stayton, saw a need  for a local rural hospital in the growing city of Butler, Missouri.  After renting a two-story house, she furnished the five rooms upstairs  for patients, and the first patient was admitted shortly after, on June  17, 1926.   In 1932, during the Great Depression, Stayton convinced the city to  purchase property for a new hospital. On September 16, 1960, Bates  County Memorial Hospital officially opened. In its first 5 months, 564  patients were admitted, and 87 babies were born.   Over the years, Bates County Memorial has gone through many  additions, improvements, and regulation demands. However, Stayton's  original vision remains, a vision of keeping a healthy hospital  presence in rural communities.   Please join me in congratulating Bates County Memorial Hospital on 60  years of service and giving a huge thank-you to all the staff for  continuing to serve during these uncertain times.                            ____________________
