 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Joseph L.  Jones of Monumental Baptist Church in Jersey City, New Jersey, on the  occasion of his retirement.   Reverend Jones has been a part of the Monumental Baptist Church  family for 54 years. He spent the last 23 years as its pastor.   Reverend Jones helped grow the church's Sunday school, Bible school,  and prayer service programs, but he also helped grow educational  opportunities in the community at large.   Under Reverend Jones' leadership, Monumental Baptist Church has gone  out into the community to expand career and educational opportunities  for everyone. That is something to be proud of.   As Reverend Jones says, he has always lived by the motto: ``Do  something good for someone else.''   I am proud to represent Monumental Baptist Church, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating the retirement of Reverend Joseph  L. Jones.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my colleagues, Delegate  Plaskett and Congressman Horsford for hosting tonight's Special Order  hour on Judge Keith's legacy and the Trump administration's recent  attempts to roll back the social safety nets in our country.   Judge Keith's legacy cannot be overstated. He was an icon for African  Americans and, indeed, all Americans. He was a Black pioneer in the  legal field whose rulings took on Presidents from Richard Nixon to  George W. Bush. For 60 years he sat on the Federal bench and  consistently ruled in favor of expansive civil rights in this country.  It is because of Judge Keith and others like him that thousands of  young Black people have entered the legal profession and rose to the  top.   He was a judge who always extended a hand down to help lift others  up. That is the American way, and it is worth fighting for. Sadly, we  live in a time when people in power don't always help uplift others. We  have a President who is doing his best to beat down everyone who  doesn't think, look, or vote like him.   Now we see that the President has set his sights on America's  neediest people. He and his cronies are peddling a myth that the  vulnerable people who rely on our social safety net are lazy folks who  just want a government handout.   But we know that is not true. Some people just need a hand up every  once in a while. The Trump administration's attempts to roll back the  social safety net is a life-and-death matter for thousands of Americans  who struggle to make ends meet. We live in an unpredictable world. One  day you can be on top, but the next day you might be knocked down. The  social safety net is our country's promise that we will help people get  back up again.   Sometimes people need a little help buying food, or getting  healthcare, or just scraping by. There is nothing wrong with that. We  all know someone who has had hard times, and when we are having a good  time, we need to look out for each other. That is the American way.   I have said this before but let me say it again: I have never met a  person who wakes up in the morning and says: ``I want to be poor  today.'' That is just not reality. And let me add this: I have never  met a person who wakes up at 5 a.m. to go to her first job; comes home  at 1 p.m. to take a nap; and heads out to her second job at 4 p.m., yet  still lives paycheck to paycheck.   I never knew anyone that said: ``I like the struggle. I like the  difficulty. I like being poor.'' That person does not exist. That is  just not how the world works.   Social safety net programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and housing  assistance are supplements that help people struggle just a little bit  less. Yet, my colleagues across the aisle and their friends in the  White House keep pushing a false narrative that people who rely on  government assistance to make ends meet are freeloaders or take  government handouts and buy drugs. The 45th President keeps pushing his  callous, immoral narrative in order to tear apart our social safety  net.   In my district, 17.9 percent of the households rely on SNAP to feed  their families. They aren't lazy. They aren't addicts. They are  hardworking people; some of them with two or three jobs just trying to  make ends meet.   And now the President is trying to define them out of existence.  According to reports, his administration wants to change how inflation  is calculated in the official poverty measure in order to define  poverty out of existence and deny people access to our social safety  net.   Well, Mr. President, that is not going to work for the American  people. The United States Government should be making it easier for  Americans to maintain a decent standard of living. The fact of the  matter is that 70 percent of Americans rely on at least one Federal  program at some point in time in their lives. The President's focus on  ripping apart our social safety net with heartless cuts is wrong, it is  immoral, and it is shameful.   It isn't about cleaning up waste, fraud, or abuse. It is about  pulling the rug out from under people. Programs like SNAP are not just  some unlimited handout for people who are sitting at home doing  nothing.   Currently, 44 percent of the people who use SNAP have at least one  person in the family working. But even though they are working, they  might make minimum wage and are still below the poverty line.   When it comes to families with children who are on SNAP, more than  half of them bring home wages. But the problem is, their income isn't  enough to actually live on. So when the self-proclaimed billionaire in  the White House talks about making people who receive SNAP benefits  work or defining poverty out of existence, he is just repeating the  same old fake news that the Republican Party has peddled for decades.   This is unacceptable, and as a Member of Congress, I am here to serve  the people in my communities, and that means all the people. We have to  protect our most vulnerable and those in need. Let us end the  administration's war on the working poor and help make their lives  better for all of our constituents.
