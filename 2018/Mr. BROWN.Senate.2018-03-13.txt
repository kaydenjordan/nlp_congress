 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to take a trip  down memory lane. Go back a decade or two to 2006, 2007, 2008, and look  at the decade before that. My State of Ohio, for 14 years in a row-- from the late 1990s through the year 2010--experienced almost a decade  and a half of foreclosure increases leading up to the crisis. That  meant that in Ohio, literally every year for 14 years, there were more  foreclosures than the year before in my State.   Predatory and irresponsible lenders made dangerous, subprime loans.  They often ignored whether borrowers had the ability to repay that  loan. The incentives were these: We will keep writing these; we will  keep underwriting; we will keep collecting fees. We don't care if the  borrower can pay.   We can see that is a setup for disaster. Because of the lack of  standards for underwriting, we learned a painful lesson that not all  mortgage lending is created equal.   Look at some headlines from that period. On September 18, 2008, the  front page of the Wall Street Journal featured three headlines. This  was September 18, 2008, so just slightly less than 10 years ago:  ``Mounting Fears Shape World Markets As Banking Giants Rush to Raise  Capital.'' ``Bad Bets and Cash Crunch Push Ailing AIG to Brink.''  ``Worst Crisis Since `30s, With No End.''   On the same day the Washington Post reported: ``Markets in Disarray  as Lending Locks Up.''   How did we get to that crisis? Banks forgot the essential rule of  lending. A borrower needs to be able to pay back the loan. It is pretty  simple, but a forgotten dictum. Instead, lenders offered loans that  required no documentation. They offered loans with teaser interest  rates that shot through the roof after 2 or 3 years. They offered loans  where borrowers never paid down their principal or they stripped their  home's value through cash-out refinances.   So borrowers had these mortgages where they simply paid the interest  with the belief the home would go up in value more and more and more,  never paying the principal. The homes didn't go up in value, and look  what happened.   All of these practices had devastating results for families and  communities and the economy. My wife Connie and I live in ZIP Code  44105 in Cleveland, OH, just south of Slavic Village in the great city  of Cleveland. Eleven years ago, in the first half of 2007, 44105 had  more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of America. I  can still see the blight brought on by those foreclosures--what it did  to individual families, what it did to the neighborhood, what it did to  the city of Cleveland.   Think about--and we don't do that very much here. We don't really  think all that much when we talk about things like this. We look at  numbers. We look at statistics. We read analyses and data, but we don't  really think about individual families.   Think about what happens when somebody suffers a foreclosure. First  of all, these families understand that things are getting tighter. It  is harder  [[Page S1650]]  and harder to pay their mortgage. Their spouse may have been scaled  back to half time, depending on the economic circumstances.   The first thing they do is often get rid of the family pet. It costs  too much to take the dog to the vet. The second thing they do is cut  back on everything. They just start cutting back on everything.  Eventually they have that sit-down with their 12-year-old daughter and  their 14-year-old son and their 15-year old son, and tell them: We are  going to have to move. We don't know where we are going or what school  district we will be in. We don't know how much we are going to get; we  have to sell the car. We don't know how much you are going to be able  to see your friends. They think about the personal side, but we don't  do that much here.   Pope Francis used to admonish his parish priests to go out and smell  like the flock. We don't do that very much here. We look at data and  ideas, and we don't think about our policies and our votes and the  impact they have on individual human beings.   So thinking back to ZIP Code 44105, if those faulty mortgage products  weren't bad enough on their own, they were targeted to communities of  color. The neighborhood my wife and I live in, ZIP Code 44105, is  mostly African American, but pretty diverse. A lot of people look more  like me, but there are a lot of people with moderate to low incomes.   These mortgage products were targeted to communities of color. In  those communities in particular, even those who qualified for no- frills, no-surprises prime mortgages were often instead steered into  subprime loans. Why? Because the lender could make more money on a  subprime loan than a straightforward loan that most Members of the  Senate generally sign up for. So even African-American and Hispanic  borrowers with higher incomes than other borrowers found themselves-- because the banks put them there--with subprime mortgages.   These practices of discrimination, which went on for years, stripped  a generation's worth of equity from communities that had fought hard  for equal access to home ownership. Think about this: The household  wealth of communities of color simply hasn't recovered from the last  decade. Middle-class Black and Hispanic families lost half of their  wealth from 2007 to 2013. In 2016, it was $38,000. The numbers are  similar for Hispanic households: $85,000 in 2007, $46,000 in 2016. They  all sound like numbers, but what that does to a family who has lost  half its wealth, particularly because their wealth is generally in the  home that they own--think of what that does.   My colleagues talk about how hard the banks have it, how hard it is  to be a banker now, and how hard it is for Wall Street. I would like to  revisit what happens when banks stop following the rules. Borrowers  with these higher cost loans were foreclosed on at almost triple the  rate of borrowers with standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. Between  2006 and 2014, more than 9 million homeowners lost their homes to  foreclosure in distressed sales or surrendered their home to the  lender--9.3 million homeowners. What does that mean to us? Do we know  any of them? Do we ever talk to any of them? Do we listen to their  stories about what happens when you get thrown out of your house? Do we  sit there and patiently listen and ask them questions and ask them to  tell us about what has happened during the last 10 years of their  lives? Because when you get thrown out of your home, whether you are  evicted or whether you get put out because of foreclosure, you don't  just give away the family pet. You don't just cut back on everything.  You lose a lot of your possessions because you can't take things with  you. You start again in your life, and you start again in debt. Does  anybody here care about that?   They talk about how hard it is for the banks and how Wall Street is  suffering, but they don't think about the individual homeowners who  struggle. Some of them get foreclosed on. Some of them are just  struggling. Some of them have lost half of their wealth.   It is not just families of color who lost half their wealth; a whole  lot of working class White families have lost a lot of their wealth.  Does this place seem to care? Not a whole lot.   It wasn't just subprime mortgages. The crisis revealed a host of  other harmful practices, like steering borrowers to affiliated  companies, kickbacks for business referrals, inflated appraisals, and  loan officer compensation based on the loan product. If you have a  certain loan product that might be more profitable, even though it is a  little sleazy and a little underhanded, you make a little more money  because you steer people into those loan products. It might lead to the  ruining of their lives or it might lead to their foreclosure, but they  are making more money.   So what does that mean? It means the worse the loan was for the  borrower, the more money the lender made. In 2008, the worse the loan  was for the borrower, the more money the lender made. That is what our  laws were. We fixed that, and we are going to undo some of that in this  bill.   After the dust settled, this country realized how twisted our  mortgage lending market had become. Congress finally stepped in to do  what the market and regulators refused to do for too long.   I believe in free enterprise. I believe in the dynamism of  capitalism. But when the market and the regulators did nothing except  encourage this kind of behavior--that is why government is involved.  That is why government steps in. That is why we did Wall Street reform.  It established a commonsense rule that lenders should evaluate whether  a borrower has the ability to repay a home loan. The ability to repay  rule means that lenders can no longer make a loan based on the home's  value or ignore the fact that an adjustable rate mortgage will become  unaffordable in a year or two.   A mortgage is the largest financial transaction most families will  make in their lifetime. It is a big deal, central to the economic life  and the life overall of a great majority of people in this country.  Requiring that the mortgage process, services, and fees be transparent  and understandable to borrowers is essential. We don't all have great  sophistication when we get a homeowner's loan. That is why it is so  important that it be transparent and understandable to borrowers. But  the bill before us today chips away at that principle. It includes  several provisions that, when taken together, weaken transparency and  inclusiveness and undermine fairness in mortgage lending.   The bill says lenders need not consider whether a borrower can afford  an adjustable rate mortgage after the interest rate adjusts. Banks and  mortgage companies make more money when they write more loans. I get  that. They should. But when the incentive is only that and there is no  requirement that the borrower be able to afford an adjustable rate  mortgage after the interest rate adjusts--we know what will happen.   The bill also allows the largest banks to acquire small banks and  retains these legal protections for the larger banks.   I spoke to a member of a bank board in Mansfield, OH, yesterday, a  longtime friend of our family's. That is where I grew up. I know the  locally owned banks in Mansfield, OH. I know that Mechanics Bank works  hard for their enrichment. I know they work hard for their customers.  They know their customers. Small banks work with their customers. If  they lose a job or face a sudden illness, the bank can try to work with  them to figure out how to avoid foreclosure. Would a megabank in  Cleveland, Columbus, or Dayton do the same thing? Based on the record  of Secretary Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, and others during the crisis, we  can be pretty sure we know the answer to that, and the answer is no,  they won't.   The bill before us also gives lenders a pass on the requirement to  escrow for taxes and insurance when making subprime loans. It doesn't  cost real money to the lender to put money aside for taxes and  insurance; it is part of the calculation when you buy a house. Most of  us want our taxes and insurance included so we have a more predictable  stream of outflow, so we know how much we are paying next month, and it  doesn't change. It may change once a year, but it doesn't change often.  By definition, someone taking out a subprime loan is at a higher risk  of default. Also, escrow helps a borrower plan for the expenses of  taxes and insurance, and it protects  [[Page S1651]]  the lender from unexpected losses. That is in the bill, and we are  stripping that out of the law.   Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, appointed by President Bush, is a  terrific public servant. She was a high-ranking employee--I believe  chief of staff--for Senator Dole when he was a Member of the Senate.  She steered the FDIC through the worst of the financial crisis. She  raised her opposition to this provision in a letter to me.   This bill exempts 85 percent of banks from reporting the HMDA data  they are collecting and reporting today. I credit Senator Cortez Masto,  who, as the attorney general of Nevada before she joined us in the  Senate 14 months ago, saw up close what happened with foreclosures. She  is a strong, outspoken opponent of this bill. She has had those  discussions with people who have lost their homes. She understands how  it happened. She doesn't have the amnesia that apparently a majority of  my colleagues have, forgetting what happened 10 years ago and learning  almost nothing from what happened 10 years ago. Her amendment would fix  HMDA data collection. Without this data, we can't monitor trends in  mortgage lending, particularly in rural areas. Without this data, it  will be even harder to see who has access to affordable mortgage credit  and who does not.   We know that redlining is still happening. The latest report from the  Center for Investigative Reporting analyzed tens of millions of  mortgage records and found that across the country, people of color are  far more likely to be turned down for a loan even when you take into  account factors like their income and the size of the loan. Without  this data, we won't know when redlining happens. It will make it more  difficult to show that community lenders go the extra mile for their  customers. That is why the NAACP, National Community Reinvestment  Coalition, Unidos, National Urban League, Rural Community Assistance  Corporation, and more than 170 State and national organizations have  objected to this devastating new hole in lending data. Why in the world  would Congress want to keep us from getting that information, keep us  from getting that data, so we, in fact, understand better what goes on?   Part of our problem in 2007 and 2008 was that we had a whole bunch of  regulators who were asleep at the switch, we had a Congress that was  oblivious, and we had a national media that was not paying enough  attention to this. Part of that was that the regulators didn't have the  information they needed. That is why the head of supervision at the  Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles, who was in the Bush administration  then, could see nothing but roses and candy in the years ahead. He said  that in 2006 and I believe in 2007. He had no idea what was going on,  partly because he maybe didn't want to know but partly because we  didn't have the data collected that we are starting to collect now. So  we are going to say we don't care about that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from former  FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and the letters from civil rights groups in  opposition to this provision be printed in the Record at the conclusion  of my remarks.   Any one of these provisions is bad enough, but taken together, they  add up to riskier loans for American families and more foreclosures on  American families.   Think about this: If this bill passes, a bank could make a subprime  loan without considering whether a borrower could afford the higher  interest rate when the teaser rate expires. The first 2 or 3 years, you  are paying rate X, and then in the third or fourth year, you are paying  X plus two or X plus three, and then the next year, maybe X plus that  number plus one, to the point you can't afford your mortgage anymore.  What happens? You get foreclosed on, and your life turns upside down.    If this bill passes, a bank could make a subprime loan without  considering whether the borrower could pay the higher interest rate. A  bank wouldn't have to collect taxes and insurance on a monthly basis,  making a loan look affordable when it may not be because you have  insurance and taxes. Why not put that in the monthly payment so people  can predict more and understand their finances better?   The homeowner loses her right to take the bank to court for removing  her from her home even though the bank made a loan it knew she could  never repay. So the bank makes a loan to a homeowner. The homeowner  perhaps doesn't have the sophistication the banker sitting across the  table has, doesn't quite understand what the teaser rate will mean to  the cost of her house. Then the bank doesn't do the escrow adding  insurance and taxes, and the bank convinces this perspective homeowner,  the borrower, that she can make these payments, no problem. Then she  loses her right to action if she is foreclosed on. She has no recourse  even though the bank sold her something that a good banker wouldn't  have. It is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for more families  ending up in homes they were misled into thinking they could afford. Is  it too much to ask a lender to consider whether a family can afford the  loan they are getting? Are we back here already?   The cherry on top is this bill eliminates data we need to determine  whether banks are targeting certain communities for these risky loans.  We know this administration and the heads of Departments are not  concerned about accountability for financial institutions' equity,  lending, and inclusivity. We learned that HUD is considering changing  its mission statement to delete references to inclusive communities.  Imagine that, Secretary Carson, that you would do such a thing.   I am concerned this bill will put more families at risk of poor  housing conditions, particularly in rural communities that are so often  ignored in this town. The bill reduces the frequency of required  inspections for units overseen by rural public housing agencies that  administer 550 or fewer units of HUD public housing and section 8  rental vouchers. For many of these so-called PHAs, HUD will inspect  their property once every 3 years rather than every 1 or 2 years. This  bill would allow PHAs to inspect more voucher-assisted units just once  every 3 years. A lot can happen to an apartment in 3 years that could  put residents' health and safety at risk. In my neighborhood, it is in  the 90 percent rate, those homes that have toxic levels of lead, and it  gets worse as the house gets older and the paint chips. And we are not  going to inspect these places.   I understand that PHAs face many challenges in maintaining high- quality housing for families. Due to years of underfunding, public  housing alone faces an estimated $26 billion backlog of repairs. My  Senate Democratic colleagues and I have proposed an infrastructure  package that includes funding for public housing repairs and  revitalization to help address these challenges. We have an obligation  to make sure these struggling families have safe and decent housing. I  have been clear throughout this process that I want to help community  lenders and housing providers better serve their customers. We don't do  that by reducing accountability. We don't do that by returning to the  freewheeling housing market that led to millions of families losing  their homes.   When we talk about escrow and lending requirements, it sounds kind of  boring, it sounds dry, and it may sound like legalese that don't  matter, but it matters when it comes to the biggest, most important  purchase most Americans will make.   It just seems that particularly when people buy that first home and  they don't really know much about how to do that--maybe they don't have  a lot of political sophistication; they are 25 or 30 years old or  whatever age they are--we shouldn't make it more complicated, we should  make it less complicated. Bankers should not be incentivized only by  how much money they make by writing more and more mortgages but instead  should walk through what this is going to cost: Here is the escrow.  Here is what your insurance costs. Here is what you are going to pay if  you have a teaser rate. We are going to make some decisions, and this  house may be a little too expensive for you because of that teaser  rate, because of what you will be paying 3 years from now in addition  to the escrow, the taxes and insurance that you hadn't really planned  for.   Weakening a standard here or granting an exemption there will end up  causing real pain for real families.  [[Page S1652]]    Growth in the housing sector is only sustainable if families can  afford their loans and homes are maintained. I know families in my ZIP  Code can't afford a repeat of the housing crisis. I know what it has  done to my neighborhood. Some of them are still digging out.   Let's stop listening to the big-bank lobbyists and start listening to  the people we serve, the families across this country who remember all  too well what foreclosures and job losses mean to them.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  February 13, 2018.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, Senate Banking Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Brown: You had requested my views on S. 2155,       the ``Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer       Protection Act''. At the outset, I would like to commend the       Senate Banking Committee leadership for developing this       legislation on a bipartisan basis, and proceeding in the       traditional way with hearings and a markup. I appreciate that       much work has gone into negotiating its provisions, and I am       highly supportive of most of them, particularly those reforms       which give relief to community and regional institutions, as       well as changes that would give consumers more control over       their credit information.        Regrettably, the bill also includes Section 402 which would       significantly weaken a key constraint on the use of excessive       leverage by the largest financial institutions in the US. In       these times of market volatility, I would strongly urge the       Senate to reject this provision as imprudent and short-      sighted. Now is the time we should be bolstering bank capital       levels, not chipping away at them.        Banks operated with far too little capital during the run       up to the 2008 financial crisis. In setting capital       requirements, regulators erroneously judged certain       activities--for instance mortgage securities, derivatives,       and European sovereign debt--as having little, if any risk.       Banks piled into these activities because regulators let them       lever returns with borrowed money. The consequences were       catastrophic.        Because their judgments about risk were so wide of the       mark, regulators have made greater use of non-risk weighted       standards since the crisis. The most important of these is       the ``supplemental leverage ratio'' or ``SLR''--a relatively       simple metric which sets minimums for big banks' common       equity as a percentage of their total assets and certain off-      balance sheet exposures. In the US, the SLR has been set at       5% for the largest banking organizations (6% for their       insured bank subsidiaries).        Section 402 is a seemingly innocuous provision which would       exempt from the SLR deposits held at central banks by       ``custodian'' banks. This includes deposits at the Federal       Reserve (Fed), as well as the central banks of other       Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development       (OECD) members such as Turkey and Greece.        As originally introduced, Section 402 was limited to three       so-called ``custodian'' banks, specialized banks which       safeguard customer assets but do not engage in traditional       commercial banking. However, during the markup, the Senate       Banking Committee loosened the definition of ``custodian''       bank, potentially creating a gaping loophole as any bank       arguably serves as ``a custodian'' of depositor money. Most       big banks will likely press the Fed to let them benefit from       Section 402, given the huge competitive advantage it would       bestow. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation       (FDIC) indicate that capital reductions for some banks could       approach 30%.        The laudable goal of the sponsors of S. 2155 is to support       economic growth. But it seems Section 402 will simply give       banks more incentives to take on additional leverage by       parking money with central banks, not making business and       consumer loans. They can arbitrage the near-zero interest       rates they pay on deposits with the 150 basis points they can       get at the Fed. That's a nice, tidy margin that will grow       even wider as the Fed raises rates this year.        Central bank deposits do not support lending in the real       economy. They do include the extra reserves created by       central banks when they intervene in the markets through       things like quantitative easing, the practice of buying       government and private securities to increase the money       supply. If the goal of S. 2155's supporters is to facilitate       monetary interventions, then that should be made clear.       However, even assuming that is the purpose, there is no need       for Section 402. The Fed already has substantial flexibility       to temporarily ease capital requirements during times of       economic stress. The Basel Committee, an international       regulatory forum which includes central bank supervisors, has       said that in times of exceptional macroeconomic circumstances       central banks should have the flexibility to temporarily       remove reserve deposits from the leverage ratio calculation       to facilitate such interventions. Only the Brexit-challenged       Bank of England has removed central bank deposits from its       leverage calculation. Notably, it also made an upward       adjustment in its ratio to mitigate the reduction in capital       levels, something which S. 2155 does not do.        More fundamentally, why does Congress want to start       designating banking activities as low or no risk, when expert       financial regulators were so spectacularly wrong prior to the       crisis? The SLR's key strength is that it does not reflect       government judgments about risk. Central bank deposits may       seem low risk, but where does this slippery slope end? The       Treasury Department wants US government securities also       removed from the leverage ratio, notwithstanding their       significant interest rate risk. What's next? Housing agency       debt? How about AAA corporate bonds? To the extent these       instruments compete with central bank deposits for banks'       liquid investments, Section 402 will put them at a       competitive disadvantage unless they get similar treatment.       It will also alter the competitive landscape as it provides a       special capital break for big banks that does not apply to       smaller institutions, an ironic result for a bill designed to       help community and regional banks.        Before concluding, I would like to address some of the       confusion surrounding this change, not surprising given the       complexity of bank capital regulation. Assets of pension       funds, mutual funds, endowments and other bank clients that       are held in custody and invested under the control of those       clients are already excluded from the SLR. Losses on those       assets fall to the clients, not the bank. The SLR applies to       funding, be they deposits or other borrowings, over which       banks have control. Even though custody banks may not operate       as traditional commercial lenders, they are highly systemic       and have significant operational risk with many trillions       under custody. They can also suffer losses on their       investment portfolios, as they did during the crisis. As       Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Vice-Chair Tom       Hoenig has pointed out, custodian banks were borrowing from       the Federal Reserve $60 to $90 billion dollars a day to cover       funding shortfalls during that tumultuous time.        In the years following the crisis, custodian and other       large, systemic banks have grown and remained profitable       notwithstanding toughened capital rules. Indeed, the higher       capital standards we imposed in the US relative to Europe       have been key to our faster economic recovery. It is true       that during times of market stress, deposits significantly       increase at custodian banks. But this is true of all banks--      FDIC insured deposits went up dramatically during the crisis.       This is why risk-based capital rules have built in counter-      cyclical buffers, and there would certainly be no harm in       Congress recognizing the authority of bank regulators to       provide capital accommodation in times of severe stress when       deposits are increasing dramatically as investors seek out       safety. This is authority I believe they already have.        Government judgments favoring one asset class over another       inevitably distort markets. I would strongly encourage       Congress not to embark down this path. The responsibility--      and accountability--for capital rules should rest with the       Fed and other bank regulators. Weakening capital rules now       will undermine the resiliency of the banking system and       heighten the risk of bank failures during the next downturn.       This current recovery is already long in the tooth by       historical standards. For now, growth is strong and banks are       profitable, but that will eventually change. If anything,       Congress should be encouraging banks and their regulators to       increase capital buffers.        You had also requested my views on other aspects of S.       2155. As previously indicated, outside of Section 402, I am       highly supportive of this bill with two caveats. First, in       limiting the application of Enhanced Prudential Standards       (EPS) Congress should take care not to weaken pre-Dodd-Frank       authorities to utilize forward-looking supervisory tools and       protect the deposit insurance fund. You would not want to       inadvertently weaken supervisory tools that existed prior to       the crisis. Second, I am troubled by Section 109 which would       exempt many more lenders from escrow requirements for high-      cost mortgage loans. Mandatory escrow of insurance and taxes       for borrowers with troubled credit histories provide both       consumer and safety and soundness benefits. Borrowers who       have difficulty managing their finances may well have trouble       making these essential payments on their own, forcing them to       turn to high cost lenders to cover those costs when they come       due, or worse, defaulting on their mortgage obligations.       Moreover, administrative costs of escrow requirements are not       high and certainly less than costs associated with default.       To both protect consumers from the loss of their homes as       well as the FDIC-insured banks from mortgage defaults, I       would encourage Congress to leave current escrow requirements       alone.            Sincerely,      Sheila C. Bair.                                   ____                                        National Association for the                                   Advancement of Colored People,                                      Washington, DC, March 5, 2018.      Re NAACP Strong opposition to S. 2155, the Economic Growth,           Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.       The Honorable,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest,       largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil       rights organization, I strongly urge you to oppose, work       against, and vote ``Nay'' on passage of S. 2155, the mis-      named Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer       Protection  [[Page S1653]]       Act. This dangerous bill does irreparable damage to fair       lending protections against racial discrimination; it harms       homebuyers; and it contains over two deregulatory provisions       of the financial services industry that were put into place       after the 2008 global crises which led to a recession from       which many American families and communities are still trying       to recover.        Section 104 of the bill would exempt 85% of depository       institutions from full reporting of loan data under the Home       Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). This would devastate our       attempts to determine--and potentially rectify--racially       discriminatory lending or loan approval patterns at play. The       HMDA dataset contains the most comprehensive publicly       available information on mortgage market activity. Each fall,       new HMDA data are made available. In 2016, almost 7,000       institutions released over 16 million records, making HMDA an       invaluable administrative dataset on housing and       homeownership for policymakers, regulators, and researchers.        Furthermore, S. 2155 provides exemptions from crucial       mortgage lending protections for buyers of manufactured       homes, such as mobile homes. These provisions would allow       sellers of manufactured homes to overcharge customers and       make the millions of Americans who wish to purchase a       manufactured home more vulnerable to predatory lending       practices similar to those which caused so many--too many--      families to lose their homes in the 2008 crisis.        If we as a nation learned anything from the 2008 financial       crisis, it is that American consumers need more information       and protection, not less. Thus, I urge you to reject S. 2155       and to focus on policies and proposals to help the average       American consumer. Thank you in advance for your attention to       the position of the NAACP. Should you have any questions or       comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at my office.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                                      March 8, 2018.      Re Oppose section 104, ``The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act           Adjustment''.         Dear Senator: The undersigned civil rights, fair housing,       consumer, and community organizations write to highlight our       strong concerns with Section 104 of S. 2155, ``the Home       Mortgage Disclosure Act Adjustment and Study''. This section       would undermine efforts to ensure that the nation's mortgage       lenders are serving all segments of the market fairly by       exempting the vast majority of lenders from the updated       reporting required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Public officials use       this information in distributing public-sector investments so       as to attract private investment to areas where it is needed,       and to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns.    The Dodd-Frank Act's Updated HMDA Reporting Reflects Lessons from the                              Financial Crisis         In response to widespread concerns about predatory lending       and opacity in the mortgage market in the run-up to and       following the financial crisis, Congress amended the Home       Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to require both banks and non-      bank lenders to disclose more information about their       mortgage lending activities--updates finalized by the CFPB in       2015. Although not previously reported and disclosed through       HMDA, these data points are already collected on a routine       basis by banks, credit unions and for-profit mortgage       companies in the normal course of business, either as a part       of basic loan underwriting, for securitization or for other       purposes required by law.      The CFPB Reduces the Reporting Burden on Small Lenders           Without Sacrificing Data About Lending in Underserved           Communities        After considering a number of higher reporting thresholds       and receiving extensive feedback from all size and type of       lending institutions, the CFPB adopted a standard that       applies the new reporting requirements to institutions that       made 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 100 open-end/home equity       lines of credit (HELOCs). Importantly, in response to       concerns raised by lenders and by some in Congress, the CFPB       has already temporarily raised the reporting threshold for       HELOCs to 500 through 2019, in order to further review the       impact of the rule and what the permanent HELOC threshold       should be. In adopting the HMDA thresholds, the agency       balanced several Congressional interests--adopting a uniform       and simplified reporting regime for banks and non-banks;       eliminating the need for low-volume banks to report while       maintaining sufficient data for analysis at the national,       local, and institutional levels; and increasing visibility       into the home mortgage lending practices of non-banks.        Section 104 upsets the careful balance: its proposed       reporting thresholds--500 closed end loans or 500 open-end       lines--would exempt the vast majority of the nation's       mortgage lenders from the updated requirements. Based on 2013       data, under the threshold set by the CFPB, 22 percent (1,400)       of the depository institutions that currently report on their       closed-end mortgages would be exempt. In contrast, if Section       104 is enacted, the agency estimates that 85 percent (5,400)       of depositories and 48 percent of nondepositories (497) would       not have to update reporting on their mortgages. This higher       threshold would sacrifice key data about lending in       underserved communities that would help to ensure the flow of       credit to qualified borrowers, stimulate the economy, and       prevent future mortgage crises.      Tiered Reporting Sacrifices Critical Data Without Reducing           Lender Burden        Section 104 proposes to adopt a tiered reporting approach,       exempting some lenders from reporting the new data points       pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act only. This is purportedly a       way to reduce burden. However, because the data points       covered by the rule are already collected by lenders, the       burden associated with the rule is minimal. Further, as with       any data collection effort, the primary driver of HMDA costs       is in establishing and maintaining systems to collect and       report data, and not the costs associated with collecting and       reporting a particular data field. Therefore, this approach       sacrifices critical information without relieving much of the       purported HMDA reporting burden on banks or non-banks.          Section 104 Would Undermine Fair Access to Mortgage Credit         HMDA was passed in 1975 to provide the necessary tools to       dismantle uneven access to mortgage credit and expand equal       lending opportunities for qualified borrowers, yet important       segments of the market continue to lack fair access. For       people of color, low- to moderate-income families, and       borrowers in rural areas, access to mortgage credit remains       tight. While the numbers of loan originations have gone down       for all borrowers, African Americans and Latinos have       experienced the steepest declines. A Federal Reserve analysis       of lending in rural areas has found higher denial rates in       those communities since the housing crisis than in urban       areas. The new data would help explain and inform responses       to these lending gaps. A new HMDA data point on the       applicant's age is also vital information for evaluating age       bias in lending, especially in conjunction with reverse       mortgages.        The stark disparities in access to mortgage credit and the       continued struggle for economic recovery in the communities       hit hardest by the financial crisis call for a strengthening       of our nation's fair lending laws, specifically HMDA, not a       weakening of them. Quite simply, the updated HMDA data will       provide critical information about whether similarly situated       borrowers and underserved communities are receiving equitable       access to mortgage credit, data that we lacked a decade ago       when the crisis hit. This is not the time to limit the       nation's ability to adequately assess the reasons for       restricted credit access for underserved borrowers. Instead,       we must increase efforts to address the causes behind the       increased difficulty in accessing safe, affordable credit.        For these reasons and more, we urge you to oppose Section       104 and any other efforts to roll back the data collection       and reporting as called for in Dodd-Frank and implemented by       the CFPB.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I first wish to thank Senator Whitehouse,  one of my best friends in the Senate.  [[Page S1673]]  We came to the Senate on the same day. He will go down in history as  the best advocate in this body or perhaps the greatest moralist of our  time combatting climate change. He has educated Members of the Senate-- some more resistant than others.   He has taken to the floor over and over. He has continued to make  sure that people listen to something important, and we all appreciate  that leadership.   Climate change affects Ohio jobs that rely on Lake Erie. The Great  Lakes are vital to our industrial heartland, as the Rockies are to the  West, as the Atlantic coastline is to New England, as the Gulf of  Mexico is to the Presiding Officer's own State of Florida. In fact, 84  percent of America's freshwater is in the five Great Lakes. Only polar  icecaps contain more freshwater than do the Great Lakes.   Lake Erie is one of the biggest lakes in the world. It is also the  shallowest of the lakes. This is an amazing statistic. Lake Erie is the  shallowest and among the smallest of the Great Lakes in surface area.  Lake Erie contains 2 percent of all the water in the Great Lakes, yet  it contains 50 percent of the fish in the Great Lakes because it is  warmer and shallower and conducive to aquatic life and fish life.   Its shallowness makes it particularly vulnerable to storm water  runoff and the algae blooms that it causes. The Maumee River runs  through Toledo. The Maumee River Basin is the largest drainage basin of  any of the Great Lakes, and the largest river that empties into the  Great Lakes is the Maumee.   Climate change makes these algae blooms off the coast of Toledo in  the western base of Lake Erie. Climate change makes those blooms worse.  It contaminates our lakes, and it threatens the Ohio businesses and  communities that rely on Lake Erie. Three summers ago, we had to get  bottled drinking water to the citizens of Toledo and the surrounding  areas of Northwest Ohio because the water was not potable at that time.   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we  know that one effect of climate change in the Great Lakes region has  been a 37-percent increase in the gully washers--the heavy rain events  that contribute to algae blooms.   I talked to farmers who have been farming in the Western Lake Erie  Basin for decades. Just a few weeks ago I did a roundtable in that part  of the State. My staff member Jonathan McCracken has done a number of  roundtables before. Since talking to these farmers, they tell us they  are experiencing heavier rain events more often and with greater  intensity compared to even 15 years ago, let alone in the lifespan of  many of these farmers.   Hotter summers and shorter winters make this worse. The effects of  algae blooms have a profound effect on the ecosystem. That is why this  matters. Protecting our lakes is one of the biggest environmental  challenges facing the entire Midwest. It is the biggest challenge  facing Ohio.   We have made some progress over the last 8 years, thanks in large  part to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The GLRI is working.  Everybody knows it does. Nobody claims it doesn't.   I remember how polluted Lake Erie was when I was growing up. I grew  up an hour or hour and a half from there. My family, a week or two in  the summer, would drive north to Gem Beach. I remember the dead fish. I  remember the smell of the lake. I remember that this lake was in big,  big trouble.   We have made progress cleaning up its tributaries. We increased  access to the lake. We approved habitats for fish and wildlife. It has  been a bipartisan success story, and it took the Federal Government to  do it. The city of Cleveland couldn't do it, nor the city of Lorraine,  the city of Sandusky, the city of Port Clinton, the city of Ashtabula.  They couldn't clean up the lake. The State of Ohio didn't have the  ability and the resources to clean this lake up. It took the Federal  Government and the U.S. EPA to have the strength and the dollars and  the mission to clean up this lake. That is why it has been a bipartisan  success story all over our country.    We need to make sure that GLRI has the funding it needs to keep up  its work and not eliminate it, as the President again proposed in his  budget. Taking a hatchet to GLRI would cost Ohio jobs, and it would  jeopardize public health by putting our drinking water at risk.   If you are over 50 years old, you remember what that lake looked  like. You remember what that lake smelled like. You remember how people  didn't swim there, how people's drinking water was threatened. You  remember that before EPA, before there was this bipartisan commitment  to clean up one of the greatest of the Great Lakes. You remember that.   Obviously, this President doesn't know this. This President won his  election based on winning these Great Lakes States, and he has  abandoned these States by drastically cutting funding for the Great  Lakes Restoration Initiative.   Those of us along the Great Lakes didn't stand for a budget that  eliminated GLRI last year. Nothing has changed this year. Ohioans on  both sides of the aisle will go to the mat for our lake.   I am working with Senator Portman--I am a Democrat; he is a  Republican--and my Ohio colleagues from both parties to protect it.  Budget cuts are terrible for this; climate change will only make it  worse.   When I was young, people wrote off Lake Erie as a polluted, dying  lake. As I said, I remember seeing it. I remember smelling it. I  remember hearing people talk about it. Many, many people thought that  there wasn't much future for this Great Lake, that it would be  impossible to clean up.   People in the past have had a habit of not just writing off Lake Erie  but also writing off my State. We have proved them wrong time and  again. We proved them wrong back then, we proved them wrong today, and  we will prove them wrong in the future.   Our lake is improving. It is supporting an entire industry. It  supports the jobs it creates. It is providing drinking water and  recreation and so much more to communities across our State, and we  can't allow climate change to ruin that progress. We cannot write off  Lake Erie. We cannot write off the millions of Ohioans and people from  Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and  Minnesota who depend on these five Great Lakes.   I see it up close. I live only 5 or 6 miles from the lake. I know  what it means for my community. I know how important this is for the  future--the environmental future--of our country, the economic future  of my State. It is important for all of us to come together on a  bipartisan basis.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
