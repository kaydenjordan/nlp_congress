 Mr. Speaker, Army Specialist Ryan Wilcox heroically  served our Nation in two combat tours.   Specialist Wilcox first deployed to Iraq as a combat engineer with  the 479th Engineer Battalion. In 2007, he suffered a gunshot wound to  his leg at that time.   In 2012, he returned to Active Duty in Afghanistan with the 444th  Engineer Battalion. During this tour, he suffered chronic pain  resulting, ultimately, in the amputation of his right leg.   Now retired, Specialist Wilcox is looking to start a new life in  upstate New York with his fiancee, Sara, and their two children,  Nicholas and Juliana.   This Saturday, a terrific organization known as Homes for Our Troops  will donate a specially adapted home in Mexico, New York, for  Specialist Wilcox and his family. This home will allow him to navigate  easily throughout his home so he can focus more on his family,  finishing college, and continuing his work to help fellow veterans in  need.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Specialist Wilcox for his  heroic service to our Nation, as well as honoring, congratulating, and  thanking Homes for Our Troops for helping transform the lives of our  Nation's heroes like Ryan Wilcox and his family.                            ____________________
