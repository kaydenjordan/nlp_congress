 Mr. Speaker, I noticed my colleague from Texas down here a  little bit earlier talking about the tragedy in Uvalde. And I can tell  you, as someone who represents central Texas and the district and the  county that shares a border with Uvalde County, it hits close to home.   But I would note that the President of the United States and my  colleagues have suddenly found Uvalde and south Texas on a map. When we  have got 15,000 people in a caravan coming to Texas; we have 700-some  people, migrants, who have died along the border; we have mobile  morgues being used in south Texas along the Rio Grande; and now  suddenly, to go exploit a tragedy for political purposes, my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle can find Uvalde on a map. Because they  sure as hell haven't been able to find Uvalde on a map over the last  year and a half of this administration.   We will have more to talk this week about the politicization of this  tragedy in Uvalde, and targeting the pretext and the false use by my  colleague from Texas of ``automatic weapons'' as opposed to semi- automatic weapons.    But let's be clear: Our borders remain wide open, and Americans are  dying in droves; hundreds and thousands of people across this country  who are dying because of open borders. We will talk about it this week.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
