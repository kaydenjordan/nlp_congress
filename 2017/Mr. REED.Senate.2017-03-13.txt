 Mr. President, I am reintroducing the PCAOB Enforcement  Transparency Act along with Senator Grassley. This bill permits the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, to make public the  disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit  firms earlier in the process.   Over 10 years ago, our markets were victimized by a series of massive  financial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and  WorldCom. In response to this crisis, the Senate Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted multiple hearings, which produced  consensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak corporate  governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of  accountants charged with auditing public companies' financial  statements.   In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by  the investigation and hearings, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 in a 99-to-0 vote. Among its many provisions, this law  called for the creation of a strong, independent board, the PCAOB,  responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies in order to  protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on the  financial statements of public companies.   To conduct its duties, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, oversees more than 1,500  registered accounting firms, as well as the audit partners and staff  who contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The board's ability to  initiate proceedings to determine whether there have been violations of  its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is an  important component of its oversight.   However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.S.  Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the  U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry  Regulatory Authority, and others, the Board's disciplinary proceedings  are not allowed to be public without consent from the parties involved.  Of course, parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no  incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus  these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In  addition, the board's decisions in disciplinary proceedings are not  allowed to be publicized until after the complete exhaustion of an  appeals process, which can often take several years.   These PCAOB disciplinary proceedings create a lack of transparency  that invites abuse and undermines the congressional intent behind the  PCAOB, which was to shine a bright light on auditing firms and  practices, and to bolster the accountability of auditors of public  companies to the investing public.   Over the years, some bad actors have taken advantage of this loophole  to shield themselves from public scrutiny and accountability. PCAOB  Chairman James Doty has repeatedly stated in testimony provided to both  the Senate and House of Representatives over the years that the secrecy  of the proceedings ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and  that such secrecy is harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and  the public at large.   For example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary  proceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports  on public companies without any of those companies knowing about its  PCAOB disciplinary proceedings. Disturbingly, investors and the public  company clients of that audit firm were deprived of relevant  information about the proceedings against the firm and the substance of  any violations.   In addition to the reasons I have already provided, there are other  reasons why the board's enforcement proceedings should be open and  transparent.   First, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to shield  conduct from public scrutiny as long as possible frustrates the process  and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both litigants  and the PCAOB.   Second, agencies such as the SEC have found open and transparent  disciplinary proceedings to be valuable because they inform peer audit  firms of the type of activity that may give rise to enforcement action  by the regulator. In effect, transparent proceedings can serve as a  deterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in the  likelihood of ``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry as a  whole would also benefit from timely, public, and nonsecret enforcement  proceedings.   Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices,  orders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless  otherwise ordered by the Board. This would more closely align the  PCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters.   Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to  PCAOB disciplinary proceedings is a critical component of bolstering  and maintaining investor confidence in our financial markets, while  better protecting companies from problematic auditors. I hope our  colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in supporting this  legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's enforcement process.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Portman):   S. 611. A bill to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to  meet the needs of homeless children, youth, and families, and honor the  assessments and priorities of local communities; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
