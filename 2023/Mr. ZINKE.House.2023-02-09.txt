 Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to death that both sides  recognize it is a problem, and it is. Let's call it like it is.   First of all, I don't expect China to tell the truth. It says it was  a civilian airship. We know that is a lie.   Nor do I appreciate the Biden administration's explanations. Let's go  through them really quickly.   Number one was remote. Our concern not to shoot it down was because  it was going someplace remote or we could have collateral damage on the  ground. It went through the Aleutian chain, one of the most remote  places on the planet. As a former SEAL, I can tell you there is not a  lot out there.   Then, it went over Montana. Petroleum County, for instance, has 434  people in it. That is less than the United States Congress. I can  guarantee you, the chance of hitting collateral damage was probably  more off the coast of Myrtle Beach than it was in Montana.   They even suggest, well, we gained great intelligence as it meandered  from Montana to the Carolinas because we were monitoring what the  Chinese were spying on. That is like inviting a burglar to your house  just to see what he takes.   Look, it is a problem and has been a problem. Also, to blame the  Trump administration--look, I was Secretary of State. Does anyone in  this body or anyone in America remember a balloon the size of three  buses at 65,000 feet going from Montana to North Carolina? I mean, come  on. We all recognize it is a problem.   Lastly, if this administration can't figure a balloon out, then how  can we figure out Taiwan?
