 Mr. Speaker, last week, America and we in Ohio lost a  true patriot, family man, successful business leader, and community  champion, Taras G. Szmagala, who passed away at 90 years of age.   To his wife, Katherine, of 64 years; son, Taras; grandson, Gregory;  and a vast network of extended family and friends, I know this is a  difficult time. Yet, I also know that you carry forward in all you do  the living memory of your beloved husband, father, and grandfather.  Please know many others feel the sharp pain of your loss.   Taras inspired us all with his gentlemanly manner, easy smile, and  dedicated passion on matters that mean the most. There was no stronger  advocate on behalf of liberty for Ukraine than Taras. He knew the  stakes.   His life was a classic, committed to family, profession, Nation, and  liberty, and he was resolute. He made and kept his promises. He  maintained resolve in all pursuits. He was jovial, loving, dependable,  and visionary, and he made our world a better place.   May he rest in peace as he takes his place at a high altar of praise,  as his spirit helps guide our world, including freedom for Ukraine. May  he help usher her into the birth of liberty to which he dedicated so  much of his life.    Sending deepest sympathy and abiding gratitude of friendship.                            ____________________
