 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Families First  Coronavirus Response Act.   Our Nation is confronting an unprecedented pandemic, unlike what any  of us can remember.   Our role in the Congress is to be proactive and ensure public health  officials have the resources and tools that they need to keep our  communities safe in the coming weeks and months.   Prompt action is needed to address this extraordinary situation, and  the Families First Coronavirus Response Act begins to meet the needs of  many people in our communities.   The legislation ensures testing is 100 percent covered and paid sick  leave. It ensures that food and economic assistance goes directly to  hardworking men, women, and families deeply affected by the outbreak.   It also provides much-needed financial assistance to the States to  meet this critical public health challenge that they are facing right  now.   Leaders must lead. People are legitimately afraid, but we have to  work together to address this issue.                            ____________________
