 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my first amendment will strike title V of  division B of this bill.   Throughout this debate, I have heard my friends across the aisle  argue that the bill before us today is a reasonable attempt to reform  our permitting system. Unfortunately, this bill closely resembles a  wish list for Big Oil and their lobbyists.   This amendment would strike one of the most egregious portions of the  bill that would undo many of the reforms we made last Congress to  ensure that the American people see a better return on our public lands  and waters. We should all be able to agree that the American people  deserve a fair deal when it comes to the use of our cherished public  lands.   For far too long, our oil and gas leasing program has offered a  sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry at the expense of  taxpayers. One fossil fuel company even went so far as to outline in a  press release the many benefits of extraction on public land compared  to private land. Their release highlighted that leases on public lands  are cheaper, last longer, and are more expansive.   While these statements may be music to the ears of those who care  most about Big Oil interests, they represent a raw and an unfair deal  for the American people.   Increasing the royalty rate to a fair level--that is all we are  asking, a fair level--will generate billions of dollars in revenue for  taxpayers. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional  Budget Office both agree and have suggested that it is good policy.   That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Restoring Community  Input and Public Protections in Oil and Gas Leasing Act to protect  taxpayers by eliminating noncompetitive oil and gas leasing and raising  the onshore oil and gas royalty rate, rental fee, and minimum bid  amount.   I am proud that the Inflation Reduction Act includes significant  provisions of that bill, including eliminating noncompetitive leasing  for oil and gas sales, raising annual rental rates, and increasing the  minimum bid for public lands. These commonsense reforms were simply  long-overdue fixes to create more balanced fiscal terms and bring  Federal lands in line with what States and private landowners already  charge.   Before the IRA, the fiscal terms for public lands leasing and  drilling were, in some cases, over 100 years old. For decades, these  outdated rates and fees allowed oil CEOs to lease public lands for  pennies on the dollar and unfairly increase their profits at the  expense of taxpayers.   Even after the IRA, States like Texas and Oklahoma still charge  higher royalty rates on their State lands than are charged on Federal  public lands.   According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, these updated fiscal terms  included in the IRA will not raise prices  [[Page H1612]]  at the pump or consumer energy prices, but they will raise billions of  dollars in additional revenue that could go toward our funding  education, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements that benefit  everyone, not just oil and gas companies.                                time  2000    Unfortunately, the bill before us today would also reinstate  noncompetitive leasing, an indefensible practice.   The Government Accountability Office also found that 99 percent of  noncompetitive leases issued between 2003 and 2009 never produced oil  and gas during their 10-year lease terms. The reason why these lands  were not put into production is that they are leased in areas where  there is virtually no likelihood of development.   At its core, noncompetitive leasing is a wasteful practice that  forces the Bureau of Land Management to expend limited public agency  time and resources administering leases that hardly ever generate  returns for taxpayers. It encourages oil and gas companies to buy up  lands they will never use to pad their portfolios and appease  shareholders, contributing to the 12.3 million acres of leased public  lands that these companies are currently sitting on and not using.   Instead of maintaining these commonsense reforms and protecting the  interests of American taxpayers, title V of the bill before us today  would undo all of these reforms and provide a gift to oil and gas  interests. By rolling back these reforms, the majority is proposing  policies that would only pad Big Oil's pocketbooks even further and  increase our Federal deficit by $160 million over 10 years, according  to the Congressional Budget Office, even as companies like ExxonMobil  and Shell are announcing record profits.   By striking this title, we can put these dollars back in the pockets  of the American people and protect commonsense reforms that are finally  ensuring that Federal taxpayers receive a fair return on any private  profit that oil and gas companies extract from our public lands.   I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American people and stand  against our increasing national debt by supporting this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment simply requires Federal  agencies to certify that they have the staffing capacity to meet the  new environmental timelines established under this bill.   According to the Government Accountability Office, the main reason  for project delays at the Federal level is a lack of agency resources  and staff capacity. Thankfully, we helped address this challenge by  securing $1 billion in the IRA to ensure Federal agencies have the  resources and expertise to conduct efficient environmental reviews.   A trained, equipped workforce is essential to processing  environmental reviews in a timely fashion in cases where there are  delays. Increasing the funding and staff for Federal agencies'  permitting offices and agency workforce training is already making the  permitting process significantly more effective and efficient in a  responsible way.   Unfortunately, instead of building on the progress we made in the  Inflation Reduction Act and supporting agencies' capacity to conduct  reviews by providing additional resources, H.R. 1 takes the more  politically expedient but impractical approach of simply forcing  agencies onto stricter timelines for reviews without providing  additional resources for Federal agencies to conduct these reviews.   By instituting these strict deadlines and limiting opportunities for  community input throughout this bill, I am worried that instead of  leading to more efficient project reviews and approvals, H.R. 1 may  actually lead to sloppier and rushed reviews. When environmental  reviews are not thorough, projects often face a litany of time- consuming lawsuits and litigation.   As some may know, I used to work on clean energy projects before  coming to Congress, and my own experience is that detailed  environmental reviews and a thoughtful permitting process alongside  early engagement with impacted communities can facilitate more  efficient completion of projects and better overall outcomes.   This amendment would help support efficient reviews by requiring that  the Council on Environmental Quality in consultation with affected  Federal agencies certify that all agencies have the funding and  staffing capacity to meet the new timelines for environmental review  required under the bill.   It is common sense that we should not be instituting arbitrary  timelines if agencies don't have the necessary resources to meet them.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that affected  agencies have the resources needed to conduct high-quality reviews,  which will lead to better overall project outcomes.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
