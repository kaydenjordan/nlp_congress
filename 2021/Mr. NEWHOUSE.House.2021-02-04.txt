 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, in the first days of his administration,  President Biden has taken a record-breaking number of executive actions  and he has signed more executive orders than any President in recent  history.   I am very proud this evening to be joined by some of my colleagues  from the Congressional Western Caucus. As a group, we represent  constituents across the country who have been negatively impacted by  these actions of President Biden.   On his very first day in office, the President signed an executive  order to  [[Page H366]]  revoke the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. This  innovative, first-of-its-kind energy project has been in the works for  years with local communities, numerous States, and even our neighbor to  the north, Canada, investing heavily in its creation.   Also, on day one, President Biden directed his Acting Secretary of  the Interior to issue a 60-day moratorium on new oil and gas leases on  Federal lands. And then if that weren't enough, to complete the one-two  punch, a week later, he extended that moratorium indefinitely.   Madam Speaker, I am confident my colleagues will echo this sentiment:  It is unconscionable that President Biden would, during a global  pandemic, eliminate thousands of jobs and prevent the creation of  thousands more with one flick of his pen.   As you will hear from my colleagues, this action was thoughtless and  devastating to the hundreds of communities and the millions of  Americans who rely on the oil and gas industry, from labor unions,  local small businesses, to rural school districts, conservationists,  people all over the country.   His long-term goals may very well be well-intentioned, but, Madam  Speaker, right now, in communities across the country, jobs, revenue,  and investment are lost. They have just disappeared.   Madam Speaker, what does President Biden propose to do in the  meantime? This truly can be described as an attack on American energy  and American workers.   Over the last 4 years during the Trump administration, the United  States has made huge strides toward energy independence, becoming the  largest net exporter of energy in the world.   President Biden's actions will unilaterally undo this progress. It  will threaten our energy security and leave thousands of hardworking  American men and women without a job. President Biden has acted without  any input or meaningful debate from the Members of this Congress who  represent the people who are most affected by his orders.   Madam Speaker, tonight, we are here to make our voices and their  voices heard. I am proud to be joined, as I said, with many of the  outstanding members of the Congressional Western Caucus, and we have a  lot of them who have a lot of great things to say.   My first guest is a new member of our executive committee. He comes  from the State of Minnesota, where at least 50,000 jobs are supported  by mining in his home State, a tremendous amount of economic activity.   So I am very pleased to yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).    Thank you, Congressman Stauber, in helping to put a  human face onto the issue that we are speaking about. The real cost to  American citizens, the loss of jobs cannot be understated and the  impact to our communities and to families across this country. So thank  you very much.   Madam Speaker, a lot of States will be impacted. The whole country  will be. I am going to turn to someone from the great State of Texas,  but you probably know this already: This ban from President Biden will  eliminate 2 million jobs in the oil and gas industry in Texas alone--in  one State.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), from  the Houston area, representing, I think, probably the epicenter of  petroleum refining in this country, another fine Member of our Western  Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Babin. I thank him  for explaining to us and helping us understand the pipeline industry  and what that does for our country, how it improves safety, and,  certainly, our care for the environment as well.   Madam Speaker, I next turn to one to our newest Members--new to our  caucus, but also to the House of Representatives--a young lady from the  State of New Mexico. Yvette Herrell is doing just a great job in the  short time that she has been here with us.   And let me just tell you a little bit about New Mexico. If you want  an example of a State that is reliant on this industry, oil and gas,  you have to look no farther than New Mexico.   You can correct me if I am wrong, but at least 134,000 jobs are  supported by that industry. And I know it is a huge part of your  State's economy.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.  Herrell).   Congresswoman Herrell, thank you very much for being with us.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Herrell. I  appreciate her helping us understand the impact on the State of New  Mexico, not just jobs but schools as well--$1 billion cost to the  school districts of your State. I just can't imagine the long-term,  detrimental impacts that that will bring.   Speaking of that, I turn to another gentleman from the State of  Texas, someone I got to know very well on the Committee on Rules.    Michael Burgess represents his district in Texas, and similar to what  we just heard from New Mexico, I believe Texas school districts also,  through property taxes on oil and gas production, on pipelines, on gas  utilities receive at least $1 billion a year as well.   Dr. Burgess, thank you so much for being here this evening and  helping us tell the American people the real impact of these decisions.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I think you are starting to get the  message that it is clear: This is going to impact every citizen of this  country. These wrongheaded decisions are impacting our way of life, our  cost of living in so many different ways.   I don't know what the next speaker is going to talk about for sure,  but I will make a guess that Bruce Westerman, who is our new ranking  member of the Committee on Natural Resources, hailing from the State of  Arkansas, may talk about a tree. I am not sure about that, but  certainly, the natural resource impacts here are going to be real, and  I always say people may not understand that. But we passed a huge bill  last Congress--I am sure you remember the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--which was part of a bigger piece of legislation. Well, guess  where a lot of that money comes from to make that happen? It is from  oil and gas leases. And I think the great State of Arkansas is set to  get a lot of money in 2021 from that fund. And this is going to have an  impact there.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman), and thank him not only for his partnership and his activity  and work on the Western Caucus, but also on the Committee on Natural  Resources.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Westerman. I  appreciate that very much, and I thank him for getting in that word  ``tree.'' I appreciate that very much and for really helping us  understand the true impacts not only to our economy but to our  environment of these kinds of decisions.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany),  another W State, which we have to stick together, a strong member of  the Congressional Western Caucus. He comes from a State that also is  set to receive a tremendous amount of funding through the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, which, again, is financed through oil and gas  leases.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Tiffany for participating this  evening, and I appreciate him being here.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Tiffany. Well- spoken. The economy, jobs, the environment, schools, national security,  the impacts of these decisions are far and wide across this country.   One of the great things about a citizen legislative body is that we  are made up of individuals from all walks of life, and I am very proud  that we have, on the Western Caucus, a new member to the caucus and  also a new member of our executive committee, but also someone whose  family is one of these people who we are talking about whose jobs will  be impacted by these decisions.   Madam Speaker, I am anxious to hear from our new Member from  Colorado, and I thank her very much for being a part of this  discussion, coming from a State that has tens of thousands of jobs that  rely on this industry.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Boebert. I  appreciate her strong voice on behalf of not only the people she  represents, but people all over the country. I thank her for those very  valuable comments.   Madam Speaker, as you can already tell, we have a very strong class  of new Members this year. I would like to turn to another who comes  from the State of Utah, a State that I don't think is the highest with  Federal land ownership, but pretty darn close. Sixty-three percent, I  understand, of the land in  [[Page H370]]  Blake Moore's State is under Federal ownership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore). I know  he has a great perspective on this issue, and I am very anxious to  welcome him and give him the floor so that he can share with us his  thoughts.                                time  2045     Madam Speaker, I appreciate that very much.   Continuing a theme of our strong freshman class, I turn to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann). This is kind of news to me. I didn't  realize that Kansas is such a major producer of energy. I think of  Kansas as wheat and corn, but energy is an important part of the  economy. I don't think a lot of Americans understand truly the impact  of these decisions in other States. I thank Congressman Mann for  participating tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congressman Mann's  involvement in the Western Caucus.   The voices we have are strong, and we will continue to speak loudly  and clearly about the impact of some of these decisions.   Madam Speaker, you probably have guessed that the State of Texas has  been impacted tremendously by these decisions. I am very pleased to  have a gentleman from the State of Texas. Congressman Chip Roy is  someone whom I have come to know and respect for his clearheaded  thinking on so many different issues, and I know he can speak firsthand  about the oil and gas industry and the impact to our economy.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Roy's strong voice and  leadership on the Republican Conference. I appreciate very much his  being part of this evening's discussion. Words couldn't be truer.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for your attention and listening  to the message that we have.   Let me ask you a question: Could you imagine if former President  Trump had signed an executive order during the middle of this pandemic  to unilaterally kill thousands of jobs?   What would you say would happen?   It would be a national outrage.   Well, President Biden's reckless executive actions are a national  outrage. As you have heard, Americans in rural communities across the  country--in fact, in urban areas, too--will suffer because of this ban.   The Western Caucus advocates for responsible land and resource  management. I can assure you that we will continue to be a strong voice  for rural America. We will do everything in our power to fight for  their livelihoods in the face of these devastating decisions by  President Biden. So we--I, tonight, call on President Biden to please  revoke and reverse these actions.   I appreciate your attention, Madam Speaker, and the opportunity to  express our views on this very important issue, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
