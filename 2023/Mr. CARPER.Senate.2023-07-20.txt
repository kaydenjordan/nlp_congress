 Mr. President, while the Senator from Massachusetts is  still on the floor, he and I have been friends for, gosh, 35 years. We  served together in the House. We used to travel all over Latin America  and South America during the contra war. We are still friends and  compadres today in a different war--a war to save or planet and to make  sure that we do that and that we provide a lot of jobs and economic  opportunity.   I am here to talk about the nomination of David Uhlmann to serve as  Assistant Administrator. But before I do that, let me say that, among  the most important things that we are working on--it is not  legislation, but it is legislation that we have already passed. And it  is the climate provisions that are part of the bipartisan  infrastructure bill that we adopted and the President signed a year  ago. And there are climate provisions there that are enormously  important, and we want to make sure that that legislation is fully  enacted. Part of that is the responsibility of the administration, but  it is the chair's responsibility. So that is hugely important.    The other thing that is hugely important is the implementation of the  Inflation Reduction Act, which has extraordinary provisions that deal  with climate change, sea level, and all.   So it is not enough just to introduce legislation. It is not enough  to enact legislation. We have to make sure it is implemented, and that  is what our responsibilities and our oversight responsibilities  include.   Having said that, I want to rise today in support of the nomination  of David Uhlmann to serve as Assistant Administrator for the EPA's  Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.   Over the last 6 years, some of our greatest achievements--some of  Congress's greatest achievements--have been passed in a series of  bedrock environmental laws. I just mentioned a couple of them a minute  ago. They are laws that have revolutionized how to protect our natural  environment and our people--people who live in this country and around  the world--from the dangers of pollution.   These laws, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act-- also known as CERCLA--have made the air that we breathe cleaner, the  water that we drink safer, and the lands that we live on healthier. And  in the process, we have revolutionized ecosystems, we have improved the  living conditions of entire communities throughout this country, and we  have saved countless of lives.   However, these indispensable lifesaving environmental laws are only  as effective, as I have mentioned, as our ability to enforce them and  to make sure that they are complied with. And in the years immediately  before President Biden took office, enforcement of our environmental  laws had been dramatically undermined.   According to the data from EPA, between 2018 and, I think, 2021,  environmental enforcement and compliance actions had fallen to half of  what they had been during the Bush and the Obama administrations. This  lack of enforcement presented a threat to public health and a threat to  the well-being of our environment, potentially letting many big  polluters off the hook after violating some of the fundamental bedrock  and environmental laws.   That is why I am so pleased the Senate is again taking up the  nomination of David Uhlmann to serve as the EPA's top enforcement  officer, leading the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.  There has not been a Senate-confirmed official leading the EPA's  enforcement efforts for far too long.   As I said before, Mr. Uhlmann is exceptionally qualified to do this  job. He brings to this position a long career that includes 17 years  with the Department of Justice, serving in both Democratic and  Republican administrations.   Let me say that again: a 17-year career with the Department of  Justice, serving in both Democrat and Republican administrations.   During seven of those years served, Mr. Uhlmann served as the Chief  of the Department of Justice's Environmental Crimes Section. In  addition, Mr. Uhlmann's nomination is supported by five former EPA  Administrators, including three who served under Republican  administrations.   I am going to say that again. Mr. Uhlmann's nomination has earned the  support of five former EPA Administrators, including three who served  under Republican administrations: William Reilly, Lee Thomas, and  Christine Todd Whitman.   His nomination also earned the support of dozens of other former  senior EPA and DOJ officials--some from Democratic administrations,  others from Republican administrations, and some from career officials.   In the words of former Deputy Attorney General for President George  W. Bush, Larry Thomson, this what he had to say about David Uhlmann:         David is a top-notch environmental lawyer and an       outstanding leader with unsurpassed integrity, compassion,       and commitment to fairness.    I wish that we could say that about all of us. Those are high words  of praise. In fact, Mr. Uhlmann received bipartisan support from the  majority of this body nearly 1 year ago when we voted to discharge his  nomination from the Environment and Public Works Committee.   Let me close by saying that I am confident that David Uhlmann will  make an outstanding--an outstanding--Assistant Administrator for  [[Page S3444]]  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. I am eager to see him  confirmed. I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting his  nomination.   I yield the floor.
