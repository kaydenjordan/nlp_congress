 Madam President, last week, most of my friends on the  left pretended to be shocked by a new CNN poll that proved what a lot  of Tennesseans have known for quite a while, and it is that Joe Biden  and his agenda with the Biden administration is truly upside down with  the American people.   Here is what we found out: Fifty-eight percent of the American people  disapprove of the way he is handling his job as President. That alone  is really an indictment on what they have been putting forward, but it  gets a little bit worse. Sixty-two percent disapprove of how he has  mishandled the economy.   Fifty-seven percent think his approach to fighting crime is not  working. They believe that because they are seeing it in their streets  in their hometowns.   Fifty-five percent don't like how he is responding to Xi Jinping.  Fifty-six percent are worried about how he is handling Putin, and I am  sure that number, in particular, will go up before the next poll comes  out.   These numbers are brutal, but here is the cherry on top. Fifty-seven  percent believe Biden's first year in office has been a total failure;  and when asked whether or not Joe Biden's government represents the  views of people like themselves, 68 percent of the people polled said,  No, Joe Biden and his administration do not represent my views.   It is pretty simple--the American people are not buying what Joe  Biden and this administration are selling. And the people in the White  House seem to put their hands up, and they just cannot figure this out.  They can't understand why the people won't just shut up and do what  they are told.   Here is the secret: It is because when the people look at  Washington--when Tennesseans look at Washington, and they look at who  is in charge of our government--and Democrats have control of the  House, the Senate, the White House--all they see is an empty suit with  an agenda.   There is no vision, but there is agenda. They have got the to-do  list. They have got the list of boxes they need to check off. We killed  the Keystone Pipeline. We put mandates in place. We have got people in  masks. We have got people in lockdowns. They are going to lose their  job if they don't go get a jab. They have got an agenda.   For all of his bluster about fundamentally transforming our way of  life, all Joe Biden has managed to do is to alienate his fellow  countrymen.   Now, his allies are trying to turn the tide by revamping their  talking points. But here is the problem: It won't work, because this  administration--the Biden administration--does not have a messaging  problem. Their problem is their agenda that they have that is  lackluster with no vision.   But the American people are paying attention to this. And you know  what they are seeing? I have to tell you, it really frightens them. It  frightens them.   Doesn't matter if I go to one of the grandkids' ballgames, go to  church, go  [[Page S661]]  to the grocery store, run some errands, I am hearing from people what  they see happening. The cramdown, the control, it frightens them.   And there is no distracting them from the fact that the President is  weaponizing this liberal wish list against what they have as the vision  for their future, for their children, for their family.   For the past year, Tennesseans have watched Biden dodge and weave and  ignore what the people are telling him--the people are telling him.  Democrats in Washington have treated their political rivals like  enemies and accused them of racism, treachery, all for the crime of  drawing a line in the sand and saying no.   It is amazing. I wish some of my colleagues did want to stand up for  freedom. The people deserve better than that. And I will tell you what,  they know it. No talking point is going to convince them to tolerate  the intolerable from their government. And, yes, inflation, mandates,  lockdowns, the open border, crime in the street, the debacle of  Afghanistan, problems with Russia, the situation with Russia, Ukraine,  China, Iran, the list grows every single day--every single day.   It is the wrong agenda. As I said, it lacks vision. At the beginning  of these remarks, I said that the liberals pretended to be shocked by  Biden's terrible poll numbers, and I stand by that statement because  the truth is the White House, my Democratic colleagues, and their  allies in the media know that they are kind of circling the drain when  it comes to what they are pushing forward on the people.   But for some reason, they think that just one more power grab is  going to do the trick. It will be the magic bullet. That certainly is a  tactic, but it also will fail because the people know that it is the  people of this country that have built this country. And it is built on  a foundation that treasures faith, family, freedom, hope, and  opportunity.   And if you have got an agenda and a checklist and a to-do list, but  you have no vision for a better future, the American people will not  buy what you are selling.   I yield the floor.
