 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA  Act, which would provide badly needed resources to civil society actors  in Burma and impose sanctions on the Burmese military for upending  years of progress, democracy, and human rights for a self-serving and  brutal agenda of repression and violence.   Having visited Burma, I have seen the strength of its people as they  have struggled to create and sustain democracy.   Now, under the authoritarian Tatmadaw, the divisions, prejudices, and  violence have been exacerbated and progress has been reversed.   The Rohingya and other vulnerable populations continue to be  displaced and assaulted. Journalists are purposely targeted for  harassment and violence.   The political opposition has faced unspeakable violence and  imprisonment.   We must commit to holding those responsible for the collapse of  democracy and human rights to account, and we must support those that  are working in dangerous circumstances to reestablish the rule of law.   As we continue to work against global authoritarianism and for  democracy and human rights around the world, let us stand shoulder to  shoulder with the people of Burma and their struggle for freedom.                            ____________________
