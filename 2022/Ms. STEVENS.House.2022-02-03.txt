 Madam Speaker, I rise solemnly today, at the start of  this new year, to draw attention to an appalling national benchmark.  This is Gun Violence Survivors Week, the time of year that gun deaths  in America surpass the number of gun deaths that most other countries  will mourn at the end of the year, if at all.   Madam Speaker, 2022 is barely underway, and yet, here we are.  Exceptional in the most disastrous and yet unacceptable way, already at  a completely incomprehensible count of lives lost to the scourge of gun  violence in the country. Gun violence leaves a mark on each individual  and community it impacts, and it spares none of our constituents and  none of our fellow countrymen and women.   Madam Speaker, this week, I am thinking about the students and  parents back home in Michigan, in Oakland County, who can no longer  distinguish between a practice exercise and an active shooter scenario  in our schools. The threats have been perpetual, and the violence has  become too real for far too many.   So we join in this House of Representatives to commit to acting on  gun safety legislation. For those who are not working for it, are  working against it.                            ____________________
