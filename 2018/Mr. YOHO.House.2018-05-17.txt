 Mr. Chairman, this is a farm policy. The farm policy is  there to produce a policy so that the American farmers can go out and  raise crops for the United States of America to continue to produce the  highest quality, the most abundant, and the cheapest food produced in  the world of any industrialized nation. That is why we have a farm  policy.   This amendment of Ms. Foxx goes after the American farmers for the  betterment of multinational soda companies and candy companies, and the  price of sugar won't go down. In my hometown, a 4-pound bag of sugar  costs $2.64.   I would ask every Member of Congress: How many constituents in your  district have come up to you and pleaded for you to do something about  the cost of sugar?                                time  1530    This is about the American farmer, not about candy companies and soda  companies. It is misdirected. I oppose it and strongly advise everybody  to vote against it.
