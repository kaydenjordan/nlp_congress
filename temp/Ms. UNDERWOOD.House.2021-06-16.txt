 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to pass  the For the People Act, or H.R. 1.   This urgently needed legislation would fight corruption and the  overwhelming influence of money in politics by strengthening ethics  rules and reforming our campaign finance system.   It would protect the foundation of our democracy, the right to vote,  at a time when it is under attack in many States.   I am proud that my home State of Illinois is not one of them. In  fact, our legislature recently voted to expand ballot access. But for  those who aren't lucky enough to live in Illinois, H.R. 1 is a much- needed defense against widespread voter suppression.   As the Senate considers these long-overdue reforms, I rise today,  here in the House of Representatives, to insist that representation  matters.   That is Congress' role in our representative democracy: to represent  the American people. If the Members elected to this Chamber don't  represent the diversity of the American people's backgrounds and their  experiences, we can't do a good job of representing their perspectives  and advocating for their needs.   Consider that women make up just over a quarter of the 117th  Congress, and that is the highest percentage it has ever been. We see  the effects of this lack of diversity in the way our government works  for women, or, rather, the fact that it doesn't work for women.   Women have been hit harder than men by job loss during the pandemic.  This is partly because women still do more childcare than men, and the  pandemic triggered a childcare crisis. But this doesn't come out of  nowhere. It is a result of chronic failure to address areas that  disproportionately impact women.   Because women haven't had a seat at the table, our needs have been  sidelined. As a result, everybody loses, not just women. All Americans  are part of an economy that depends on childcare to function.   It is no coincidence that the Biden-Harris administration's bold plan  to invest in human infrastructure comes just months after our first  female Vice President was sworn in. This is just one of many instances  in which everybody benefits when different perspectives and life  experiences are represented in our elected leadership.   When we talk about candidate diversity, we are talking about growing  our economy, improving childcare, and strengthening our infrastructure.  Good policy starts with good representation.   H.R. 1 will give Americans the government we deserve by enabling us  to elect people who truly represent us.   One of the most important provisions in the bill for improving  representation is the creation of a small-donor public financing  program.                                time  1030    In the States and cities where it is already in use, public financing  is popular because it empowers candidates to get their message out to  voters, even if  [[Page H2825]]  they don't have deep pockets or corporate connections.   But the Brennan Center for Justice found that public financing  doesn't just increase the socioeconomic diversity of candidates for  public office, it also boosts racial and gender diversity.   That is why I introduced an amendment to H.R. 1 to include an  assessment of the impact on candidate diversity in the required report  to Congress on the new public financing program, and I am grateful that  my colleagues voted to pass my amendment.   This is personal for me because I firmly believe that we can have a  Congress that looks like America if we just give people a fair shot.   I became the first woman and the first person of color to represent  my district because I refused to be counted out as unelectable in my  own community. I know that women and people of color are electable  everywhere. No seat in Congress should be deemed out of reach for  certain types of candidates.   When everybody has a fair shot, all candidates are electable, and  small donor public financing gives people that fair shot. Small donor  public financing and the other crucial reforms in H.R. 1 would make our  representative democracy both more representative and more democratic.  In other words, it would make America more American, aligning our  system of government with our highest national values.   So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass the For the People Act  with the small donor public financing program intact and help America  live up to our values.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and  my amendment with Representatives Frankel, Nadler, Speier, and Blunt  Rochester, which would require public companies to report on workplace  harassment settlements in their SEC filings.   The amendment is pulled from the EMPOWER Act, a bipartisan bill I am  proud to co-lead alongside Congresswoman Frankel and my Republican and  Democratic colleagues.   For too long, many employers have tolerated, and even encouraged, a  culture of secrecy surrounding workplace harassment, writing  settlements off as a cost of doing business.   This amendment would shine a light on major employers that fail to  protect their employees, improve transparency for shareholders, and  encourage companies to ensure a safe, healthy, and productive  workplace.   This is an important bipartisan policy, and I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on the amendment and the underlying bill.
