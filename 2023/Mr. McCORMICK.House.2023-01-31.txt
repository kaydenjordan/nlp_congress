 Madam Speaker, this week, Americans are hearing about  yet another battle over the debt ceiling, a fiscal restraint that was  supposed to stop Congress from spending too much.   Every couple of years, Congress basically gives itself a free pass  and votes to raise the debt ceiling, kicking the can down the road.  With a national debt over $31 trillion, this is a game our country  cannot afford to keep playing.   Today, President Biden is set to miss his budget deadline as required  by law for the third consecutive year. I would love to see us actually  handle the budget one item at a time rather than in a typical omnibus.   Vilification of debt control and protecting our future generations is  not where this discussion should start. We are not going to get rid of  this deficit in 1 year, but we can get rid of something this year. Can  we at least have a small step toward reducing our national debt for the  future of our children?   Hardworking American families have balanced budgets every month,  every year, and they deserve a government that does the same.                            ____________________     Well, sir, you asked for a physician to stand. I am a  physician. I am an emergency medicine physician who served during the  entire COVID pandemic from before the pandemic began.   I am sure I was exposed to it over a thousand times with thousands of  patients that I treated for COVID, some of which I intubated.   We had healthcare workers who had decades of experience exposed over  and over again before there even was a vaccination. People went home  sick. They had fevers.   It may surprise you that I was never tested for COVID. Not in the  entire career that I have had as an emergency physician have I ever  been tested for COVID.   I came to work time and time again, putting my life on the line. I  lost friends. I watched people put their lives on the line and come to  work when everybody else got to call in or stay home based on  congressional mandates or congressional exceptions because we were  essential, because we understand our profession.   We understand how important it is to public service, to save lives,  to learn and to continue to grow, to have the debate over what would  and would not work for patients, and we evolved.   It wasn't just one size fits all for medicine. People are not treated  the same because people are different. Different exposures require  different treatments.   Once you have had the disease, you develop an immunity. If you have  immunity, and you are exposed to a vaccination within a certain time,  you can have a hyperimmune response that can be harmful.   This is not taken into account by congressional people who do not  understand medicine, who have not been to medical school, who have not  had a residency, who have not had decades of experience either as a  doctor, a nurse, a mid-level, or some other healthcare professional who  understands healthcare far more than anybody who sits in these seats,  who have never treated one patient or read one book or had one test  concerning the outcome of a patient. They have never held the hand of a  patient who is dying.    So, I would challenge you, sir, to consider a  healthcare professional, when they get to determine their own fate as  they continue to put their lives on the line to serve the very people  that we are supposed to be serving here in Congress.
