 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R.  7910.   I thought I would take this opportunity to do my own fact check on  some of the inaccurate claims my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle presented at last week's markup.   My Democrat colleagues will often claim there are loopholes in the  current background check system, sometimes specifically citing the  Charleston loophole. This is simply not true. Federal firearms  licensees cannot transfer a firearm without performing a background  check on the purchaser.   The FBI is notified immediately if a prohibited person attempts to  purchase a weapon, and the FBI has 3 days to follow up. The 3 days for  follow-up prevent the FBI from sitting on their hands and not following  through with background checks as a way to deny a person a firearm by  bureaucracy and, therefore, take away their Second Amendment rights.   Another claim frequently made by my colleagues is that banning so- called assault weapons, a term they rarely define, would reduce mass  shootings. Despite automatic weapons already being illegal to the  general public, the left uses the term ``assault weapons'' to describe  scary-looking guns, regardless of the actual characteristics of the  firearm. Even weapons mischaracterized as assault weapons are used in  less than 1 percent of all homicides.   Many of my colleagues claim mandating so-called safe storage of  firearms is a commonsense approach to reducing gun violence. Not only  does a requirement to keep a firearm within the home unloaded or locked  up not comply with Supreme Court precedent, but it also puts them at a  disadvantage.   Listen, if you want to accomplish something today, pass what many  States have done, and that is to make resources available to secure  schools. Madam Speaker, $100 million, and over 1,300 Wisconsin schools  have removed themselves from the list of the most vulnerable with State  dollars. Let's do that today and really accomplish something.
