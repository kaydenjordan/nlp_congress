 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch     Mr. President, yesterday Judge Neil Gorsuch went through  over 11 hours of questioning in the Judiciary Committee. As expected,  he used the opportunity to speak at length about his knowledge of case  law, hiding behind precedents rather than giving an impression of his  actual views. As expected, his supporters are saying that Judge Gorsuch  was erudite, polished, homespun. But none of this matters compared to  the real purpose of hearings: to find out a nominee's views and what  kind of judge he will be, not how his repartee from the bench will  sound.   For 11 hours, Judge Gorsuch looked like he was playing dodgeball with  the Senate Judiciary Committee, bending over backward to avoid  revealing anything that might constitute a judicial philosophy or give  hints about his approach to the legal issues of our day. Those, to me,  are far more important than any superficial impressions he may have  left. He dodged questions on previous cases like Citizens United, Rowe  v. Wade, and Brown v. Board. He dodged general questions on dark money  in politics, LGBTQ rights, and the constitutionality of a Muslim ban.   He did manage to wax poetic on the significance of a judge's robe and  the humility it brings. He said it reminds us that ``ours is a  judiciary of honest black polyester.'' Well, if he were truly humbled,  he would realize the augustness of this position and answer questions  directly. Judge Gorsuch's testimony yesterday was replete with humble  kinds of metaphors and homespun stories but pitifully short on  substance, which is what really matters.   The hearings this week are starting to have the element of farce. The  Republicans ask softball questions, while we Democrats endeavor to get  the judge to offer a meaningful response on one--any legal issue but  are met with constant refrains of ``That is settled law'' and ``I can't  prejudge'' and ``Gee, Senator, my personal views have no place here.''  Let me repeat. There is no legal precedent, rule, or logic for failing  to answer questions that don't involve immediate and specific cases  before the Court. Is Judge Gorsuch hiding behind this rhetoric because  he does not want people to know his views?   After 4 days of this Kabuki theatre, the press will write that Judge  Gorsuch was smooth and well-spoken, but I doubt that even at the end of  the hearing process we will have any greater views of his  jurisprudence. Will we know any better than we do today what kind of  Justice he will be on our Nation's highest Court?   You know, we have seen this before. It was not all that long ago that  another charming, polished, erudite judge named John Roberts came  before the committee, impressing lawmakers while playing the role of a  model jurist. He displayed a similar reluctance to answer specific  questions, but he assured us all that he was a judge who was free from  the biases of politics and ideology, that, in his words, he simply  ``called balls and strikes.'' We were duped. Judge Roberts showed his  true activist colors as soon as he got to the bench and dragged the  Court sharply to the right, ruling consistently in favor of wealthy  special interests and powerful corporations. The whole episode with  Judge Gorsuch feels like a Roberts' rerun. If his voting record is any  indication, according to the New York Times survey, he will be even  more conservative than Justice Roberts.   This is not how the hearing process is supposed to work. Although it  has become practice for Supreme Court Justices to elude specific  questions, it is not in the best interests of our country to elevate a  cipher to the Supreme Court. We don't want the qualifications for  Senate confirmation to be an ability of skillful evasion. The hearing  process cannot accomplish what it is designed to if the nominee refuses  to engage on matters of legal substance.   If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch does not have strong views, that  he is not simply a caller of balls and strikes, a tabula rasa, just  look at the way he was chosen. He was supported and pushed by the  Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. Do they just call balls  and strikes, or do those two groups have an avowed interest in moving  the judiciary far to the right? He was supported by billionaires like  Mr. Anschutz who have a similar desire. Does anyone think the  Federalist Society would choose someone who just called balls and  strikes when they have been dedicated for a generation to moving the  courts to the right? They have not endorsed a moderate judge in their  history. Again, they are dedicated to moving the court far away from  the mainstream.   If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch would be an activist judge with  strong conservative views eschewing the interests of average people,  just look at how he was selected--by the Federalist Society, by the  Heritage foundation, not by average American jurists.                                  TrumpCare    Mr. President, on another matter, TrumpCare, as we speak, the House  Republican leadership is desperately trying to whip enough votes to  pass their bill tomorrow, making sweetheart deals to sway recalcitrant  Members.   It is funny that all the changes House Republicans have made this  past week don't even attempt to address the real problems with the  bill: that 24 million fewer Americans will have coverage and that  premiums will go up. In fact, the changes they are making to TrumpCare  are even more cruel than their existing bill in an attempt to win  conservative votes. Still, many of them don't think it is cruel enough  yet. In their rush, they included language in their managers' amendment  that would exclude 7 million or so veterans from the eligibility for  tax credits in the bill--7 million veterans. That is what happens when  you try to rush a complicated bill like this through.   When Democrats were in the majority and working through healthcare,  we debated the bill over the course of a whole year. We had one of the  longest committee hearings and amendment processes in recent memory.  Still, even then, Republicans criticized us for trying to jam it  through. ``Read the bill,'' they would chant.   Now Republicans are trying to do in 2 weeks what we spent 1 year on  because the time was required. My friend the distinguished majority  leader says he hopes to have TrumpCare brought up and passed through  the Senate by the end of next week--no committee process, potentially  no CBO score.   I guess Senate Republicans are negotiating a substitute bill behind  closed doors right now to meet that accelerated, speedy, and reckless  timeline. When you are talking about a drastic reformation of our  healthcare system, one-sixth of our economy, that is breathtakingly  irresponsible and rankly hypocritical. When will Democrats get to view  the substitute bill? Will there be a CBO score before both Republicans  and Democrats have to vote on it in the Senate? We don't know. But  rushing it through in this fashion, as the majority leader promised, is  unwise and unfair to Democratic Senators and, far more importantly, to  the American people. It is also a direct contradiction to how then- Minority Leader McConnell spoke about health reform in 2009. Here is  what he said: ``We shouldn't try to do it in the dark, and whatever  final bill is produced should be available to the American public and  to members of the Senate for enough time to come to grips with it, and  there should be and must be a CBO score.''   Well, Leader McConnell, what was good enough for us back in 2009  should be good enough for you today.   I certainly hope Leader McConnell follows his own advice from 2009  now that he is majority leader.  [[Page S1903]]    My Republican friends like to claim this bill isn't the end of the  story on healthcare. They claim they can pass a third prong later on  down the road. Republicans in the Senate and the House should know  this: There is no third prong. It is a fantasy.   Any legislation outside of reconciliation requires 60 votes, and  Democrats will not help Republicans repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act today, tomorrow, or 6 months from now. This bill, TrumpCare,  Republicans, is your one shot.   I think that is why House Republicans have tried to jam some extra  policy changes onto their bill--like the Medicaid work requirement and  the restrictions on abortion--because they know they won't be able to  later on, and they need more conservative votes to pass this bill  tomorrow.   This approach has a serious problem. There is a serious question as  to whether these changes are budgetary changes or policy changes. If  they are policy changes, they will not meet the Senate's standards of  reconciliation, known as the Byrd rule, and can be stricken from the  bill.   Of particular vulnerability, my Republican colleagues, are provisions  like the Medicaid work requirement and the restrictions on abortion.  House Republicans should hear this before they vote: Those provisions  that you might think help you vote yes on the bill may not survive.  Factor that into your vote.   Ahead of the vote tomorrow, I just want to say to my Republican  colleagues--and I have sympathy, although I don't agree. I vehemently  disagree. I know you feel caught between a rock and a hard place,  between the prospect of failing to fulfill a shrill and unthought- through campaign pledge and a bill that would badly hurt millions of  Americans, particularly your voters.   I say to them: There is a way out. Drop your efforts to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, and Democrats will work with you on serious  proposals to improve the existing law. Drop TrumpCare. Come to us with  some ideas on how to improve the ACA, and we will sit down with you and  try to figure out what is best for our country. You can avoid this  disaster of a bill called TrumpCare, which will result in higher costs,  less care, and 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage. Turn  back before it is too late.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from West Virginia.
