 Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in  support of legislation that is critical to our democracy--the Freedom  to Vote Act. And this is a bill that was the product of work by many,  many Senators from across the country with different views but all  committed to one thing: our democracy.   And I want to thank Senator Schumer for bringing the group together  as well as the other Senators: Senator Manchin, whose name is on the  bill, whose experience as secretary of state really was so helpful to  us in forming this bill and also realizing the differences between so  many jurisdictions, including world jurisdictions, that have different  staffing levels and different needs; Senator Merkley, an expert on  election law; Senator Padilla, also a former secretary of state;  Senator King, bringing his independent spirit from the State of Maine;  Senator Kaine, former civil rights lawyer; Senator Tester, who sees  this and understands all of this firsthand in the State of Montana,  where, by the way, for decades they have had same-day registration,  which when you look at the States, whether they are red or blue--States  that have same-day registration, like my State--tend to have some of  the highest voter turnouts in the country, and, sadly, they have  disposed of that in the State of Montana recently; and Senator Warnock,  from the great State of Georgia, who was the host, along with Senator  Ossoff, of a Rules Committee field hearing we recently held in Georgia,  where we saw firsthand why so many leaders in the business community  across the country and in Georgia have voiced their concern about a  bill that recently passed there that would literally say that you  cannot vote on weekends during the runoff period, during a critical  period of votes in Georgia.   That was a group that came together, different views, different  levels of experience, but all committed to one idea: that democracy  will prevail.   The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms. That is  why this bill is called the Freedom to Vote Act. It ensures that people  are part of the franchise and that government is accountable to the  people, but this fundamental right that is the very foundation of our  system of government is under attack.   Since the 2020 election, we have seen a persistent and coordinated  assault on the freedom to vote in States across the country. These  attacks on our democracy demand a Federal response. The Constitution  anticipated that perhaps we would need a Federal response when, in the  words of the Constitution, as written by our Founding Fathers, that  Congress can make or alter the rules regarding Federal elections.   The need for action could not be more serious. It has been almost a  year since the violent mob of insurrectionists stormed into this  Chamber and desecrated our Capitol. They came into this very room,  rifled through the desks, were up there right on the dais where the  Presiding Officer now presides. They came here, but what they did was  not just an attack on a building, it was an attack on our Republic--an  attack on our Republic.   I still can picture it like it just happened. Senator Blunt and I  were the last two remaining Senators in the Chamber at 3:30 in the  morning, along with the incredible staff from the Parliamentarian's  office, with the pages, along with Vice President Pence, and the two  young women with that mahogany box filled with the remaining electoral  ballots. We made our way over to the House of Representatives, where  glass was smashed against the sides, where there was still spray paint  on statues and on columns, and we finished our job.   Two weeks later, as we stood on that inaugural stage--Democrat and  Republican leaders from both parties from this Chamber, all the  Senators from this Chamber, leaders nationally--Republicans, Democrats  stood on that  [[Page S9237]]  stage under that beautiful blue sky with little flakes of snow, and it  was like everything was in technicolor. I said that day, this is a  moment where democracy brushes itself off, stands straight and moves  forward, one Nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for  all.   Maybe I was naive. I thought this was the moment in the middle of  this raging pandemic that we were going to move forward as a country.  And we did, but lurking--lurking--in the background were claims, false,  incredibly dangerous claims that somehow the election was invalid and,  along with that, a coordinated effort across the country to introduce  bills--over 425 of them now--to make it harder, not easier, for people  to vote.   What has been the result of this democracy on fire? What happened  here in the Capitol is that canister of bear spray has been replaced by  bill after bill after bill. Those flagpoles that were used to poke and  jab at our brave officers who are here to defend us, resulting in  several of their deaths--that has been replaced by repeated efforts to  lie about the results of the election.   What has happened to our democracy? Members in this Chamber know  well. This year alone, Capitol Police have responded to nearly 9,000  threats against Members of Congress since the beginning of the year-- 9,000 threats. That is nearly double the threats faced by Members just  3 years ago.   Election officials across the country have also been targeted by an  overwhelming increase in the number of threats. Senator Blunt and I  held a Rules Committee hearing on this deeply disturbing trend this  fall. We heard from the Kentucky Republican secretary of state who said  if we do not act, States and localities will be unable to retain or  recruit people to administer future elections. He talked about the need  to make it very clear that local elected officials who are  administering the election should be safe; that they should not be  threatened.   Then we heard from others. Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner  Al Schmidt shared some of the horrifying threats that he and his family  have received after he stood up to lies about election fraud, including  a message that said: ``Tell the truth or your three kids will be  fatally shot,'' with the names of his 7-year-old son and his 11- and  14-year-old daughters, their address, photos of their house out on the  internet.   Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, received a voice mail saying:         I am a hunter--and I think you should be hunted.    These aren't just a few examples; this is happening across our  country. This is why we have united on this side of the aisle behind  the Freedom to Vote Act. It takes these threats against these election  officials head-on by establishing a right to vote and have every vote  counted and protects election officials from improper removal by  partisan actors. You have to have--malfeasance has to occur to be  removed.   There are protections against sham audits like the ones we saw in  Arizona and the ones being advanced in Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and  Pennsylvania and strengthens the protections for election workers by  making it a Federal crime to ``intimidate, threaten, or coerce''  election workers.   It was during Senator Bob Dole's funeral service in Washington that  President Biden reminded us what Senator Dole had once said. You see,  Senator Dole stood against the tide. He supported civil rights  legislation when that was a really hard thing to do. He supported the  Martin Luther King holiday. And the words he said at that time ring  true today. He said this:         No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class       citizens.        No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class       citizens.    His warning is exactly what is going on today: efforts to treat some  Americans as second-class citizens by making them stand for hours and  hours and hours to vote in lines; by telling them: Oh, by the way, you  are not going to be able to, like you did before, get water or food  from certain people who might give it to you while you are standing in  line. That is the story we heard in Georgia; by telling them--like a  bill that passed in Wisconsin that would have been put into law except  for the Governor there. It said we are only going to have one dropoff  box in the entire city of Milwaukee; or like what we saw in the last  election in Texas, in Harris County, a county that has about as much  people as my entire State: We are only going to have one dropoff box  there in that county; taking away options for registering to vote;  making it harder for people with disabilities or elderly voters to  receive the assistance they need to make their voices heard; telling  people: Oh, hey, if you have COVID and you are in the hospital and you  want to apply for a mail-in ballot because you obviously aren't going  to be able to go in and vote, you need to get a notary public to sign  the application. South Carolina had taken that requirement away, and  then they put it back in.    Over 400 bills were introduced in nearly every State to limit the  freedom to vote, and over 30 already were signed into law. That is why  we must now establish national standards for voting--completely allowed  for in the Constitution--to make sure all voters can cast their ballots  in the way that works best for them, regardless of what ZIP Code they  live in.   The need for Federal action is urgent. Redistricting is underway to  draw congressional maps that will define our democracy for the next  decade. You know how many of these maps do not come close to  reflecting, on a nonpartisan basis, what goes on in the State.   We know what has been happening in Wisconsin. Actual--actual--ideas  and actual proposals are supported by someone in this very Chamber to  take away the right of the bipartisan election board to count the  ballots and instead have them counted by the legislature.   With 19 States having enacted laws this year to roll back the freedom  to vote, we can't simply sit back and watch our democracy be  threatened.   As Senator Rev. Raphael Warnock has said, What is this all about?         Some people don't want some people to vote.    Whether our democracy is threatened with bear spray, crowbars, and  axes, or long lines, no dropoff boxes, and secret money, it is still  under siege, and we must stand up and do what is right. We want trust  in our government--trust regardless of where people are politically.   You know, my State has one of the highest voter turnouts in the  country, if not the highest every single time. We have elected a  Republican Governor with those standards in Tim Pawlenty; we have  elected a Democratic Governor in Tim Walz; and we have elected an  Independent Governor in Jesse Ventura. What is the difference? People  are part of the franchise. They come up, and they say: Look, I didn't  vote for you, but I agreed with you on that; I didn't like what you did  on that. They are part of the franchise.   As we have seen in States like Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Montana, and  Texas, we are up against this coordinated attack. Our democracy cannot  wait.   The infamous new law in Georgia says you can't vote on weekends, as I  mentioned, in the runoff or register to vote during the runoff, and  there are limitations when it comes to dropoff boxes for voting by mail  and a new requirement--one that used to be in that was taken out for  the pandemic because it was so confusing, and then it was put back in  with this law--that you have to put a date on the outside of your  inside envelope. What date would you think that would be? Anyone  casting the ballot would think the date that I am voting. No, no. It is  your birthday that has to be put on the outside of the envelope when  you put that ballot in.   In Iowa, a new law cut the days of early voting by 9 days and will  close the polls an hour early. This was after the State, in the words  of its own Republican secretary of state, had ``shattered'' its voter  turnout record last year.   Why do that except that you are trying to make it harder for certain  people to vote. The words of a court about a North Carolina law years  ago: Discrimination with surgical precision.   A new law in Montana that I noticed says you can no longer register  to vote on election day after that having been an option in the State  for 15 years.   In Texas, another new law eliminates drop boxes and puts new  restrictions on vote-by-mail by also empowering partisan poll watchers.  [[Page S9238]]    That is why we need the Freedom to Vote Act, which builds on the  framework put forward by our colleague and the former West Virginia  secretary of state, Joe Manchin, in June. It includes key reforms like  ensuring voters have access to at least 2 weeks of early voting and  same-day registration and that voters can cast a mail-in ballot without  an excuse.   Increasing transparency through the DISCLOSE Act. I don't care if you  are a Democrat, Republican, Independent--whatever party you are in--you  don't want to have money coming in an election, dark money that you  can't even figure out where it is from, telling you stuff that you  can't even figure out if it is true. This part of the bill would simply  require super PACs and issue advocacy groups to disclose donors who  contribute more than $10,000 so at least we know who is putting in all  that money to run ads so you understand why they are doing it.   It would prohibit partisan gerrymandering so voters choose their  elected officials, not the elected officials choosing who votes for  them.   And we need to enact the bill now to give States time to implement  these reforms.   As I noted, the Freedom to Vote Act has the support of all 50 Senate  Democrats. We have talked to our Republican colleagues about this as  well as the John Lewis bill. Why have we done that? Well, for decades  voting rights has been a bipartisan issue. In 2006, the Voting Rights  Act was reauthorized by a vote of 98 to 0. Yes, 2006; it is not that  long ago--98 to 0.   This bill already includes bipartisan profiles that included many of  our Republican colleagues. I know the Honest Ads Act is in this bill.  That is a bill I did first with John McCain, whom we so dearly miss,  and now with Senator Graham; the Secure Elections Act, which is about  backup paper ballots and making sure that we don't have foreign  interference on our elections. That is the bill Senator Lankford and I  introduced together with the support of Senators Burr and Warner and  Senator Graham.   But in October, when we had a vote to open debate on the Freedom to  Vote Act, not a single one of our Republican colleagues voted to even  debate the bill. I see Senator Murkowski is here who did allow a vote  to open debate on the John Lewis bill, which is very important to our  country. She stood up and said: Look, I may not agree with everything  in this bill, but we should allow for debate.   Let's be clear again, article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the  United States of America empowers Congress to make or alter rules for  Federal elections at any time. I believe this provision was designed to  help us in times like these, in times where we are seeing an assault on  elections, where people are increasingly starting to distrust the  results of elections.   In the face of complete obstruction on something so fundamental as  the Freedom to Vote Act, we must restore the Senate with rule changes  that will allow us to debate this bill.   Now, I just want to briefly address this. Throughout Senate history,  rules governing debate have changed multiple times.   We just somehow found a way to vote on what was good, and that was  the debt ceiling vote--hmm, a little bit of a change to allow us to do  that with a 51-vote margin. In fact, there are already 161 exceptions-- exceptions to the filibuster.   Even the number of votes needed to end debate has changed. In 1975,  Senator Mondale led the successful and bipartisan effort that reduced  the cloture threshold from 67 to 60 votes.   There have been cries for standing debates--standing--what is called  a standing filibuster. Why is that? Because instead of an empty Chamber  right now, except for me and Senator Murkowski and the Presiding  Officer from the great State of Nevada, there is no one else here.   And yet we have so many serious things before us. We have a  continuing raging pandemic. We have climate change that is causing  weather events we never thought possible, including thunderstorms in  the middle of the State of Minnesota in the middle of December. Never  in history have we had a tornado warning in our State in the middle of  December.   We have had tragedies across the Midwest with storms of magnitude we  never thought possible. We have rising--no. Are we discussing that? No.  Are we discussing voting and what is happening in this country right  now, except for me giving this long speech? No, we are not.   So I think we know that this isn't the Senate that is supposed to be  the world's greatest deliberative body, that is supposed to allow us to  have votes on amendments and discussions on serious issues, not to ram  through things but to have discussions on serious issues so we can make  decisions.   Do you think the rest of the world isn't watching what is going on  here right now? Simple attempts to do something about childcare or  preschool or reducing the prices of prescription drugs, when we pay  more in our country for prescription drugs than any other country in  the world, and we are getting blocked from bringing those bills forward  to have actual discussions on them or trying to fit them in little  boxes of how they fit some archaic Senate rule.   Even Senator Robert Byrd said, when he was advocating for rule  reforms way back in 1979: ``Certain rules that were necessary . . .  must be changed to reflect changed circumstances.''   Well, I think an all-out assault on our democracy--that is a changed  circumstance, where at least we should be debating the solution in this  Chamber. I think being unable to advance things that we know we have to  tackle, not just immediate crisis, because we are pretty good at  those--we are pretty good when a financial crisis occurs or when we  have storms or floods or tornadoes or hurricanes. We are pretty good at  getting the funds out and rescue help out there.   But not everything is an immediate crisis. It is just a crisis about  to happen, and our job, our duty when we take that oath is to protect  the Constitution. That is what we want to debate right now on this  floor, instead of in another empty Chamber. And with the standing  filibuster, requiring people to be here and debate and speak, it is not  just an old movie, then; it is real life. Requiring people to actually  be here and do their jobs--big surprise, news bulletin--we are here  debating real issues and legislation and voting on amendments and doing  our jobs, instead of just running back in here every four hours and  making a vote and then going back out and making phone calls.   Protecting the freedom to vote has never been easy. Throughout our  country's 245-year history, we have had to course-correct to ensure  that our democracy for the people, by the people actually lived up to  its ideals. Voting is how Americans control their government and hold  elected officials accountable.   So for anyone watching this at home, do you want to hold people  accountable? It is by making sure that they have the right to vote, so  they can exercise their right to vote, and their views at the polls in  a safe way, across this Nation.   And do you want to hold them accountable? It is by actually having  votes on bills and actually debating the issues of our time as the rest  of the world watches what should be the beacon of democracy.   It strengthens our hand with the rest of the world. It makes us  stronger when our democracy is functioning and working, and not when we  have a bunch of people in here with bear spray and bayonets going after  our police officers.   That is the vision, I am sorry to say, that much of the world saw  less than a year ago. And that is not the lasting vision that we want  of this Chamber or of this democracy.   Americans have fought and died to protect our freedom to vote. They  have done so on the battlefield and in marches during the civil rights  movement, and 56 years after the Voting Rights Act was passed by this  Chamber and signed into law, we still continue this fight.   But just as we know from those trying to keep their fellow Americans  from voting, those trying to undermine our very system of government in  State after State across the country, they are not going to stop until  we make clear that there is something larger than ourselves. As John  McCain used to say, there is nothing more liberating than a cause  larger than yourself.  [[Page S9239]]    That cause, my friends in this Chamber, is our very democracy, and  that is why we won't stop. Our Nation was founded on the ideals of  democracy, and we have seen for ourselves in this building how we can't  afford to take it for granted.   We have a lot of work to do in rebuilding our country. And, no, we  should not go home tomorrow. No, we should not, not when this is at  stake. We must stand up for the salvation of our democracy.   And each day that we delay, it gets harder and harder to undo what is  being done. We owe it to our country and to the future generation of  Americans to take care of this country.   We are the stewards, my friends, of this Nation right now and our  democracy. So many people before us have found a way to do the right  thing. And in the words of Bob Dole, in a first-class democracy, the  people deserve better than being treated like second-class citizens.   I yield the floor.
