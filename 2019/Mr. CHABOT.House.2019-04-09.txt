 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, legislation which protects the  sanctity of life for the unborn by ensuring that infants who are born  alive receive proper medical care, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to immediately  schedule consideration of the Born-Alive bill so we can stand up and  protect the sanctity of human life, and I would ask all of my  colleagues in this body to join in my request.
