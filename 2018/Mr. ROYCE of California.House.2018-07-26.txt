 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  gratitude to my deputy chief of staff, Sara Catalan, for her many years  of service to the people of our congressional district. I am indebted  to her for her faithful service, her good work, sound judgment, and  perseverance.   Constituents have often thanked me for the attention and assistance  they received from her and the dedicated district staff that she put  together and managed.   Her passion for public policy is evident to all who have worked with  her. She has been vital to my outreach and proactive engagement with  the diverse communities of the district, ensuring that everyone is  heard.   She has also been valuable in assisting me with my efforts to prevent  stalking, support victims of crime, strengthen education, and combat  human trafficking. I have always relied upon her counsel and appreciate  her forthrightness and her integrity.   As she leaves my office and begins the next phase of her career  working for a member of the California State Senate, I know she will  continue to serve the people of California well                            ____________________
