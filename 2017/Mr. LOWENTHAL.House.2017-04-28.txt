 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, April 30, marks 42 years  since the fall of Saigon, commemorated as Black April in Vietnamese- American communities across the United States.   Along with Congresswoman Lofgren, Congressman Correa, and other  colleagues, I introduced a resolution in remembrance of this event,  recognizing the service of U.S. Armed Forces and South Vietnamese  forces, and honoring the contributions and sacrifices of Vietnamese  Americans.   This community, started by refugees, has prospered and thrived,  giving so much back to this country. They continue to fight tirelessly  for the basic human rights of people in Vietnam. I will continue to be  a voice for Vietnamese Americans in Congress and for the rights of the  people of Vietnam.                            ____________________
