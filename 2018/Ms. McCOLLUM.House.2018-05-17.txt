 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Foxx  amendment.   In my home State of Minnesota, sugar beet is number one. That means  this amendment will directly hurt my State's economy.   Minnesota's sugar creates more than 28,000 jobs and has an annual  impact of more than $3 billion. This amendment will cost Minnesota and  other sugar-producing States so much more. It will hurt farmers, small  businesses, schools, hospitals--real lives of real people in rural  communities that this bill is supposed to help.   We should be supporting American farmers instead of sending their  jobs to countries that heavily subsidize sugar production, like Brazil  and Mexico. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this harmful  amendment, and I ask them to stand with farmers in Minnesota and all  across the United States.
