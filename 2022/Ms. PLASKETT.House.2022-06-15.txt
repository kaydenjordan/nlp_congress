 Madam Speaker, I have just returned from the Ninth  Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, which gathered the heads of  state and senior government officials from nearly every country in the  Western Hemisphere, as well as hundreds of businesses, civil society,  and youth leaders from across the region.   Members of a 20-person congressional delegation met with leaders from  many of our neighboring countries, Chile, Jamaica, Canada, Haiti.   I had the opportunity to speak with the heads of state of many of our  Caribbean neighbors. From these conversations, one thing was clear: Now  more than ever, it is necessary for the United States to deepen its  relationship with Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean.   With threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, democratic erosion, and  climate change, my constituents in the Virgin Islands know all too well  the collective challenges facing the hemisphere.   I thank the Biden administration for its commitment to productive  engagement with Latin and Central America and the Caribbean. In Los  Angeles, the administration announced the Americas Partnership for  Economic Prosperity, which calls for sustainable and inclusive trade;  the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030; and  the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration.   I strongly urge this administration to follow up on these commitments  and promises with concrete actions that will deliver tangible results,  particularly in the Caribbean because the Caribbean is facing an  economic crisis. The pandemic has exacted a harsh toll on the region,  with regional economic activity falling by 9.9 percent in 2020,  significantly worse than the rest of the region.   Climate change poses a particularly dire threat to the lives,  livelihood, and businesses in the Caribbean. For years, the harmful  trend of financial de-risking by banks has economically strangled the  Caribbean islands.   The Caribbean, which is our third border, is essential to U.S.  national and economic security. From the early days of the American  Revolution to the Cold War, the Caribbean has played a vital role in  U.S. defense. It, alone, is the United States' sixth largest trade  partner, with $35.3 billion of trade in 2018. And 13 million people in  the U.S. share Caribbean ancestry.   Despite these common interests between the U.S. and the Caribbean,  China is making significant inroads in this area. Indeed, total Chinese  trade with Latin America and the Caribbean rose from $18 billion in  2002 to $449 billion in 2021, and China is now South America's largest  trade partner.   Therefore, improving the U.S.-Caribbean relationship and  strengthening the U.S.-Caribbean trade and economic partnership must be  a priority for the administration and this Congress.   First, we must follow up on our commitments made at the summit with  tangible results and concrete investments that correspond to the  Caribbean's needs and for our national security.                                time  1015    Second, this Chamber must pass H. Res. 1047, which will reaffirm the  economic partnership between the United  [[Page H5551]]  States and the Caribbean nations, recognizing the need to strengthen  trade and investments.   Third, we must authorize a general capital increase for the Inter- American Development Bank to ensure that the premier lending  institutions for South America and the Caribbean have the resources to  support the region in this difficult time.   I have introduced H.R. 7726 to do so, and the Senate has already  approved such a capital increase in the United States Innovation and  Competition Act. It is essential that this capital increase be included  in the final version of the House COMPETES Act.   Fourth, the administration must work to counter the misguided trend  of de-risking from U.S. banks, which has unfairly cut Caribbean nations  off from access to capital and credit and economically harmed the  region.   Madam Speaker, the Caribbean is inextricably linked to the security,  economic prosperity, and cultural heritage of the United States. It is  time for us to recognize this importance and prioritize U.S.-Caribbean  relationships.                            ____________________
