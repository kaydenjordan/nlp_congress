 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Priscilla Thomas, a commissioner in Chatham County, Georgia, a champion  of our area's local youth and a Savannah native.   In 1990, Dr. Thomas was first elected to serve as a commissioner in  Chatham County. During her tenure, she became chairman pro tem and  later the first minority and female vice chairman. However, long before  she entered government, Dr. Thomas was already dedicated to creating  more opportunities and better lives for young people.   She worked as a principal at Haven Elementary School in Savannah  after earning her Ph.D. in educational administration from the  University of North America. When she was elected to serve as  commissioner in 1990, she continued to use her passion for young people  to provide entertaining and enlightening activities for them, including  the Chatham County Youth Commission and the Summer Bonanza Partnership.   On December 16, 2016, Dr. Thomas attended her final county commission  meeting and retired from her 26 years as a Chatham County commissioner.  She will always be remembered for being one of the toughest, fairest,  and most well-informed members of our local government and for her 60  years serving young people. She certainly will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support of H.R. 288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. In  2015, the FCC adopted burdensome transparency requirements for Internet  service providers. The FCC immediately recognized that these new  transparency requirements would be particularly burdensome for small  Internet service providers, so they provided a temporary exemption for  providers with 100,000 or fewer subscribers. Despite overwhelming  support to make the exemption permanent, the Commission extended the  current exemption for just an additional year.   The bill eases the burdens created by the FCC rule by extending the  exemption to Internet service providers who have 250,000 subscribers or  less and extends the exemption for 5 years.   This is commonsense legislation. This bill provides relief and  certainty to Internet service providers so they can continue to build  networks, deploy broadband, improve connectivity for rural consumers,  and create jobs.    I commend Chairman Walden for championing this legislation so that we  can continue to grow our infrastructure and improve connectivity for  rural Americans.
