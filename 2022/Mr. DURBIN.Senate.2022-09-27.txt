 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, here is item No. 2.   For decades, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for  prescription drugs. On average, we pay nearly four times more than the  people in Canada and other western nations for exactly the same drug.  This price gouging by Big Pharma hurts Americans' health and their  financial security.   I have stories sent to me from time to time from the people I  represent, especially senior citizens, who tell me these sky-high  prescription drug prices force them to choose between medications and  other basic necessities like food and shelter. Phillip has one of those  stories.   Phillip lives in a small town south of Chicago. He is 73 years old  and is a diabetic. After having several heart and back surgeries, he  can't work any longer. He takes several medications regularly. Now, you  are going to recognize the name of one of them. It is called  Trulicity--if you watch TV, you have heard that one--a noninsulin  treatment that he uses to control his blood sugar and manage his  diabetes, Trulicity.   Do you know the 1-month prescription cost for Trulicity? It is  $2,000.   So what does Phillip do, who can't work and has a fixed income? He  tries to cut the pills in half to make his prescription last longer.  Sometimes he just skips the medication altogether.   He is not alone. One in five Americans does not take the medications  as prescribed because they are too expensive. In Phillip's case, even  that isn't enough. At the end of the day, he had to refinance his  home--what a time to do it, huh, with the interest rates?--because here  in America, for too long, we have found it acceptable to allow  pharmaceutical companies to charge what they wish. Not anymore.   We pressed for decades--both Democrats and Republicans gave these  speeches; this was not just a Democratic issue--to lower prescription  drug prices, at least for seniors. Last month, we did it right here on  the floor of the Senate. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress  passed without a single Republican vote, is delivering real relief now  for families who are struggling with high prices.   A few minutes ago, the Republican leader was on the floor, telling us  what a terrible bill that was, the Inflation Reduction Act. He didn't  mention the  [[Page S5039]]  fact that it is going to do some remarkable things. It makes historic  investments to address the climate crisis. That is one thing. It  includes investments in renewable, affordable energy sources. That is  certainly needed. These investments in renewable energy can save  families hundreds of dollars a year in energy costs. That is real  relief.   Just as an aside, last month, my wife and I decided to put solar  panels on our home in Springfield, IL. We are not the first in our  town, but we are certainly the first in our neighborhood. They  predicted it will reduce our electric bill by 85 percent a month. Think  about your own electric bill and what that would mean: money in hand.   There are tax credits to put on solar panels. How did we achieve that  and put tax credits in for heat pumps and electric water heaters? We  put it in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Senator McConnell just  came to the floor and said was a terrible bill. I think you are going  to see more and more Americans making the choice our family made. I  think they should.   The Inflation Reduction Act is also going to lower healthcare costs-- one of the biggest items in every family's budget. First, it will begin  to let Medicare negotiate fair prices for medications used by seniors.   Is that a radical idea, that a Federal Agency, on behalf of the  people it serves, negotiates for lower drug prices? It is an idea that  has been at work in the Veterans Health Administration for years. The  VA, our VA, in serving our veterans--the men and women who serve  this country--pays, on average, half of what Medicare pays for exactly  the same drugs now because the VA could negotiate and Medicare could  not.    The bill which Senator McConnell took exception to now gives Medicare  the power to negotiate lower prices for seniors, and 83 percent of  Americans think that is a pretty good idea. How do we get 83 percent of  Americans to agree on anything? They agree on that, as that is a good  idea, and 71 percent of the people are from the party of the Senator  from Kentucky.   Second, the Inflation Reduction Act will cap the price Medicare  recipients pay for insulin--insulin: $35 a month for Medicare  recipients. That is the limit--and it limits seniors' out-of-pocket  expenses for all medications to $2,000 a year. Remember Phil? Phil was  paying $2,000 a month for Trulicity. Under this bill, which we passed  here a month ago without a single vote from the other side of the  aisle, we are going to limit seniors' responsibility under Medicare for  prescription drugs to $2,000 a year.   By the way, I believe we should cap the cost of insulin at $35 a  month for everybody, not just seniors. Guess what radical nation--what  socialist nation--does that? Canada. Canada does it. Pharmaceutical  companies still make a healthy profit. They just don't make a killing  on a lifesaving drug.   Third, the Inflation Reduction Act will curb the outrageous cost  increases that Medicare beneficiaries pay for medications. It does that  by tying prescription drug price increases to the cost of living.  Pharmaceutical companies that raise their prices faster are going to  pay a penalty if they do. The days of Big Pharma raising prices they  charge seniors at 5 or 10 times the rate of inflation are over.   Of course, the pharmaceutical giants and their lobbyists fought us  every step of the way. They said: If you put limits on the prices we  can charge, then we are going to have to cut our research.   Guess what they didn't tell you and what our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle did not admit: It isn't true. Studies have found that  Big Pharma could lose $1 trillion in sales over the next decade, and it  would still remain the most profitable industry in America. By the way,  did you know these pharmaceutical companies spend more money on  advertising and marketing than they do on research?   Point 2, did you know that the research that they are using is based  on research that was started at the National Institutes of Health at  the expense of American taxpayers? I am all for the National Institutes  of Health. They use what the NIH develops to make new drugs. It is a  good thing to do, and they are very profitable as they do it, so I  don't want to hear that they can charge less and that they are not  going to be able to survive. I don't believe it.   It is not only seniors who will save on healthcare costs. More than  14 million Americans who receive their health coverage through the  Affordable Care Act marketplace will save hundreds--even thousands--of  dollars on their monthly insurance premiums because of the Inflation  Reduction Act.   Under the American Rescue Plan, we lowered monthly premiums for  middle-income families and for those with ACA health plans. The  Inflation Reduction Act will continue this for another 3 years, and I  hope I am here to renew it. No one should go without medical care ever  but especially not while we are fighting a worldwide pandemic.   Not only did our Republican colleagues vote against what I just  described to you, lowering monthly premiums for families nationwide,  but they went further and tried in every way they could think to gut  the Affordable Care Act.   Two weeks ago, a Federal judge in the Northern District of Texas  ruled that the Affordable Care Act's requirement that health plans  offer free preventive health services, like vaccinations, was  unconstitutional. In 2020, because of the ACA, 152 million Americans  received these preventive health services, with no out-of-pocket cost,  often resulting in the early detection of cancer, heart disease, and  other serious conditions.   Now a group of Texas residents and businesses argues that that just  violates their basic religious liberty--religious liberty. They picked  a judge who has been friendly to them in the past. This same judge in  northern Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional.  That was overturned by the Supreme Court. Thank goodness.   It has been 12 years since the ACA became law. It is long past time  for both parties to support this effort which provides health insurance  for millions of Americans at an affordable cost. We need to bring down  the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs for all American  families.   The last item of good news comes from a blog that I read rather  religiously by a lady in Maine, Heather Cox Richardson. Almost every  day, she publishes a column for those who want to read it. I don't know  if there is a subscription cost. She asks from time to time if you want  to contribute to her effort. I do.   Well, today's is one that, I think, is worth reading and remembering.   She says:         A headline in The New York Times today read: ``Factory Jobs       Are Booming Like It's the 1970s.'' The story explained that       more money in the hands of consumers thanks to Federal       stimulus spending, along with a new skepticism of stretched       supply lines, has created a rebound in American       manufacturing.        Since the 1970s . . . outsourcing and automation have meant       that every recession has seen factory jobs disappear [in       America] and never return.    Well, there is good news. We now know that we have not only regained  all of the manufacturing jobs lost during the pandemic, we have added  67,000 more.         Those numbers would be higher if the labor market weren't       so tight, a condition leading employers to offer higher wages       and better benefits.   The other point she makes is one that the National Economic Council  Director, Brian Deese, told reporters: ``One of the most striking  things that we are seeing'' is that American companies ``are committing  to build and expand'' right here at home because of supply chain  concerns. ``Meanwhile''--get this--``the real net worth of the bottom  50% of U.S. households has climbed 60% [in the last year and a half] .  . . now reaching $67,524.''   Inflation is a problem. Don't get me wrong; it is a challenge.  Gasoline prices seem to be creeping down, at least in the Midwest. I  can't speak for all over the country. Food prices are still too high. I  have been to the supermarket over the weekend. I know what is going on.  But we are seeing some evidence of progress on the economic front, and  I certainly hope that it continues.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this column by Heather  Cox Richardson be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S5040]]                                   September 26, 2022                        (By Heather Cox Richardson)         A headline in the New York Times today read: ``Factory Jobs       Are Booming Like It's the 1970s.'' The story explained that       more money in the hands of consumers thanks to federal       stimulus spending, along with a new skepticism of stretched       supply lines, has created a rebound in American       manufacturing.        Since the 1970s, authors Jim Tankersley, Alan Rappeport,       and Ana Swanson explain, outsourcing and automation have       meant that every recession has seen factory jobs disappear       and never return as employers used downturns to move       operations to countries with lower wage levels. This time,       though, American manufacturers have not only regained all the       jobs lost during the pandemic, they have also added about       67,000 more. Those numbers would be higher if the labor       market weren't so tight, a condition leading employers to       offer higher wages and better benefits.        Biden has made it clear that he is trying to overturn 40       years of ``supply side'' economics, ushered in by President       Ronald Reagan. This system was designed to free up capital at       the top of the economy through tax cuts and deregulation in       the belief that putting capital in the hands of the wealthy--      the ``supply side''--would lead them to invest more in the       economy, thus making it grow more quickly and providing more       jobs. While Republicans came to embrace that ideology       wholeheartedly, in fact it never showed signs of increasing       economic growth. What it did was to move wealth dramatically       upward. It also made the measure of the economy the health of       Wall Street rather than Main Street.        Since Abraham Lincoln's administration, which faced a       similar economic stratification upward. Biden has followed in       this tradition. Insisting that he would build the economy       ``from the bottom up and the middle out,'' he, along with the       Democrats in Congress, bolstered domestic manufacturing with       measures like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the       Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act.        Now, statistics show, that investment has paid off. Chad       Moutray, the chief economist for the National Association of       Manufacturers, told the New York Times reporters: ``We have       67,000 more workers today than we had in February 2020. 1       didn't think we would get there, to be honest with you.''        National Economic Council director Brian Deese told the       reporters, ``One of the most striking things that we are       seeing now is the number of companies--U.S. companies and       global companies--that are committing to build and expand       their manufacturing footprint in the United States, and doing       so based on their view that not only did the pandemic       highlight the need for more resilience in their supply       chains, but that the United States is creating a policy       environment that makes long-term investment here in the       United States more attractive.''        Meanwhile, the real net worth of the bottom 50% of U.S.       households has climbed 60% since Biden took office, now       reaching $67,524.        One of the things that will continue to feed this change is       the plan to forgive significant student loan debt, especially       among low-income Black and Brown Americans. This story is       hitting the news today after the Congressional Budget Office       responded to a series of questions posed by Senator Richard       Burr (R-NC) and Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), both       fervently opposed to the program. The CBO's responses to       those specific questions have been widely published,       suggesting the program will cost the U.S. $400 billion. This       is sparking cries about its expense, but this particular CBO       number calculates the cost over the next 30 years rather than       the usual ten, does not address the stimulus effects of the       relief, and does not take into account how much anyone would       actually have repaid. The estimate is, the CBO states in its       letter, ``highly uncertain.''        In contrast to Biden's economic program, on Friday the new       government of Prime Minister Liz Truss announced the most       radical tax cuts in Britain since 1972, cutting the top       income tax rate as well as corporate taxes to spur the       economy. This unfunded cut will mean borrowing at rising       interest rates. Concerns about inflation, already hammering       the British economy, made the value of the pound, which is       the English unit of currency, drop to its lowest level since       1985.        These different economic visions are in conflict here in       the United States. Former Trump economic advisor Steve Moore       reacted to the Truss tax cuts by saying: ``This is exactly       what we should be doing in the US.'' White House economic       advisor Jared Bernstein said: ``President Biden has been very       clear about the negative track record of trickle-down,       Reagan-style tax cuts.''        Republicans have managed to keep voters behind their       economic program by downplaying it and emphasizing cultural       issues, primarily abortion, which reliably turned out anti-      abortion voters. Now that the Supreme Court has overturned       the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion,       Republicans have a demographic problem: a majority of voters       support reproductive rights and are turning out to vote, and       there is no longer a reason for anti-abortion voters to show       up.        So Republican leaders are downplaying abortion: reporter       Eric Garcia noted today that Republican representative and       Senate candidate Ted Budd (R-NC), who is a cosponsor of the       House version of Senator Lindsey Graham's (R-SC) national       abortion bill, didn't mention his stance in a recent rally       with former president Trump. They are also inventing new       cultural crises, most notably an attack on LGBTQIA folks but       also a renewed attack on immigrants.        Trump has gone further, jumping aboard the QAnon train,       which the FBI considers a domestic terrorism threat, as his       own legal troubles are mounting. His lawyers failed to slow       down the criminal investigation into his theft of documents,       including many marked with the highest levels of       classification. New York Attorney General Letitia James has       sued Trump, his company, and his children and two associates       for fraud. And now the House Select Committee to Investigate       the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol is beginning to       turn up more information.        On Friday the committee subpoenaed Wisconsin House Speaker       Robin Vos to ask about a phone call he had with Trump in July       2022 (not a typo) in which Trump tried to get him to change       the 2020 result in Wisconsin. Vos is challenging the       subpoena.        In the lead-up to Wednesday's midday public hearing of the       committee, Zachary Cohen of CNN reported today that election       denier Phil Waldron, a former Army colonel associated with       Trump loyalist Michael Flynn, was in contact with White House       chief of staff Mark Meadows in late December 2020 about       gaining access to the voting systems in Arizona and Georgia.       Waldron referred to Arizona as ``our lead domino we were       counting on to start the cascade,'' to overturn the election.        Meanwhile, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court justice       Clarence Thomas, was texting QAnon links to Meadows. And now,       after flirting with QAnon since 2020, Trump has embraced it       wholeheartedly, first ``retruthing'' social media posts       featuring him as a QAnon hero and warning that ``The Storm Is       Coming,'' then using QAnon music at a rally. Now, he has sent       out an email calling for the death penalty for drug dealers--      a favorite theme of fascists since the 1930s and a major part       of the program of former dictator Rodrigo Duterte of the       Philippines, whom Trump admires--along with the warning that       ``Under Democrat control, the streets of our great cities are       drenched in the blood of innocent victims,'' tapping into the       QAnon themes of violent retribution for those they see as       preying on America's youth.        ``I certainly will do whatever it takes to make sure Donald       Trump isn't anywhere close to the Oval Office,''       Representative Liz Cheney said this weekend at The Texas       Tribune Festival, which highlights politics and policy. ``And       if he is the nominee, I won't be a Republican.'' She warned       that a Republican majority in the House would empower Trump       Republicans like Jim Jordan (OH), Marjorie Taylor Greene       (GA), and Lauren Boebert (CO).        And when asked if Trump should testify before the       committee, Cheney answered: ``Any interaction that Donald       Trump has with the committee will be under oath and subject       to penalty of perjury.''                                    Notes       Jeff Stein@JStein WaPo        Former Trump economic adviser Steve Moore on Liz Truss tax       policy: ``I'm very supportive of what they're doing. This is       exactly what we should be doing in the US . . . I'm surprised       the market has not reacted positively but I think that's       going to reverse course.''

September 26th 2022        https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/24/liz-cheney-texas- tribune-festival     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to do something unusual on  the floor of the Senate. I would like to report some good news. It  isn't often we have these reports. Today, I have three items in my news  that I would like to share with the people who are following this. I  would like to start my remarks by sharing an incredible story from the  other side of the world.   In May 2020, as the world was reeling from the spread of the deadly  new strain of the coronavirus, the Red Cross society in the African  nation of Kenya received 500 bicycles from a Chicago-based,  nongovernmental organization known as World Bicycle Relief. Community  healthworkers used these bicycles to make house visits across southern  Kenya, providing health services to remote communities that would  otherwise not be reached because of restrictions on movement due to  COVID-19.   In Malawi, young girls used these bicycles to get safely to and from  school, and when COVID-19 closed the schools down, girls like 17-year- old Elizabeth were able to shift focus to help their parents, who are  farmers, weather the economic effects of the pandemic. She used her  bicycle to take their produce to market.   Stories like these are common around the world, showing the value of  a simple, relatively inexpensive, green, and easy-to-repair means of  mobility--a bicycle--to help meet important development objectives.   Since its founding in 2005, the World Bicycle Relief of Chicago has  done great work in helping displaced survivors after a natural disaster  in Sri Lanka, allowing farmers to move crops in Zambia, and getting  girls to school in Malawi.   I have even seen myself how a bicycle ambulance in rural Tanzania can  change lives; and not long ago, my staff saw the group's efforts in  Kenya, where more than 25,000 sustainable, rugged bicycles have been  provided.   Since 2019, I have worked through appropriations to push USAID to  invest in bicycles, which help meet the needs in healthcare, education,  women and girls' empowerment, and more. Part of this funding has  included an in-depth assessment to see what is most useful and how to  make the programs locally sustainable. They not only send bikes; they  send parts and then train the repairmen. USAID has used these lessons  and opportunities with increasing success thanks to the work of many  groups, including that of the World Bicycle Relief of Chicago.   Today, I am introducing legislation in partnering with the Kenya  bicycle world and U.S. House of Representatives' Representative Earl  Blumenauer of Oregon. Our bill is going to codify these important  efforts and formalize the creation of a mobility program within USAID's  Office of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment.   COVID-19 has taught us that a global health crisis can easily turn  into an economic crisis, a food crisis, a mobility crisis, and more.  Sometimes the simplest things, like a bicycle, can help make incredible  progress.   That is item No. 1.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4962         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bicycles for Rural African       Transport Act''.       SEC. 2. RURAL MOBILITY PROGRAM IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.         (a) Establishment.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development (referred to in this       section as ``USAID'') shall establish, within the Office of       Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, a rural mobility       program (referred to in this section as the ``Program'') to       carry out the purposes described in paragraph (2), including       through grants made to eligible nongovernmental partner       organizations.

A bill to create an Active Shooter Alert Communications  Network, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I would like to do something unusual on  the floor of the Senate. I would like to report some good news. It  isn't often we have these reports. Today, I have three items in my news  that I would like to share with the people who are following this. I  would like to start my remarks by sharing an incredible story from the  other side of the world.   In May 2020, as the world was reeling from the spread of the deadly  new strain of the coronavirus, the Red Cross society in the African  nation of Kenya received 500 bicycles from a Chicago-based,  nongovernmental organization known as World Bicycle Relief. Community  healthworkers used these bicycles to make house visits across southern  Kenya, providing health services to remote communities that would  otherwise not be reached because of restrictions on movement due to  COVID-19.   In Malawi, young girls used these bicycles to get safely to and from  school, and when COVID-19 closed the schools down, girls like 17-year- old Elizabeth were able to shift focus to help their parents, who are  farmers, weather the economic effects of the pandemic. She used her  bicycle to take their produce to market.   Stories like these are common around the world, showing the value of  a simple, relatively inexpensive, green, and easy-to-repair means of  mobility--a bicycle--to help meet important development objectives.   Since its founding in 2005, the World Bicycle Relief of Chicago has  done great work in helping displaced survivors after a natural disaster  in Sri Lanka, allowing farmers to move crops in Zambia, and getting  girls to school in Malawi.   I have even seen myself how a bicycle ambulance in rural Tanzania can  change lives; and not long ago, my staff saw the group's efforts in  Kenya, where more than 25,000 sustainable, rugged bicycles have been  provided.   Since 2019, I have worked through appropriations to push USAID to  invest in bicycles, which help meet the needs in healthcare, education,  women and girls' empowerment, and more. Part of this funding has  included an in-depth assessment to see what is most useful and how to  make the programs locally sustainable. They not only send bikes; they  send parts and then train the repairmen. USAID has used these lessons  and opportunities with increasing success thanks to the work of many  groups, including that of the World Bicycle Relief of Chicago.   Today, I am introducing legislation in partnering with the Kenya  bicycle world and U.S. House of Representatives' Representative Earl  Blumenauer of Oregon. Our bill is going to codify these important  efforts and formalize the creation of a mobility program within USAID's  Office of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment.   COVID-19 has taught us that a global health crisis can easily turn  into an economic crisis, a food crisis, a mobility crisis, and more.  Sometimes the simplest things, like a bicycle, can help make incredible  progress.   That is item No. 1.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4962         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bicycles for Rural African       Transport Act''.       SEC. 2. RURAL MOBILITY PROGRAM IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
