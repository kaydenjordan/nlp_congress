 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 9.   My amendment is straightforward. This bill requires the President to  submit a plan to Congress to meet our obligations under the Paris  accord. This amendment ensures that we do not forget the impact of our  infrastructure when addressing the threat of climate change.   We know that climate change is real. We know that we are already  feeling its effects and that it will only intensify. Strong scientific  research tells us that storms are getting stronger and more frequent.  Sea levels are rising, and this poses a direct threat to our coastal  communities.   While this bill and the Paris accord take significant steps to  address the root causes of climate change, we must be prepared to  address the significant impact it is having on our Nation's  infrastructure today.   My district in New Jersey was among the hardest hit by Superstorm  Sandy. Toms River alone saw $2.25 billion in property damages, the  highest out of any township in New Jersey, and we are still recovering  from that storm that hit our State years ago.   In 2017 we saw three of the five costliest storms in our history in  Harvey, Maria, and Irma. Rising sea levels are increasing the severity  and frequency of flooding and are contributing to beach erosion, posing  a major threat to our coastal tourism economy.   Climate change isn't just measured by rising tides and rising  temperatures. It is measured by the rising costs that will incur on our  communities and the investment needed in infrastructure to keep our  communities resilient in the face of that threat.   In the coming months, as we hopefully take up and pass a bold  infrastructure package, this amendment will provide guidance towards  achieving the infrastructure resiliency our communities need. We know  that infrastructure improvements don't only need to come in the form of  potholes fixed and bridges rebuilt, they need to lessen the impact of  rising storm surges from the next big storm and make sure communities  like mine in Ocean County can remain a place for people to raise a  family, create jobs, and achieve the American Dream.   The Paris Agreement's loss and damage provision recognizes the  importance of updating our infrastructure to help communities deal with  the adverse impacts of climate change. I urge that we include this  amendment because it is crucial that there is an understanding from top  to bottom of the threat that climate change poses and the impact that  it will have toward infrastructure resiliency across our country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and  ensure we are not only protecting our climate but the infrastructure we  need to support our communities, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), who is the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).                                time  0930     Mr. Chair, I reiterate that my amendment is straightforward.  It recognizes the importance of safeguarding our communities and  updating infrastructure to protect against the adverse impacts of  climate change.   We can see that storms are getting worse and worse and costlier. The  storms are not hitting just red States or blue States. They are hitting  all of us.   I urge all my colleagues to stand behind my amendment and lend your  support to ensure that our communities are resilient after the next big  storm so that they can remain a place for people to raise a family,  create jobs, and achieve the American Dream.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.
