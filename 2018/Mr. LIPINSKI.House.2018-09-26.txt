 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank both Chairman  Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their work in crafting this  compromise bill and for including some of my provisions in the bill.   Mr. DeFazio did an excellent job of going over pros and cons in this  bill, so let me talk about a few provisions I have in here.    One requires the GAO to quantify the cost to passengers of every  airline computer failure since 2014, including the one that just  occurred last night. I am hopeful this report will spur Congress to  take further action to ensure better passenger protections. Other  provisions will improve transparency in ticket sales and help develop  the aviation workforce's next generation.   The bill also has other wins for the traveling public, airline  workers, and residents around airports. For example, the bill directs  the FAA to be more responsive to community noise issues, including  residents who live near airports such as Midway in my district.   Finally, this bill will help our aviation system remain the gold  standard for safety, including some of those things Mr. DeFazio talked  about in regard to drones.   I thank Chairman Shuster for his work on this bill, for all his work  as chairman of the committee for 6 years, and for everything he has  done in Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
