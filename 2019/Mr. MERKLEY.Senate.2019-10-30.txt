 Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to hear the news on  Monday of the death of our former colleague, Kay Hagan.   She is the sister, the wife, and the aunt of Navy veterans; daughter- in-law to a two-star Marine Corps general; daughter of a former Florida  mayor; and niece to a former U.S. Senator and Governor. Service was in  Kay Hagan's veins.   She spent an early career in financial services, but it was only a  matter of time until she decided to get directly engaged in public  policy.   In office, she was a fierce and unwavering advocate for our men and  women in uniform, a staunch fighter for the right of every American to  have healthcare, and a warrior for women and children. The people of  North Carolina and the people of the United States are far better off  because of her years of service in the North Carolina Senate and the 6  years in the U.S. Senate.   When she was here she worked on so many different issues. She  immersed herself in trying to assist our military personnel. She was  the founding member of the Military Family Caucus. She championed the  program that offers education support for military spouses. She  cosponsored the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, and she drove the  investigation of the contamination of water at Camp Lejeune and  legislation to rectify that.   She introduced the Hire a Hero Act to try to enable our veterans to  get jobs and make that transition from military service to civilian  life. She led the effort for overdue recognition of African-American  marines who were forced to train at a separate camp outside Camp  Lejeune, and that led them to being awarded the Congressional Gold  Medal.  [[Page S6281]]    When it came to women and children, she was there every day in that  fight--the fight for a stronger Violence Against Women Act and the  fight for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, so women can be paid  commensurate with their male colleagues. She authored the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Act to maintain and continue the support for  mandatory screening for newborns.   She fought for workers and middle-class America and manufacturing  jobs for Americans and for equal opportunity by sponsoring the  Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which passed on the Senate floor 6  years ago.   She proceeded to work on banking and financial issues. She was the  lead on the SAFE Act Confidentiality and Privilege Enhancement Act,  which had to do with some of the nitty-gritty of mortgage licensing.  She worked to ensure that groups like Habitat for Humanity could lend  money on a zero-interest loan to their homeowners and be able to do so  without violating the legal precepts of American law. It was issue  after issue.   When I think of her journey, I think about the parallel structure  between her life and mine, in that she ran for the legislature in North  Carolina the same year that I ran for the legislature in Oregon. I won  a seat in the Oregon House and she won a seat in the North Carolina  Senate. We both spent 10 years there. We both then decided that we  should attempt to take our philosophy of fighting for the people to the  U.S. Senate. We threw our hats into the ring at the same moment,  running campaigns against incumbent Senators, and we both won.   I recall how every time I checked on how she was doing, she was  always doing 5 to 10 points better than I was, and I just kept  thinking: I just have to follow Kay Hagan's example. Then, before the  campaign was over, she called me up one day, and we hadn't actually met  much or talked much, and she said: I just want to check in on how you  are doing.   We connected and bonded over our parallel paths and the fight we were  in, which was such an intense effort of campaigning with the desire and  determination to make this country a better place.   Of course, as I have noted, when she got here, she threw herself into  so many aspects of our national life and our legal structure. I was  pleased that we were both assigned by Senator Kennedy to the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We were able to work on the  ACA, or the Affordable Care Act, to try to greatly increase health  coverage and make it more affordable and available throughout America-- really important for the people of North Carolina, the citizens of my  State, and citizens across this country.   Then, we were both assigned to the Banking Committee, and it was  Dodd-Frank. We worked on questions such as how do we end some of the  predatory lending practices? Both of us worked on payday-loan predatory  actions, where interest rates could be 500 percent. We knew the damage  done to our families across the country. We didn't succeed on that  particular piece of legislation--the payday loan piece--but we were  stemming in this fight from the same place. I so applaud her  determination to end predatory practices and lending.    Many of the things that we were fighting for did get into Dodd-Frank  in terms of fairness and mortgages so that homeownership would be a  dream of homeownership that would result in equity for middle-class  Americans rather than a nightmare of homeownership, in which interest  rates would double after 2 years, and the family would go bankrupt, and  they would be foreclosed on and could lose their house.   Apart from all of that, Kay was such a beautiful voice and spirit in  this Chamber--cheerful, determined, thoughtful, gracious. She just made  you enjoy being here.   I also think about her, as when she served, she was the healthiest  Member of this Chamber. She paid a lot of attention to the diet she  ate, the food she ate, how she exercised, how she brought balance to  her life. That, too, was an inspiration to us.   Here we find that our journeys on this planet are pretty precarious.  We never know what is going to happen on the next day or the next week.  I think it is a reminder to all of us to use our moments wisely, to  treat each other with the sort of graciousness she exemplified--this  sort of spirited fighting for ``we the people,'' the people of the  United States for whom she was determined to deploy and champion on the  floor of the Senate.   Her illness and her death are a real loss to all of us. It is  important that we carry her in our hearts. She certainly has a place  solidly secured in my heart and, I think, the hearts of everyone who  served with her.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am honored to join my colleague who  has led this battle for the vision of the For the People Act that will  restore the ``we the people'' democratic republic.   Here we are on the floor of the Senate. It is an institution that  once reverberated with great debates on the great issues our Nation  faced--issues of war and peace, of civil rights, of healthcare and  housing, of education and infrastructure, and of living-wage jobs;  issues of equal opportunity and of environmental pollution; issues that  affect the fundamental success of each family in America and our  collective success as a nation.   Yet, if you are sitting here today and are observing the Senate from  the benches up above, you will be hard-pressed to see any of that  because those debates are not happening in the U.S. Senate. This  Chamber is silent on the great issues that face America.   Before he was the majority leader, the majority leader promised that  things would be different under his leadership.   He said:         A Senate majority under my leadership would break sharply       from the practices of the Reid era in favor of a far more       free-wheeling approach to problem solving. I would work to       restore its traditional role as a place where good ideas are       generated, debated and voted upon.    Now, one of the fundamental principles is that every Senator should  be able to raise any issue and have the chance to defend it, to present  it, to see it attacked, to respond to those attacks, and to have the  American people see where we stand. But, today, the Senate is not  operating in that manner today. The reality is reflected in a different  quote by the majority leader from this past year.   He said:         Donald Trump is still in the White House, and as long as I       am Majority Leader of the Senate, I get to set the agenda.       That's why I call myself the Grim Reaper.    The majority leader is taking great pride in preventing this Chamber  from being the legislative body that was envisioned in the  Constitution, one in which we examine the issues that the citizens of  our States present to us with great concern and ask us to resolve so as  to take this Nation forward. Instead, we are deeply mired in the  legislative graveyard that the majority leader has been so proud to  create.   How about the Bipartisan Background Checks Act? It is now engraved on  a tombstone. The Paycheck Fairness Act? Engraved on a tombstone.  Violence Against Women? On a tombstone--or how about Save the Internet?  Or the Climate Action Now Act?   How about healthcare? Across my State, in rural areas and urban  areas, everybody wants the same fair price, even if they have  preexisting conditions. That is the fundamental nature of an effective  insurance strategy for healthcare, but the Protecting Americans With  Preexisting Conditions Act has never been debated on this floor.   The American Dream and Promise Act, the Securing America's Federal  Elections Act? How about the Raise the Wage Act? How about the Equality  Act that grants every member of our society, LGBTQ Americans, the full  opportunity to have the doors of opportunity opened, rather than  slammed shut--debated and passed just down the hall, each and every one  of these bills, but here, they haven't been debated. The Senate is  failing its constitutional responsibility.   In fact, during the last 2 years, there has only been three  priorities that have seemed to have arisen in this Chamber. One was the  goal of stripping healthcare from 30 million Americans. It failed by  the slimmest of margins. A second is to pack the courts with judges who  believe in a supercharged amendment to give power to the powerful,  rather than power to the people.   The third is a $2 trillion tax cut to enrich the richest Americans.  In any chamber that truly represents the people, you don't see the goal  of destroying healthcare for 30 million Americans and giving $2  trillion to the richest Americans. But that is what we have seen here,  while we fail to see the bills on healthcare, on housing, on education,  on infrastructure, on living wage jobs--the fundamentals by which the  American families prosper.   Why is it that this Chamber is now a completely owned subsidiary of  the most powerful people in this country? It is because of the  fundamental corruption of our constitutional system, starting with  gerrymandering.   Many of us hear that phrase, ``equal representation,'' and understand  we are talking about fundamental fairness of distributed power, but  gerrymandering is the opposite of that. The Supreme Court has given  complete license to extreme partisan gerrymandering, instead of  defending the constitutional vision of equal representation. It is  principle in a democracy and in a republic that the citizens choose  their legislators, the legislators don't choose  [[Page S6283]]  their citizens. But that legislation to address that, to create  nonpartisan commissions to prevent that gerrymandering, hasn't been  debated on the floor of this Chamber.   A second piece of corruption is voter suppression. The Supreme Court  opened the doors by gutting the Voting Rights Act, again failing to  defend the vision of the Constitution. But have we remedied that here  on this floor? Have we addressed that fundamental corruption in which  all kinds of tactics are created to prevent people from voting across  this country--all kinds of clever ID laws to disempower communities  that are minority communities or college communities or poor  communities or Native American communities? We have not.   There is perhaps the most vicious form of corruption, the dark money  flowing through our campaign systems. Jefferson was very clear that if  you have government by the powerful, you end up with laws for the  powerful. So you have to have distributed power so that the power of  the people results in laws that reflect the will of the people. That is  the difference between the vision of our constitutional system here in  the United States of America and the system of kingships that dominated  Europe.   But because of the corruption of dark money in our campaign system,  it has created the concentration of power, the exact opposite of what  Jefferson laid out and our Founders laid out in our Constitution. We  start our Constitution with those powerful first three words, ``We the  people,'' because that is the vision of our Constitution--not ``We the  powerful,'' not ``We the privileged.''   So a bill has been crafted, H.R. 1, the For the People Act. My  colleague from New Mexico has led this charge to address this  fundamental corruption in order to restore the vision our Nation was  founded on because, if we restore that foundation, then we would be  addressing healthcare on the floor of the Senate, making it more  affordable, stopping the price gouging of Americans, the challenges of  access in communities across this country.   We would be addressing the shortage of housing that is driving a  homeless epidemic in this country, partly because of the economics, the  structure of our economy, and partly because of unaddressed mental  illness and drug addiction.   We would be addressing education because education is the path to  full participation; yet today, we have seen a shrinkage of the  opportunities through apprenticeships for working people and through  college--affordable college for the dreams taking you in that direction  if you weren't previously burdened by a debt the size of a home  mortgage. We would be addressing infrastructure and jobs. We would be  addressing the environmental challenges our planet faces if we restore  the vision of our Constitution.   This For the People Act is the most important piece of legislation  because everything else we care about as Americans is going to fail if  we let this Chamber be controlled by powerful special interests through  this corrupted system. So let's take it on. Let's take on the  gerrymandering and the voter suppression and the dark money. Let's have  the courage to debate it on this floor because that is what we were  elected to do, was to work on the big challenges facing our Nation, and  there is perhaps no bigger challenge than this.   Madam President, I yield back to my colleague from New Mexico.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Antonio Pena Anaya, be granted privileges of the floor for the  remainder of the day.
