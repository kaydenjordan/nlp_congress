 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  dangerous and shameful Senate version of TrumpCare.   According to the new Congressional Budget Office estimate, this bill  will leave 22 million Americans without insurance by 2026. In my  district, that amounts to over 91,000 of my constituents, and over 2  million Floridians in total.   TrumpCare would allow insurers to charge seniors up to five times  more than younger people.   In addition, we have more than 1.3 million Americans who are in  nursing homes, and 62 percent of those pay for their stay and their  care with Medicaid dollars, including three in five Floridians who are  in a nursing home.   The majority promised Americans that they would fix TrumpCare in the  Senate. Instead, 13 men made a backroom deal and they left seniors out  of it. Make no mistake, while billionaires reap huge tax breaks in this  bill, older middle class Americans will suffer.   I urge my Republican colleagues to find their backbone--and look for  their hearts while they are at it--and stand up for our seniors.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
