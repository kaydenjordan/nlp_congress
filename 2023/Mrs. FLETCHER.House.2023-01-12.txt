 Mr. Speaker, energy security is a key component of our  national security. Our energy exports have a security impact around the  world as they do here at home. That is why I am disappointed this  morning to hear many of my friends across the aisle criticizing and  blaming President Biden for taking action to lower gas prices for  American consumers and to weaken Russia's ability to fund its  unconscionable and unjustified war that is unprovoked against Ukraine  by selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   The SPR is a critical foreign policy tool and energy security tool,  and it has been for more than 40 years. The SPR was created for this  precise purpose for this moment that we are living in, and these recent  sales--like every sale of crude in the U.S.--are made on the open  market to any entity wishing to purchase it.    The effective utilization of the SPR has successfully lowered costs  at the pump for Americans over the last year. In December, The Wall  Street Journal reported that U.S. Government made roughly $4 billion in  profits last year from the sale of crude oil out of the SPR. This is an  important point to remember because it is the direct work of this body.  [[Page H214]]    In 2015, the Energy and Commerce Committee under Republican  leadership lifted the 40-year ban on crude oil exports. I wasn't here  at the time, but if I had been, I would have supported my Republican  colleagues in that effort to acknowledge the global free market for the  commodity and the importance of ensuring America's energy security and  leadership.   But it isn't right to complain now for those who support free trade  in oil and for those who voted for it then to complain that the system  worked as it was intended to. The oil from the SPR was put on the  global market which increased supply and brought prices down here at  home.   Some of the oil sold by design onto the global market made its way to  China. This was not an unforeseen consequence. The then-majority on the  Energy and Commerce Committee explicitly rejected a proposal by a  Democratic member of the committee at the time, Mr. Green from Houston,  to license the export of crude oil the way we license LNG exports which  requires the Department of Energy to approve the sales. Requiring DOE  approval on crude sales could have prevented the sales that are now of  concern.   That said, I appreciate that this is a step toward addressing those  concerns. But I am also concerned that this alone is insufficient, and  we need a more robust mechanism to address any sales of concern.   Certainly, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would be  concerned about sales to North Korea or Iran or other adversaries. That  is why in the last Congress I supported my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Chrissy Houlahan's, bipartisan bill that would have closed the loophole  to allow the sale or export of oil from the SPR to foreign adversaries.   There is still work to do here, and I hope that moving forward we can  work together to craft smart energy policy that enhances our energy  security and best serves the American people.                                time  1000
