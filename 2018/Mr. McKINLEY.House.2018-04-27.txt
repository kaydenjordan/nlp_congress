 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 40th anniversary  of the Willow Island disaster, when 51 construction workers perished in  the deadliest construction accident in United States history.   These men were building cooling tower No. 2 at the Pleasants Power  Station in West Virginia. Just after 10 o'clock on that tragic day, as  the third lift of concrete was being lifted, the cable housing on the  crane went slack and the crane collapsed in on the tower.   The concrete that had been poured the previous day then started to  unwrap the tower, taking out the scaffolding. All the men who were on  the scaffolding at that time were killed, and many workers on the  ground were buried under the falling debris.   This horrible accident spurred a national conversation about more  construction safety and led to improved standards. And for those of us  who have worked in the construction industry, it underscored just how  fragile life is and that paying attention to every detail can make a  difference whether we go home or not.   This is a tragedy that is still felt throughout the Pleasants County  community. Angie Colvin, who was just in the fifth grade at the time of  the disaster, lost 12 family members that day, including her father.   The Willow Island community will gather this evening at the memorial  erected in honor of those 51 workers. Our prayers are with the entire  community on this day of remembrance.                            ____________________
