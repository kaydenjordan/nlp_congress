 Madam Speaker, more than a century ago, the Black  community in Springfield, Illinois, came under attack by a violent mob,  resulting in the loss of lives and livelihoods.   While the 1908 Springfield race riot demonstrates our Nation's deep  history of racial violence, it also gave rise to the NAACP, an  organization that would lead the charge in securing civil rights for  millions of Black Americans in the decades to come.   Today, I am honored to introduce bipartisan legislation with  Congressman Darin LaHood to make the site of this historic event a  national monument, providing long overdue recognition for our local  history and its impact on our Nation.   I am grateful to Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth for their  work on this bill in the Senate, and I look forward to working together  to make this vision a reality.                            ____________________
