 Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Justin Heupel of Flathead County for his dedication to his  students and passion for advancing agriculture education in Montana.   Originally from Culbertson, MT, Mr. Heupel first joined FFA as a  student in 1988. His passion for farming and ag took him to Montana  State University where he received a degree in agricultural education-- ``Go Cats!'' He has served Montana as an educator for 27 years and has  spent the last 19 years teaching at the H.E. Robinson Agricultural  Education Center in Kalispell, where he also serves as a faculty  adviser for FFA.   Mr. Heupel has been instrumental in improving and expanding ag  education  [[Page S194]]  in our great State. He served as president of the Montana Association  of Agricultural Educators and advocated for the Advancing Agricultural  Education in Montana program that helped create over 25 new agriculture  education programs in Montana schools and provided funding to improve  the quality of existing programs. Recently, Mr. Heupel received the  National FFA Organization's highest degree recognizing him for his  exceptional service to agricultural education.   Teachers serve an important role as they shape the minds of young  Montanans and help prepare them for future careers. Montana has a rich  legacy of agriculture, as it is the primary driver of our economy.  There is no doubt that Mr. Heupel's passion for teaching about  agriculture helped encourage young Montanans to pursue careers in this  important field. In fact, nine of his former students have gone on to  become agricultural education teachers themselves.   Passionate educators like Mr. Heupel help make Montana a better place  and give students the tools they need to be successful. It is my honor  to recognize Mr. Heupel for his devotion to shaping the next generation  of Montana ag leaders and keeping Montana's rich legacy of agriculture  alive. Keep up the great work; you make Montana proud.                            ____________________
