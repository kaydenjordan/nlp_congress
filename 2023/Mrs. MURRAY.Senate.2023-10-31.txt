 Mr. President, I want to make clear that I also worry  about the influence of Chinese entities, but this amendment is not the  answer. This amendment could have far-reaching, unintended consequences  that would affect our Agencies' ability to fulfill their missions and  serve people.   If this amendment passed, the VA could face challenges in obtaining  products for essential mission needs, like pharmaceuticals, medical  devices, and IT.   This amendment could negatively impact the procurement of meat for  the school meals programs. For example, Smithfield is owned by a  Chinese company. This amendment would actually prohibit the USDA from  purchasing hogs from any U.S.-based farmers owned by Smithfield. Is  that what we want?   It could also prevent Americans from understanding the security  challenges related to Chinese-made drones because this amendment would  mean the FAA would no longer be able to purchase drones made by Chinese  entities to conduct critical counter-UAS research, testing analysis, or  training.   We should have more time to carefully consider the impact of this  amendment and the serious, unintended consequences it could have before  adding it to this legislation.   I urge a ``no'' vote.
