 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia  for yielding to me and for his efforts in leading this fight.   Let's get something straight. I am a proud Texan, and let me tell  you, Texans are not happy when the government comes after their Second  Amendment right.   My District 14, on the Gulf Coast of Texas, has more concealed  handgun licensees than any other congressional district in Texas, and I  have to assume in the country, for that matter.   The Second Amendment is extremely clear: ``The right of the people to  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' What is so hard to  understand about that?   But, let's face it, folks. The far left's dangerous attack on the  United States Constitution continues unabated, with yet another example  right here with the ATF's unconstitutional pistol brace rule, which  bans millions of firearms with stabilizing braces.   The ATF ruling could turn as many as 40 million Americans into  felons, and those 40 million Americans are sick and tired of faceless  bureaucrats trying to destroy the Second Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said, where the people fear the  government, there is tyranny. Where the government fears the people,  there is liberty.   I would add, Mr. Speaker, fear the government that fears your guns.
