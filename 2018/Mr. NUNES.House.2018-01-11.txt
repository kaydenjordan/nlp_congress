 Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion.    Mr. Speaker, I will just be really brief today. I want to  thank all of my colleagues. There are a lot of strong opinions on both  sides of the aisle on this issue, and we have taken many steps at the  House Intelligence Committee to take Members out to the agencies that  are doing this work.   We have offered time for Members to come down to the SCIF to read all  of the information because, at the end of the day, we all take the  American people's constitutional liberties seriously. I think the  robust debate that has occurred in this House over the last year on  this issue, through many markups, through many committees, and then  even today on the floor here in the House of Representatives, has been  a tough fight because it is a tough issue.   But in closing, this really is a compromise. We worked with the House  Judiciary Committee for many months. I can't thank Chairman Goodlatte  enough for all of his very difficult work in trying to find a  compromise. At the same time, the House Intelligence Committee, we have  worked to come to a compromise with the Democrats on the other side of  the aisle.   So with all of that said, this is one of those days, if we get this  bill passed, I think we can walk out of here proud that we all stood  our ground for stances that we really believe in, but, at the end of  the day, the House is going to work its will in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H159]]     Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
