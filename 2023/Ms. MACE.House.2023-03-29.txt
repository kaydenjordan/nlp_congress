 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, first off, I thank the leadership of our party  and our Conference here today for H.R. 1 and for including some  baseline text protecting the coastline of South Carolina.   South Carolina's beaches are paved with gold. We have clean air,  clean water, a beautiful environment, beautiful trees, a beautiful  landscape, beautiful beaches, and we were able to get baseline text in  H.R. 1 this week that would protect our shoreline from offshore  drilling.   There is no oil out there. We don't need to study it; we don't need  to drill; we don't need to look for it. It does not exist, and the  coast of South Carolina does not want it. I thank folks for including  that in this legislation and protecting our coastline. My State of  South Carolina is deeply appreciative of that in the baseline text.   This amendment really looks at the necessity to have an all-of-the- above strategy and approach to energy. Our policy should reflect our  need to study and find uses for alternative energy sources, and that is  what this amendment will do today.   This amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to report annually on  ongoing assessments of alternative and renewable energy sources. It is  needed to protect American energy security. As the world becomes more  unstable, we need to rely on clean American energy right here at home  and what other sources, alternative sources, of energy are available to  us right here in the United States.   We need to ensure that we take steps to preserve the environment, as  well as why we need an offshore drilling ban but also looking at  alternative sources of energy.   Our overall goal here is to strengthen our supply chains and to  advance American energy security with this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
