 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Issa for yielding. I thank  the chairman of the full Committee on the Judiciary,   Jim Jordan, for  his leadership and collaboration with my office in ushering this bill  through the Judiciary Committee under thorough regular order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bipartisan and  bicameral bill, H.R. 1105, the Debbie Smith Act of 2023.   No woman should ever have to experience the trauma and the pain of a  rape or sexual assault. Yet tragically, these crimes are far too  common, and approximately one in four women will experience this  horrific crime.  [[Page H5678]]    There must be accountability, Mr. Speaker.   That means identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting the attackers  to the fullest extent of the law.   One of the most important methods of investigating these crimes is  through DNA analysis. However, in 2019, the Government Accountability  Office found that backlogged DNA analysis requests at State and local  crime labs increased by 85 percent over the last decade, and the most  recent data estimates that 200,000 sexual assault kits across the  country remain untested.   This is absolutely unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.   My bill, H.R. 1105, addresses this issue directly. H.R. 1105 is a  straight reauthorization of the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program  through fiscal year 2029.   This vital program provides support for law enforcement in all 50  States to help police improve their procedures for collecting DNA  evidence from rape kits and crime scenes; support the proper and timely  analysis of this evidence with a specific priority placed on rape and  sexual assault kits; audit untested DNA evidence from sexual assault  cases; and it enhances the capacity of State and local prosecutors to  bring these cases to court.                                time  1645    This program has been incredibly effective since it was first  established, Mr. Speaker. Funding from this program has directly  resulted in nearly 1.8 million DNA cases analyzed and processed,  including over 600,000 crime scenes and rape kits.   Because of these efforts, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program  accounts for over half of all of the matches, or hits, in the Federal  criminal DNA database. That is quite literally helping survivors reach  the justice, the accountability, and the closure that they need.   Mr. Speaker, we must not let this program lapse at the end of this  fiscal year.   I was proud to lead the previous iteration of this bill in 2019 with  my dear friend Representative Carolyn Maloney. I am beyond thankful to  the 85 bipartisan Members of Congress who have signed on in support of  this legislation.   I also thank Majority Leader   Steve Scalise and his team--you know  who you are--for bringing this bill to the floor, Subcommittee Chairman    Andy Biggs for his partnership in moving this bill through the proper  legislative process, as well as Senators Cornyn, Klobuchar, Graham, and  the Late Senator Dianne Feinstein for their leadership in the Senate.   Through our bicameral work, this bill has only gotten stronger. We  have added an important provision to ensure that a portion of the funds  from this program specifically are set aside for the auditing of  untested rape kits. This will support law enforcement's efforts to  fully account for the rape kits in their possession so that they can be  more efficiently analyzed, processed, and used to put rapists behind  bars.   I thank Senator Rand Paul for this legislative contribution, and I  look forward to seeing an overwhelming bipartisan show of support for  this bill and this program on the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Debbie Smith: I have heard her calls to get  this done, and I promise her this program will be reauthorized as soon  as possible.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
