 Madam Speaker, the trauma, disruption, stress, and  isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the  mental health crisis facing our young people. I have seen this  reflected in my own community. My alma mater, Neuqua Valley High School  in Naperville, Illinois, has lost two students to suicide just this  school year.   These are not isolated events. We are seeing the impacts of the youth  mental health crisis play out in schools and communities across my  district and across the Nation. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago  has seen the number of children admitted as a result of suicide  attempts increase from two to three children per month to two to three  per day. There are now 3,000 children on their waitlist for outpatient  mental healthcare. This is absolutely heartbreaking.   However, I find hope in seeing young people in my community stand up  in the face of tragedy and demand solutions from their schools and  government officials. They shouldn't have to do this, but they are  organizing, participating in school board meetings, and writing and  calling my office. I want them to know that I hear them, and I am  fighting for them.   This summer, I introduced the Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal  Means Safety Act to invest in educating healthcare providers and  evidence-based youth suicide prevention measures. It is absolutely  critical that we act immediately to address the growing unmet need for  more school-based mental health providers.   That is why I am fighting for the maximum possible funding through  the Department of Education for the school-based mental health  workforce in the omnibus appropriations package. I am inviting all  Members to join this bipartisan effort.   Last month, I was proud to join Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark to  introduce the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Act to provide  consistent, long-term funding to support schools in hiring more school- based mental health providers and meet the recommended student-to- provider ratios.   As we begin another year of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, we must  target resources toward supporting the mental health of kids in school.  As U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in his recent advisory on  youth mental health: ``It would be a tragedy if we beat back one public  health crisis only to allow another to grow in its place.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both the House and Senate to  work together and across the aisle to pass legislation, including a  fiscal year 2022 spending package, that makes necessary investments in  combating the mental health crisis facing young people.   We must seize this critical opportunity to build better, safer, and  more supportive environments for our young people to grow and thrive.                            ____________________
