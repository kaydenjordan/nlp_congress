 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life  and faith of my friend, local Houston radio favorite, Michael ``Matt''  Patrick Ryan.   Matt came to Houston after stints in New York, Indiana, and Ohio.  Boy, he just became a favorite of our region, his no-nonsense but so  optimistic way of informing and entertaining us as host of KTRH Morning  News and his syndicated afternoon show.   In September of 2015, Matt faced a new challenge--stage IV melanoma.  He shared his struggle with us. Matt's battle with cancer ended last  Sunday, July 9, but his inspiration is eternal.   So today, as a country, we all join Matt's family--especially his  best friend and wife, Paula; children, Alexandra, Alanna, and Jake; his  family, friends, and listeners in ``the Sandbox''--to recognize his  lifetime of service, his courage, and his absolute faith in God.   We love you, Matt. You will be missed, friend.                            ____________________
