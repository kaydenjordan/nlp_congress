 Mr. Speaker, the headline of The New York Times  yesterday said: ``Syrian Forces Rush Into U.S. Void. Battle Lines  Shifting to the Benefit of Iran, Russia and ISIS,'' to the negative  impact of the national security of the United States of America,  because of one simple phone call of this President to President  Erdogan, and within minutes, the release of vital U.S. troops to the  slaughter of the heroic Kurdish troops who lost their lives and those  remaining, and the release of ISIS family members and ISIS.   We are in a national security crisis. I believe we should be asking  for a no-fly zone of Turkey over northern Syria, and we need to find a  way to rebuild Humpty Dumpty's house.   Let me also indicate that there is no indication that anything is  awry in the investigation that is proceeding. It is proceeding in a  manner where Democrats and Republicans are able to ask questions of  witnesses, along with their staff. This is not an independent counsel,  and so our committees are doing the investigation.   All parties are able to be part of that investigation. And as well,  there is no preclusion to what ultimately may be open hearings.   Let us be patient. Let us be sober and somber for this important  responsibility under the Constitution of the United States of America.  That is the way this Congress should behave.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chairman and ranking  member for coming together.   I was on the floor earlier, and I held up The New York Times that  says: ``Syrian Forces Rush Into U.S. Void,'' and, ``Battle Lines  Shifting to the Benefit of Iran, Russia and ISIS.''   We worked very hard to get Turkey into NATO and to respect it for its  secular position and its embracing of the ideals of democracy, but to  now be the cause of thousands fleeing out of violence and bombing, now  being the cause of ISIS supporters and families escaping, now being the  cause of ISIS fighters escaping, and not listening to any form of  reconciliation to put Russia as the mainstay is absolutely  unacceptable.   I believe that these sanctions and this rebuke and this resolution  that  [[Page H8163]]  has indicated it was wrong to green-light the Turkish military  incursion into Syria's Kurdish territory, expressing strong support for  Syrian Kurdish forces who were our allies, and calling on Turkey to  immediately cease military action in northeast Syria is a question of  our national security.   I add that there should be a no-fly zone. I know how challenging that  would be for Turkey not to be flying over northern Syria.   It is important that we do what we need to do to save the precious  lives of those children, some of whom have already died, and those who  are fleeing the violence.   Mr. Speaker, let us pass this resolution, H.J. Res. 77, but let us  find a way to bring some peace and stand down in that region, and also  to thank the United States military, which should not have been moved.  I ask my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 77.
