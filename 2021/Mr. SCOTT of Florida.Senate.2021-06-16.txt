 Madam President, the United States is a beacon  of democracy in the world, and our Nation was founded on free and fair  elections, but if the American people don't have confidence in our  elections, we don't have a sustainable democracy.   Right now, unfortunately, many people do not have confidence. People  across the country are mad when they look at the blatant power grab by  the Democrats to fundamentally change our democracy. Do you know what?  They should be mad. We are talking about the sacred right to vote.   If we want to continue as a thriving democracy, we have to take  action so  [[Page S4569]]  that Americans trust in free and fair elections. That is why I  introduced the Save Democracy Act so as to restore faith in our Federal  elections and guarantee that voters decide the outcomes of elections,  not the courts.   I also introduced the Promoting Election Integrity by Proving Voter  Identity Act so as to require voter ID. It is pretty simple. If you  want to vote in person, you will need to bring your current and valid  ID. If you want to vote by mail, you will need to provide a copy of  your ID. Like I said, it is pretty simple and straightforward. If we  want, and we do--we want 100 percent participation in our elections,  and we want zero fraud. We want it to be easy to vote and very hard to  cheat. Voter ID helps us meet that goal.   Of course, the Democrats will do anything to fight against these  commonsense reforms. Instead, the Democrats are pushing S. 1, otherwise  known as the Corrupt Politicians Act. S. 1 is the most ridiculous  legislation I have seen since I have come to the Senate. I would need  hours to go through all of it. For our purposes here today, I want to  highlight just one piece of this lunacy: using taxpayer dollars to pay  for political campaigns.   The Democrats want to use your tax dollars to subsidize their  political campaigns. Think about how anti-democratic it is to allow  public servants to use the people's money to manipulate the people  themselves. Just to be crystal clear, here is what is exactly being  proposed by the Democrats in this anti-democratic bill: Public  officials--the government--take money from you. Then they use that  money to pay for their campaign ads in order to manipulate you.   This bill is nothing but a political power grab by Washington  Democrats. New Hampshire Democrat Secretary of State Bill Gardner even  said recently that S. 1 was a power grab by the Federal Government that  would ``trample New Hampshire's state constitution.''   Under the Democrats' plan, a candidate for the Senate in California  could spend $80 million in taxpayer dollars to run attack ads and fund  his campaign--$80 million. In Georgia, a Senate candidate could get as  much as $25 million in taxpayer money. Candidates in Arizona could get  almost $19 million. New York candidates would get more than $44  million. That doesn't make any sense.   What kind of return on investment are the American people getting  when their hard-earned tax dollars are funding attack ads? Why is the  Federal Government in the business of funding campaigns? Because my  Democratic colleagues want the government to take your money and spend  it on trying to manipulate your vote.   Only in Washington would a bunch of politicians look at the  challenges from recovering from the pandemic and decide the most  important thing we can do is make taxpayers fund campaign ads.   This is the most radical piece of voting legislation this Nation has  ever seen at a time when restoring confidence in our elections has  never been more important.   I was sent to the U.S. Senate to fight for Floridians and Americans  against corrupt politicians. Here is my promise to every American  family: I am going to fight every day to make sure the Democrats do not  try to take your money to manipulate your vote.   If we are serious about working together to move our country forward,  restore public trust in our elections, and protect democracy, we need  to reject the insanity of S. 1 and look to commonsense reforms like  voter ID. We will continue to fight the Democrats' election power grab  and combat their efforts to prevent measures that protect the integrity  of our elections   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I stand again today in support  of our great ally Israel. Israel is a vibrant democracy that supports  capitalism, champions human rights, and holds free and open elections.  Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, and Israel deserves  our unwavering support.   Israel is surrounded by nations and terrorist groups that want it  wiped off the face of the Earth. I saw this firsthand during my latest  visit as Senator, which gave me a clear picture of Israel's proximity  to its enemies--Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran.   At my last visit, I was about a half mile from the Gaza Strip and  went to a kibbutz. What was shocking to me is that there were little  children there instinctively raised that, whenever they would hear the  sirens, they instinctively raised their hands because somebody is going  to pick them up and get them to a bomb shelter. I think what they were  telling me when I was there is they had 15 seconds to get to a bomb  shelter when the sirens went off, which said that Hamas was sending  rockets. Also, they were told the story that Hamas was sending balloons  with candy and explosives. So when the balloon would come down, if the  children would touch it, it would explode. It is disgusting.   For 11 days last month, we saw rockets rain down on Israel. As we  watched Hamas terrorists target innocent Israeli citizens, I thought  about the families impacted by this evil. Think about a 5-year-old you  know. They like to play games. They love their brothers and sisters,  and they love their mom and dad. Well, a 5-year-old, just like the one  you are thinking of, named Ido Avigal was killed as Hamas rockets  indiscriminately just pounded Israel. His life was taken by Hamas  terrorists. I have a 5-year-old grandson. I can't imagine life without  him. I can't imagine what either of those families is going through  right now.   Instead of coming together against this violence, we saw the  Democrats turn their backs on Israel. I was proud to lead more than 30  of my colleagues in a resolution to support Israel in its right to  defend itself against terrorist attacks. Unfortunately, it was blocked  by Senate Democrats.   It was not so long ago that the Senate stood with Israel on a  bipartisan basis. In 2014, when Israel was again subject to a barrage  of rockets targeting innocent Israelis, then-Majority Leader Reid  offered a resolution supporting Israel's right to defend itself against  Hamas. Every single Senator voted to support Israel's right to defend  itself against Hamas--not anymore. It is despicable that something as  simple as reaffirming America's support for Israel no longer aligns  with the priorities of the Democrat Party.   I have also joined in a resolution with Senator Cruz to approve the  arm sales to Israel and the resolution with Senator Hawley to condemn  the disturbing wave of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel actions in  Congress, in the United States, and around the world. These  reprehensible and disturbing acts must be swiftly condemned at every  level and those responsible prosecuted to the fullest extent of the  law.   President Biden's State Department recently said:         We're going to be working in partnership with the United       Nations and the Palestinian Authority to `kind of' channel       aid there in a manner that does its best to go to the people       of Gaza.    The official went on to say:         As we've seen in life, as we all know in life, there are no       guarantees, but we're going to do everything that we can to       ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it       the most.    So the Biden administration can't guarantee that American taxpayer  dollars aren't going to fund terrorists in Hamas? The Biden  administration thinks it is OK to fund Hamas terrorists because ``in  life there are no guarantees''? The Biden administration seems  unbothered if some funding goes to the terrorists that killed Ido.   President Biden must do better. His administration must control where  this money is going. Yes, we can make sure American tax dollars aren't  funding terrorists. What we are hearing from the Biden administration  is they simply won't take the time to do what it takes to guarantee  that. This lack of accountability or concern is absolutely disgusting,  and we should not allow it.  [[Page S4575]]    That is why I, along with Senators Joni Ernst, Cindy Hyde-Smith, and  Mike Braun, introduced the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act, which  says that no funds will be authorized for the territory of Gaza until  the President certifies to Congress that these funds can be spent  without benefitting terrorist organizations.   The Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act also ensures U.S. funds are  not authorized for expenditure in the territory of Gaza to any United  Nations entity or office that the President cannot certify is not  encouraging or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas and  propaganda.   Recently, a European Union report was released showing Palestinian  Authority textbooks in U.N.-supported schools encourage violence  against Israelis, including anti-Semitic messages. And just last week,  a tunnel reportedly dug by Hamas was found underneath a Gaza school run  by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.   We can't allow this to continue. I am proud to lead my colleagues in  saying the United States will not fund this destruction.   I yield to my colleague from Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst.    And I yield to my colleague from Mississippi,  Senator Hyde-Smith    Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues  from Iowa and Mississippi for supporting me today in our effort to make  sure that we do not ever fund Hamas.   I hope every single Member in this body can agree that the United  States shouldn't fund terrorists with American taxpayer dollars-- funding that could be used to kill Israelis--like I do.  [[Page S4576]]  I look forward to my colleagues joining me today to stand with Israel  and against terrorism.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1899 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Madam President.    Madam President, I am glad my colleague has  acknowledged his interest in helping Israel. Unfortunately, I am  surprised that the--if my colleague had an interest, why didn't the  Foreign Relations Committee take up the same resolution that the  majority leader retook up in support of Israel basically saying that  Israel had the right to defend itself and saying that Hamas was a  terrorist organization? My colleague didn't.   This is a pretty simple bill. It basically just says, look, any  foreign aid we are going to give to the Palestinian Authority, we are  going to make sure it doesn't go to Hamas. It is pretty simple.   Let's remember why we are doing this. President Biden's State  Department said:         We're going to be working in partnership with the United       Nations and the Palestinian Authority to kind of channel aid       there in a manner that does its best to go to the people of       Gaza.    That should scare us.   It went on to say:         As we have seen in life, as we all know in life, there are       no guarantees, but we're going to do everything that we can       to ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it       the most.    That is not much of a guarantee. That is a ``maybe we will try.'' We  can do better. The Senate should do better. Republicans and Democrats  should all say that not a dime will ever go to Hamas, a terrorist  organization that kills little boys like Ido. We should all be  disgusted with this.   So I am very disappointed that my colleague uses a procedural matter  to say he objects, but basically what he is saying is he will not agree  that this money will not go to Hamas. This was really simple. You could  read this in just 2 minutes.   I am disappointed that my Democratic colleague has made this  political. It is not political. It is about, do we support Israel? Are  we going to make sure that never a dime goes to Hamas and another  little boy like Ido dies?   I yield the floor.
