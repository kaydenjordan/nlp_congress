 Mr. Speaker, I oppose President Trump's outrageous  policy of separating families on our southern border.   Tearing children from the arms of their parents, confining them in  cages with children caring for one another, should never happen  anywhere in the world, let alone in America.   The National Association of School Psychologists calls this emotional  violence. They go on to say, ``Such trauma can have lifelong  consequences with respect to children's mental health and behavioral  health.''   This is a human rights violation committed by the Trump  administration. Make no mistake. President Trump has the power to end  this today.   When the President says he is required by law to enact this policy or  when he blames Democrats for the crisis he has created, I say: Mr.  President, you are not telling the truth. So tomorrow, you don't need  to go to Minnesota. You need to stay here in Washington, stop this  heartless policy. The American people demand that these children be  given back to their parents and to end this crisis now.
