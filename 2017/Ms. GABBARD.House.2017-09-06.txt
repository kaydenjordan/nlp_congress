 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Shingai, who came to the  U.S. when he was 13, graduated with a political science degree from  Hawaii Pacific University, and is putting that degree into practice  today.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Oklahoma has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
