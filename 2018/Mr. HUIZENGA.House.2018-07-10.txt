 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6139) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study to evaluate the issues affecting the provision of and  reliance upon investment research into small issuers.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6139         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Investment       Research for Small and Emerging Issuers Act''.       SEC. 2. RESEARCH STUDY.         (a) Study Required.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall conduct a study to evaluate the issues affecting the       provision of and reliance upon investment research into small       issuers, including emerging growth companies and companies       considering initial public offerings.        (b) Contents of Study.--The study required under subsection       (a) shall consider--        (1) factors related to the demand for such research by       institutional and retail investors;        (2) the availability of such research, including--        (A) the number and types of firms who provide such       research;        (B) the volume of such research over time; and        (C) competition in the research market;        (3) conflicts of interest relating to the production and       distribution of investment research;        (4) the costs of such research;        (5) the impacts of different payment mechanisms for       investment research into small issuers, including whether       such research is paid for by--        (A) hard-dollar payments from research clients;        (B) payments directed from the client's commission income       (i.e., ``soft dollars''); or        (C) payments from the issuer that is the subject of such       research;        (6) any unique challenges faced by minority-owned, women-      owned, and veteran-owned small issuers in obtaining research       coverage; and        (7) the impact on the availability of research coverage for       small issuers due to--        (A) investment adviser concentration and consolidation,       including any potential impacts of fund-size on demand for       investment research of small issuers;        (B) broker and dealer concentration and consolidation,       including any relationships between the size of the firm and       allocation of resources for investment research into small       issuers;        (C) Securities and Exchange Commission rules;        (D) registered national securities association rules;        (E) State and Federal liability concerns;        (F) the settlement agreements referenced in Securities and       Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 18438 (i.e., the       ``Global Research Analyst Settlement''); and        (G) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of       the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial       instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive       2011/61/EU, as implemented by the European Union (``EU'')       member states (``MiFID II'').        (c) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and       Exchange Commission shall submit to Congress a report that       includes--        (1) the results of the study required by subsection (a);       and        (2) recommendations to increase the demand for, volume of,       and quality of investment research into small issuers,       including emerging growth companies and companies considering       initial public offerings.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, initial public offerings, or IPOs, have historically  been one of the most meaningful steps in the lifecycle of a company.   Going public was the ultimate goal for many entrepreneurs. You start  a business from scratch, build it into a successful enterprise, and  then open up an opportunity for the public to share in your success.  Going public not only affords companies many benefits, including access  to the capital markets, but IPOs are also important to the investing  public. By completing an IPO, a company is able to raise much-needed  capital for job creation and expansion opportunities, while allowing  Main Street investors an opportunity to have an economic piece of the  action and the ability to participate in the growth phase of a company.   However, over the past two decades, our Nation has experienced a 37  percent decline in the number of U.S.-listed companies. Equally  troubling, we have seen the number of public companies fall to around  5,700. These statistics are concerning because they are similar to the  data we saw in the 1980s when our economy was less than half of its  current size.   For a myriad of reasons, the public model is no longer viewed as the  most attractive means of raising capital. Instead, small and emerging  growth companies are choosing to go public much later in their  lifecycle or, frankly, choosing not to go public at all.   We must work to change that trajectory, in my mind. In speaking to  the New York Economic Club, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stated:  ``Regardless of the cause, the reduction in the number of U.S.-listed  public companies is a serious issue for our markets and the country  more generally. To the extent companies are eschewing our public  markets, the vast majority of Main Street investors will be unable to  participate in their growth. The potential lasting effects of such an  outcome to the economy and society are, in two words, not good.''   That is from SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.   I share Chairman Clayton's concerns. We need to ensure that our  capital markets are open for innovators and job creators, and we must  work to rightsize regulations for smaller companies as well.   One way that Congress worked to lift burdensome regulations and help  small companies gain access to these capital markets was the bipartisan  Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly known as the JOBS Act.  Section 105 of the JOBS Act changed the ``gun-jumping rules'' to  provide an exception from the definition of an offer to allow for the  publication or distribution by a broker or dealer of a research report  about an emerging growth company that is the subject of a proposed  public offering.   However, few investment banks have published any pre-IPO research  since passage of the JOBS Act, and research coverage, in general, on  small issuers continues to be an issue. This negatively affects  investor interest and awareness in a company as well as its trading  liquidity and, therefore, does not allow the company to launch the way  that it properly could.                                time  1445    This provision is intended to increase research, but, unfortunately,  it has had the opposite effect, and, instead, there has been a  significant decline--we have seen a significant decline over recent  years in analyst research covering small public companies.   According to the U.S. Chamber, ``61 percent of all companies listed  on a major exchange with less than $100 million market capitalization  have no research coverage at all.''   For equities with a market cap below $750 million, the average number  of research analysts covering that stock is one, while equities above  $750 million  [[Page H5998]]  in market cap have an average of 12 research analysts covering the  stock.   Additionally, the amount of research written on small companies has  declined even as the percentage of individual ownership in small cap  companies has gone up, has increased. Little or no research coverage  generally corresponds with lower stock liquidity, and reduced research  coverage may particularly be disadvantageous to individual investors  who have limited research capabilities on their own.   In fact, one study published in June of 2017 in The Journal of  Finance found that an increase in the number of analysts covering an  industry improved the quality of analyst forecasts and information flow  to investors. For that reason, it is important to examine current SEC  rules and regulations affecting the ability of investment research  coverage regarding these small issuers.   The Treasury report on Capital Markets recommended a holistic review  of the rules and regulations regarding research, including the global  settlement, to determine which provisions should be retained, amended,  or removed.   Our bipartisan bill, the Improving Investment Research for Small and  Emerging Issuers Act would direct the SEC to study and evaluate issues  affecting the ability of emerging growth companies and other small  issuers in obtaining research coverage, including SEC rules, FINRA  rules, State and Federal liability concerns, the 2003 Global Research  Analyst Settlements, and MiFID II.   And not later than 180 days after enactment of that, the SEC will be  required to submit to Congress a report that includes the results of  the study and recommendations to assist these emerging growth  companies, or EGCs, and other small issuers to obtain research  coverage.   Among the issues the SEC must consider are factors related to the  demand for such research by institutional and retail investors, cost  considerations for such research, and the impact on the availability of  research coverage for small issuers due to a variety of market and  regulatory conditions.   The SEC's report must include recommendations to increase the demand  for, volume of, and quality of investment research into small issuers,  including EGCs. This legislation is supported by Biotechnology Industry  Organization, also known as BIO; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Nasdaq;  the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, also known  as SIFMA; and the National Venture Capital Association.   I thank the ranking member, Ms. Waters, for recognizing the  importance of this research in our capital markets and working with me  to address this issue and being a cosponsor of this.   So I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to, again, thank the ranking member  for her work on this and being able to move forward on this very  important issue. And I, again, want to encourage all of our friends on  all sides, on both sides of the aisle, to be supportive of this. It is  a very important thing as we figure out the situation with the IPOs  here in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1861) to award a Congressional Gold Medal in honor of  Lawrence Eugene ``Larry'' Doby in recognition of his achievements and  contributions to American major league athletics, civil rights, and the  Armed Forces during World War II.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1861         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``The Larry Doby Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) Larry Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, on       December 13, 1923, and moved to Paterson, New Jersey, in       1938, where he became a standout 4 sport athlete at Paterson       Eastside High School;        (2) Larry Doby attended Long Island University on a       basketball scholarship before enlisting in the United States       Navy during World War II;        (3) upon his honorable discharge from the Navy in 1946,       Larry Doby played baseball in the Negro National League for       the Newark Eagles;        (4) after playing the 1946 season, Larry Doby's contract       was purchased by the Cleveland Indians of the American League       on July 3, 1947;        (5) on July 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African-      American to play in the American League;        (6) Larry Doby played in the American League for 13 years,       appearing in 1,533 games and batting .283, with 253 home runs       and 970 runs batted in;        (7) Larry Doby was voted to 7 All-Star teams, led the       American League in home runs twice, and played in 2 World       Series;        (8) in 1948, Larry Doby helped lead the Cleveland Indians       to a World Series Championship over the Boston Braves and       became the first African-American player to hit a home run in       a World Series game;        (9) after his stellar playing career ended, Larry Doby       continued to make a significant contribution to his       community;        (10) Larry Doby was a pioneer in the cause of civil rights       and received honorary doctorate degrees from Long Island       University, Princeton University, and Fairfield University;        (11) in 1978, Larry Doby became the manager of the Chicago       White Sox, only the second African-American manager of a       Major League Baseball team;        (12) Larry Doby was the Director of Community Relations for       the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association,       where he was deeply involved in a number of inner-city youth       programs; and        (13) Larry Doby was inducted to the National Baseball Hall       of Fame in 1998.  [[Page H5999]]            SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design, in       honor of Larry Doby and in recognition of his achievements       and contributions to American major league athletics, civil       rights, and the Armed Forces during World War II.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6000]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, what an incredible story that we see here.   I, too, want to congratulate both Congressman Pascrell, as well as  Congressman Renacci for their work on this.   As I was doing a little research and hearing the stories and looking  at Wikipedia and some other things, it led to lots of different places.  The amazing athleticism of this man was clear--the fact that he was 17  when he started playing baseball professionally; the fact that he  played basketball professionally; the fact that he went on to be a  major force in two different sports, both with the New Jersey Nets as  well as with the White Sox as a player and as a manager--well deserved  and, unfortunately, as has been pointed out, far too long in the  making.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for their tenacity in going  after this. It is not easy to get 300 of your colleagues in this body  to agree on anything. That it is Tuesday would be difficult to get them  to agree on, much less awarding a Gold Medal. So kudos and thanks to  those gentlemen who worked so hard.   Again, as I said, one of the things that struck me is the camaraderie  that it sounds like he and Jackie Robinson had--speaking on the phone  often; being the first two members of their race to break that color  barrier in their respective leagues--what a wonderful story that is.   Congratulations to the Doby family and to my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5749) to require the appropriate Federal banking agencies to  increase the risk-sensitivity of the capital treatment of certain  centrally cleared options, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5749         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H6001]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Options Markets Stability       Act''.       SECTION 2. RULEMAKING.         Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the       Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal       Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the       Currency shall, jointly, issue a proposed rule, and finalize       such rule within 360 days of the date of enactment of this       Act, to adopt a methodology for calculating the counterparty       credit risk exposure, at default, of a depository       institution, depository institution holding company, or       affiliate thereof to a client arising from a guarantee       provided by the depository institution, depository       institution holding company, or affiliate thereof to a       central counterparty in respect of the client's performance       under an exchange-listed derivative contract cleared through       that central counterparty pursuant to the risk-based and       leverage-based capital rules applicable to depository       institutions and depository institution holding companies       under parts 3, 217, and 324 of title 12, Code of Federal       Regulations. In issuing such rule, the Board of Governors of       the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency shall       consider--        (1) the availability of liquidity provided by market makers       during times of high volatility in the capital markets;        (2) the spread between the bid and the quote offered by       market makers;        (3) the preference for clearing through central       counterparties;        (4) the safety and soundness of the financial system and       financial stability, including the benefits of central       clearing;        (5) the safety and soundness of individual institutions       that may centrally clear exchange-listed derivatives or       options on behalf of a client, including concentration of       market share;        (6) the economic value of delta weighting a counterparty's       position and netting of a counterparty's position;        (7) the inherent risk of the positions;        (8) barriers to entry for depository institutions,       depository institution holding companies, affiliates thereof,       and entities not affiliated with a depository institution or       depository institution holding company to centrally clear       exchange-listed derivatives or options on behalf of market       makers;        (9) the impact any changes may have on the broader capital       regime and aggregate capital in the system; and        (10) consideration of other potential factors that impact       market making in the exchange-listed options market,       including changes in market structure.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         At the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date the       final rule is issued under section 2, the Board of Governors       of the Federal Reserve System shall submit to the Committee       on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the       Senate a report detailing the impact of the final rule during       such period on the factors described under paragraphs (1)       through (10) of section 2.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5749, the Options  Markets Stability Act, which would adjust the risk sensitivity of the  capital treatment of centrally cleared options.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend from Illinois and fellow member  of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hultgren, for his tireless  work on this. Mr. Speaker, it may come as no surprise that this may not  be the most exciting portion of the work that is done in our committee,  it is not necessarily the most sexy of issues that we deal with, but it  is extremely important. I appreciate the work of the gentleman as well  as members on the committee from all sides.   As I said, Mr. Speaker, options are incredibly useful and powerful  risk mitigation tools that can help protect an investor's financial  portfolio. From buying puts to hedge the downside risk of owning a  stock to writing covered calls to collect income and cap potential  losses, listed options strategies are protective tools employed by  individual investors, institutions, and pension funds.   But options do have a sensitivity to the price of the underlying  stock such that, at any given point in time, the value of an option  will respond differently to changes in the price of the option's  underlying shares.   Increased volatility in equity markets during recent months has  revealed that certain bank capital requirements using the current  exposure method--or CEM, as it is known--from the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision discourages the use of central clearing, which is a  central tenet of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is actually counterintuitive  and the reason why we are here today trying to fix that.   Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires derivatives, including  options, to be centrally cleared in order to take advantage of the  risk-mitigating benefits of clearing. As a result, the role of clearing  members, or houses, and the amount of transactions cleared by these  institutions has expanded significantly.   However, businesses and end users which use these options to manage  business risks can only trade through a clearing member, as they are  unable to access clearinghouses directly.   The risk-based and leverage-based capital requirements for banks have  made it cost prohibitive for clearing members to expand their  derivatives clearing services when there is higher volume. As a result,  liquidity providers who depend on banks to centrally clear their  options are having trouble providing liquidity during instances of  market volatility, therefore making it more expensive for individuals  and institutions to hedge their positions through the use of options  contracts. As I pointed out, Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the opposite  of what the intent of the Dodd-Frank Act was in this area.   Although the Basel Committee agreed to replace CEM by January of 2017  with a more risk-sensitive method known as the standardized approach  for measuring counterparty credit risk, or SA-CCR, exposures, the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve has not yet implemented SA-CCR, and  the transition is not imminent.   To remedy these problems, H.R. 5749, the Options Markets Stability  Act introduced by Representative Hultgren and Representative Foster,  two colleagues from Illinois, will help alleviate the unnecessary  adverse impact of the current exposure method, or CEM, on the listed  options market.   This legislation would require the Federal Reserve Board, Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation to implement a risk-adjusted approach to value centrally  cleared options as it relates to capital rules to better and more  accurately reflect exposure and promote options market-making activity.   Specifically, the bill changes how the calculation of the CEM on  options contracts is calculated on their notional face value rather  than through a risk-adjusted value, which reflects actual exposures.                                time  1515    By changing this calculation, it will incentivize the use of hedged  positions and would reduce the amount of capital required to place  these positions and reduce overall exposure.   Market-maker liquidity is critical to vibrant options markets, and  the knock-on effects are increased costs to investors, a heightened  possibility of market dislocation during volatile environments, and the  discouragement of centrally cleared products that help limit the  systemic risk that we are all trying to eliminate.   This bipartisan bill, which passed the Financial Services Committee  by a vote of 54-0, is a modest adjustment to the risk- and leverage- based capital rules to better take into account the actual risk of  clearing options.   I commend my colleagues, Representative Hultgren and Representative  Foster, for their bipartisan work on this important bill, and I urge  all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5749.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chair of the  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I encourage my  colleagues to vote for H.R. 5749, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5877) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow  for the registration of venture exchanges, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5877         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Main Street Growth Act''.       SEC. 2. VENTURE EXCHANGES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5877, the Main Street Growth  Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from the Financial Services  Committee, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), which would help  further facilitate capital formation for smaller issuers.   Specifically, the Main Street Growth Act would provide for the  creation and registration of venture exchanges. Venture exchanges would  be prohibited from extending unlisted trading privileges, or UTP, as  they are known, to any venture security, which would prevent venture  securities from trading on exchanges other than the one that it is  listed on, in order to concentrate liquidity onto the venture exchange.  In addition, venture exchanges would also be exempt from  decimalization.   The U.S. capital markets have, and continue to be, a vibrant  ecosystem, fueling America's economic growth and generating millions of  private sector jobs. These markets provide financing and needed  resources to the smallest startups, as well as the largest  international companies.   However, a company's size has often impacted how easily it is to  access capital, as larger companies generally found the capital markets  easier to access than smaller companies.   While the number of IPOs in the U.S. has rebounded from its post- crisis collapse--thanks, in part, to the success of the JOBS Act-- smaller companies still face significant regulatory and market  impediments that disincentivize them from accessing capital via the  public markets.   There are differing perspectives as to why fewer companies,  particularly smaller companies, have gone public over the past few  decades. In fact, Chairman Clayton recently said, at the end of the  day, no matter what those reasons are, it is ``not good'' that would be  happening.   The data suggests that, in order to fulfill its capital formation  mandate, the SEC needs to tailor its approach to account for the  varying nature and size of companies, including the one-size-fits-all  regulatory structure of the current equity markets.   As a natural extension of the JOBS Act and the new securities  offerings available to startup enterprises, venture exchanges offer one  possible solution to the liquidity and capital access challenges faced  by smaller issuers.   A venture exchange construct would expand access to capital for  entrepreneurs; enable earlier public participation in the company's  lifecycle; and attract post-issuance support, including research,  sales, and capital commitments by market-makers.   In fact, the SEC's Commissioners, market participants, and other  interested parties have all expressed interest in the concept of  venture exchanges as a means to provide secondary market liquidity to  smaller companies.   NASDAQ recently testified at a hearing held on May 23 of this year:  ``NASDAQ recommends permitting issuers to choose to trade in an  environment with consolidated liquidity as would be allowed under the  Venture Exchange Legislation. By creating a market for smaller issuers  that is voluntary for issuers to join and largely exempt from the UTP  obligations, subject to key exemptions, we can concentrate liquidity to  reduce volatility and improve the trading experience.''   Additionally, at that same hearing, the U.S. Chamber stated: ``While  the JOBS Act did a great deal to help EGCs raise capital in primary  offerings, it did comparatively little to address the secondary market  trading in these same companies.''   Legislation like the Main Street Growth Act is an important  bipartisan step to better tailoring market structure rules for small  issuers and helping to facilitate capital formation.   I commend my colleague, Mr. Emmer, on his bipartisan work on the Main  Street Growth Act, which passed the Financial Services Committee by a  vote of 56-0, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5877.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I also have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5953) to provide regulatory relief to charitable  organizations that provide housing assistance, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5953         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Building       Up Independent Lives and Dreams Act'' or the ``BUILD Act''.       SEC. 2. MORTGAGE LOAN TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.         (a) TILA Amendment.--Section 105 of the Truth in Lending       Act (15 U.S.C. 1604) is amended by inserting after subsection       (d) the following:        ``(e) Disclosure for Charitable Mortgage Loan       Transactions.--With respect to a mortgage loan transaction       involving a residential mortgage loan offered at zero percent       interest primarily for charitable purposes by an organization       having tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, forms HUD-1 and GFE (as       defined under section 1024.2(b) of title 12, Code of Federal       Regulations), together with a disclosure substantially in the       form of the Loan Model Form H-2 (as defined under Appendix H       to section 1026 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations)       shall, collectively, be an appropriate model form for       purposes of subsection (b).''.        (b) RESPA Amendment.--Section 4 of the Real Estate       Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2603) is amended       by adding at the end the following:        ``(d) With respect to a mortgage loan transaction involving       a residential mortgage loan offered at zero percent interest       primarily for charitable purposes, an organization having       tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 may use forms HUD-1 and GFE (as defined       under section 1024.2(b) of title 12, Code of Federal       Regulations) together with a disclosure substantially in the       form of the Loan Model Form H-2 (as defined under Appendix H       to section 1026 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations),       collectively, in lieu of the disclosure published under       subsection (a).''.        (c) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Bureau of       Consumer Financial Protection shall issue such regulations as       may be necessary to implement the amendments made by       subsections (a) and (b).        (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a)       and (b) shall take effect on the date of the enactment of       this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5953, the Building Up  Independent Lives and Dreams, or BUILD, Act, which would cut some of  the regulatory red tape and alleviate unnecessary burdens that were  created by Dodd-Frank.   The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, as it is referred to, and the Real  Estate Settlements Procedures Act, also known as RESPA, required  lenders to provide consumers disclosures about the estimated and actual  real estate settlement costs and financial terms of the mortgages that  they offer.   Among other requirements, RESPA required standardized disclosures,  such as good faith estimates, of the costs that the borrower should  expect to pay at closing, and a list of closing costs commonly known as  the HUD-1 document.   TILA required lenders to disclose the cost of credit and the  repayment terms of mortgage loans before borrowers entered into a  transaction. These disclosures were intended to help consumers compare  the terms and make informed decisions regarding the suitability of  various mortgage products and services that they were looking at  purchasing.  [[Page H6006]]    However, Dodd-Frank mandated that the Bureau of Consumer Financial  Protection promulgate ``a single integrated disclosure for mortgage  loan transactions . . . to aid the borrower . . . in understanding the  transaction by utilizing readily understandable language to simplify  the technical nature of the disclosures.''   It seems to me that in an effort to simplify the language, we might  have added some more complicated language. But nonetheless, it remains  compliant with both TILA and RESPA, which are very important.   I can tell you, as a former licensed Realtor, these disclosures and  these closing documents are extremely important.   What we have seen, though, under this current situation, the TILA- RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, as it is called, the TRID rule  was born out of this.   The final TRID forms combined elements of the good faith estimate,  the HUD-1, and the TILA disclosure.   While these new forms were designed to be more consumer friendly-- they include sections on balloon loans and adjustable rate mortgages  that may be applicable to traditional mortgage lenders--these forms are  not relevant to charitable organizations like Habitat for Humanity,  however.   Additionally, the TRID integrated disclosure forms pose significant  implementation and compliance challenges for these charitable  organizations because they include difficult-to-understand timing and  delivery requirements and other practical implementation issues that go  well beyond the previous content requirements, such as requiring  purchasing and training of costly complex software intended for  traditional mortgage lenders. Therefore, many charitable organizations  have difficulty with fulfilling the needed compliance related to the  origination and servicing of their loans.   The BUILD Act, introduced by Representative Loudermilk and  Representative Sherman, would roll back requirements of the TILA-RESPA  Integrated Disclosures Rule for charities, and only charities, like  Habitat for Humanity and others, and, instead, allow these charities to  use the good faith estimate and HUD-1 mortgage forms that had been in  place previously.   Groups like Habitat for Humanity and their local State organizations  specialize in providing housing for low income and rural communities.  The financing that is done at a zero percent interest rate to provide  minimal cost to the occupant is commendable and a goal that we all  have.   This bill cuts yet another senseless and poorly written provision of  Dodd-Frank that will help provide affordable housing for low income  Americans in search of the American Dream.   Specifically, this bipartisan bill would provide tax-exempt nonprofit  organizations originating these zero interest mortgage loans the  flexibility to choose the simplest and most cost effective delivery of  the mortgage disclosures.   Now these charitable organizations will be able to use their very  scarce resources for building, repairing, and rehabilitating housing  instead of spending it on costly compliance software.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the bipartisan work of  Representatives Loudermilk and Sherman on the BUILD Act, which passed  the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 35-0. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5953, the BUILD Act, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my colleague from the  Financial Services Committee, the author of the BUILD Act.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to commend our colleagues for  working in a bipartisan manner, Mr. Loudermilk and Mr. Sherman, not  only for dealing with this in committee; there was some trust that was  shown on all sides to move forward on that, and this is the way the  system is supposed to work. Congratulations.   I look forward to supporting this bill and request that all of my  colleagues do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4537) to preserve the State-based system of insurance  regulation and provide greater oversight of and transparency on  international insurance standards setting processes, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4537         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``International Insurance       Standards Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The State-based system for insurance regulation in the       United States has served American consumers well for more       than 150 years and has fostered an open and competitive       marketplace with a diversity of insurance products to the       benefit of policyholders and consumers.        (2) Protecting policyholders by regulating to ensure an       insurer's ability to pay claims has been the hallmark of the       successful United States system and should be the paramount       objective of domestic prudential regulation and emerging       international standards.        (3) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) reaffirmed the State-      based insurance regulatory system.       SEC. 3.

(b) Federal Insurance Office Functions.--Subparagraph (E)       of section 313(c)(1) of title 31, United States Code, is       amended by inserting ``Federal Government'' after ``United       States''.        (c) Negotiations.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to prevent participation in negotiations of any       proposed agreement or standard.       SEC. 4. STATE INSURANCE REGULATOR INVOLVEMENT IN                     INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SETTING.

SEC. 8. INAPPLICABILITY TO TRADE AGREEMENTS.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not       apply to any forum or negotiations related to a trade       agreement.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first I would like to commend my friends, Mr. Duffy and  Mr. Heck, for their work on this very important issue. For over 150  years, U.S. insurance companies of every kind--including property- casualty, life, reinsurance, health, and auto--have all been regulated  primarily by the States.   Congress and the States have occasionally reviewed the effectiveness  of the State-based regulation of insurance and coordinated efforts that  they have to achieve greater regulatory uniformity. In fact, in 1945,  Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which confirmed the States'  regulatory authority over insurance except where a Federal law  expressly provides otherwise.   As a former State representative in the Michigan Legislature, I know  firsthand that Michigan does a better job of protecting policyholders  within their borders than the Federal Government can do. I have seen it  in action. Even more, Michigan certainly knows how to maintain a robust  insurance marketplace that works for Michigan consumers. I would assume  the exact same thing in Wisconsin and in Washington and in California  and all throughout the States.   However, there are those who believe Washington knows best. In fact,  title V of the Dodd-Frank Act enlarged the Federal Government's role in  the insurance industry by creating a Federal office specifically tasked  with insurance matters. The Dodd-Frank Act established FIO, or the  Federal Insurance Office, at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and  charged the FIO Director with the responsibility to both represent the  interests of U.S. insurers during the negotiation of international  agreements and then advise the Office of the United States Trade  Representative during trade negotiations.   At the same time, the Dodd-Frank Act changed domestic insurance  regulation. Dodd-Frank led to changes in the U.S. participation at the  International Association of Insurance Supervisors, also known as IAIS,  which develops international insurance regulations for its 190  jurisdictions in more than 140 countries.   Mr. Speaker, I know that I am not the only one who is concerned that  this could influence the Federal Government to look at replacing our  State-based regulatory insurance model with some sort of international  standards that were created, frankly, by unelected European  bureaucrats. The outcomes of these discussions could have significant  impact on the U.S. insurance markets, consumers, and the companies that  provide those products.   Therefore, the U.S. needs to maintain a strong, unified voice that  will ensure our successful State-based, policyholder-centric system of  insurance regulation is the model for the discussions and the basis of  the official United States position abroad.   H.R. 4537, the International Insurance Standards Act, introduced by  my friend and colleague, Representative Duffy, would require the United  States to recognize the primacy of the U.S. State-based insurance  regulatory regime when entering into and agreeing to international  insurance negotiations. Additionally, this bill would provide needed  transparency throughout the negotiation process and provide Congress  with final approval authorization.   As the IAIS works on topics like global capital standards,  governance,  [[Page H6009]]  and market conduct, H.R. 4537 would position the U.S. to participate in  the discussions, while also protecting itself from European standards  that could be detrimental to U.S. consumers, insurers, and markets.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend, again, Representative Duffy and  Representative Heck for their bipartisan work on this important bill,  which passed the Financial Services Committee on a vote of 56-4. I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect an insurance  regulatory model that has worked well for over 150 years and vote in  favor of H.R. 4537.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2018.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing with respect to the       jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Ways and Means in       matters being considered in H.R. 4537, the International       Insurance Standards Act of 2018.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 4537 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4537.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                            House of Representative,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your June 22, 2018       letter regarding H.R. 4537, the ``International Insurance       Standards Act of 2017''.        I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on       H.R. 4537 so that it may move expeditiously to the House       floor, I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on       the bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is in no way       waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar       legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on       this legislation, I will support any request that your       committee be represented therein.        Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this       letter in our committee's report on H.R. 4537 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                 Committee on Rules,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2018.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On December 13, 2017, the Committee on       Financial Services favorably ordered H.R. 4537, the       ``International Insurance Standards Act of 2017,'' reported       to the House. As you know, the Committee on Rules was granted       an additional referral upon the bill's introduction pursuant       to the Committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of       the House of Representatives over the rules of the House and       special orders of business.        Because of your willingness to make the necessary changes       to provisions that fall within Rules Committee jurisdiction       prior to floor consideration of the bill. I will waive       consideration of the bill by the Rules Committee. By agreeing       to waive consideration of the bill, the Rules Committee does       not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 4537. In addition, the       Committee reserves its authority to seek conferees on any       provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction       during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on       this legislation. I ask your commitment to support any       request by the Rules Committee for conferees on H.R. 4537 or       related legislation.        I also request that you include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the committee report to accompany H.R. 4537       and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this       legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention       to these matters.            Sincerely,                                                     Pete Sessions,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2018.      Hon. Pete Sessions,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Sessions: Thank you for your June 25, 2018       letter regarding H.R. 4537, the ``International Insurance       Standards Act of 2017''.        I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on       H.R. 4537 so that it may move expeditiously to the House       floor I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on       the bill, the Committee on Rules is in no way waiving its       jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. In       addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, I       will support any request that your committee be represented       therein.        Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this       letter in our committee's report on H.R. 4537 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy). My friend and colleague is a  leader of this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the ranking  member that that could, too, be a unifying part of the House of  Representatives, our collective frustration with the airlines and  delays in getting us all here in a timely fashion for important things  like this.   But that little bipartisan sentiment aside, I, too, want to commend  Mr. Heck and Mr. Duffy for their work on this, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support this underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5793) to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development to carry out a housing choice voucher mobility  demonstration to encourage families receiving such voucher assistance  to move to lower-poverty areas and expand access to opportunity areas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5793         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Choice Voucher       Mobility Demonstration Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER MOBILITY DEMONSTRATION.

(c) Regional Housing Mobility Plan.--The Secretary shall       require each public housing agency applying to participate in       the demonstration program under this section to submit a       Regional Housing Mobility Plan (in this section referred to       as a ``Plan''), which shall--        (1) identify the public housing agencies that will       participate under the Plan and the number of vouchers each       participating agency will make available out of their       existing programs in connection with the demonstration;        (2) identify any community-based organizations, nonprofit       organizations, businesses, and other entities that will       participate under the Plan and describe the commitments for       such participation made by each such entity;        (3) identify any waivers or alternative requirements       requested for the execution of the Plan;        (4) identify any specific actions that the public housing       agencies and other entities will undertake to accomplish the       goals of the  [[Page H6011]]       demonstration, which shall include a comprehensive approach       to enable a successful transition to opportunity areas and       may include counseling and continued support for families;        (5) specify the criteria that the public housing agencies       would use to identify opportunity areas under the plan;        (6) provide for establishment of priority and preferences       for participating families, including a preference for       families with young children, as such term is defined by the       Secretary, based on regional housing needs and priorities;       and        (7) comply with any other requirements established by the       Secretary.        (d) Funding for Mobility-Related Services.--        (1) Use of administrative fees.--Public housing agencies       participating in the demonstration program under this section       may use administrative fees under section 8(q) of the United       States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)), their       administrative fee reserves, and funding from private       entities to provide mobility-related services in connection       with the demonstration program, including services such as       counseling, portability coordination, landlord outreach,       security deposits, and administrative activities associated       with establishing and operating regional mobility programs.        (2) Use of housing assistance funds.--Public housing       agencies participating in the demonstration under this       section may use housing assistance payments funds under       section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42       U.S.C. 1437f(o)) for security deposits if necessary to enable       families to lease units with vouchers in designated       opportunity areas.        (e) Waivers; Alternative Requirements.--        (1) Waivers.--To allow for public housing agencies to       implement and administer their Regional Housing Mobility       Plans, the Secretary may waive or specify alternative       requirements for the following provisions of the United       States Housing Act of 1937:        (A) Sections 8(o)(7)(A) and 8(o)(13)(E)(i) (relating to the       term of a lease and mobility requirements).        (B) Section 8(o)(13)(C)(i) (relating to the public housing       plan for an agency).        (C) Section 8(r)(2) (relating to the responsibility of a       public housing agency to administer ported assistance).        (2) Alternative requirements.--The Secretary shall provide       additional authority for public housing agencies in a       selected region to form a consortium that has a single       housing choice voucher funding contract, or to enter into a       partial consortium to operate all or portions of the Regional       Housing Mobility Plan, including agencies participating in       the Moving To Work Demonstration program.        (3) Effective date.--Any waiver or alternative requirements       pursuant to this subsection shall not take effect before the       expiration of the 10-day period beginning upon publication of       notice of such waiver or alternative requirement in the       Federal Register.        (f) Implementation.--The Secretary may implement the       demonstration, including its terms, procedures, requirements,       and conditions, by notice.        (g) Evaluation.--Not later than five years after       implementation of the regional housing mobility programs       under the demonstration program under this section, the       Secretary shall submit to the Congress and publish in the       Federal Register a report evaluating the effectiveness of the       strategies pursued under the demonstration, subject to the       availability of funding to conduct the evaluation. Through       official websites and other methods, the Secretary shall       disseminate interim findings as they become available, and       shall, if promising strategies are identified, notify the       Congress of the amount of funds that would be required to       expand the testing of these strategies in additional types of       public housing agencies and housing markets.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of much-needed legislation that  would authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to carry  out a housing choice voucher mobility demonstration program that would  encourage families receiving such voucher assistance to move to  communities of their own choice and to expand their access to  opportunity areas.   The Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Demonstration Act of 2018 is a  bipartisan piece of legislation that passed out of our committee with a  vote of 53-0. This unanimous vote shows its need and showcases the  broad support of the legislation across the political spectrum.   The legislation would further improve voucher mobility to help more  households using housing vouchers move to communities of their choice,  including those with access to better paying jobs, good schools,  transportation, and greater healthcare opportunities.   Through the demonstration, HUD and the public housing agencies, also  known as PHAs, would be able to develop new models for improving  voucher mobility and provide counseling to help HUD-assisted families  move to these areas of opportunity.   A recent Harvard study showed that giving housing vouchers to low- income families significantly improved their lives and provided  children with greater opportunity and a better shot at success. The  study estimated that moving a child out of public housing to a low- poverty area will increase the child's total lifetime earnings by  nearly $302,000.   The study clearly demonstrates that offering low-income families  housing vouchers and assistance in moving to these lower poverty  neighborhoods has substantial benefits for the families themselves, for  the communities, and for taxpayers.   Helping all Americans afford decent, stable homes is the key to  ensuring that people have the opportunity to lead healthy and  productive lives. Enacting this legislation is an important step that  Congress can and should take to address this challenge.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), who is the chairman of the  Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. I commend him on his fine work.  [[Page H6012]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there is an old adage: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Well, guess what, folks; this is kind of broke. We need to look for  different ways of fixing it.   This bill today that my colleague from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) and my  colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) have been working on is that  attempt to look for those answers. We do truly have common goals. They  are common goals of opportunity, reward, and upward mobility for all  Americans and to give them that opportunity.   Whether you are watching on C-SPAN or maybe in the gallery right now,  what you are seeing on the floor may not compute with what you are  seeing in the news all the time. We actually are agreeing on things. We  actually are trying to move ahead and trying to better our citizens and  our constituents in a way that will ultimately benefit not just them  and their families individually, but their communities, our collective  State, and, by extension, our country. That is what we are trying to do  here today.   I just, again, want to commend the gentlemen from Wisconsin and  Missouri for their work on this and for the leadership of the ranking  member and Chairman Hensarling, as well, on this.   As we move forward to try to provide that opportunity to provide that  upward mobility, to give citizens the real choice of what to do with  their lives and how to live their lives, I can think of no better way  than starting off with this pilot program.   And, hopefully, as I share the confidence with my friend from  Wisconsin, I believe this will work. When it works, we will have that  proof to go back and to use things like that Harvard study and others  that have shown that upward mobility is achievable and that people  aren't locked into one location or one mindset or one community. They  can choose to be a part of that, but if they know they are going to  have greater opportunity somewhere else, then the Federal Government  shouldn't stand in the way of that opportunity. This bill does exactly  that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to suggest to my colleagues that they vote for  this very important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5970) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  implement rules simplifying the quarterly financial reporting regime,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5970         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Disclosures for       Investors Act''.       SEC. 2. FORM 10-Q ANALYSIS.         (a) In General.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits of       requiring reporting companies to use Form 10-Q for submitting       quarterly financial reports. Such analysis shall consider--        (1) the costs and benefits of Form 10-Q to emerging growth       companies;        (2) the costs and benefits of Form 10-Q to the Commission       in terms of its ability to protect investors, maintain fair,       orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital       formation;        (3) the costs and benefits of Form 10-Q to other reporting       companies, investors, market researchers, and other market       participants, including the costs and benefits associated       with--        (A) the public availability of the information required to       be filed on Form 10-Q;        (B) the use of a standardized reporting format across all       classes of reporting companies; and        (C) the quarterly disclosure by some companies of financial       information in formats other than Form 10-Q, such as a       quarterly earnings press release;        (4) the costs and benefits of alternative formats for       quarterly reporting for emerging growth companies to emerging       growth companies, the Commission, other reporting companies,       investors, market researchers, and other market participants;       and        (5) the expected impact of the use of alternative formats       of quarterly reporting by emerging growth companies on       overall market transparency and efficiency.        (b) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue a       report to Congress that includes--        (1) the results of the analysis required by subsection (a);       and        (2) recommendations for decreasing costs, increasing       transparency, and increasing efficiency of quarterly       financial reporting by emerging growth companies.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Mrs. Wagner, from Missouri for  her work on this very important bill. This is part of a series of bills  that we have seen, not just today but throughout the time that we have  put forth on the Capital Markets Subcommittee, as well as the Financial  Services Committee overall, because we know that there is no one thing  that has ground the gears of our economy to a halt or to slow it down,  and there is also no one magic thing that can happen or be passed that  will suddenly spring it to life. It is a little like throwing sand in  the gears of a machine. Over time, it just gets harder and harder and  harder for that machine to grind on.   We are here through a whole series of bills, both today and at other  times, to add a little oil to the machine, to try to make sure that our  capital markets are continuing to move and to be the envy of the world.  We know, Mr. Speaker, that our capital markets here in the United  States have been and continue to be the envy of the world, and they are  a vibrant ecosystem fueling America's economic growth and generating  millions of private sector jobs.   These capital markets provide financing and needed resources to the  smallest startups and to the very largest of the international  companies that we have here in the United States. However, smaller  companies have often been penalized for their size.   As we have talked about in previous bills, the number of IPOs, or  initial public offerings, that have occurred in the United States have  plummeted. We have tried to fix that or tried to help improve that  through things like the JOBS Act, but these small companies still face  significant regulatory and market impediments that disincentivize them  from accessing capital via the public markets.   The Federal securities laws require that most SEC registrants  disclose certain information on an ongoing basis, including a quarterly  report on what is called the form 10Q. Form 10Q includes condensed  financial information and  [[Page H6014]]  other data prepared by a company and reviewed, though generally  unaudited, by its independent auditor.   The purpose is to provide a continuing view of the company's  financial position during the year. The report must be filed for each  of the first three fiscal quarters of the company's fiscal year.   The SEC's current corporate disclosure system imposes a number of  outdated, duplicative, burdensome, and unnecessary requirements on U.S.  companies diverting private sector resources toward regulatory  compliance and away from innovation, growth, and job creation, where it  really should be. Moreover, this outdated disclosure regime leads to  unnecessarily long, complicated, and often immaterial public company  disclosures, resulting in widespread investor confusion and,  potentially, suboptimal investment decisions.   While the SEC has often recognized the need to study and streamline  the corporate disclosure regime, it has recently been Congress that has  actually spurred them on in this regard. Through provisions such as the  JOBS Act and the FAST Act, the SEC is required to study current  regulations and then eliminate these outdated, duplicative, and  unnecessary disclosure obligations.   Form 10Q can create extreme administrative costs. A 2011 report of  the IPO Task Force found that 92 percent of public companies said that  ``administrative burden of public reporting'' was a significant  challenge to completing an IPO and becoming a public company.   We have talked about, Mr. Speaker, earlier, that lack of ability for  retail investors, the Joe and Jane investor, to have the same  opportunity that some sort of well-financed, professional investor or  fund that is out there is going to have.   We need to allow them to have access into these pools of companies so  that they may catch the upside of so many of these companies that are  seeing extreme growth. That is the reason why we need to have these  IPOs.   In addition to filing forms 10K annually and 10Q quarterly, companies  must file current reports on form 8K, often within 4 business days  after the occurrence of specified events; these are things that could  move their stock price, for example, and is relevant disclosure that  needs to happen. They are then required to file these form 8Ks.   In other words, by the time a quarterly report is filed, many  material events have already been reported by a company through these  8Ks; and according to widespread economic views regarding efficiency of  markets, that information has then been priced into the cost of an  equity. Granting early growth companies the option of issuing a press  release or other short form that includes earnings results, as opposed  to a full 10Q form, would provide investors with important quarterly  financial information but reduce unnecessary burdens and complexities  associated with the current quarterly reporting system.   Again, it is extremely important that investors have access to that  information. This bill does nothing to diminish that. In fact, it makes  it more approachable and more accessible to the average investor.   Nonetheless, this bill does not require any action by the SEC to  change the 10Q reporting regime. It simply requires the SEC to consider  the issue and report back to Congress on it. In doing so, the SEC can  consider the substantial costs of these financial disclosures and aim  to modernize the disclosure process in a manner that encourages  investors to make more efficient use of the information filed with the  SEC.   Specifically, H.R. 5970, the Modernizing Disclosures for Investors  Act, would require the SEC to provide a report to Congress with a cost- benefit analysis for emerging growth companies' use of the SEC form 10Q  and recommendations for decreasing costs, increasing transparency, and  increasing efficiency of quarterly financial reporting by emerging  growth companies within 180 days after enactment of this bill.   I would like to commend my colleagues, Representative Wagner and  Representative Gottheimer, for their bipartisan work on this very  important bill. This bill, it is important to note, Mr. Speaker, passed  the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 56-0. That is very  important information because I believe that this is bipartisan and  should be a bicameral step toward maintaining the health of our capital  markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5970, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it has been a long afternoon. We have  covered a lot of territory, eight different bills, I think, today. As I  had said earlier, there is no magic bill that is going to somehow cure  or remedy some of the challenges that our capital markets have seen  over the last number of years, but this is a step towards that.   H.R. 5970 and so many of these other bills are important steps that  this House is taking on a very bipartisan basis. I commend everybody  who has worked on this--Mr. Gottheimer and Mrs. Wagner in this  particular case--and I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues across the aisle to search for true solutions in policy and  to set aside the politics of what needs to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5970, and  I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6015]]
