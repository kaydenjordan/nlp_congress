 Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague, Senator  Portman, in rising to recognize the 200th anniversary of the birth of  one of  [[Page S2115]]  the giants of American religious life, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise. Rabbi  Wise adopted Ohio as his home and is recognized as the father of  American Reform Judaism. His ideas and teachings and the many great  institutions he founded have had a profound effect on American Judaism  and on people of faith throughout our country and around the world.   Rabbi Wise believed in liberty, in life, and in faith; he wanted to  ensure that his ancient religious tradition, which had sustained people  for millennia, remained relevant in a new and fast-changing nation. He  pioneered ideas like men and women sitting together during services and  choral singing and gave so many a new way to understand and practice  their faith.   The groundbreaking institutions he founded left an indelible mark on  Judaism and remain an integral part of our country's religious life to  this day: the Central Conference of American Rabbis--CCAR--the Union of  American Hebrew Congregations, today known as the Union for Reform  Judaism, and Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.   Rabbi Wise made Cincinnati his home, and in large part because of the  institutions he created, Cincinnati became central to the fabric of  American Judaism. HUC is a center of Jewish thought, and this year, the  CCAR will celebrate its 130th anniversary in the Queen City. The weekly  newspaper Rabbi Wise founded, the Israelite, was based in Cincinnati,  and that paper helped shape Reform Judaism.   Senator Portman and I join the people of Ohio in remembering this  great Ohioan on the bicentennial of his birth. Rabbi Wise and his  legacy are a great source of pride for so many Ohioans; we are honored  to recognize his incredible contributions to Judaism, to Ohio, and to  our country.                            ____________________
