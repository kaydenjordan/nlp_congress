 Mr. Speaker, on July 4, 1776, our Founding Fathers in the  preamble to the Declaration of Independence wrote these words that form  the very foundation of our great Nation: We hold these truths to be  self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by  their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to say that we cannot and to  say that we will not forget the duty of this Congress to defend the  inalienable right to life.   We cannot forget the devastating impact that Roe v. Wade caused on  families and the unborn.   That devastation would have continued if Dobbs v. Jackson--a case  that proudly originated in my home State of Mississippi--had not come  before the Supreme Court and opened the pathway to allow States to  protect life.   If our great Nation can unite around any singular issue, it should be  that life is sacred, that life is a gift from God, and that life should  be protected.                                time  2000
