 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  rise in opposition to the bill.   Despite months of opportunities for Congress to intervene in the  border crisis and actually fix our laws, the Democrat majority has done  nothing except stand by, at first denying that there was a crisis, and  then watching as a chaotic and dangerous situation developed.   The administration repeatedly warned us that the unprecedented  migrant flow was overwhelming the government's ability to adequately  respond and that the facilities were overcrowded because they were not  designed as long-term holding facilities. Yet the Democrat majority  brought forth no legislation to fix the problems. Instead, they passed  the Dream Act, a bill which will only incentivize more illegal  immigration.   So, aside from the Dream Act, what is the majority's next idea? H.R.  3239, the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border  Protection Custody Act, a bill that will not solve the border crisis  and, in fact, will make the crisis worse.   H.R. 3239 does nothing to address the root causes of this crisis:   It does nothing to address the push-and-pull factors that drive  illegal immigration, including loopholes in our own laws;   It does nothing to fix the Flores settlement agreement's guarantee of  catch and release for almost all family units;   It does nothing to fix the provision in the Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act that prevents the safe repatriation of  children from noncontiguous countries;   It does not introduce reasonable reforms to our asylum laws. Instead,  it imposes onerous and burdensome requirements on the hundreds of CBP  facilities at a time when the government is already overwhelmed.   Of course, CBP should always strive to comply with their custodial  care standards, and I know that the men and women of CBP are treating  migrants with respect. But H.R. 3239 does not address the root causes  of the conditions at CBP facilities: that ICE and HHS do not have  enough space available to take custody of these individuals.   The bill does not increase funding for ICE detention beds to ensure  single adults do not have to be in CBP custody beyond 72 hours. It does  not fund additional permanent HHS shelter capacity for unaccompanied  children.   Instead, in the midst of a chaotic situation, H.R. 3239 imposes  extensive medical screening, medical care, and facilities requirements  on to CBP that are, in many cases, simply unworkable.   This bill's onerous requirements significantly impact CBP's mission  and ignore the reality that CBP is confronting an influx of migrants  that has overwhelmed the system and caused a crisis.                                time  1845    H.R. 3239 requires a fully documented medical screening of each and  every  [[Page H7337]]  person entering CBP custody, to include a full physical exam, risk  assessment, interview, medical intake questionnaire, and taking of all  vital signs.   In addition, the bill requires CBP to require additional follow-up  medical care, including psychological and mental health care.   The bill even requires that CBP shall have onsite, to the extent  practicable, in addition to the medical professionals employed to  conduct the initial medical screenings, `` . . . licensed emergency  care professionals, specialty physicians (including physicians  specializing in pediatrics, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology,  geriatric medicine, internal medicine, and infectious diseases), nurse  practitioners, other nurses, physician assistants, licensed social  workers, mental health professionals, public health professionals,  dieticians, interpreters, and chaperones.'' If it is impracticable to  have them onsite, CBP must have them on call.   May I remind you that our own veterans do not have access to the same  list of healthcare specialists at an initial request at their clinics.   I offered an amendment that was not made in order that stated that  this bill would not go into effect until the VA confirms that medical  care that meets the standards listed in this bill for detainees is made  available to every veteran seeking medical care at a facility of the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   CBP personnel should be interdicting narcotics, preventing illegal  immigration, stopping child trafficking, and facilitating lawful trade  and travel, yet H.R. 3239 would have them, instead, setting up full- service hospitals at hundreds of facilities.   The requirements of H.R. 3239 apply not only to border patrol  stations, but also to ports of entry, including land, sea, and air  ports of entry, checkpoints, forward operating bases, and secondary  inspection areas.   As if the current crisis weren't enough of a challenge, the bill  requires updates to hundreds of CBP facilities, requisition of  personnel and equipment, and training for all CBP personnel at covered  facilities, all at an immense cost.   May I mention again, I offered an amendment that would require the  DHS Secretary to also report on the cost of implementation of this  legislation.   My amendment would have also delayed the 6-month implementation  requirement if Congress does not appropriate sufficient funds to carry  out the requirements of this bill, yet H.R. 3239 does not authorize any  appropriations.   The requirements apply to facilities no matter the size, the  location, or even the amount of traffic. So it applies equally to a  very busy airport, processing millions of passengers a year, just as it  would to an extremely remote port of entry or to an isolated  checkpoint.   Under this bill, there could be more medical personnel working at the  facility than aliens on any given day.   H.R. 3239 will also weaken border security at a time when we should  be enhancing CBP's ability to respond to the surge.   The bill would limit CBP's ability to house migrants that come during  a surge, while simultaneously limiting the number of people that could  be housed in existing CBP processing facilities, yet CBP cannot simply  process those individuals out to ICE custody, because, again, H.R. 3239  does not fund any additional ICE detention beds.   The practical effects of H.R. 3239 are simply more catch-and-release.   The majority has made no secret that CBP will be forced to release  even more people into the United States. This is not a design flaw; it  is a feature of the bill.   H.R. 3239 also increases the incentive to exploit children to gain  entry into the United States. Smugglers know migrants will be released  into the U.S. interior if they bring a child, because of a legal  loophole created by the Flores settlement agreement preventing those  family units from being detained for a sufficient amount of time to  complete their immigrant court proceedings.   DHS continues to see adults fraudulently posing as a parent. This  loophole is exploited by smugglers and human traffickers on a daily  basis, as children are being rented and purchased like chattel.   H.R. 3239 broadens this loophole even further, extending it beyond  parents to any adult relative of a child. The incentive to bring a  child will be even greater, and human traffickers would now be able to  pose as a child's distant relative to evade detection and take  advantage of the Flores loophole.   CBP is already confronting a crisis that is worsening by  Congressional inaction to fix the loopholes in our laws that fuel  illegal immigration. Congress shouldn't make the crisis worse by  passing H.R. 3239.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   I want to bring attention to page 8 of the bill, line 16. I am going  to read it verbatim: ``The Commissioner or the Administrator of General  Services shall ensure that each location to which detainees are first  transported after an initial encounter has onsite at least one licensed  medical professional to conduct health screenings. Other personnel that  are or may be necessary for carrying out the functions described in  subsection (e), such as licensed emergency care professionals,  specialty physicians (including physicians specializing in pediatrics,  family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, geriatric medicine,  internal medicine, and infectious diseases), nurse practitioners, other  nurses, physician assistants, licensed social workers, mental health  professionals, public health professionals, dieticians, interpreters,  and chaperones, shall be located onsite, to the extent practicable, or  if not practicable, shall be available on call.''   In the medical field, ``on call'' means 30 minutes or closer.   So this bill absolutely requires that all of these specialty  physicians are available either onsite or within 30 minutes or closer  to being able to be at the location, any of these CBP locations, and  they have to be provided this healthcare within 12 hours of manifesting  themselves at these facilities.   Right now our veterans don't have access to this healthcare that is  ensured in this bill for illegal immigrants coming into our country. If  you go to a clinic at a VA facility, they don't have specialty  physicians. You have to wait 30 to 60, maybe 90 days to get an  appointment with a specialty physician in order to get the care that  that veteran wants or needs, not 12 hours.    So we are providing through this bill better healthcare opportunities  for illegal immigrants showing up at the border than we are for our  veterans who have served our country, who have raised their right hand  to swear an oath to our Constitution, who have service-connected  disability, and have the ability to use Veterans Affairs facilities.  They only get 30 to 60 days to get those medical needs taken care of;  illegal immigrants get it in 12 hours, according to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Chairman, I will make this very quick and to the point. If this  bill were to become law, illegal immigrants illegally crossing our  border will have better access to healthcare at government expense than  our veterans with service-connected disabilities. And not just better  healthcare access to specialty doctors and psychiatric care, not just  that, but within a timeframe 30 to 60 days faster than veterans can get  appointments for medical care at a VA facility.   The requirements in this bill show that, depending on the scenario,  CBP has 6 to 12 hours to provide care to the immigrant. A veteran under  the MISSION Act that was passed by Congress last session, has 30 to 60  days to get an appointment. So we are treating an illegal immigrant  within a day, a requirement by law, where veterans have to wait 30 to  60 days just to get an appointment.   And let's discuss the cost. Oh, that is right, we don't know the cost  because the majority didn't consult CBP or Homeland Security, and we  have absolutely no idea how much this is going to cost. We are going to  put this unfunded mandate on CBP when they are already taxed and  already tolled with the crisis that we have on the border and not know  how much it is going to cost them to implement all of these medical  requirements that are in this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment;  however, I do not oppose it.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct the DHS Office of  Inspector General to investigate CBP's compliance with Federal  regulations promulgated to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse  in CBP facilities.   I have no objection to the amendment insofar as the inspector general  is already directed by statute to conduct audits to ensure compliance  with Federal regulations, and I have no doubt that the men and women of  CBP are effectively carrying out the mandates of regulations,  implementing a zero tolerance for sexual abuse policy.   CBP is currently bound by duly published regulation at 6 CFR 115 that  the agency mandate ``zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual abuse.''  The regulation contains extensive and detailed requirements implemented  to prevent sexual assault. Those requirements detail the steps CBP must  take relating to prevention planning; responsive planning in the case  of an allegation; training and education; risk assessments; reporting  mechanisms; the official response following a detainee report;  investigations; disciplinary sanctions for staff, contractors, and  volunteers; medical and mental care; data collection and review; and  audits for compliance. These regulations are designed to ensure the  safety of not only those in custody, but also of CBP personnel and  staff in CBP facilities.   The Inspector General Act already requires the DHS Office of  Inspector General ``to conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and  investigations relating to the programs and operations'' of the DHS.  And the inspector general routinely conducts audits of DHS programs and  facilities to ensure compliance with Federal regulations.   I have no objection to the amendment, which directs the OIG to do  what it already does under the Inspector General Act, which is to  conduct audits to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated by the  DHS to ensure the safety of CBP personnel and those in custody.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is in keeping with the clear  hostility with which the majority views the men and women of U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, including the Border Patrol agents who  have put their lives on the line to effectuate over 3,800 migrant  rescues so far this fiscal year and the officers of field operations  who are in peril each day when they search vehicles and pedestrians for  dangerous and deadly narcotics like fentanyl.   The amendment requires quarterly publication of complaints of sexual  abuse in CBP facilities. Of course, preventing sexual abuse in any  government facility is an extremely important endeavor, but this  amendment does not do that. Instead, it requires premature publication  of mere allegations without any context. The effect is the maligning of  the men and women who serve on our border and at our ports of entry  without doing anything to actually prevent such abuse.   This amendment requires all complaints to be aggregated and published  quarterly, regardless of whether an investigation is complete,  regardless of whether the complaint was substantiated, and regardless  of whether the victim was a CBP employee, contractor, or detainee.   We will not know whether those complaints were ever substantiated or  unsubstantiated pursuant to an investigation.   We will not know whether those complaints were against CBP personnel,  contracted staff, or against other aliens in the facility.   We will not know whether the victims were CBP personnel, contracted  staff, or an alien in the facility.   I am also concerned that the amendment requires CBP to exclude  personally identifiable information of the individual who reported the  abuse, but it is silent as to the personally identifiable information  of the accused. It would be inappropriate to publish a complaint  against an individual without any context, especially if an  investigation later determines that the complaint is unsubstantiated.   The Judiciary Committee already went through a similar situation with  Health and Human Services, where one member of the majority claimed  that hundreds of sexual abuse allegations were made against HHS  employees when, in fact, the allegations by unaccompanied alien  children were against contractors and other UACs.   The requirements of this amendment will simply give the appearance,  regardless of the facts or ultimate outcome of the investigation into  the complaints, that CBP facilities are rife with sexual abuse. And the  further implication is that CBP personnel condone sexual violence. Such  a characterization is offensive to the hardworking men and women of CBP  who follow existing regulations and policies to prevent sexual abuse in  their facilities.  [[Page H7344]]    In fact, CBP is bound by a duly published regulation at 6 CFR 115,  that the agency mandate ``zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual  abuse.'' And ``zero tolerance'' isn't a mere buzzword. The regulation  contains extensive and detailed requirements implemented to prevent  sexual assault. Those requirements detail the steps CBP must take  relating to prevention planning; responsive planning in the case of an  allegation; training and education; risk assessments; reporting  mechanisms; the official response following a detainee report;  investigations; disciplinary sanctions for staff, contractors, and  volunteers; medical and mental care; data collection and review; and  audits for compliance.   The manager's amendment to the bill already makes clear that the bill  does not abrogate existing policies designed to prevent, detect, and  respond to sexual abuse. In fact, it acknowledges that CBP has a zero- tolerance policy for sexual abuse.   Furthermore, the DHS OIG is already directed to conduct unannounced  inspections of CBP facilities in the bill, and CBP's own existing  regulations require periodic audits based on the risk assessment of the  facility.   CBP is already confronting a crisis that is worsened by congressional  inaction to fix the loopholes in our laws that fuel illegal  immigration. The men and women who protect our border have been given  an enormous task made more difficult by offensive rhetoric. Congress  shouldn't make their job more difficult by requiring premature  publication of complaints without context, which will have the effect  of wrongfully painting the civil servants as sexual predators.   I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
