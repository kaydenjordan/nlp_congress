 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I appreciate his extraordinary leadership for us on the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   Across America, drug abuse and addiction are leading to broken lives,  broken families, and broken systems. It is leaving our communities  trapped in a cycle of hopelessness and deaths of despair. People need  help. People need hope.   I have heard these stories myself in eastern Washington. Last year,  the SUPPORT Act marked the most comprehensive action we have taken on a  single drug crisis, but the fight is not over.   In 2017, there were tens of thousands of drug overdose deaths. The  sharpest increase occurred because of fentanyl from China. Fentanyl is  50 times more potent than heroin. Just a few milligrams that can fit on  Lincoln's ear on a penny, are lethal.   Chinese chemical companies are the largest, single source of this. To  crack down on China, the Drug Enforcement Administration created a  temporary scheduling system for fentanyl. Previously, drug traffickers  could slightly change the molecules in the drug so the formula was not  considered prohibited. With this scheduling tool, the DEA changed the  scheduling temporarily in order to combat all fentanyl-related  substances.   This legislation would extend this emergency declaration through May  2021, and it will give law enforcement the tools they need to keep us  safe.   We must keep fentanyl off our streets to save lives and to win the  future. That means cracking down on Chinese fentanyl and stopping these  deaths of despair which are not only threatening families, they are  threatening America's leadership and prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation.
