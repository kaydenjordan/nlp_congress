 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   By creating nearly 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities and  yielding over $10 billion in net benefits, this legislation is a  lifeline for our economy and for countless Americans, including those  in my home State of North Carolina.   With a proven track record of success, we know this is a safe and  smart investment, something our country desperately needs right now.   I am also pleased that this legislation includes a bill which I led  with Representative Mondaire Jones, the Apprenticeship Access for All  Act, language that will advance programs that promote the recruitment,  employment, and retention of people of color, individuals with  disabilities, and individuals facing barriers to employment, especially  in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand sectors and occupations. After  all, we must be sure that everyone has access to opportunity.   This vote is about ensuring our workforce gets the investment it  needs and the support it deserves. This vote is about showing the  American people that they are seen, that they are heard, and that we  deeply care about providing them pathways to a stable future. This vote  is also about upholding Congress' commitment and obligation to serve  every American.   I urge support.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record the  following letter from the Center for Law and Social Policy in support  of the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.

Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Robert ``Bobby'' Scott and Ranking Member       Virginia Foxx: We, the Center for Law and Social Policy       (CLASP), write to express our views regarding the       reauthorization of the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA). As       a national, nonprofit, anti-poverty organization, CLASP works       to advance federal and state policies that promote economic       security for individuals with low incomes, including people       of color, opportunity youth, people impacted by the criminal       justice system, and immigrants. We appreciate the opportunity       to provide the committee with recommendations that help to       increase greater access to registered apprenticeships,       preapprenticeships and youth apprenticeships, particularly       for individuals who face the greatest obstacles in accessing       high-quality employment pathways that lead to livable wages       and benefits.        Reauthorization becomes all the more important given that       the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis, and the       increasing impacts of climate change have devastated the       health and economic wellbeing of millions of families with       low incomes. Workers of color, immigrants, young people,       women, workers in jobs paying low wages, and frontline       workers are among the hardest hit by these crises. Worse       still, significant job losses and reductions in income have       deepened racial inequities and exacerbated poverty and       economic hardship for millions. Therefore, true economic       recovery will require building back high-quality jobs in all       sectors--including growth sectors like clean energy and the       care economy--that treat all workers and working families as       essential, strengthen the economy, and enable workers to meet       family obligations, save for the future, and move out of       poverty. It will require investments in workers through       workforce development and training, subsidized jobs, and work       supports such as affordable child care. It will also require       a new social contract ensuring all workers can access       critical workplace rights, benefits, and protections.        Over a century ago, Wisconsin created the first state       Registered Apprenticeship Act and in 1937, Congress enacted       the National Apprenticeship Act. The NAA created thousands of       Registered Apprenticeship programs and instructed the       Department of Labor to promote labor standards to protect       apprentice welfare. With over 706,000 new apprentices since       2017 and an average salary of $70,000 after program       completion, Registered Apprenticeships are a successful       workforce development strategy with significant economic       gains. However, inequities, discrimination, and barriers to       entry have historically prevented, and continue to prevent,       many people with low incomes, especially Black, Indigenous,       people of color (BIPOC) and women, from accessing and       succeeding in a Registered Apprenticeship, A 1967 study       described overwhelming resistance to racial integration in       apprenticeship programs. Today, while there have been       improvements, apprenticeships remain largely white and male.        As Congress considers NAA's reauthorization, it has an       opportunity to address equity and expand access to Registered       Apprenticeships, including through high-quality pre-      apprenticeships. A registered, high-quality pre-      apprenticeship can support students with low incomes--      especially students of color and those impacted by the       justice system--and promote equitable access to a Registered       Apprenticeship program. For these reasons, we are providing       the committee with recommendations to promote high-quality       apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship to ensure that       students with low incomes, students of color, immigrants, and       students impacted by the justice system can access high-      quality Registered Apprenticeships.        Below are recommendations that we urge the committee to       consider:        Require that all apprenticeships, including pre-      apprenticeships and youth apprenticeships be registered.       Across states, there is an interest in expanding pre-      apprenticeships. To prepare preapprentices to succeed in       registered apprenticeships, they must have access to high-      quality registered apprenticeships. All pre-apprenticeships       and apprenticeships must incorporate the types of workplace       and labor standards of quality that have made registered       apprenticeships successful. They must also provide direct       entry into registered apprenticeships for successful       apprentices.        Provide adequate compensation for pre-apprentices. Few       people can afford the time or money to dedicate weeks/months       to a pre-apprenticeship program without income to support       themselves and their families. Unpaid programs will exclude       people with low incomes, people impacted by the justice       system, individuals with families and others, and result in a       pool of apprentices that lacks racial and ethnic diversity.       The reauthorization of the NAA can help to ensure that people       of color and women fully participate in pre-apprenticeships       and registered apprentices receive adequate compensation.        Eliminate barriers for women, including women of color. As       of 2017, women made up just 7.3% of apprentices nationwide.       Furthermore, women tend to be enrolled in apprenticeships       with lower pay scales, such as childcare where the median       journeyperson wage is only $9.75/hour compared to $23.46/      hour, the corresponding wage for the top male apprenticeship       occupation, electrician. Our nation must work to attract more       women into registered apprenticeships as a career pathway and       ensure that they earn wages that are comparable to wages       earned by males in comparable occupations.        Eliminate barriers to entry for people with low incomes.       Many registered apprenticeships impose barriers to entry for       people with low incomes due high costs for tools, equipment,       books, supplies, uniforms and scheduling inflexibility for       parenting or commuting individuals. Scheduling barriers are       especially problematic for individuals on probation and       parole or community supervision. The reauthorization must       provide wraparound services and robust supports to cover the       costs of childcare, transportation, equipment, and related       costs that pose barriers to entry.        Support ongoing efforts to reform the criminal justice       system and ensure incarcerated individuals have access to       apprenticeship pathways. A National Center for Education       Statistics survey found that 29 percent of incarcerated       respondents wanted to obtain certificates from a trade school       or college while incarcerated; 39 percent of them said the       main reason they wanted to enroll was to ``increase the       possibilities of getting a job when released.'' Nevertheless,       only 7 percent of the incarcerated received such       certificates. The NAA must help incarcerated and formerly       incarcerated individuals access the registered       apprenticeships they want and provide them with other       opportunities to pursue employment pathways that lead to       family-sustaining jobs with benefits.        The reauthorization must support ongoing efforts at       reforming the criminal justice system. This includes ensuring       that occupational licensing bans do not preclude individuals       impacted by the justice system from obtaining employment that       they have been trained for by an apprenticeship. Individuals       who are incarcerated must also be paid fair wages, and the       law must help to ensure that providers do not discriminate       against those impacted by the justice system.        Pay incarcerated apprentices adequate compensation in line       with the minimum wage for registered apprenticeships.       Apprentices who are incarcerated are often paid below the       minimum wage. A 2019 Urban Institute report noted that the       average starting wage for apprentices was less than one       dollar an hour. Furthermore, the quality and long-term       outcomes of these apprenticeships rarely match those of       Registered Apprenticeships outside prison walls. The       reauthorization of the NAA can raise wages--as well as labor       standards--for incarcerated apprentices, bring them in line       with the minimum wage or the average wage for registered       apprentices, and ensure the apprenticeships are high-quality       education programs.        Ensure that youths and adults with low incomes are       guaranteed equitable access to established registered       apprenticeships, postsecondary education opportunities, or       both. Quite often, young people with low incomes, especially       students of color, end up funneled or ``tracked'' into lower-      performing or poorly funded programs and pathways. Youth       apprenticeships and preapprenticeship programs can guarantee       that pre-apprentices will have equitable access either to an       established registered apprenticeship or postsecondary       educational opportunities.        Incentivize and allow for greater participation of regional       and local intermediaries, such as high schools, adult       education providers, workforce partners, and community-based       organizations in the recruitment and retention of youth of       color (both in-school and out-of-school youth). Out-of-school       youth, high school students, and young people of color are       less likely to reap the benefits of federal and state       programs and are often left behind in these programs.       Regional and local intermediaries, such as workforce       partners, high schools, adult education providers, community-      based organizations, and other community partners can provide       supportive services such as mental health and behavioral       services, housing, and other supports to help increase the       participation of youth of color in the pre-apprenticeship       recruitment and retention process.        Dedicate a funding stream for high-quality, registered pre-      apprenticeships. To continue to expand and have long-term       sustainability, pre-apprenticeships must have a dedicated       funding stream that allows pre-apprentices to be adequately       compensated. Such a structure would allow for greater       participation of youth and adults who face the greatest       barriers to employment and postsecondary education.        We thank the committee for working in a bipartisan manner       to increase greater access to registered apprenticeships       through the reauthorization of the NAA. We look forward to       working with you and your staff.            Sincerely,      Molly Bashay,        Senior Policy Analyst, Postsecondary Education and       Workforce Development, CLASP.      Kisha Bird,        Director, Youth Policy, CLASP.
