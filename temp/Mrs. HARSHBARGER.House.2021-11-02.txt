 Mr. Speaker, one of the top concerns for Americans  is the high cost of prescription drugs. Congress must do something to  lower these prescription drug prices. We know the American people want  lower prices, but they don't want to sacrifice access to lifesaving  treatments.   Prior to representing the great people of east Tennessee in Congress,  I served for 35 years as a community pharmacist, so I know a thing or  two about safeguarding patient access to affordable medicines and  solving patient problems.   We absolutely need to reform the ways pharmaceutical manufacturers  price their products and sometimes manipulate the system. But there is  another part of the drug pricing equation that doesn't get nearly as  much attention, and that is the role of the pharmacy benefit managers,  or PBMs, their lack of transparency, their market dominance, and the  effects of their business practices on drug prices and patient choices.   PBMs were created as middlemen to reduce administrative costs for  insurers, validate patients' eligibility, administer plan benefits, and  negotiate  [[Page H6080]]  costs between pharmacies and health plans. But they have morphed into  one of the most highly concentrated and least accountable profit  centers in the healthcare industry. Over time, these PBMs have been  allowed to operate and consolidate their market powers virtually  unchecked.   Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans all use PBMs to  manage drug benefits. That is more than 260 million American lives.                                time  1100    These pharmacy benefit managers wield enormous power as middlemen on  numerous fronts. They choose what drugs are covered and not covered by  insurance; they negotiate purchasing deals with drug makers; they  determine copays for consumers; they decide which pharmacies are  included in prescription plans and which are not; they decide how much  pharmacies are reimbursed for the drugs they sell, where, by the way, a  lot of pharmacies dispense drugs to a patient, and they are reimbursed  less than what they paid for the drug.   In 2020, the top six PBMs handled more than 95 percent of total U.S.- equivalent prescription claims. Curiously, this market power  concentration and vertical integration with the insurance carriers was  allowed by our Federal Trade Commission over the last 15 years, the  very agency whose mission it is to safeguard Americans from  concentrated corporate power.   What are the effects on drug spending? Between 2015 and 2018, nearly  half of the increase in total brand drug spending went to payers,  including PBMs, according to an analysis from Berkeley Research Group.   Such a huge slice of yearly drug spending going to middlemen has  catapulted the U.S. PBM market to be valued at more than half a  trillion dollars, and that is with a ``T''. Analysts see PBMs  continuing to prosper in the coming years.   The virtually unchecked powers of PBMs have enabled them to: Number  one, charge drug manufacturers hefty rebates for preferred placement on  formularies. The higher the list price, the higher the rebates, but no  one knows where these rebates go.   Number two is to impose restrictive take-it-or-leave-it contracts  with community pharmacists.   Number three is charge community pharmacies outrageous clawbacks or  DIR fees, often totally unpredictable, where PBMs claw back or take  back moneys they have already reimbursed pharmacies, often weeks or  months after a patient transaction. The typical community pharmacy now  pays roughly $81,000 a year in DIR fees, making it all but impossible  to set a budget for the future.   These and other business practices happen in relative secrecy with no  real oversight. No one is really able to follow the dollars on how and  where the money flows; not the payer, not the pharmacist, and certainly  not the patient.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the PBM Accountability  Study Act, H.R. 1829, which would have the U.S. Government  Accountability Office study the roles PBMs play in drug pricing and  spending, their market concentrations, and states of competition. My  bill also requires GAO to make recommendations on lowering drug costs,  improving transparency, and improving competition in the PBM industry.  This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I invite all of my  colleagues to cosponsor and help with this important legislation.   I sincerely hope we can work together to include the provisions of  this bill and other PBM reforms in any drug-pricing legislation that we  consider this year.                            ____________________
