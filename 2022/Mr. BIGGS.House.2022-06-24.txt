 Mr. Speaker, I thank God for the decision that stops the  heinous practice that has taken more than 60 million lives in this  country over the last 50 years. I thank God that those voices that have  been lost, we will not see that anymore. I hope and pray that that is  the case. I thank them for that.   There is no right to take that life, but there is a right to defend  yourself. We have a God-given, constitutionally protected right to  protect ourselves, and the Supreme Court reaffirmed that yesterday.   This bill infringes on the constitutionally protected rights of law- abiding Americans, and it provides funding for States to infringe on  Americans' Second Amendment rights and violate their due process  rights.   It treats 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old Americans as second-class  citizens. The Ninth Circuit recently held that the Second Amendment  applies to 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old Americans just like it does to  Americans over the age of 21.   This bill criminalizes routine gun transactions between law-abiding  Americans.   Justice Alito, in his concurrence, highlighted the flawed logic used  by the supporters of this bill. Alito said: ``Does the dissent think  that laws like New York's prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a  person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that  it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home? And how does the  dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the  top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in  this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.''   The essence of this is gun controls do not stop criminals because  criminals have no regard for the law. That is the definition of a  criminal.   This bill will restrict law-abiding Americans' ability to purchase  firearms and protect themselves and their families. It violates a basic  God-given right.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same.
