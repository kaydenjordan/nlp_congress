 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, and I am proud to co-lead this  important legislation with the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), my  friend.   As millions of American families across the country struggle to  afford basic goods, from food to fuel--in large part thanks to the  inflation brought on by the absurd spending blowout of the last 2  years--the very last thing that taxpayers need is a bloated and  weaponized IRS.   Unfortunately, that is exactly what they got when the administration  rammed through $80 billion to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to harass and  spy on middle-class and low-income families, with most of 1.2 million  new additional audits.   The agency needs reform and modernization, but that is not what these  billions in taxpayer dollars did. Of the $80 billion, only $3.2 billion  was set aside for taxpayer services. Meanwhile, new audits and  enforcement got $45 billion.   The job of the IRS is to serve taxpayers, not target them. That is  why we must pass today's bill, which will rescind the IRS funding for  enforcement while leaving in place the funding for improvements to  customer service and technology.   Californians and all Americans deserve an accountable government and  a strong economy. An accountable government is one that serves its  citizens, not one that empowers bureaucrats to target taxpayers. We  will never build an economy that is strong by weaponizing government  agencies to cripple small businesses and employers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues who support an accountable  government and a strong economy to vote ``yes'' on this legislation to  empower American families, support small businesses, and protect  taxpayers.
