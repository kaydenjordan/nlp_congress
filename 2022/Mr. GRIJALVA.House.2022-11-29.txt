 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in shock and feeling an  immense loss for the Member that will not be with us, Donald McEachin,  the gentleman from Virginia, a dear friend.   The members of the Committee on Natural Resources extend to his  family, his wife Colette, his children and his grandchildren, his loved  ones, and his loyal and capable staff, our condolences, our sympathies,  and our comfort.   This imposing man, Donald McEachin, was more than that. His strength  came from his heart, his faith, his empathy, and his compassion for  other people.   On this journey, I have had the privilege and pleasure to work with  him for over 3 years to develop legislation that would assure every  American had clean air, clean water, and a clean environment. That  piece of legislation is historic, and it is the creation of great work  on the part of Donald McEachin.   It is his legacy that I hope we address, but it is also his character  and his strength, as he guided me and other Members through a process  that is sometimes difficult, sometimes contentious, but a process that  at the end of the day has produced something that will be part of the  legacy of a man that served his community, served his country, served  his family, and gave honor to all of us. This is a deep loss, an  immense loss, and one that I share with everyone.                            ____________________
