 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for yielding, and I want to thank the chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus for pulling this all together.   I am Gwen Moore from the great State of Wisconsin, and I was first  elected in 2005. I was so excited about becoming a Member of Congress  and especially excited about becoming a member of the Congressional  Black Caucus.   Every year the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation hosts a great  gala, and I was eager in September of 2005 to march across the stage  with the likes of John Lewis, Barbara Lee, and Maxine Waters with my  brand new classmates, Cleaver, G.K. Butterfield, Al Green, and Senator  Obama. I was ready for the pageantry. All my relatives were coming to  see me curtsy in my African outfit made with red and gold African  wedding cloth. But then I learned that all but one member of the  Congressional Black Caucus would suit up. Then when I discovered that,  I commissioned myself to implore him not to ruin the evening with his  recalcitrance.   Mr. Alcee Lamar Hastings' prompt and declarative declination was  peppered with his famous street vernacular. Even though he was  disinterested in the pomp and ceremony of the CBCF gala, he attended  CBC meetings regularly. His excellent judgment, powers of discernment,  and strategic thinking silenced the room every time and had Members on  the edge of their seats as he weighed in on tactics and strategy.   I wondered: Where in the world did this man get his confidence that  he exhibited on a daily basis?   Where did he get the courage?   His swagger was more than just his socks and his tie. There was  something that I wanted to know about him.   Well, fortunately for me, Mr. Hastings drew me in as a mentee. He was  familiar with my legislative agenda around equity and justice for women  and people of color. So he invited me to accompany him in 2006 to the  annual session of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in  Europe, held in Brussels that year, wherein he was serving his third  term as parliamentary assembly president of the Organization for  Security and Co-operation in Europe.   He was first elected in 2004. You have heard from other speakers,  Madam Speaker, that this is an international organization of 57 member  countries, and he is the only person of African descent to ever hold  this position and he is the only American to ever hold this position.  He would have to whip and get votes and everything, and Alcee did that.   When I saw him, I was stunned to witness on this international stage  the mastery of his indefatigable leadership. He commandeered the agenda  on human rights to take a deeper dive into minority rights, and not  just Black versus White, but Jews and other ethnic minorities, gypsies,  women, and migrants.   In fact, under his leadership the OSCE broadened its mandate to  address human rights to include intolerance, migration, and organized  crime.  [[Page H2040]]    The global consensus around the plight of Blacks at the hands of  police was a topic of this international body. Indeed, I learned that  racial oppression was global, and Alcee shepherded this international  body through dozens and dozens of resolutions around global racial  equity.   I was hooked. I went with Alcee every time. What I found is that  language was not a barrier, culture was not a barrier, and even  adversarial relationships with people like the Russians or some of the  other known dictators who attended the meetings did not prevent him  from engaging them in side meetings to advance the international  dialogue.   Because of my association with Mr. Hastings, I have met around 300  parliamentarians of African descent in Europe, Spain, Italy, Germany,  Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Canada just to name a  few.   The last trip I took with Mr. Hastings--we all knew it was his last  trip--we went to London, and we gathered in a circle with  parliamentarians from Britain. We talked about the historic  relationship of the United States and Britain, and indeed that same  connection that Barbara Lee referred to, he made us promise to continue  the Atlantic engagement with our brethren. We have to keep that promise  to him because he gave birth to those relationships over 30 years.                                time  1930    Do you know what? I figured out where he got his swagger from. He was  not concerned with little things and petty things, what people thought,  and pomp and circumstance.   He was a universal human rights leader. When I thought about him, I  don't know why I thought of this song that I first heard Sarah Vaughan  singing. But some of the lyrics in ``Universal Prisoner'' were:       Most people go around thinking they're free      Believing it's an easy way to be      They run in guilt and fear      From all the things they truly hold dear      The question is asked, do you give the love that is inside      Or do you run to the phony world where most people hide?    Mr. Hastings embodied the universal precepts of equality, equity, and  justice. He was a true humanitarian.   Enjoy your flight into the universe, Mr. Hastings.
