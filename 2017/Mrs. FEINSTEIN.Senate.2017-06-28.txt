 Mr. President, today Senators Heller, Bennet,  Gardner, and I are introducing the Water Conservation Tax Parity Act.  This bill would exempt the value of residential water conservation and  storm water runoff management rebates from gross income calculations.   California and the western States have been facing a severe drought.  Some public utilities, state and local governments, and water  management providers offer programs to promote water conservation and  storm water management by providing subsidies. These programs help  stimulate responsible water use; however, residential participation is  essential to their success.   For example, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California  has offered a rebate program to encourage residents to replace turf  with more water-responsible landscapes. More than 23,000 households  have benefited from the turf removal rebates, and the average rebate  per household covers 1,500 square feet or about $3,000, which covers  about half of the cost to the resident.   Section 136 of the Internal Revenue Code already exempts energy  conservation rebates from inclusion in gross income. However, there is  no Federal exemption for water conservation or storm water management  measures, which may undermine incentives for participation in these  programs. These programs are just as valuable as energy conservation  programs and should be treated equally in the tax code. This bill would  simply exempt water conservation and storm water management rebates  from being included in gross income and would be retroactive to 2015.  This would maintain the important incentives for resident participation  in critical water conservation measures.   This bill is supported by a coalition of organizations and public  utilities, including the Western Urban Water Coalition, Alliance for  Water Efficiency, American Water Works Association, National  Association of Water Companies, U.S. Water Alliance, Association of  Water Agencies, WaterNow Alliance, Western Coalition of Arid States,  and National Water Resources Association. This bill is crucial to  ensuring residents continue participating in water conservation and  storm water management programs.   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and am hopeful that this Congress will move it forward.   Thank you. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Murphy):   S. 1466. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to award grants  to  [[Page S3832]]  fund research on orthotics and prosthetics, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Armed Services.

I yield the floor.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th  anniversary of the founding of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group.   Founded by David Packard in 1978, the Leadership Group has worked  tirelessly to improve the economic health and quality of life in  Silicon Valley. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the  Silicon Valley Leadership Group--and its Chief Executive Officer Carl  Guardino--on many issues important to the San Francisco Bay Area.   For instance, the Leadership Group has been an indispensable partner  in efforts to restore the San Francisco Bay and its critical wetlands.  Just last year, they helped secure $500 million for those restoration  efforts. The Leadership Group was integral in establishing a permanent  U.S. Patent and Trademark office in San Jose. That office now supports  the creativity and innovation that made Silicon Valley the global  leader of the digital revolution. Most recently, the Leadership Group  was a driving force in developing transportation improvements in  Silicon Valley--including the electrification of the Caltrain system  that will cut travel times and improve air quality for countless  Californians.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution to recognize the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and its  contributions to Silicon Valley, the state of California and our  national economy.   Thank you.                            ____________________
