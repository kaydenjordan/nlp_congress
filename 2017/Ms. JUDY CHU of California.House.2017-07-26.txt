 Mr. Speaker, the inclusion of $1.6  billion to fund an ineffective divisive border wall is a direct attack  on immigrant communities across our Nation. Funding this immoral wall  does nothing to help our country. It only helps to promote President  Trump's campaign of fear.   The wall itself mirrors President Trump's approach to policy:  divisive, ineffective, and motivated by hate.   This is exemplified by the Trump administration's reckless disregard  of the humanitarian cost of building a border wall, which will force  immigrants and asylum seekers to take greater risks and more dangerous  routes that will likely result in more deaths. Furthermore, this wall  will literally divide immigrant households and tear families apart.   Instead of funding ineffective efforts to protect our homeland from  dangerous threats, this administration would rather fulfill a campaign  promise that does the exact opposite. It makes us less safe by  targeting immigrant communities and closing off America from our  neighbors.   American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for  President Trump's xenophobic anti-immigrant agenda.                            ____________________
