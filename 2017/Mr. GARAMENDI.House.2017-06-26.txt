 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tej Maan, an  upstanding citizen and council member in my district. Mr. Maan has been  the director of environmental health in Yuba County since 1998, where  he has created vital safeguards to protect the environmental health and  well-being of the Yuba County community.   Additionally, Mr. Maan is a member of the Punjabi American Heritage  Society, the California Conference of Directors of Environmental  Health, and the Yuba City Chamber of Commerce. He is the host of a  local television show called ``Punjabi Waves,'' which features  discussions and in-depth interviews on current events and issues in the  Punjabi community.   Mr. Maan is also the founder of the first Sikh school in the United  States, which is located in Yuba City. Tej's love for America and his  selfless dedication to his community have made him a well-respected and  treasured member of the Yuba City region. I offer my utmost  appreciation and gratitude for Tej Maan's many contributions to  society.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1726 is a noncontroversial bill to reorganize the  Coast Guard's permanent authorities under title 14 of the U.S. Code in  order to improve the clarity and the coherence of the title.   I would like to thank my assistant, and counsel, Dave Jansen, and  John Rayfield, on the other side, for recognizing that there is  confusion, and so this legislation, while it makes no substantive  changes to the Coast Guard's existing authorities and policies under  title 14, does save for some conforming changes to create a new chapter  for all of the Coast Guard national advisory councils and execute a  handful of other minor transfers.   It just simply ends a lot of confusion as people try to figure out  where it is in the code that they must look.   Accordingly, I am comfortable with supporting this legislation,  although I do note that it will impose some additional administrative  costs on the Coast Guard as they set about implementing it.   I want to commend the chairman, Mr. Hunter, for the Coast Guard and  Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, for his initiative and for his  staff's initiative, in taking on this important little bit of  housekeeping that is going to make all of our lives easier. I will  certainly urge all of the Members to support it.   I also appreciate Chairman Hunter's work with me in an effort to try  to  [[Page H5164]]  solve another problem. This is only one piece of our effort to try to  improve the maritime industry. While we are trying to move H.R. 1726  today, we have more work to do.   And to that end, I look forward to working with Chairman Hunter on  bringing H.R. 2593 to the floor before the August recess, together with  the full committee chairman, Bill Shuster; and ranking Democrat, Peter  DeFazio. H.R. 2593 deals with the Federal Maritime Commission  Authorization Act of 2017.   This legislation would update and strengthen the Shipping Act to  address the current upheaval in the global shipping markets that affect  U.S. foreign trade.   The formation of three large ocean carrier alliances has raised  legitimate concerns among U.S. port service providers, maritime  terminal operators, and tug operators. By virtue of the sheer size and  volume of trade that these alliances carry, they will have a decided  advantage in determining ports of call, negotiating contracts, and  shifting costs, all at the expense, possibly, of our domestic port  service providers.   I know Chairman Hunter shares my concerns, and neither of us are  indifferent. We are going to have to deal with this, and that will be  our next piece of legislation on the floor. The chairman is on top of  it with his staff, and we look forward to that bill, H.R. 2593, being  reported out of the Transportation Committee as it clarifies the  Federal Maritime Commission's authority to oversee and aggressively  deal with competition.   So what we have today is one of two pieces of legislation that we  intend to move forward dealing with the overall well-being of the  maritime industry.   I highly recommend H.R. 1726 to the floor. It is noncontroversial and  should pass. The other piece of legislation will be here shortly, and  we will take that up at that time.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
