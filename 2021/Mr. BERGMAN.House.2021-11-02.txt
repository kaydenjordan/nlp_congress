 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Biden  Department of Justice attack on our parents who advocate for their  children to our local school boards. These efforts undermine the very  foundation of our public schools. That is what they do.   We have recently seen an unprecedented level of local civic  engagement allowing parents, teachers, and government officials to  navigate our pandemic recovery and promote accountability in the  classroom. However, this administration has responded by using scare  tactics to prevent any criticism from parents against biased policies.   Parents don't want their children's educational development stunted  by mask mandates or corrupted by critical race theory. What parents do  want is a say in their children's educational futures without being  threatened for exercising their First Amendment rights.   The Attorney General must immediately withdraw this memorandum.   I will continue fighting for a mom's or dad's right to make their  opinion heard because that is the America our parents and students  deserve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I was unexpectedly detained during vote  proceedings. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 348.

Here in D.C. and back home in Michigan, I stay closely connected with  all my fellow veterans, and I can tell you this: From the Afghanistan  debacle to lingering backlogs at the VA, it has not been an easy year  for veterans and their families.   But I want to remind you all, veterans, you are not alone. We are  here with you; we are listening; and we are working through the  difficult times to get things done. You are going to hear today from  many of my colleagues who not only share this feeling but want to  remind you that we are working every day on your behalf, not for any  political reason but because we strive to thank you and honor you for  your service to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), who  is my friend, colleague, and fellow marine.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Bost for his comments, and I  yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my friend and colleague  and fellow Air Force veteran.    Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I accept that  for all the veterans who served, especially the marines.   Now, it is my honor to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Rouzer), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert), my friend and Army veteran.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Tiffany), my friend and border colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Clyde), my friend and colleague and Navy veteran.    Madam Speaker, in closing, during my 40 years in  uniform, and now here in Congress, and also even before uniform, being  raised in a family of World War II veterans, I feel as though because  of my parents' guidance and example, I have dedicated my life to our  military community, in one form or another.   Through all of that and all I have learned, there is one thing about  Veterans Day that I really want to make sure that I talk about; all of  you, talk to a veteran. Don't just say ``Thank you for your service,''  but engage them, find out about their story.   Veterans, to you, share your stories, because we don't know how many  more days that we might have to walk the face of the Earth. It is so  important for us to share our stories as veterans with the next  generations.   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   We live in the greatest country in the world because men and women  have sworn an oath to give their lives for our country. Never forget  that. That is what makes us the United States of America.   May God continue to bless our troops, all of our veterans and their  families.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
