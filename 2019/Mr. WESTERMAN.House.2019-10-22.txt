 Madam Speaker, this cloak-and-dagger impeachment  process is unprecedented, uncalled for, and unfair to the American  people.   When I, a Member of Congress, am turned away from reading testimony  from Chairman Schiff's closed-door hearings, how can I keep informed on  a narrative that is constantly changing?   How are we supposed to know all the facts when the Intelligence  Committee is selectively leaking information to the press, creating a  biased narrative while shrouding the truth in darkness?   Will we ever get information before there is a vote on impeachment,  or will the Speaker continue allowing secret hearings and inquiries to  drag on?   These are questions every American should be asking.   Impeachment undoes an election and is the most serious tool Congress  can use. We should treat it as such. Instead, we have seen Democrats  calling for it since before President Trump was even inaugurated.   One of my Democrat colleagues recently said: If President Trump isn't  guilty, he needs to prove it.   That is not how America works. It is the Speaker's responsibility to  lay out the evidence in an open, transparent way so we can debate it  and vote on it.                            ____________________
