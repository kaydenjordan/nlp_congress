 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House amendment to  S. 2248.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe for his service and leadership in  the committee. I also thank Ranking Member Walz, as well as the  committee staff, for their efforts in this legislation and for  including my bipartisan bill, the Servicemember Family Burial Act, as a  provision of this larger bill.   When the Department of Veterans Affairs provides burial and  headstones or markers for eligible family members who predecease active  servicemembers, it is always under very difficult situations. The loss  of a spouse or a child is a very painful occurrence, and we want to  make sure that the burial benefits and the whole process is as easy as  possible for our Active Duty servicemembers during these very difficult  times.   This bill codifies existing current practice to ensure the VA's  process occurs with dignity, sensitivity, and compassion.   In summary, this is a simple change that allows for the burial and  provisions of headstones for eligible spouses and dependents of  children of Active Duty servicemembers in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the inclusion of my legislation within the  larger bill, which contains a range of notable measures aimed at  assisting our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.
