 Senator Mikulski, who served in the Halls of Congress for 40  years--30 years in this body and 10 years in the House of  Representatives--has provided a tribute. She is not only the longest  serving woman in all of Congress but also the first Democratic woman  elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right, the first woman to chair  the Senate Appropriations Committee, an inductee into the National  Women's Hall of Fame, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of  Freedom award from President Barack Obama. As we remember Mrs. Barbara  O'Malley, this great public servant and longtime staffer to Senator  Mikulski, I thought it would be appropriate to share Senator Mikulski's  heartfelt tribute. I also have tributes from former Majority Leader  Harry Reid; Senator Mikulski's chief of staff, Dr. Shannon Kula; the  Acting Administrator of the National Aeronautics & Space  Administration, Steve Jurczyk; and a statement from the Civil Air  Patrol. I ask unanimous consent that these statements be printed in the  Record following my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Statement of Senator Barbara A. Mikulski on the Passing of Barbara A.                                  O'Malley         For over 30 years I have had the good fortune to know one       of our state's greatest treasures, Barbara A. O'Malley, and       her passing on January 6, 2021 has left a hole in our hearts       the depths of the ocean wide.        Barbara Ann Suelzer, the daughter of Joseph and Martha Dix       Suelzer, was born in 1928 and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana,       where she graduated from Central Catholic High School. During       World War II and while still in high school, she joined the       Civil Air Patrol, Group 523, earned her private pilot       certificate in 1946, and then remarkably went on to work in       the office of Flying Service.        Shortly thereafter, Barbara Suelzer went to Washington, DC       to work for Rep. Edward Kruse and then a few years later,       while a committee woman at the Young Democrats, she met a       young Georgetown University Law School student, Thomas Martin       O'Malley. Their love of politics grew into a love for one       another and they were married in 1954. Together, they made a       home in Rockville, Maryland and raised six wonderful       children--four sons: Patrick, Peter, Paul and Martin       O'Malley, as well as two daughters, Bridget (O'Malley) Hunter       and Eileen (O'Malley) Schempp.        To my amazing good fortune, her son, Martin O'Malley,       became my 1986 campaign field director and later he went on       to become Mayor of Baltimore City, Governor for the State of       Maryland, and even a democratic Presidential candidate. But       one of the greatest things Governor O'Malley did for me apart       from his own service, was that he recommended his mother       apply for the receptionist job in my new Senate office       starting in January 1987. It was my distinct pleasure to have       her on my staff until my retirement in January 2017.        For all who knew her, Mrs. O, greeted every constituent       with kindness, care and consideration in what was after all,       the people's house. She had a great love of history, and she       knew the history of the Capitol. She knew every nook and       cranny, even the basement, and when school groups came to the       Capitol, it was Mrs. O who led the tour. She also developed       relationships with other staffers and loved playing poker--      and became a legend for her skill at the game--especially       with other senators. Indeed, her love of flying combined with       her passion for history, inspired her volunteer work as a       docent for the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum for many years.       In 2016, Mrs. O was formally recognized by the U.S. Civil Air       Patrol during their 75th Anniversary Gala and received a       replica of CAP's 2014 Congressional Gold Medal for her       service during World War II.        I, along with my entire office, counted on Mrs. O over the       course of 30 years. She was honest, kind, and looked out for       one and all. Her life was rooted deep in her Catholic faith       and together, we served the people of Maryland and this great       nation. My deepest condolences go out to the entire O'Malley       family and to her extended Mikulski staff family  [[Page S243]]       who also feel her loss. May she rest in peace with her       beloved husband Thomas Martin.                                   ____    Statement of Senator Harry Reid on the Passing of Barbara A. O'Malley         Barbara O'Malley was beloved on the Hill. Mrs. O had an       amazing love of politics, history, and the Capitol. She lived       an admirable life. She earned her private pilot's license as       a teenager and later served as Civil Air Patrol in World War       II. She worked on presidential campaigns and in public       service, working for decades in the United States Senate. She       was admired on both sides of the aisle. Mrs. O will be dearly       missed by all those privileged to have known her.                                   ____    Statement of Dr. Shannon Kula, Former Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator         Barbara A. Mikulski, on the Passing of Barbara A. O'Malley         Barbara O'Malley, warmly known as ``Mrs. O,'' was our       source of joy and someone we counted on as always and was a       fierce defender of all of us as the BAMMER family. Every day       and in every way, Mrs. O was our rock. We counted on her       whether it was training new staffers, welcoming thousands of       visitors during inaugurations, sit-ins, war protests, or,       speaking with thousands of constituents on every policy and       political issue you could think of, day in and day out. Then,       just as she promised them, reporting to the Senator exactly       what they were saying. Every person counted and she took her       job seriously. She got us through the dark days of 9/11,       anthrax and ricin attacks. She helped us celebrate victories       whether it was successfully fighting for seniors who were due       their social security benefits, the passage of important       legislation on the Senate floor, or ushering in the holidays       with her famous homemade treats. We loved her resident       celebrity status too from legendary Senator poker games to       her visit with Tony Bennett. Everyone knew and loved Mrs. O!        She looked out for staff in more ways than I can count. For       me, I started my days around 7:30 a.m. and it was a toss-up       whether she or I unlocked the doors each morning. In those       quiet moments, we'd catch up before the day began and the       rest of the staff arrived. Usually, she'd proudly share the       latest pictures of her children, grandchildren or great       grandchildren. Sometimes we'd then go to 8 a.m. mass together       at St. Joseph's across the street. She'd look after all the       office plants and helped me learn to grow mine--even reviving       the ones I thought were clearly long dead. Most days, I would       be running around the Capitol, the Senate floor, meeting       after meeting and couldn't get to my desk until 4pm-ish and       still had at least five or six hours of work ahead. But as I       began to dig out, and was hungry from not having lunch yet, I       would find a special Mrs. O tin of goodies waiting for me       along with a sweet reminder note that was her mantra: ``Keep       your eye upon the donut and not upon the hole.'' Her brownies       and Spritz cookies were favorites. We couldn't be more       grateful to have known her, worked alongside her, and to have       had her in our corner.        Mrs. O embodied exactly what I believe the suffragettes       fought for 100 years ago. She not only did all that they       hoped for and more, but then reached back to bring more women       along with her toward this journey of a more perfect union.       She was bold, feared nothing and no one, a trailblazer who       literally learned to fly, raised and cherished a beautiful       family, had an incredible decades-long career in Congress,       followed her faith, never said an unkind word, and was       thoughtful and generous to everyone.        I know this former pilot now rides on eagle's wings and       that is a comfort . . . but I, and so many, feel the hole,       despite the donut. Mrs. O will be greatly missed but       treasured in our memories always.                                   ____   Statement of Steve Jurczyk, Acting Administrator, National Aeronautics      and Space Administration, on the Passing of Barbara A. O'Malley         The National Aeronautics and Space Administration fondly       remembers Mrs. Barbara A. O'Malley, who was the first face       and voice encountered by 10 NASA Administrators and scores of       NASA staff in visiting or calling Senator Barbara A. Mikulski       for 30 years. Mrs. O'Malley is an honorary employee of NASA,       given her myriad interactions with Agency employees, her       close attention to Agency milestones and activities, and her       personal assistance in NASA interaction with the Committee on       Appropriations and Chairwoman Mikulski. Mrs. O'Malley greeted       dozens of NASA astronauts visiting Senator Mikulski and       attended all manner of NASA events--including commemorations       at the National Air and Space Museum, concerts at the Kennedy       Center for the Performing Arts, and launches at the NASA       Kennedy Space Center and Wallops Flight Facility. Mrs.       O'Malley is remembered for her wit, sparkling eyes, and ready       smile.        NASA's condolences are extended to the O'Malley family and       extended Mikulski staff family.                                   ____   Statement of the Civil Air Patrol on the Passing of Barbara A. O'Malley         Civil Air Patrol (CAP) mourns the loss of one of its       original members from World War II, Mrs. Barbara Suelzer       O'Malley, of Timonium, Maryland. She joined CAP in 1943 as a       cadet while attending high school in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and       stayed passionately involved with CAP throughout her life.       She earned her private pilot certificate as a teenager and       was a long-time aviation and space enthusiast. She loved       working with young people interested in aviation,       particularly CAP cadets and she later served as a docent with       the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. All this was       in addition to her exceptional and long career in politics.        On December 1, 2016, during CAP's 75th Anniversary Gala at       the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, Mrs. O'Malley       was presented with a replica Congressional Gold Medal (CGM).       She was one of only two to be so honored that evening.       Presenting the award was retired Senator Tom Harkin and CAP's       National Commander, Major General Joseph Vazquez. In the       audience was the Secretary of the Air Force, the Honorable       Deborah Lee James, among numerous other VIPs. The CGM was       given to CAP in 2014 for the unusual and heroic service of       its volunteers during World War II.        Civil Air Patrol is truly grateful for Mrs. O'Malley's       dedication and service to CAP and our nation over her long       life.
