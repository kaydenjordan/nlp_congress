 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend,  the ranking member. I didn't realize I was delaying his closing  statement. I am interested in hearing it, too.   And then we are going to compare beards together after this; right? I  am going to lose, I know, because he is the ranking member. That is  what happens.   Madam Speaker, I do want to say a heartfelt thank-you and  congratulations to Ranking Member Graves. This is a testament to his  leadership for our side on this committee that we have come here to see  such bipartisanship when it comes to the Water Resources Development  Act.   Madam Speaker, I do also want to thank Chairman DeFazio for his hard  work. This is something that we have seen over my time in Congress. My  first term, I was blessed enough to be appointed to the conference  committee that got us on track for getting WRDA together on a biennial  process.   Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves, these are the guys who  helped lead the teams to put this successful effort together.   And the chairman, I am sure, is probably surprised. I haven't been  one to stand up and talk about bipartisanship in this Congress as much  as I would have liked, but today is that day to celebrate, and he needs  to be commended for his leadership, and I am excited that we see this  success when it comes to WRDA.   This legislation is important to my district because I represent the  Illinois and Mississippi waterways, the navigation projects that make  sure that global commerce gets from my district out into the global  marketplace.   Without proper policies governing the Corps of Engineers and projects  that are so important to my district, we wouldn't be able to be as  successful, economically. This is the reason why I am so excited that  we see this bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, I urge a hearty ``yes'' vote and passage on this bill,  and I thank every one of my colleagues who helped get us to this point.  Madam Speaker, I certainly look forward to an overwhelming vote in the  House today or later this week.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for  allowing this bill to come to the floor today.   I also want to give a heartfelt thanks to my colleague from the great  State of California, Grace Napolitano. Grace and I cosponsored together  H.R. 66, which is the House companion bill to this legislation.   I also want to thank, since we are taking up the Senate bill, the  Senate version of this bill, I really want to thank my colleague from  my home State of Illinois, Senator Tammy Duckworth, for her work in  making sure that this bicameral, bipartisan compromise comes to the  floor today.   I am proud to have Route 66 run through the middle of my district,  and I do believe that it is important to celebrate its history.   In 1926, Route 66 became the Nation's first all-paved highway under  the U.S. Highway System. As Chairman DeFazio stated earlier, it  connects Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica, California.   Early on, the road was used by thousands of Americans seeking escape  from the Dust Bowl, and it provided critical employment opportunities  for road crews paving the road during the Great Depression.   During World War II, the highway transported troops, equipment, and  supplies to military bases across our country and was used after the  war by thousands of troops who were gladly returning home to see their  families.   By the 1950s, Route 66 began to see a rise in tourism and really  became the true symbol of American freedom and independence that we all  know today.   In April of 2017, I went on an extended tour of Illinois' stretch of  the highway with my colleague and good friend, Congressman Darin  LaHood, and also my good friend and former district director, who is  now a State legislator, Representative Tim Butler, and other local  leaders. We had the opportunity to see the impact that the ``Mother  Road'' brings to our home State of Illinois.                                time  1445    It supports many jobs, key economic activity in small towns, and it  helps generate the important local sales tax revenue to our communities  that line Route 66.   If you want to come to that stretch of Illinois, travelers along  Route 66 can see a giant pink elephant. That is right, Madam Speaker, a  giant pink elephant right outside the Pink Elephant Antique Mall in  Livingston, Illinois, right at the southwestern part of the 13th  District of Illinois.   They can go see a movie at the Wildey Theater in Edwardsville,  Illinois, in my district that originally opened in 1909.   They can stop for an all-day breakfast at Jungle Jim's Cafe, a  quintessential roadside diner in Springfield. They have great pancakes,  too. Don't eat too many of them. The omelets are great. It is a  wonderful place to stop.   These are just a few of the thousands of local businesses along Route  66 whose livelihood depends on the historic highway. You don't even  have to be in a car to ride along Route 66. The Illinois Route 66 Trail  is a system of off-road paths for bikes, hikers, or anyone else looking  to see the Mother Road in a different way.   The centennial of Route 66 will be an international celebration, and  the State of Illinois will be ready to welcome travelers from around  the world who want to experience the history and magic of this scenic  byway.  [[Page H6987]]    For this reason, one of the important aspects of this bill is its  creation of a commission to recommend activities to honor the 100th  anniversary of Route 66 in the year 2026.   Additionally, the bill directs the U.S. Department of Transportation  to work with certain governors to develop a plan to preserve the first  all-paved U.S. highway connecting the Midwest to the West Coast in  California. It is important to retain the legacy of this great road.   Throughout its history, Route 66 has been more than just a way to get  from point A to point B. It has evolved in a symbol of American  independence and prosperity.   I am proud to help continue the legacy of Route 66. H.R. 66 passed  the House last year by a voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on S. 1014.   I don't believe that I have anybody else here to speak on this bill,  unless I surprise any of my colleagues by yielding them time. So, Madam  Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
