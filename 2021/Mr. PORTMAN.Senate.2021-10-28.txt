 Mr. President, well, first, I just got to hear the story  of Jim Schmidt of Alaska--what an amazing American hero. I thank the  Senator from Alaska, Senator Sullivan, for sharing that with all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here on the floor tonight to talk  about the growing epidemic of drug addiction and the issue that is  occurring in my home State of Ohio and, really, all the States  represented here in this Chamber and how we need to redouble our  efforts.   It is a heartbreaking story because we were making so much progress  prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but, now, underneath the pandemic, we  have this epidemic that is growing.   But before I get into that, I must talk first about what is going on  this evening in the U.S. House of Representatives. Almost 3 months ago,  at the beginning of August, we passed in this Chamber bipartisan  legislation to finally address our infrastructure shortfalls in this  country. Presidents of both parties had been proposing it for many  years. Congress had talked about it a lot, but we had never been able  to figure out a way forward.   So a group of 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats got together and said:  We are going to grow this from the middle out and figure out how to  address our infrastructure challenges and do so in a bipartisan way.   We did that. The President of the United States, President Biden,  supported our effort, and we were able to get that legislation across  the floor here in the U.S. Senate--not without some challenges and some  changes and modifications. But we were able to do it because it was  great for America, great for every State represented here, because it  was repairing roads and bridges but also our ports, our waterways, our  water infrastructure, our infrastructure that is considered digital,  which would be high-speed internet, to make sure it is available to all  of our citizens.   So there are a lot of things that people had talked about for a long  time and said they were for, but finally we were able to actually put  it into writing and get it done. And it passed this Chamber with a big  vote: 69 votes. Rarely does something so significant pass this Chamber  with that kind of bipartisan support.    Unfortunately, it has languished in the House of Representatives for  almost 3 months, since early August. And the reason it has languished  over there isn't because it doesn't have the votes. It is really more  because people would like to use it as a hostage for something they  want even more, and that is just wrong.   So, tonight, I urge my House colleagues, Democrat and Republican  alike, to put aside the partisanship and focus on the substance of the  bill and pass it. It has been held political hostage to something that  House Democrats, particularly progressives in the House, want even  more. It is not that they are opposed to infrastructure. They know this  is needed. They know it is good for their constituents and it is good  for our country. It is because they want even more to pass a massive,  new spending bill called sometimes the Build Back Better bill,  sometimes the reconciliation bill, sometimes the $3.5 trillion tax-and- spend bill. That is totally separate from infrastructure, but that is  really what they want to pass.   So they know that a lot of moderate Democrats support the  infrastructure bill. They need those moderate Democrats to support the  massive tax-and-spend bill. So, in effect, they have held it hostage.  They have not allowed the infrastructure bill to move unless they get  commitments on the bill they really want, which is the tax-and-spend  bill. I think that is just wrong.   So I urge the Speaker of the House and my colleagues in the House to  go ahead and vote on that legislation this evening. I know there has  been back-and-forth all day about what will happen. All I can say is it  is the right thing to do for our country.   When you think about it, the infrastructure bill is exactly what we  need right now. Not only do we have a long-term challenge that  everybody knows about and that we have been talking about for literally  decades, but for the problems we face right now in our economy, it is  very effective.   Inflation: Everybody is concerned about it, and they should be. The  cost of gasoline at the pump is up about 42 percent this year compared  to last year. It is really tough on middle-class families because,  although paychecks may have gone up a little bit, inflation has gone up  higher. So it is essentially a tax on so many of our working families  in this country. But everything is up: food, clothing, furniture,  everything.   So inflation is driven, in part, by the stimulus spending. You  remember that, back in March, there was a big bill, $1.9 trillion. And  many of us said, including some Democrats and including, famously,  Larry Summers, who is the former Democratic Secretary of the Treasury  for President Obama and in the Clinton administration: If you do this  massive amount of spending, an unprecedented amount of stimulus  spending, you will drive up inflation because you are putting many more  dollars into people's pockets, into the economy, at a time when the  economy  [[Page S7453]]  is already beginning to improve, and it will be chasing fewer and fewer  goods, and that will raise inflation.   And that is exactly what has happened, which is bad for everybody,  particularly, again, lower and middle-income families who are seeing  this hidden tax, really, on everything they buy and, again, taking away  the power of their slight increase in wages that we have seen. In fact,  when you look at the data, it looks like wages have actually gone down  in the past year. They have gone down because, after inflation, wages  are worth less.   So that is where we are right now. And the infrastructure bill is  actually counterinflationary. Why do I say that? Because it doesn't  invest in the way that the tax-and-spend bill invests. It is not about  stimulus. It is about longer term investments in hard capital assets.   So the economists look at that--including conservative economists at  the American Enterprise Institute, including Doug Holtz-Eakin, who is a  former CBO Director here and a more conservative economist--and they  say: Now, this actually will be counterinflationary because you are  investing long term in these capital assets, creating jobs, making our  economy more efficient, making it more productive; and, therefore, in  this instance now where we have this high inflation, it is a good thing  to do.   No. 2, we have had a lot of natural disasters in this country,  particularly in the last year. About one out of every three Americans,  apparently, lives in an area that has been subject to one of these  natural disasters. It is the hurricanes. It is the floods. It is the  wildfires. It is something that is affecting our country in a major way  right now, and we hear about it virtually every week.   This legislation, the infrastructure bill, actually has provisions  for resiliency to mitigate the damage from these natural disasters. So  it is a well-timed bill in that sense as well.   There is an historic commitment to ensuring that we are not just  talking about climate change and natural disasters but actually putting  in place things that will protect communities from these natural  disasters--whether it is forest fires, whether it is hurricanes,  whether it is tornadoes, or other natural disasters. That is in this  legislation, the infrastructure bill.   And, finally, what is one of the biggest issues we face right now in  terms of our economy? The supply chain crisis. Go to a store in your  community, as many of you have, and you will see that the shelves are a  lot more bare than they used to be. And there is not much on the  shelves because we have this supply chain problem, kind of a  bottleneck.   Well, this legislation helps in that regard because it provides  funding for infrastructure, including our ports: our ports of entry,  our land ports, but also our seaports that are now in a situation where  they are jammed with more and more container ships, and, yet, they  can't process them quickly enough.   So what the experts tell me is that the $2 billion in the  infrastructure bill will help to improve those facilities, improve  their operation, improve the intermodal connections--in other words,  the truck connections, the train connections--to our ports and help  move along this supply chain issue that we are currently facing.   The legislation helps with regard to freight, rail. It helps with  regard to our waterways, which carry a lot of freight in our country.   So it is something that would be helpful in all three of these areas:  inflation, natural disasters, and also our supply chain issues.   At the same time, again, it is just needed because our infrastructure  has fallen behind, particularly fallen behind other countries. And,  therefore, making our economy more efficient and more productive is a  good thing. Again, that is why it got 69 votes here in the U.S. Senate  and why we need to pass it.   It is totally different from the tax-and-spend reconciliation bill,  which, again, is massive new spending, massive tax increases, which  will add to inflation; and at a time when we have such high debts and  deficits, it will add to our record level of debt and deficit. Its  large tax increases will hurt our economy at a time when we cannot  afford it.   We just got the numbers in from the economic growth in the last  quarter. They just came in today: 0.5-percent growth. Very  disappointing. Well below expectations.   So we know economic growth is slowing. We know inflation is rising.  We know that this is not the time for us to put forward this kind of  legislation because it will aggravate the inflationary pressures, but  it also causes us, at a time of debt and deficits, to see big increases  in spending.   And, finally, again, at a time when our economy is, unfortunately,  not performing the way we would like to see it--it is slowing down; it  has been the worst economic quarter we have seen since 2000--we need to  make sure we were not adding new taxes to our economy at this time. So  the timing is bad.   By the way, the infrastructure bill has no new tax increases. The  infrastructure bill is not about immediate spending. It is about long- term spending over 5, 10, 15 years for capital assets--again,  counterinflationary.   So they are very different proposals, aren't they?   I call on my colleagues in the House tonight to pass this  legislation, get the infrastructure bill done. Don't hold it hostage  with something else. That is not how we operate. Do the right thing for  your constituents and for our country.   The other focus that I had tonight was on our opioid and, more  broadly, drug addiction crisis we face in this country and,  unfortunately, at a time with the pandemic, causing huge healthcare  problems that has distracted a lot of our attention, understandably.  But underneath that pandemic there has been this epidemic that has been  growing, and that is, again, this addiction issue.   Back in 2018, we saw a reduction in addiction and, specifically, in  the way it is typically measured, which is the number of overdose  deaths that occur in our States. It was great news: a 22-percent  decrease in overdose deaths in my home State of Ohio, after decades of  increases every single year--22 percent in 1 year.   2019 was also a good year, where we saw significant success in  getting people into treatment, getting people into recovery, reducing  the use of drugs through prevention--all the things that we have been  wanting to do.   So much of that came from work that was done in this Chamber because  we did enact new legislation and provided billions of more dollars for  prevention, for treatment, for recovery. And we had a lot of great  activity going on at the State level, at our local levels as well,  building on that.   We had more Narcan being provided to our communities, which is this  miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose. We had very good  success in getting more people not just into treatment but into longer- term recovery, where there is a greater chance of them succeeding and  not relapsing.   We did that through some legislation called the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, bipartisan legislation passed here in this  Chamber. Senator Whitehouse joined with me on that as a coauthor. And  then we also passed additional legislation to get more money directly  to the States. And we found that we were, again, making progress, and  then the pandemic hit.   Unfortunately, we now know from the latest data from the Centers for  Disease Control--the CDC--that under the cover of this pandemic, the  drug epidemic has not only not gone away, it has actually gotten much  worse.   Overdose deaths rose by nearly 30 percent between March 2020 and  March 2021--the latest year for which we have data; 30-percent increase  in overdose deaths.   This is very discouraging and heartbreaking really because that means  much more devastation for our communities, families being broken apart,  people not being able to achieve their God-given ability in life.  Thousands more being lost--96,779 more individuals--moms and dads, sons  and daughters, friends and loved ones--lost their lives to overdose  deaths during that yearlong period, the most recent year that we have  data for. It is the worst year we have had in the history of our  country in terms of overdose deaths.   Again, we have been rightfully focused on COVID-19. But,  particularly,  [[Page S7454]]  as the COVID pandemic is beginning to get better, the Delta variant  finally beginning to affect our communities less, we have got to  refocus ourselves on this addiction issue. If we don't do it, we are  going to continue to see this tragic epidemic take away more lives.   In 47 States and the District of Columbia, the overdose rate went up  during this last year, including a 26-percent increase in my home State  of Ohio. In some States, by the way, the increase was as high as 85  percent. And I know the Members of the Senate who represent those  States are well aware of that and would join me in saying we have to  figure out a way; we have got to figure out a way.   So what is the way forward?   Well, part of it is to getting back to what we know works. The  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the bill called the 21st  Century Cures Act--both signed into law in 2016--again, provided  billions of new dollars for prevention, for treatment, for longer-term  recovery, for Narcan to help our first responders. And that worked, and  we made progress. So let's get back to that and redouble our efforts  there.   But we need to do more. And we have new legislation we have  introduced we think will do that. It is called the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act 2.0--I am sorry, 3.0. We have already done  the first bill and 2.0. Now, we are at 3.0. And it provides additional  help but also has some new provisions in addition to funding those that  we know work, and that is extremely important as well.    By the way, in these overdose deaths, we know that, increasingly, it  is synthetic opioids that is causing the deadly outcome. Fentanyl, in  particular, which is a synthetic form of heroin or other opioids that,  for a long time, was being produced in China and then sent to our  shores, and this poison was coming into our communities by our own U.S.  Postal Service.   So several years ago, we wrote legislation to deal with that called  the STOP Act, and it actually has been quite effective to keep these  drugs from coming in through the United States mail system. At that  time, our mail system didn't provide the kind of screening that the  private carriers did, like FedEx or UPS or DHL, and so people who were  traffickers chose to use our own Postal Service. Maddening. And they  were doing it successfully.   But it is kind of like whack-a-mole. Once we dealt with the STOP Act  and dealt with the fentanyl coming in from China directly through the  mail system, it started to show up where?   Through our southern border.   So, today, what the experts will tell you is this deadly fentanyl is  coming in primarily through the U.S.-Mexico border; it is cheaper than  ever, very inexpensive. Sometimes it is produced in Mexico using  precursors that come from China. It is being pressed into pills, often,  so people don't know it is fentanyl. The pill may be Xanax. The pill  may be Percocet. People think they are getting pain relief or anxiety  relief when, in fact, they are getting fentanyl; and the tragic result  of that is, again, more and more overdose deaths.   We had a roundtable discussion recently where we talked about the  issue of the border and what was happening and the fact that so many  people now are coming across the border, but also so much contraband,  including these drugs. And we had a witness whose name was Virginia  Krieger. This was last week: Virginia told us her very tragic story  about her daughter, who thought she was taking a Percocet for pain  because that is what the pill said. And she died of an overdose. And it  was determined after the fact that, in fact, she had died of fentanyl  because some evil scientist--perhaps in Mexico--had pressed these  pills, made these pills, probably to try to get her addicted to this  powerful drug fentanyl, and, in fact, she had ingested it, taken it,  and it had caused her to overdose and die.   Virginia--God bless her--has taken the death of her daughter, Tiffany  Leigh Robertson, and channeled that grief into something positive. She  is going out to the schools now and talking to young people--I see our  pages are here tonight--and saying: Every drug, every pill that is not  from a pharmacy that you might find on the streets is potentially  deadly. It can kill you. So be cautious. Don't ever take a pill if you  don't know that it is coming from a pharmacy, that it is what it says  it is.   My heart goes out to Virginia, her family, and all those who have  lost loved ones to these deadly substances. We need to be sure that we  reduce the supply of these drugs, and we also do much more in terms of  the demand reduction.   One way we can start to address the supply of fentanyl and other  synthetic opioids is to make sure that they are illegal. That might  seem obvious to you, but we have had a hard time here in this country  dealing with this issue because--think about it--if the synthetic form  of an opioid, which can be changed by one of these evil scientists  fairly easily--maybe just one molecule changes--and suddenly it is not  on the list of controlled substances and not illegal.   So in order to avoid this problem and be sure that people are  properly prosecuted for illegal drugs, we are putting together  legislation and trying to pass it, that ensures that there is a  permanent classification of these drugs as being illegal.   The Drug Enforcement Agency, back in 2018, used its authority to  temporarily classify all fentanyl-related drugs--all of them--as  schedule I substances, meaning illegal at the highest level, which  allows law enforcement to aggressively intercept and destroy those  substances. Unfortunately, that was only temporary. So that designation  needs to be made permanent.   We have successfully extended the temporary extension a few times  here, but it is going to expire again at the end of January. So in just  a couple of months, once again, we will have an expiration of that  designation.   Until we make these fentanyl-related drugs permanently illegal, law  enforcement will not have the certainty they need to go after the  criminals moving these deadly substances, and fewer lives will be lost.   The legislation is called the FIGHT Fentanyl Act. It is bipartisan. I  introduced it with Senator Manchin. Again, it fixes this problem by  permanently classifying these drugs that are fentanyl-related as  schedule I. It also gives our law enforcement the certainty they need  to go after synthetic opioids in all forms and show we are committed to  addressing the threat posed by this particularly dangerous class of  drugs.   So my hope is my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work with  us to get this done before the end of January. There is no reason we  should do it at the last minute. We should provide that certainty and  predictability.   At the same time, I continue to believe that the most progress can be  made on the demand side. So, yes, we need to do a better job at the  southern border. It is outrageous what is happening now. So many drugs  are coming across at record levels. The apprehensions of fentanyl are  at record levels. In fact, enough fentanyl has been apprehended this  year alone to kill every man, woman, and child in America. That is how  deadly the drug is.   But, ultimately, we have to deal with the demand for that drug in  this country. As long as we have this insatiable demand, it is going to  be difficult to stop it through the supply side or even making these  drugs illegal.   So that is why I think we need new legislation to build on the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, to build on what we have done  previously, and this CARA 3.0 that we have introduced with Senator  Whitehouse can help on that. It does so by addressing three important  areas: research and education, treatment and recovery, and criminal  justice reform.   First, it will bolster our work to prevent drug abuse before it  happens, through funding, through research and education. To me, it is  time for a national awareness campaign. It would be money well spent.  And I believe we could use the money that we would appropriate here to  leverage a lot more private interest in this, to get the private  companies--like the pharmaceutical companies--to step forward and to  help us in a true national drug awareness campaign.   Second, research and development. We need to have better pain relief  drugs in this country. We are still relying on things like Percocet, as  I mentioned, and other opioids, prescription forms, that we have been  relying on for decades. It is time to actually move  [[Page S7455]]  forward with the research and development of alternative pain  treatments that don't lead to addiction as opioids do. There has been  some progress there, but not nearly enough, and it needs more help.   Third, in terms of treating substance abuse, our bill builds on what  works by doubling down on proven evidence-based addiction treatment  methods while expanding treatment options for groups particularly  vulnerable to addiction, including young people, new and expecting  moms, rural communities, communities of color. And it will make  permanent the expanded telehealth options for addiction treatment that  were temporarily created in response to the social distancing required  by COVID-19. This is an exciting opportunity because it turns out,  during COVID-19, when we had to rely more on telehealth, there was  actually a lot of success in getting people into treatment.    Now, it wasn't as good as having your recovery coach there with you  and your, perhaps, other recovering addicts with you to give you the  support you need, but for some people who couldn't travel because of  the COVID-19 restrictions and, now, perhaps can't travel for other  reasons, telehealth is something that was determined to be quite  successful in many cases. We should continue that. We have to change  laws to do that because it is about whether that would be reimbursed,  particularly under Medicaid and Medicare.   CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recovery options for individuals  working to put addiction behind them through funding to support  recovery support networks. It will enable physicians to provide  medication-assisted treatment, like Methadone, to a greater number of  patients and change the law to allow those drugs to be prescribed via  telehealth for greater use of access.   Part of the telehealth we are looking for is if you have a  medication-assisted treatment plan, then you can use telehealth--in  other words, over the internet--to be able to get your prescription.  There needs to be safeguards in that. We need to be sure the first time  a prescription is given, there is a face-to-face contact and make sure  that it is not being abused, but this can be quite helpful.   Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our criminal justice system to ensure that  those struggling with addiction, including our veterans, are treated  with fairness and compassion by the law, putting them on a path to  recovery instead of a downward spiral of substance abuse.   When someone comes out of one of our prisons or jails and comes out  as an addict and there is not treatment provided, way too often that  person, of course, relapses and begins to use again, gets back into  criminal activity, and gets right back in the criminal justice system.  That doesn't help anybody. It certainly doesn't help the taxpayer  because the cost is $30 to $35,000--probably more at the Federal  level--to incarcerate someone.   And when they get out, they are just creating more crimes in the  community. It is worth putting some emphasis on treatment while someone  is in prison if they are suffering from addiction and, certainly, when  they get out, getting them into treatment and recovery programs to get  them back on their feet.   By the way, we need these people in our workforce right now. We have  always needed them, but we particularly do now. This is a win-win for  our economy and certainly for the addict.   CARA and CARA 2.0 have given States and local communities new  resources and authorities to make a real difference in our States. CARA  3.0, this new bill, renews and strengthens those programs and, given  the recent spike in addiction, provides a significant boost in funding  as well.   When added with existing CARA programs authorized through 2023, we  would be investing over $1 billion a year to address the epidemic,  putting us on a path toward brighter future free from addiction. It is  money well spent, in my view. It is necessary. Again, it is going to  help to bring our families back together, get people back to work, and  ensure that our communities are not being devastated by crime that is  committed in relation to these drug issues.   I believe these two bills--the FIGHT Fentanyl Act we talked about and  CARA 3.0--will make a difference in addressing this crisis of addiction  our country now faces that has been made even worse during the time of  the pandemic. A lot of our victims of this addiction crisis are  suffering in silence.   I urge my colleagues: Let's act now. Let's bring this to the light.  Let's allow mere people to get into treatment, longer-term recovery.  Let's be sure we are making fentanyl illegal in all of its forms.  Let's, without delay, go to work to once again do what we know works  because we turned the tide on addiction.   We began to turn it in 2018, 2019. Let's get back to that. We will  save lives and give so many more Americans the ability to achieve their  God-given potential.   I yield the floor.   (Mr. KAINE assumed the Chair.)
