 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act, and H.R. 2377, the Federal  Extreme Risk Protection Order Act.   In Texas, our souls are crushed, and our hearts are still broken. We  stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbors in Uvalde and  communities across the Nation, mourning the lives of those who have  lost their lives to gun violence.   Empathy, love, and morality are calling upon us to pass these bills  that are commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence and save  children's lives.   Let's not be deceived by the absurd proposition to arm our teachers  in schools. Let's let schools be schools. A teacher should be armed  with books, not guns. Children need to focus on learning the ABCs, not  how to dodge bullets.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to consult their conscience,  not the NRA, and vote ``yes'' on these measures.
