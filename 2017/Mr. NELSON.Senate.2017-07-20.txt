 Madam President, I want to discuss this nomination.   I am here to add my voice to those of my colleagues who oppose the  nomination of David Bernhardt to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior.  There are a host of reasons--from his history of censoring scientists  to his denial of climate change--but I am going to limit my remarks to  his allegiance to the oil industry and, specifically, his disregard for  the importance of a moratorium on any drilling in the eastern Gulf of  Mexico.   During his confirmation process, he gave some very troubling  responses to questions about the moratorium from the ranking member,  Senator Cantwell. She asked: ``Do you support the current moratorium in  relation to offshore drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico?''   He responded:         I am aware that, in response to the President's recent       Executive Order on the Outer Continental Shelf, Secretary       Zinke issued a Secretarial Order 3350 directing the Bureau of       Ocean Energy Management to review and develop a new five-year       plan. I support the President's and the Secretary's actions       to examine new leasing opportunities within the OCS in order       to advance the Administration's energy agenda.    Then Senator Cantwell asked him: ``Do you support extending this  moratorium?''   He responded: ``I support the President's and the Secretary's actions  aimed at increasing offshore production while balancing conservation  objectives.''   First of all, when it comes to the eastern gulf, there is no good way  to increase offshore production while balancing environmental concerns.  The gulf--the eastern gulf is still recovering from the horrific 2010  Deepwater Horizon explosion, which fouled the gulf all the way east  into most of the Panhandle of Florida.   Secondly, as I have explained time and again, it makes no sense to  drill in an area that is critically important to the U.S. military and  is the largest testing and training area for the U.S. military in the  world, where we are testing our most sophisticated weapons systems and  where we are sending our fighter pilots who need the open space to  train. That is why they have the F-22 training at Tyndall Air Force  Base. That is why they have training for pilots on the F-35 at Eglin  Air Force Base. That is also why the Chief of Staff of the Air Force  wrote in a letter just recently, ``The moratorium is essential for  developing and sustaining the Air Force's future combat capabilities.''   I ask unanimous consent to have the two letters printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                       Office of the Under Secretary                                                      of Defense,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.      Hon. Matt Gaetz,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Gaetz: Thank you for your letter dated       March 24, 2017, regarding maintaining the moratorium on oil       and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico beyond 2022. Since       military readiness falls under my purview, I have been asked       to respond to your letter on behalf of the Secretary of       Defense. The Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the       vital importance of maintaining this moratorium.        National security and energy security are inextricably       linked and the DoD fully supports the development of our       nation's domestic energy resources in a manner that is       compatible with military testing, training, and operations.       As mentioned in your letter, the complex of eastern Gulf of       Mexico operating areas and warning areas provides critical       opportunities for advanced weapons testing and joint training       exercises. The moratorium on oil and gas ``leasing, pre-      leasing, and other related activities'' ensures that these       vital military readiness activities may be conducted without       interference and is critical to their continuation. Emerging       technologies such as hypersonics, autonomous systems, and       advanced sub-surface systems will require enlarged testing       and training footprints, and increased DoD reliance on the       Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act's moratorium beyond 2022.       The moratorium is essential for developing and sustaining our       nation's future combat capabilities.        Since signing the 1983 ``Memorandum of Agreement Between       the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior       on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf,'' the two       departments have worked cooperatively to ensure offshore       resource development is compatible with military readiness       activities. During recent discussions between the DoD and the       Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy       Management, a question arose concerning whether Congress       intended the moratorium to prohibit even geological and       geophysical survey activities in the eastern Gulf. We would       welcome clarification from Congress concerning this matter.        On behalf of the Secretary, I appreciate your interest in       sustaining our testing and training activities in the eastern       Gulf of Mexico.            Sincerely,                                                        A.M. Kurta,       Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for       Personnel and Readiness.                                   ____                                        Department of the Air Force,                                    Office of the Chief of Staff,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Bill Nelson,      United States Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Nelson: I write this letter in whole-hearted       support of a proposal seeking to extend the moratorium on       leasing, preleasing, or any other related activity in any       area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico.       I understand this provision is being considered for inclusion       in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2018.        The Air Force fully supports the development of our       nation's domestic energy resources in a manner that is       compatible with the military testing, training, and       operations. The complex of eastern Gulf of Mexico operating       areas and warning areas provides critical opportunities for       advanced weapons testing and joint training exercises. The       moratorium on oil and gas leasing, pre-leasing, and other       related activities ensures that these vital military       readiness activities may be conducted without interference       and is critical to their continuation. Of course, we are       always willing to work with the appropriate agencies to see       if there are ways to explore for energy without hampering air       operations.        The moratorium is essential for developing and sustaining       the Air Force's future combat capabilities. Although the Gulf       of Mexico Energy Security Act's moratorium does not expire       until 2022, the Air Force needs the certainty of the proposed       extension to guarantee long-term capabilities for future       tests. Emerging technologies such as hypersonics, 5th       generation fighters, and advanced sub-surface systems will       require enlarged testing and training footprints, and       increased Air Force reliance on the moratorium far beyond       2022.  [[Page S4095]]         Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any       questions. I look forward to continuing our work with you to       ensure America's Air Force remains the very best.            Sincerely,                                                 David L. Goldfein,                                     General, USAF, Chief of Staff.     The letters--one from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense and the other from General Goldfein, the Chief of Staff of the  Air Force--state they are needing to put a major investment of  telemetry into the eastern gulf range for all of these sophisticated  weapons systems, and they don't want this investment of the  infrastructure with the moratorium ending in the year 2022. They want  to extend the moratorium for another 5 years, to 2027. That is a  reasonable request by the Department of Defense and the Department of  the Air Force.   For example, a test can start way down in the South, off of Key West,  and a cruise missile could go all the way, 300 miles, because of the  size of this test range, and then it could have a land impact on Eglin  Air Force Base. That is part of our testing regime.   One could ask, Why couldn't the cruise missile weave around oil rig  activities? Well, look at the new miniature cruise missiles that are  out there. It is not one, but a swarm, which takes up a big footprint  that we are testing. This is just one example of a weapons system that  needs a lot of open space. This is a national asset. We don't want to  give it up. That is why the top brass in the Pentagon is asking that we  extend this moratorium so that those expensive investments in telemetry  can be made.   We should not put someone in charge at the Department of the Interior  if he has an open objection to what is obviously needed for national  security and if he has demonstrated a history of siding just with  special interests. It would be a bad decision when it comes to the  national security of this country.   I am going to oppose the nomination, but that is just one reason, one  item, on an ever-growing list of concerns that this Senator has with  the Department of the Interior these days.   On June 29, Secretary Zinke announced that the Department was seeking  public comment on a new 5-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing.  In case anyone has forgotten, the current 5-year plan was just  finalized 6 months ago and is supposed to run through 2022. Why would  the Department spend more taxpayer money to go through the whole  process all over again? The only reason this Senator can see is that  the oil industry wants more acreage. They are going after the eastern  Gulf of Mexico, despite the fact that the Department of Defense is  asking for exactly the opposite.   By the way, they ought to take from the very productive sections of  the Gulf of Mexico off of Louisiana. There are acres and acres under  lease, but of all those acres under lease, how many are actually  drilled and/or in production? It is a small percentage of the acreage  under lease that is actually drilled. So why don't we take advantage of  the existing leases, particularly in the central gulf, which is where  the oil is? That is where all the sediments over millions of years came  down the Mississippi River, settled in what is today the gulf, into the  Earth's crust, compacted it, and made it into oil. That is where the  oil is.   Now, remember, also out there in the eastern gulf, this is the area  that is off limits. This is the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range. The  Air Force wants to extend that moratorium from 2022 by 5 years--out to  2027--in order to protect it for all of these reasons we have been  discussing. It is all of that open space, and we ought not give it up.   I will give you another example of the short memories over at the  Department of the Interior.   After the 2010 BP oilspill, it became clear that the relationship  between regulators and the oil industry was a problem so the Minerals  Management Service was divided into two separate agencies in the  Department of the Interior--the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,  which regulates lease sales, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental  Enforcement, which is supposed to ensure that safety standards are  followed. Less than a decade later, people seem to have forgotten all  of that, and they want to put the two back together again. It is  another example of what is going on. Not only that, but the  administration is trying to roll back the safety rules, like the well  control rule that was finalized in November of last year. This long- overdue rule seeks to prevent what went so tragically wrong on the  Deepwater Horizon rig from ever happening again.   Every day, it seems like the administration is coming up with a new  way to put the gulf at risk and Florida's coastline and tourism-driven  economy at risk. It is now putting at risk the national security of the  country by messing up the largest testing and training range for the  U.S. military and the world. It is utilized by all branches of service.  As a matter of fact, when they stopped the Atlantic fleet of the Navy  from doing all of its training off of Puerto Rico on the Island of  Vieques, all of that training came to the gulf. The Navy squadrons come  down for 2 weeks at a time to the Naval Air Station Key West, with the  airport actually being on Boca Chica Key, and when they lift off on the  runway, within 2 minutes, those F/A-18s are over restricted airspace so  they do not have to spend a lot of time and fuel in getting to their  training area.   I have heard from business owners, and I have heard from residents  across the entire State of Florida. They do not want drilling in the  eastern gulf. They have seen what can happen when the inevitable spill  happens. We lose an entire season of tourism, and all of that revenue  goes away, along with that loss.   Why do they know that?   The BP oilspill was off of Louisiana, but the winds started carrying  the oil slicks to the east. It got as far east as Pensacola Beach, and  the white, sugary sands of Pensacola were covered in black oil. That  was the photograph that went around the world. The winds continued to  push it, and tar mats came over and got onto the beach at Destin. We  were desperately trying to keep the oil from going into the  Choctawhatchee Bay at Destin like it had already gone into the  Pensacola Bay at Pensacola. The winds kept pushing it to the east, and  the tarballs ended up all over the tourism beaches of Panama City. Then  the winds did us a favor--they reversed, and they started taking it  back to the west.   So there was oil on some of the beaches, but what happened for an  entire year of the tourist season? The tourists did not come to the  gulf beaches, not only in Northwest Florida but all down the peninsula,  all the way down to Marco Island, and they lost an entire tourist  season. That is why people are so upset about any messing around.   This Senator brings this to us as I have spoken of what has happened  and have stood up for over the last four decades in order to fight to  prevent those kinds of spills from happening again off the coast of the  State of Florida.   Yet now we have, right here, an issue in front of us, something that  could threaten the Department of Defense's mission for being ready to  protect this Nation. In that case, my recommendation to the Senate is  not to vote for this nomination for Deputy Secretary of the Interior  because of his history and because of how he responded to Senator  Cantwell in the committee.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
