 Madam Speaker, in 2016, President Obama sent $1.7  billion of untraceable cash on shrink-wrapped cargo pallets to the  regime in Iran. The Iranian expatriates in my district reported that  immediately following this shameful spectacle, the Iranian Guard  expanded dramatically and began a brutal round of repression that cost  thousands of innocent Iranians their lives.   Thankfully, President Trump has reversed these destructive policies  of appeasement. The renewal of sanctions against Iran is again bringing  economic pressure on the regime and causing European nations to  reconsider their ties with that tyranny.   Iran is one of the oldest and greatest civilizations in history, yet  it has been suppressed and plundered by a clique of theocratic thugs  who comprise the illegitimate Iranian Government.   This resolution is an important gesture, but it is empty and idle  without action. We need to support the freedom-fighting organizations  operating within Iran with the same financial resources that Obama sent  to their oppressors. I challenge the House majority to do so.
