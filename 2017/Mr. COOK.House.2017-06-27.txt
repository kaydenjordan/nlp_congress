 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 497) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain  public lands in San Bernardino County, California, to the San  Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, and to accept in return  certain exchanged non-public lands, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 497         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

In the event Conservation District opts not to       make the indicated equalization payment, the exchange shall       not proceed.        (2) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by       which the non-Federal land exceeds the Federal land and the       credited value of the Federal exchange parcel, the Secretary       shall order the exchange without requirement of any       additional equalization payment by the United States to the       Conservation District.        (c) Appraisals.--        (1) The value of the land to be exchanged under this Act       shall be determined by appraisals conducted by 1 or more       independent and qualified appraisers.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cook) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan, commonsense piece of  legislation, the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. This bill  reflects a compromise negotiated at the grassroots level among the  cities, county, mining companies, wildlife agencies, and water  organizations for over two decades in the Upper Santa Ana Wash area.   The bill simply authorizes a land exchange of 327 acres of Bureau of  Land Management land for 310 acres of land currently owned by the San  Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District. This exchange  facilitates the implementation of the broader Upper Santa Ana Wash Land  Management and Habitat Conservation Plan, which identifies  opportunities to expand existing aggregate mining operations to support  new infrastructure developments; enhance water storage for the  surrounding communities; and establish protected habitat for certain  threatened and endangered plants and species.   After the exchange, the Bureau of Land Management will use the land  to protect critical habitat and will enhance the region's water  conservation and storage efforts by recharging more than 77 water  basins. The land acquired by the Water Conservation District, which is  currently adjacent to two aggregate mines, will allow local mining  companies to expand and create greater efficiency in their current  mining operations.   The companies estimate that this small exchange will result in  approximately $8.5 million in new infrastructure projects and a $36  million increase in annual payrolls from the new sites.   This bill is supported by a wide variety of stakeholders in my  district, including the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation  District, the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, San  Bernardino County, the city of Highland, California, the city of  Redlands, California, CEMEX, the Endangered Habitats League,  Robertson's Ready Mix, and Inland Action.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, obviously, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 497, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 220) to authorize the expansion of an existing hydroelectric  project, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska  (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I was going to say a few words about this bill  here, but I would be in fear of my life if I changed anything on  Congressman Young's statement.   So with that, I think he did an outstanding job presenting, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Robert Emmet Park Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) Robert Emmet was one of Ireland's most prominent       historical figures, having led an effort to secure Irish       independence in 1803.        (2) Although Emmet's efforts initially failed, they       succeeded in inspiring new generations of Irish men and women       to struggle for independence.        (3) For his efforts to gain Irish independence, Emmet was       found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by hanging.        (4) Robert Emmet's ``Speech from the Dock'' motivated many       of the efforts that led to an independent Ireland following       1916's Easter Rising; (Emmet famously said that ``To       [Ireland] I sacrificed every selfish, every lasting sentiment       . . . I wished to place her independence beyond the reach of       any power of earth . . . to procure for my country the       guarantee which Washington procured for America . . . to       exalt her to that proud station in the world.''). Emmet was       strongly influenced by American democracy and the American       Revolution.        (5) Emmet had family members similarly admiring of the       United States and dedicated to the cause of Irish       independence, including his brother Thomas Addis Emmet who       went on to become a prominent Attorney General of New York.        (6) Emmet has been revered by generations of Irish-      Americans for his leadership, courage, and sacrifice.        (7) Fifty years ago on April 22, 1966, the Robert Emmet       Statue was dedicated on a small parcel of National Park       Service land (reservation 302) at the corner of 24th Street       NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington, DC.        (8) Robert Emmet's statue is the central feature of       reservation 302.        (9) Many leading Members of Congress, including Speaker of       the House John W. McCormack and Senators Everett Dirksen and       Mike Mansfield served on the Robert Emmet Statue Dedication       Committee.        (10) Other members of that committee and participants in       the dedication ceremony included Secretary of the Interior       Stewart Udall, Representative Michael Kirwan, Ambassador of       Ireland William P. Fay, and Rector of St. Matthews Cathedral       John K. Cartwright.       SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF ROBERT EMMET PARK.         (a) Redesignation.--The small triangular property       designated by the National Park Service as reservation 302,       shall be known as ``Robert Emmet Park''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation,       document, record, map, paper, or other record of the United       States to the property referred to in subsection (a) is       deemed to be a reference to ``Robert Emmet Park''.        (c) Signage.--The Secretary of the Interior may post signs       on or near Robert Emmet Park that include one or more of the       following:        (1) Information on Robert Emmet, his contribution to Irish       Independence, and his respect for the United States and the       American Revolution.        (2) Information on the history of the statue of Robert       Emmet located in Robert Emmet Park.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cook) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1500, offered by our colleague, Representative  Joseph Crowley of New York, renames a small triangular property owned  by the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., as Robert Emmet Park.   Robert Emmet, sometimes referred to as the George Washington of  Ireland, was a prominent historical figure known for his role in the  Irish rebellion of 1803 and for his classic ``Speech from the Dock''  that inspired future efforts to gain Irish independence.   The small National Park Service reservation that is redesignated by  this bill includes a statue of Robert Emmet, originally cast in 1916 by  Irish-American artist Jerome Connor. In April of last year, the statue  was rededicated at a ceremony that also jointly marked the centennial  of the 1916 Easter Rising. The statue and park, located just a few  blocks from the Irish Embassy, are a source of pride to the Irish  community.   I wish to thank Representative Crowley for his sponsorship of this  bill, and also Mr. Jack O'Brien of the Ancient Order of Hibernians for  his tireless work in support of this legislation and his lifelong  dedication to Irish cultural projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1500.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1073         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``Arlington Ridge tract'' means the       parcel of Federal land located in Arlington County, Virginia,       known as the Nevius Tract and transferred to the Department       of the Interior in 1953, that is bounded generally by--        (1) Arlington Boulevard (United States Route 50) to the       north;        (2) Jefferson Davis Highway (Virginia Route 110) to the       east;        (3) Marshall Drive to the south; and        (4) North Meade Street to the west.       SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A VISITOR SERVICES FACILITY ON THE                     ARLINGTON RIDGE TRACT.         Notwithstanding section 2863(g) of Public Law 107-107, the       Secretary of the Interior is authorized to construct a       structure for visitor services to include a public restroom       facility on the Arlington Ridge tract in the area of the U.S.       Marine Corps War Memorial.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cook) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1073, brought to us by our Natural Resources  Committee colleague Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia, authorizes the  National Park Service to construct a visitor services center at the  United States Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.   The United States Marine Corps Memorial is one of the emblematic  sites of our Nation's Capital. As a marine, the memorial is especially  near and dear to my heart. It represents our Nation's gratitude and  esteem for the Marines and those who have fought beside them.   While the statue depicts the flag raising on Iwo Jima--one of the  most iconic events in World War II--the memorial is dedicated to all  marines who have given their lives in defense of the United States  since 1775.   Each year, the memorial attracts over 1 million visitors and hosts  several popular events, including Summer Sunset Parades and the Marine  Corps Marathon.   Despite this popularity, the memorial lacks basic visitor services  such as permanent restroom facilities. The bill before us authorizes  the construction of a visitor services center that includes permanent  restroom facilities, thus allowing those visiting our Nation's Capital  to visit and appreciate this grand memorial with increased comfort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1073.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1135) to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities Historic Preservation program.

H.R. 295, introduced by Congressman James Clyburn from South  Carolina, reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Historic Preservation program.   Since 1988, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic  Preservation program has awarded over $60 million in grants to assist  Historically Black Colleges and Universities with needed maintenance  and rehabilitation of historic buildings on their campuses. These  projects may include repairing damaged masonry, upgrading electrical  and plumbing systems, or fixing leaking roofs.   Although the needs of our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and  Universities exceed the amounts authorized by this legislation, future  funding provided to this program will help to ensure that the rich  history of these campuses remains preserved for future generations.   I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
