 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 5089,  the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of  2018.   Mr. Speaker, in 2013, my home airport, Los Angeles International  Airport, came under attack when a gunman opened fire at a TSA security  checkpoint, killing TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez and injuring many  others.                                time  1715    This shooting was just one of several recent attacks on relatively  soft targets such as public airport areas and surface transportation  systems.   In the wake of the shooting at LAX, Congress passed the Gerardo  Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015, which made several important  security improvements, including directing airports in high-risk  surface transportation systems to install incident response plans and  requiring TSA to provide active-shooter training to all of its  screening personnel. Now, over 2 years later, it is time to take the  next step in improving security for these soft targets. Enactment of my  bill, H.R. 5089, is that next step. H.R. 5089 is focused on enhancing  the capabilities of local transportation security stakeholders to  prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and other serious incidents.   State and local stakeholders, including transit system owners and  operators and law enforcement agencies, play a significant role in  securing surface transportation systems against threats; yet many  stakeholders cite a lack of sufficient information from TSA and the  Federal Government to adequately prepare for these threats.   The Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of  2018 requires DHS to prioritize the assignment of officers and  intelligence analysts to fusion centers in jurisdictions with a high- risk surface transportation asset, thus improving information sharing.   Further, it directs TSA to make a framework available to stakeholders  for establishing operation centers responsible for overseeing daily  operations of transportation facilities, allowing for improved  communications.   Finally, it authorizes DHS to develop a training program through the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to enhance the capabilities of  law enforcement agencies operating at surface transportation assets.   Taken together, the provisions build upon previous efforts to secure  our transportation systems by enhancing protection, preparedness, and  response capabilities of State and local partners working to protect  these critical systems.   Mr. Speaker, the shooting at LAX, along with attacks on surface  transportation systems and public airport areas in New Orleans, Fort  Lauderdale, New York City, and overseas have proven that acts of terror  are not limited to the aviation sector. To effectively address threats  to surface transportation systems, State and local stakeholders must be  able to communicate not only with TSA and the Federal Government, but  amongst themselves during an incident. My bill seeks to bridge  potential gaps in communication and coordination capabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5089, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
