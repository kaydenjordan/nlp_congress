 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome the establishment  of U.S. Coast Guard Base Guam, the Coast Guard's new, dedicated base of  operations in my district, focused on logistics and operational support  throughout the Western Pacific.   Under the command of Commander Dana Hiatt, the opening of this new  base signifies a milestone in the relationship between our Nation and  regional allies in the Pacific.   As illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, also known as IUU,  continues to plague the region, it is essential that the U.S. Coast  Guard expand its presence accordingly to counter IUU fishing in U.S.  territorial waters and those of our allies in the Freely Associated  States. The Coast Guard's role in search and rescue operations is also  invaluable.   Just last month, in a joint Navy-Coast Guard operation, a Navy  helicopter saved three divers 29 miles off the coast of Guam. It took  just 2 hours from the report of the missing divers for them to be  pulled out of the water. I applaud the tireless efforts of our Coast  Guard and sailors for saving these divers and the dozens of others they  save off Guam every year.   Guam's location in the Indo-Pacific is vital to keeping a free and  open Pacific and supports our military in its mission to protect the  interests of the United States in the region. This new base reasserts a  core idea that keeps our island and Nation safe: What is good for Guam  is good for America.   Madam Speaker, I could not be prouder to welcome these new  coastguardsmen and their families to our beautiful island, and I look  forward to continuing to support and grow the partnership between the  Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the  people of Guam.                            ____________________
