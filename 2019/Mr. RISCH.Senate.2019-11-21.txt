However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Kellogg Lumber in Kellogg as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small  Business of the Day for November 21, 2019. Kellogg Lumber is a retail  lumber and hardware store owned by U.S. Army veteran Steve Bristow.  Bristow's grandfather, Daniel Fultz, began working as a bookkeeper for  the company in 1951 and worked his way to become owner in the 1960s.  Following a devastating fire in 1955, Fultz rebuilt the company and in  1989 passed it on to his son, Ronald Bristow. Ronald Bristow's son,  Steve, and his wife, Teirza, acquired the company in 2007 and remain  its owners today.   The company sells building materials, such as plywood, paint, and  power tools, and serves clients who seek personal or commercial  construction and remodels. Kellogg Lumber partners with well-known  community vendors to provide reliable, quality products to their  customers, who include homeowners, builders, and contractors. Many  customers have relied on the company to serve their construction needs  for more than 25 years. Bristow and the employees at Kellogg Lumber's  hard work and expertise have earned them a reputation for exceptional  customer service in the Kellogg community.
