 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just 24 hours ago, I expected my remarks on the CHIPS  and Science Act to be very different.   I have worked on this bill for more than 3 years. When I first took  leadership of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee as  ranking member in 2019, developing legislation to strengthen American  science and technology was my highest priority.   After extensive work, in January of 2020, I introduced a  comprehensive bill that created a long-term strategy for investment in  basic research and infrastructure to protect the economic and national  security of the United States.   Our committee's chairwoman, Eddie Bernice Johnson, shared my desire  to refocus, revitalize, and reinvest in American science, and so we  worked together for 2 years, gathering extensive stakeholder feedback  and technical advice, while holding multiple hearings with expert  witnesses to chart a path forward.   This has been an exemplary bipartisan process. Chairwoman Johnson and  her staff have put in countless hours of work with my staff to find  strong, consensus policies to support Federal R&D. I thank the  chairwoman for her partnership and leadership and her staff for their  diligence.   I also thank my committee staff members, who have put in long hours  and hard work to craft what I believe could be a transformational  science policy. I particularly thank Jennifer Wickre, who led this  process for us from the very beginning.   The Science, Space, and Technology Committee's efforts over the past  few years and the bipartisan legislation we produced is truly an  incredible example of what we can achieve when we work together as  responsible legislators in regular order. Unfortunately, not everyone  shares our commitment to that process.   Mr. Speaker, I was frustrated last year when Democratic leadership  put off conferencing our competitiveness legislation with our  colleagues across the Hill in favor of focusing on the doomed Build  Back Better Act.   I was frustrated when the proposed funding for semiconductor  manufacturing jumped from $24 billion to $52 billion with no  explanation.   I was frustrated when, after finally starting on conference  negotiations, the other body tied our research policy to  reconciliation.   I was frustrated when negotiations were shut down, and I was even  more frustrated when the House was shut out of discussions once they  picked back up.   So maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but I am frankly, in all fairness,  disgusted by the developments over the last 24 hours.   House Republicans have been working in good faith this entire time to  come to consensus legislation that could be passed by both Chambers.  But time and time again, we have been thwarted by Democratic leadership  that has moved the goalposts, shut down the process, chosen their  divisive partisan policies over a smart bipartisan bill that would  benefit our country for generations.   I understand why people on my side of the room are furious. I share  those concerns, and I have been around here long enough to know that  this is not the way to do things. For better or for worse--and it is  very clearly for the worse, I would note--the CHIPS and Science Act has  been irrevocably tied to a massive tax hike and spending spree in  reconciliation.   The decisions on how to pursue scientific policy are out of the hands  of this committee, and at this point practically out of the hands of  this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I remain incredibly proud of the good work we have done  to strategically strengthen American research and development. And yet  I cannot ignore the fact that the immense tax hikes and irresponsible  spending in the expanded reconciliation package change the calculus  when it comes to supporting spending bills, particularly a bill that  has come to be tied to reconciliation.   This is one of those occasions that, as a statesman and responsible  Member of Congress, I have to put aside my own pride in the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee's work and cast a vote that represents  the best interests of Americans, and particularly the good people of  the Third District of Oklahoma.   So, regrettably--and it is more regrettably than you can possibly  imagine--I will not be casting my vote for the CHIPS and Science Act  today.   I emphasize that this is in no way a reflection of my feeling about  the transformational research policies in this bill. I am grateful to  Chairwoman Johnson for working with me every step of the way to create  a strategic, bipartisan, forward-thinking policy.   I just wish other legislators in both Chambers would follow our  example instead of forcing indefensible votes like we have today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Brady), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever it is  appropriate, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers and I, too, am  prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I said in my opening remarks, I am deeply  disappointed by the process that led us here, especially over the last  24 hours. Had Democratic leadership acted in good faith, we would be  having a very different discussion today.   I would prefer that our bipartisan strategic competitiveness policy  had not been tied to the partisan and divisive reconciliation  legislation. But it would be dishonest to pretend that that hasn't been  the case.   And after long and careful thought for what reconciliation will mean  to the economy, the expanded government, and the American people, I  cannot, in good conscience, vote for the $52  [[Page H7386]]  billion in mandatory spending; while knowing that hundreds of billions  in taxes and partisan spending are about to bulldoze us.   We know the numbers, but it is worth repeating them because they are  more than numbers. As someone who studied economics, I am very  cognizant that these are, in fact, a representation of the daily life  for families across America.   Inflation has skyrocketed to 9.1 percent. Every dollar in your  wallets, in your paycheck, in your retirement account, every dollar is  now worth less.   The next set of numbers is 1.6 and 0.9. Those are the most recent  declines in our Gross Domestic Product, GDP.   While my friends on the other side of the aisle want to debate the  definition of recession, let's put that nitpicking aside and step back  for a moment and consider the big picture, what this means for  Americans.   Our economic growth is slowing. Our inflation is rising. Our job  growth is tapering off. Americans are unquestionably worse off now than  they were a year ago; and that is what I have to consider when casting  today's vote.   What we need right now is policy to make our economy stronger and  more competitive; not backroom deals that increase taxes on businesses  and raise government spending.   As I said at the start of this debate, I am incredibly proud of the  work the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee has done to  create thoughtful, strategic, sustainable science and technology  policy. I am grateful to Chairwoman Johnson, to the Republican and  Democrat members of the Science Committee, and to all the staffers who  worked to advance this legislation.   While others may try to take credit, the truth is division B was  primarily developed and written by our committee, which has been  working on this issue for longer than anyone on the Hill.   I would like very much to cast my vote in support of our research and  development policies, but I cannot ignore the consequences of doing so,  alongside a deeply flawed reconciliation package. I owe it to my  constituents to vote in their best interests. And today, that means  voting against the legislation I have long supported.   I will conclude with this: I believe the bipartisan leadership of the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee represents the best that  Congress can be when we work together in a transparent fashion to come  to agreements that serve the American people.   I believe that actions taken by Democratic leadership yesterday are a  sad example of the dysfunction that plagues Congress when we ignore  these details. I am deeply disappointed in this process.   Even with all my admiration for my chairwoman, and all the respect  for our mutual members and our staffs, even with all that, Mr. Speaker,  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
