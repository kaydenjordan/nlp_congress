 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Affordable  Care Act. It is a promise to the American people that we must keep. It  guarantees access to affordable, high-quality health care as a right  for all Americans. Backing out of this commitment is irresponsible,  inexcusable, and reprehensible.   As a Member from a congressional district that houses some of the  largest hospitals in the country, health is a crucial issue for my  constituents. Under the ACA, millions of Americans now have access to  affordable health care through individual marketplaces and Medicaid  expansion. Children in New York can remain on their parents' plan  through the age of 29. An insurance company cannot discriminate against  patients with preexisting conditions.   Repeal will be detrimental to our healthcare systems and medical  research community. Without a plan to  [[Page H113]]  replace the ACA, Republicans are openly gambling with the health care  of millions, many of whom will be affected, like the elderly and  disabled who cannot afford to return to the old system of skyrocketing  costs.   I will fight for those Americans who rely on the ACA, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
