 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 204, the Right to Try Act,  because this legislation will enhance access to potentially lifesaving  treatments for patients with terminal diseases or conditions.   Currently, patients can only receive drugs that are undergoing FDA  clinical trials through compassionate use or expanded access. At this  time, patients and their physicians can acquire unapproved treatments  through the FDA, not directly through the drug sponsor. This critical  legislation would establish informed consent for patients to access  unapproved drugs that could save their lives.   This bill still guards patients from manufacturers misbranding or  mislabeling drugs and specifies that any unapproved drug used in the  new alternative pathway must have an active application that is not the  subject of a clinical hold   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker and the majority leader for  recognizing the importance of right-to-try legislation and making sure  that we fulfill our duty to patients looking for any chance to survive  deadly conditions.   This is a great step forward toward ensuring our patients get to take  advantage of the incredible pharmaceutical therapies that are being  researched and developed in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 216.                            ____________________
