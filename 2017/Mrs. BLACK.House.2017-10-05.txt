 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 15  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 15  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this budget substitute, which is,  put simply, an abdication of our fiscal responsibility as a governing  body.   Our country is $20 trillion in debt, with $9 trillion added to the  national debt during the Obama years. We have the responsibility to our  children and our grandchildren to stop this Congress' addiction to  spending. It is a responsibility that I take seriously; it is a  responsibility that the members of my committee take seriously; and it  is a responsibility that Republicans in the House take seriously.   Clearly, it is not a responsibility that our friends across the aisle  take seriously. Our budget works to end the addiction to spending that  has dominated Washington for far too long.   The House budget, passed out of committee with unanimous Republican  support in July, begins to address our spending addiction by balancing  the budget over 10 years so that we can start paying down our national  debt, and it addresses mandatory spending in a significant way for the  first time since 1997.   This budget substitute does quite the opposite. The Democrats' budget  raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, which would be the largest tax increase  in U.S. history. It increases spending by $6.2 trillion, compared to  the budget passed by my committee. It never balances, with a deficit in  2027 of $852 billion.   What we hear from the other side of the aisle and what we see in this  budget is simply more of same: more spending, more tax increases, and  more debt. I don't think that is acceptable, and neither do the  American people.   Since we began this budget debate yesterday, my counterparts on the  other side of the aisle have been throwing out misleading numbers about  our budget and our tax reform effort in order to hide the fact that  they offer no new solutions to the most pressing problems our country  faces.   Here is a number that they should keep in mind while they discuss  this fiscally irresponsible substitute. The national debt for every  person is over $63,000. Every man, woman, and even child in our country  has a $63,000 weight hanging over their heads. Our budget takes real  steps to fix this crisis. This budget substitute does not. Honestly, it  is as simple as that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this Democrat substitute,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney).   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair, with all respect, the cruel  and unusual punishment is the Democratic-proposed substitute amendment.  The raw deal is the Democratic-proposed substitute amendment that  increases spending $6.2 trillion over our budget.   This thing raises taxes--$2.7 trillion, the largest tax increase in  American history, at a time when we are drowning in debt and stagnant  wage growth.   It requires a one-to-one match of defense and nondefense  discretionary spending at a time when we can't keep our F-18s flying  and we have airplanes crashing around the country for lack of  maintenance.   This is unconscionable. This budget never balances. It will leave us  with an $852 billion deficit by fiscal year 2027. It expands ObamaCare,  the most disastrous and heinous trick played on the American people  that I can remember. It prioritizes amnesty over security.   We are never going to get our country straight and preserve our  sovereignty if we don't protect our security. On the other hand, we  have got the Republican budget that offers to do a lot of things. One  thing it offers to do is put a work requirement for able-bodied adults  with no dependent children into welfare.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article by Nicholas Eberstadt  of AEI talking about the horrible condition of our labor force now and  how drastically important this is and how much it will improve the  opportunities for people to rise out of poverty. We have got three 25-  to 54-year-old males sitting out of the labor force collecting benefits  for every one that is unemployed. The unemployed rate is 4.7 percent.  That makes the total 20 percent. It is almost over 5 million people  that we owe them a moral obligation to offer them an opportunity to  rise out of poverty through work, and that is what the Republican  budget does.                        [Commentary, Feb. 15, 2017]                    Economy: Our Miserable 21st Century                         (By Nicholas N. Eberstadt)         On the morning of November 9, 2016, American's elite--its       talking and deciding classes--woke up to a country they did       not know. To most privileged and well-educated Americans,       especially those living in its bicoastal bastions, the       election of Donald Trump had been a thing almost impossible       even to imagine. What sort of country would go and elect       someone like Trump as president? Certainly not one they were       familiar with, or understood anything about.        Whatever else it may or may not have accomplished, the 2016       election was a sort of shock therapy for Americans living       within what Charles Murray famously termed ``the bubble''       (the protective barrier of prosperity and self-selected       associations that increasingly shield our best and brightest       from contact with the rest of their society). The very fact       of Trump's election served as a truth broadcast about a       reality that could no longer be denied: Things out there in       America are a whole lot different from what you thought.        Yes, things are very different indeed these days in the       ``real America'' outside the bubble. In fact, things have       been going badly wrong in America since the beginning of the       21st century.        It turns out that the year 2000 marks a grim historical       milestone of sorts for our nation. For whatever reasons, the       Great American Escalator, which had lifted successive       generations of Americans to ever higher standards of living       and levels of social well-being, broke down around then--and       broke down very badly.        The warning lights have been flashing, and the klaxons       sounding, for more than a decade and a half. But our pundits       and prognosticators and professors and policymakers,       ensconced as they generally are deep within the bubble, were       for the most part too distant from the distress of the       general population to see or hear it. (So much for the       vaunted ``information era'' and ``big-data revolution.'') Now       that those signals are no longer possible to ignore, it is       high time for experts and intellectuals to reacquaint       themselves with the country in which they live and to begin       the task of describing what has befallen the country in which       we have lived since the dawn of the new century.        Consider the condition of the American economy. In some       circles people still widely believe, as one recent New York       Times business-section article cluelessly insisted before the       inauguration, that ``Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that       is fundamentally solid.'' But this is patent nonsense. By now       it should be painfully obvious that the U.S. economy has been       in the grip of deep dysfunction since the dawn of the new       century. And in retrospect, it should also be apparent that       America's strange new economic maladies were almost perfectly       designed to set the stage for a populist storm.        Ever since 2000, basic indicators have offered oddly       inconsistent readings on America's economic performance and       prospects. It is curious and highly uncharacteristic to find       such measures so very far out of alignment with one another.       We are witnessing an ominous and growing divergence between       three trends that should ordinarily move in tandem: wealth,       output, and employment.        Depending upon which of these three indicators you choose,       America looks to be heading up, down, or more or less       nowhere. From the standpoint of wealth creation, the 21st       century is off to a roaring start. By this yardstick, it       looks as if Americans have never had it so good and as if the       future is full of promise. Between early 2000 and late 2016,       the estimated net worth of American households and nonprofit       institutions more than doubled, from $44 trillion to $90       trillion.        Although that wealth is not evenly distributed, it is still       a fantastic sum of money--an average of over a million       dollars for every notional family of four. This upsurge of       wealth took place despite the crash of 2008--indeed, private       wealth holdings are over $20 trillion higher now than they       were at their pre-crash apogee. The value of American real-      estate assets is near or at all-time highs, and America's       businesses appear to be thriving. Even before the ``Trump       rally'' of late 2016 and early 2017, U.S. equities markets       were hitting new highs--and since stock prices are strongly       shaped by expectations of future profits, investors evidently       are counting on the continuation of the current happy days       for U.S. asset holders for some time to come.        A rather less cheering picture, though, emerges if we look       instead at real trends for the macro-economy. Here,       performance since the start of the century might charitably       be described as mediocre, and prospects today are no better       than guarded. The recovery from the crash of 2008--which       unleashed the worst recession since the Great Depression--has       been singularly slow and weak. According to the Bureau of       Economic Analysis (BEA), it took nearly four years for       America's gross domestic product (GDP) to re-attain its late       2007 level. As of late 2016, total value added to the U.S.       economy was just 12 percent higher than in 2007. The       situation is even more sobering if we consider per capita       growth. It took America six and a half years--until mid-      2014--to get back to its late 2007 per capita production       levels. And in late 2016, per capita output was just 4       percent higher than in late 2007--nine years earlier. By this       reckoning, the American economy looks to have suffered       something close to a lost decade.        But there was clearly trouble brewing in America's macro-      economy well before the 2008 crash, too. Between late 2000       and late 2007, per capita GDP growth averaged less than 1.5       percent per annum. That compares with the nation's long-term       postwar 1948-2000 per capita growth rate of almost 2.3       percent, which in turn can be compared to the ``snap back''       tempo of 1.1 percent per annum since per capita GDP bottomed       out in 2009. Between 2000 and 2016, per capita growth in       America has averaged less than 1 percent a year. To state it       plainly: With postwar, pre-21st-century rates for the years       2000-2016, per capita GDP in America would be more than 20       percent higher than it is today.        The reasons for America's newly fitful and halting       macroeconomic performance are still a puzzlement to       economists and a subject of considerable contention and       debate. Economists are generally in consensus, however, in       one area: They have begun redefining the growth potential of       the U.S. economy downwards. The U.S. Congressional Budget       Office (CBO), for example, suggests that the ``potential       growth'' rate for the U.S. economy at full employment of       factors of production has now dropped below 1.7 percent a       year, implying a sustainable long-term annual per capita       economic growth rate for America today of well under 1       percent.        Then there is the employment situation. If 21st-century       America's GDP trends have been disappointing, labor-force       trends have been utterly dismal. Work rates have fallen off a       cliff since the year 2000 and are at their lowest levels in       decades. We can see this by looking at the estimates by the       Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian employment       rate, the jobs-to-population ratio for adult civilian men and       women. Between early 2000 and late 2016, America's overall       work rate for Americans age 20 and older underwent a drastic       decline. It plunged by almost 5 percentage points (from 64.6       to 59.7). Unless you are a labor economist, you may not       appreciate just how severe a falloff in employment such       numbers attest to. Postwar America never experienced anything       comparable.        From peak to trough, the collapse in work rates for U.S.       adults between 2008 and 2010 was roughly twice the amplitude       of what had previously been the country's worst postwar       recession, back in the early 1980s. In that previous steep       recession, it took America five years to re-attain the adult       work rates recorded at the start of 1980. This time, the U.S.       job market has as yet, in early 2017, scarcely begun to claw       its way back up to the work rates of 2007--much less back to       the work rates from early 2000. U.S. adult work rates never       recovered entirely from the recession of 2001--much less the       crash of '08.        And the work rates being measured here include people who       are engaged in any paid employment--any job, at any wage, for       any number of hours of work at all.        On Wall Street and in some parts of Washington these days,       one hears that America  [[Page H7875]]       has gotten back to ``near full employment.'' For Americans       outside the bubble, such talk must seem nonsensical. It is       true that the oft-cited ``civilian unemployment rate'' looked       pretty good by the end of the Obama era--in December 2016, it       was down to 4.7 percent, about the same as it had been back       in 1965, at a time of genuine full employment. The problem       here is that the unemployment rate only tracks joblessness       for those still in the labor force; it takes no account of       workforce dropouts. Alas, the exodus out of the workforce has       been the big labor-market story for America's new century.       (At this writing, for every unemployed American man between       25 and 55 years of age, there are another three who are       neither working nor looking for work.) Thus the       ``unemployment rate'' increasingly looks like an antique       index devised for some earlier and increasingly distant war:       the economic equivalent of a musket inventory or a cavalry       count.        By the criterion of adult work rates, by contrast,       employment conditions in America remain remarkably bleak.       From late 2009 through early 2014, the country's work rates       more or less flatlined. So far as can be told, this is the       only ``recovery'' in U.S. economic history in which that       basic labor-market indicator almost completely failed to       respond.        Since 2014, there has finally been a measure of improvement       in the work rate--but it would be unwise to exaggerate the       dimensions of that turnaround. As of late 2016, the adult       work rate in America was still at its lowest level in more       than 30 years. To put things another way: If our nation's       work rate today were back up to its start-of-the-century       highs, well over 10 million more Americans would currently       have paying jobs.        There is no way to sugarcoat these awful numbers. They are       not a statistical artifact that can be explained away by       population aging, or by increased educational enrollment for       adult students, or by any other genuine change in       contemporary American society. The plain fact is that 21st-      century America has witnessed a dreadful collapse of work.        For an apples-to-apples look at America's 21st-century jobs       problem, we can focus on the 25-54 population--known to labor       economists for self-evident reasons as the ``prime working       age'' group. For this key labor-force cohort, work rates in       late 2016 were down almost 4 percentage points from their       year-2000 highs. That is a jobs gap approaching 5 million for       this group alone.        It is not only that work rates for prime-age males have       fallen since the year 2000--they have, but the collapse of       work for American men is a tale that goes back at least half       a century. (I wrote a short book last year about this sad       saga.) What is perhaps more startling is the unexpected and       largely unnoticed fall-off in work rates for prime-age women.       In the U.S. and all other Western societies, postwar labor       markets underwent an epochal transformation. After World War       II, work rates for prime women surged, and continued to       rise--until the year 2000. Since then, they too have       declined. Current work rates for prime-age women are back to       where they were a generation ago, in the late 1980s. The       21st-century U.S. economy has been brutal for male and female       laborers alike--and the wreckage in the labor market has been       sufficiently powerful to cancel, and even reverse, one of our       society's most distinctive postwar trends: the rise of paid       work for women outside the household.        In our era of no more than indifferent economic growth,       21st-century America has somehow managed to produce markedly       more wealth for its wealthholders even as it provided       markedly less work for its workers. And trends for paid hours       of work look even worse than the work rates themselves.       Between 2000 and 2015, according to the BEA, total paid hours       of work in America increased by just 4 percent (as against a       35 percent increase for 1985-2000, the 15-year period       immediately preceding this one).        Over the 2000-2015 period, however, the adult civilian       population rose by almost 18 percent--meaning that paid hours       of work per adult civilian have plummeted by a shocking 12       percent thus far in our new American century.        This is the terrible contradiction of economic life in what       we might call America's Second Gilded Age (2000--). It is a       paradox that may help us understand a number of overarching       features of our new century. These include the consistent       findings that public trust in almost all U.S. institutions       has sharply declined since 2000, even as growing majorities       hold that America is ``heading in the wrong direction.'' It       provides an immediate answer to why overwhelming majorities       of respondents in public-opinion surveys continue to tell       pollsters, year after year, that our ever-richer America is       still stuck in the middle of a recession. The mounting       economic woes of the ``little people'' may not have been       generally recognized by those inside the bubble, or even by       many bubble inhabitants who claimed to be economic       specialists--but they proved to be potent fuel for the       populist fire that raged through American politics in 2016.        So general economic conditions for many ordinary       Americans--not least of these, Americans who did not fit       within the academy's designated victim classes--have been       rather more insecure than those within the comfort of the       bubble understood. But the anxiety, dissatisfaction, anger,       and despair that range within our borders today are not       wholly a reaction to the way our economy is misfiring. On the       nonmaterial front, it is likewise clear that many things in       our society are going wrong and yet seem beyond our powers to       correct.        Some of these gnawing problems are by no means new: A       number of them (such as family breakdown) can be traced back       at least to the 1960s, while others are arguably as old as       modernity itself (anomie and isolation in big anonymous       communities, secularization and the decline of faith). But a       number have roared down upon us by surprise since the turn of       the century--and others have redoubled with fearsome new       intensity since roughly the year 2000.        American health conditions seem to have taken a seriously       wrong turn in the new century. It is not just that overall       health progress has been shockingly slow, despite the       trillions we devote to medical services each year. (Which       ``Cold War babies'' among us would have predicted we'd live       to see the day when life expectancy in East Germany was       higher than in the United States, as is the case today?)        Alas, the problem is not just slowdowns in health       progress--there also appears to have been positive       retrogression for broad and heretofore seemingly untroubled       segments of the national population. A short but electrifying       2015 paper by Anne Case and Nobel Economics Laureate Angus       Deaton talked about a mortality trend that had gone almost       unnoticed until then: rising death rates for middle-aged U.S.       whites. By Case and Deaton's reckoning, death rates rose       somewhat slightly over the 1999-2013 period for all non-      Hispanic white men and women 45-54 years of age--but they       rose sharply for those with high-school degrees or less, and       for this less-educated grouping most of the rise in death       rates was accounted for by suicides, chronic liver cirrhosis,       and poisonings (including drug overdoses).        Though some researchers, for highly technical reasons,       suggested that the mortality spike might not have been quite       as sharp as Case and Deaton reckoned, there is little doubt       that the spike itself has taken place. Health has been       deteriorating for a significant swath of white America in our       new century, thanks in large part to drug and alcohol abuse.       All this sounds a little too close for comfort to the story       of modern Russia, with its devastating vodka- and drug-      binging health setbacks. Yes: It can happen here, and it has.       Welcome to our new America.        In December 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC) reported that for the first time in decades,       life expectancy at birth in the United States had dropped       very slightly (to 78.8 years in 2015, from 78.9 years in       2014). Though the decline was small, it was statistically       meaningful--rising death rates were characteristic of males       and females alike; of blacks and whites and Latinos together.       (Only black women avoided mortality increases--their death       levels were stagnant.) A jump in ``unintentional injuries''       accounted for much of the overall uptick.        It would be unwarranted to place too much portent in a       single year's mortality changes; slight annual drops in U.S.       life expectancy have occasionally been registered in the       past, too, followed by continued improvements. But given       other developments we are witnessing in our new America, we       must wonder whether the 2015 decline in life expectancy is       just a blip, or the start of a new trend. We will find out       soon enough. It cannot be encouraging, though, that the Human       Mortality Database, an international consortium of       demographers who vet national data to improve comparability       between countries, has suggested that health progress in       America essentially ceased in 2012--that the U.S. gained on       average only about a single day of life expectancy at birth       between 2012 and 2014, before the 2015 turndown.        The opioid epidemic of pain pills and heroin that has been       ravaging and shortening lives from coast to coast is a new       plague for our new century. The terrifying novelty of this       particular drug epidemic, of course, is that it has gone (so       to speak) ``mainstream'' this time, effecting breakout from       disadvantaged minority communities to Main Street White       America. By 2013, according to a 2015 report by the Drug       Enforcement Administration, more Americans died from drug       overdoses (largely but not wholly opioid abuse) than from       either traffic fatalities or guns. The dimensions of the       opioid epidemic in the real America are still not fully       appreciated within the bubble, where drug use tends to be       more carefully limited and recreational. In Dreamland, his       harrowing and magisterial account of modern America's opioid       explosion, the journalist Sam Quinones notes in passing that       ``in one three-month period'' just a few years ago, according       to the Ohio Department of Health, ``fully 11 percent of all       Ohioans were prescribed opiates.'' And of course many       Americans self-medicate with licit or illicit painkillers       without doctors' orders.        In the fall of 2016, Alan Krueger, former chairman of the       President's Council of Economic Advisers, released a study       that further refined the picture of the real existing opioid       epidemic in America: According to his work, nearly half of       all prime working-age male labor-force dropouts--an army now       totaling roughly 7 million men--currently take pain       medication on a daily basis.        We already knew from other sources (such as BLS ``time       use'' surveys) that the overwhelming majority of the prime-      age men in this un-working army generally don't ``do civil       society'' (charitable work, religious activities,       volunteering), or for that matter much in the way of child       care or help for others in the home either, despite the       abundance of time on their hands. Their routine,  [[Page H7876]]       instead, typically centers on watching--watching TV, DVDs,       Internet, hand-held devices, etc.--and indeed watching for an       average of 2,000 hours a year, as if it were a full-time job.       But Krueger's study adds a poignant and immensely sad detail       to this portrait of daily life in 21st-century America: In       our mind's eye we can now picture many millions of un-working       men in the prime of life, out of work and not looking for       jobs, sitting in front of screens--stoned.        But how did so many millions of un-working men, whose       incomes are limited, manage en masse to afford a constant       supply of pain medication? Oxycontin is not cheap. As       Dreamland carefully explains, one main mechanism today has       been the welfare state: more specifically, Medicaid, Uncle       Sam's means-tested health-benefits program. Here is how it       works (we are with Quinones in Portsmouth, Ohio):        [The Medicaid card] pays for medicine--whatever pills a       doctor deems that the insured patient needs. Among those who       receive Medicaid cards are people on state welfare or on a       federal disability program known as SSI. . . . If you could       get a prescription from a willing doctor--and Portsmouth had       plenty of them--Medicaid health-insurance cards paid for that       prescription every month. For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay,       therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars,       with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A       user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for       that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars       on the street.        In 21st-century America, ``dependence on government'' has       thus come to take on an entirely new meaning.        You may now wish to ask: What share of prime-working-age       men these days are enrolled in Medicaid? According to the       Census Bureau's SIPP survey (Survey of Income and Program       Participation), as of 2013, over one-fifth (21 percent) of       all civilian men between 25 and 55 years of age were Medicaid       beneficiaries. For prime-age people not in the labor force,       the share was over half (53 percent). And for un-working       Anglos (non-Hispanic white men not in the labor force) of       prime working age, the share enrolled in Medicaid was 48       percent.        By the way: Of the entire un-working prime-age male Anglo       population in 2013, nearly three-fifths (57 percent) were       reportedly collecting disability benefits from one or more       government disability program in 2013. Disability checks and       means-tested benefits cannot support a lavish lifestyle. But       they can offer a permanent alternative to paid employment,       and for growing numbers of American men, they do. The rise of       these programs has coincided with the death of work for       larger and larger numbers of American men not yet of       retirement age. We cannot say that these programs caused the       death of work for millions upon millions of younger men: What       is incontrovertible, however, is that they have financed it--      just as Medicaid inadvertently helped finance America's       immense and increasing appetite for opioids in our new       century.        It is intriguing to note that America's nationwide opioid       epidemic has not been accompanied by a nationwide crime wave       (excepting of course the apparent explosion of illicit heroin       use). Just the opposite: As best can be told, national       victimization rates for violent crimes and property crimes       have both reportedly dropped by about two-thirds over the       past two decades. The drop in crime over the past generation       has done great things for the general quality of life in much       of America. There is one complication from this drama,       however, that inhabitants of the bubble may not be aware of,       even though it is all too well known to a great many       residents of the real America. This is the extraordinary       expansion of what some have termed America's ``criminal       class''--the population sentenced to prison or convicted of       felony offenses--in recent decades. This trend did not begin       in our century, but it has taken on breathtaking enormity       since the year 2000.        Most well-informed readers know that the U.S. currently has       a higher share of its populace in jail or prison than almost       any other country on earth, that Barack Obama and others talk       of our criminal-justice process as ``mass incarceration,''       and know that well over 2 million men were in prison or jail       in recent years. But only a tiny fraction of all living       Americans ever convicted of a felony is actually incarcerated       at this very moment. Quite the contrary: Maybe 90 percent of       all sentenced felons today are out of confinement and living       more or less among us. The reason: the basic arithmetic of       sentencing and incarceration in America today.        Correctional release and sentenced community supervision       (probation and parole) guarantee a steady annual ``flow'' of       convicted felons back into society to augment the very       considerable ``stock'' of felons and ex-felons already there.       And this ``stock'' is by now truly enormous.        One forthcoming demographic study by Sarah Shannon and five       other researchers estimates that the cohort of current and       former felons in America very nearly reached 20 million by       the year 2010. If its estimates are roughly accurate, and if       America's felon population has continued to grow at more or       less the same tempotraced out for the years leading up to       2010, we would expect it to surpass 23 million persons by the       end of 2016 at the latest. Very rough calculations might       therefore suggest that at this writing, America's population       of non-institutionalized adults with a felony conviction       somewhere in their past has almost certainly broken the 20       million mark by the end of 2016. A little more rough       arithmetic suggests that about 17 million men in our general       population have a felony conviction somewhere in their CV.       That works out to one of every eight adult males in America       today.        We have to use rough estimates here, rather than precise       official numbers, because the government does not collect any       data at all on the size or socioeconomic circumstances of       this population of 20 million, and never has. Amazing as this       may sound and scandalous though it may be, America has, at       least to date, effectively banished this huge group--a group       roughly twice the total size of our illegal-immigrant       population and an adult population larger than that in any       state but California--to a near-total and seemingly unending       statistical invisibility. Our ex-cons are, so to speak,       statistical outcasts who live in a darkness our polity does       not care enough to illuminate--beyond the scope or interest       of public policy, unless and until they next run afoul of the       law.        Thus we cannot describe with any precision or certainty       what has become of those who make up our ``criminal class''       after their (latest) sentencing or release. In the most       stylized terms, however, we might guess that their odds in       the real America are not all that favorable. And when we       consider some of the other trends we have already mentioned--      employment, health, addiction, welfare dependence--we can see       the emergence of a malign new nationwide undertow, pulling       downward against social mobility.        Social mobility has always been the jewel in the crown of       the American mythosand ethos. The idea (not without a measure       of truth to back it up) was that people in America are free       to achieve according to their merit and their grit--unlike in       other places, where they are trapped by barriers of class or       the misfortune of misrule. Nearly two decades into our new       century, there are unmistakable signs that America's fabled       social mobility is in trouble--perhaps even in serious       trouble.        Consider the following facts. First, according to the       Census Bureau, geographical mobility in America has been on       the decline for three decades, and in 2016 the annual       movement of households from one location to the next was       reportedly at an all-time (postwar) low. Second, as a study       by three Federal Reserve economists and a Notre Dame       colleague demonstrated last year, ``labor market fluidity''--      the churning between jobs that among other things allows       people to get ahead--has been on the decline in the American       labor market for decades, with no sign as yet of a       turnaround. Finally, and not least important, a December 2016       report by the ``Equal Opportunity Project,'' a team led by       the formidable Stanford economist Raj Chetty, calculated that       the odds of a 30-year-old's earning more than his parents at       the same age was now just 51 percent: down from 86 percent 40       years ago. Other researchers who have examined the same data       argue that the odds may not be quite as low as the Chetty       team concludes, but agree that the chances of surpassing       one's parents' real income have been on the downswing and are       probably lower now than ever before in postwar America.        Thus the bittersweet reality of life for real Americans in       the early 21st century: Even though the American economy       still remains the world's unrivaled engine of wealth       generation, those outside the bubble may have less of a shot       at the American Dream than has been the case for decades,       maybe generations--possibly even since the Great Depression.        The funny thing is, people inside the bubble are forever       talking about ``economic inequality,'' that wonderful seminar       construct, and forever virtue-signaling about how personally       opposed they are to it. By contrast, ``economic insecurity''       is akin to a phrase from an unknown language. But if we were       somehow to find a ``Google Translate'' function for       communicating from real America into the bubble, an important       message might be conveyed:        The abstraction of ``inequality'' doesn't matter a lot to       ordinary Americans. The reality of economic insecurity does.       The Great American Escalator is broken--and it badly needs to       be fixed.        With the election of 2016, Americans within the bubble       finally learned that the 21st century has gotten off to a       very bad start in America. Welcome to the reality. We have a       lot of work to do together to turn this around.     Mr. Chairman, I do want to say to my good friend and  colleague from Tennessee that I think the D stands for debt for  Democrats, and I think the R stands for Republicans and recovery.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Womack), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the  Appropriations Committee.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arkansas.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arkansas.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arkansas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), who is a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairman of the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I look into my children's and grandchildren's eyes, and I  say: I want you to know that right now you owe $63,000 for your part of  the debt of this country.   What we are doing in Congress right now, if we were to vote on and  accept this amendment, we would be increasing that burden on our  children and grandchildren.   I, for one, cannot do that, and I think that we have got to be  responsible. We have got to look at how we in this country can get back  to the place, as has already been said, that we ask families and  businesses to do, and that is to live within their means.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer), who is a member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Chairman, I am going to be brief in my closing  comments.   I do want to ask my colleague to consider this: Are we proud of a  country where we are leaving our children and grandchildren in further  and further debt?   During our discussion in this Chamber, we have shared our ideas for  building a better America, an America that we would be proud to entrust  to future generations. While it requires confronting real challenges  along the road ahead, it is, undoubtedly, worth the journey.   First, our budget forces the Federal Government to live within its  means, just like hardworking Americans and small businesses do on a  daily basis.   Second, our budget identifies wasteful spending and finds much-needed  savings and reforms for unsustainable mandatory spending. In fact, our  committee has put forward the largest reform package for mandatory  programs that has been seen in 20 years.   Third, it calls for a robust funding of our military, ensuring the  resources that will allow us to be ready and protect our mainland. It  also starts the process of restoring our military readiness, which  suffered dramatically during the Obama administration.   Finally, our budget is the golden key that unlocks progrowth tax  reform and takes us one step further to the great ideas unveiled in the  framework last week.   Without question, our budget plan reflects American values and shared  priorities. I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for a win  for all Americans, because doing so will begin to ensure a brighter and  better future for generations to come, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Newhouse) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Walorski, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent  resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for  the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the  appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, and,  pursuant to House Resolution 553, she reported the concurrent  resolution back to the House.
