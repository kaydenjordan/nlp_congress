 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bryce Sinclair, a  senior at Maine-Endwell High School in New York's 22nd Congressional  District. I am honored to announce that Bryce accepted his appointment  to join the corps of cadets at the United States Military Academy at  West Point, New York.   Bryce was selected among a highly competitive pool of applicants from  around the country. Bryce's decision to attend West Point comes as no  surprise to those who know him well. He is a young leader with  exceptional talent and potential and is already a dedicated member of  our community.   I wish to congratulate Bryce on this tremendous honor. I wish him the  best as he takes on this venerable challenge to serve our community and  our Nation in line with the Army's core values: loyalty, duty, respect,  selfless service, honor, and personal courage.   As the mother of a Naval Academy graduate, the service academies hold  a special place in my heart, especially the friendly annual rivalry at  the Army/Navy game.   Mr. Speaker, we wish Bryce all the best as he moves closer to his  next incredible step in joining the corps of cadets. Good luck, Bryce.  And go Army and go Navy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member for their leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1112 and H. Res. 134.  Both of these bills support democracy and stand with the people of  Burma, also known as Myanmar.   New York's 22nd District is home to more than 4,000 Burmese refugees  and new Burmese-American citizens. They have been coming to our region  for over 20 years. They are demanding action and a return to civilian  rule in Burma. I stand with them and all of my colleagues in condemning  the atrocious human rights abuses that are taking place at the hands of  the military coup last month.   I am honored to be an original cosponsor on both of these bills on  Burma as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, where they  received strong bipartisan support. Though these bills will not solve  the problem in Burma, this will provide continued pressure on the  military and a strong unified international condemnation will add to  that. However, these bills are a very important step in the right  direction.   The Burmese refugees and American citizens I represent in New York's  22nd District remain resolute in support of their friends and families  who are suffering through this tragic process. In Utica, for example,  they continue to advocate peacefully and protest in solidarity with  those in their home country, displaying signs that read: ``Save  Democracy, Save Burma.''   The passion and courage of the Burmese people both in my district and  in Burma is inspiring. I am honored to provide a voice for them in this  august body.   Madam Speaker, I urge all to remain committed to the Burmese people's  quest for democracy and to oppose the assault on their free and fair  government.   Again, I thank Chairman Meeks, Ranking Member McCaul, and the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for being so strong on this  initiative. It is critically important to the Burmese refugees in my  community.   To the citizens: We stand with you.
