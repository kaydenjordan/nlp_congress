 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Antonio Baez,  who is a member of our district congressional staff and who has  answered yet another call to serve. Antonio came to our office through  the Wounded Warrior program, later moving to our official staff.   A family man and proud Marine Corps veteran who later served in  Afghanistan as a member of the Army Reserve, Antonio adeptly attended  to his duties with skill, knowledge, and compassion.   He was president of his police academy class at Lorain County  Community College and served as a sworn officer and deputy sheriff,  nobly serving his community.   Antonio exhibited exemplary public service to the people of Ohio's  Ninth District. I deeply appreciate his service as do the hundreds of  constituents for whom he was a dutiful listening ear and a guiding  heart.   This past weekend, Antonio raised his right hand again, taking the  oath of office as a newly elected member of the Lorain City Council. He  is a son of Lorain and has never forgotten his roots.   Bravo. His call to serve runs deep, and I know he will serve his  beloved community well.   Godspeed, and I thank Antonio for his service to the American people.  Onward.   What Lorain makes and grows makes and grows Lorain.                            ____________________
