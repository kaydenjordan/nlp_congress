 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order  [[Page H618]]  at any time to take from the Speaker's table H.R. 195, with the Senate  amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and  to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a  motion offered by the majority leader or his designee that the House  concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate  amendment; that the Senate amendment and the motion be considered as  read; that the motion be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and  controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their  respective designees; and that the previous question be considered as  ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion.
