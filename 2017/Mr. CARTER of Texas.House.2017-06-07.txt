 Mr. Speaker, this polygraph waiver provision  that is proposed here is a darn good idea that is a long time overdue  from happening. The reality is the hiring process of the Border Patrol,  and, in fact, I would argue almost everything under my jurisdiction in  Homeland Security, is as slow as molasses in the wintertime. It just  doesn't move.  [[Page H4682]]    Meanwhile, we have got skilled law enforcement people applying,  skilled former veterans with high clearances who are applying for these  jobs and being stumbled by the lack of polygraph operators available to  do it.   This is a choice and a right choice of setting a priority for those  people who have served, proving their worth, and are asking to be part  of the defense of our national borders. I support this wholeheartedly.  I support Chairwoman McSally's concept here. It is great. It starts a  new way of doing things. We need more than anything else in the Federal  Government--if a new way of doing things is the right way, we ought to  be doing it. Nobody is going to keep from checking on people. You can  still make them take a polygraph if you run across something you don't  like. But it is a good idea whose time has come. Let's be modern  Americans and have new ideas and make those new ideas work.   I commend everyone here in support of this. I am proud to be a  cosponsor of this bill, and I think, for a change, government is making  a good start at new ideas.
