 I rise to recognize the Honorable Barbara Curran, a  lifelong public servant from New Jersey who broke many glass ceilings.   Barbara was an accomplished scholar, even earning her law degree in  the evenings as a single mom. Entering the world of politics as a woman  in the 1970s, she was a force. Barbara was the first woman to serve in  all three branches of the New Jersey government--as assemblywoman, as a  member of the Governor's cabinet, and as a superior court judge. She  was referred to as the ``blue elephant'' for her commitment to  bipartisanship.   Barbara cherished time with family and never missed an opportunity to  send encouraging handwritten notes. At times, she was even called off  the bench to take a call from her daughter.   I am grateful for the role model Barbara was to me and to so many who  saw a path forward in politics through her example, and a glimpse at  how to balance being a parent with the demands of public service.   In January, Barbara Curran passed away peacefully. My heart is with  her daughter, Katie; her son-in-law, Patrick; and her grandchildren,  Duke, Marrin, Lilah, and Moira.   I was honored to know Barbara, and she will be dearly missed.                            ____________________
