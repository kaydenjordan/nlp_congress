 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Jeremiah Heesaker and  Theresa Miller of Ely, Minnesota, for their dedication to our Nation's  veterans.   Last week, in freezing cold temperatures, Jeremiah and Theresa led a  small group of Minnesotans in laying wreaths decorated with American  flags on top of 130 veteran graves in the Ely Cemetery. They laid all  the wreaths out before Veterans Day weekend, hoping to bring happiness  to all the families who would be visiting the grave of a loved one.   For Jeremiah and Theresa, the care of our veterans is an issue close  to their hearts. Jeremiah served in the Army in the 101st Airborne;  Theresa's husband is also a veteran.   Mr. Speaker, American heroes deserve to be treated in death with the  same amount of respect and admiration that they earned in life. I am  grateful to Jeremiah and Theresa for taking action to honor America's  departed heroes and their families this Veterans Day.   We must never forget those who have bravely served so that we can  continue to live in the land of the free.                            ____________________
