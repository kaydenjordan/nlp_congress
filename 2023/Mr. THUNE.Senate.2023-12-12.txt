 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will vote on the  final version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which  is one of the most important bills we consider each year.   We had a robust floor debate on the Senate version of this bill in  July featuring the kind of open amendment process we should be using on  a regular basis to debate important legislation. All told, more than  900 amendments were considered, and 121 amendments were adopted during  floor consideration, making this the most open NDAA floor debate in  years. I wish we had been able to take up a final version of this  legislation earlier, but I am glad we are on track to finally pass it  this week.   I have said it before, and I will say it again. If we don't get  national security right, the rest is conversation. The security of our  Nation is the precondition for everything else--for the continued  enjoyment of our freedoms, for a flourishing society, for a healthy  economy, for government's ability literally to do anything. So there is  no time when we can afford to let our readiness slide or to take the  security of our Nation for granted.   But the unfortunate truth is that we have some catching up to do when  it comes to military preparedness. We have military services that are  well below their recruitment targets. We are behind on shipbuilding and  ship maintenance. There is a persistent pilot shortage, and in a number  of cases, we have too few mission-capable aircraft. We are not doing an  adequate job of maintaining the kind of supply we need of certain  munitions. And the list goes on.   This is not an acceptable situation, and it could have very serious  consequences. To give just one example, recent war games envisioning a  U.S.-China conflict following an attack on Taiwan have had grim  results, showing enormous military and economic costs to both sides.  One story on these war games noted:         And while the ultimate outcome in these exercises is not       always clear--the U.S. does better in some than others--the       cost is [clear]. In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its       long-range air-to-surface missiles in a few days, with a       substantial portion of its planes destroyed on the ground.        In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its long-range air-      to-surface missiles in a few days, with a substantial portion       of its planes destroyed on the ground.    Well, needless to say, we have some serious work to do, and I am  pleased to report that this year's NDAA does make some genuine progress  on the readiness front. The bill expands the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative and deepens our ties with our ally Taiwan to help detour  Chinese aggression. It rejects the President's dangerous plan to shrink  the U.S. Navy and authorizes investment in new ships. It contains  multiple measures to increase our supply of munitions, including the  addition of six critical munitions to the Pentagon's multiyear  procurement program. Two of these munitions--Tomahawk missiles and Mark  48 torpedoes--play an important role in our ability to deter China.   I am also pleased that the committee responded to my request and  included significant funding for joint air-to-surface standoff missile  procurement, the long-range anti-ship missile, and development of the  nuclear long-range standoff weapon, or LRSO. These are essential arrows  to have in the quiver for our bombers, and the future LRSO will help  modernize the air leg of our nuclear triad.   This year's NDAA also critically invests in recruitment. As I  mentioned earlier, we have multiple military services that are well  below their recruitment targets. These represent serious future  personnel deficiencies. All the ships, planes, and munitions in the  [[Page S5905]]  world will be of very limited help if we don't have the personnel  necessary to deploy these resources. So expanding and improving our  recruitment efforts has to be a priority.   We also have to continue to work to improve the quality of life of  our military members and their families, which is why I am pleased to  report that this year's bill includes a 5.2-percent pay increase for  our troops, as well as measures to improve barracks quality and expand  access to mental health care, among other things.   I am also pleased that this year's NDAA takes measures to keep our  military's focus warfighting and not the dissemination of woke  ideologies by Pentagon bureaucrats.   Above all, I am proud to report that this year's bill authorizes full  funding for the next steps of the B-21 mission, the Air Force's new,  long-range, strategic bomber, which will revolutionize our long-range  strike capabilities and be hosted at South Dakota's own Ellsworth Air  Force Base. The Air Force calls the B-21 Raider the future backbone of  its bomber force.   One of my top priorities here in Congress over the past several years  has been ensuring that the Air Force--and Ellsworth in particular--has  everything it needs for this critical advancement in our Nation's  readiness. This year's NDAA will once again fund not only the B-21  bomber, which we excitedly saw take flight 1 month ago, but the support  facilities at Ellsworth that will be needed to maintain this aircraft  once it enters service.   While, as I said, we are passing this bill a little late, I am  pleased that we are finally passing it and in what I expect will be a  strongly bipartisan fashion.
