 Mr. Speaker, I stand today as the chair of the Women's  Caucus and as a member of the executive board of the Congressional  Black Caucus, and I stand in strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting  Rights Advancement Act.   These repeated attacks on our right to vote have severely undermined  the people's fundamental voting rights, which are the principles of our  democracy.   H.R. 4 helps protect citizens' ability to register to vote and  provides real enforcement so that marginalized communities, like women  who celebrate their 100th year to vote and African American  communities, will have proper access to the ballot box.   The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and we must  ensure that every eligible American voter has the ability to have their  vote heard.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''                                time  1130
