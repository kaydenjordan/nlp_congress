 Mr. Speaker, Democrats today want to introduce gun  control legislation that they say is going to make you safer. They want  to expand background checks.   But what do background checks accomplish?   Well, the DOJ said there were 112,000 denials in a year.   Who were those 112,000 people?   Well, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have you  think those were felons, they saved you from those felons.   But how many of those 112,000 were prosecuted for that crime of  trying to acquire that gun?   According to the DOJ, 12--1-2--12 in a year.   Who were the other 100,000?   Imagine, just imagine now that you are the victim of an abusive  relationship and after 5 years you have summoned the courage and the  resources to separate from that relationship, but things have escalated  and now you have decided that it is time to acquire the means to  protect you and your children. So you go to the gun store and you try  to buy a gun. The clerk presses the computer button, and it says  ``denied.''   You ask the clerk, ``Why was it denied?''   The clerk says, ``I don't know. This happens sometimes. Maybe you had  a similar name to somebody else in the database.''   You can't buy a gun today, tomorrow, next week. Not ever. You have  [[Page H1288]]  been denied. So you go to a friend you have known for a long time. Your  friend says, ``I would like to help you.''   You say, ``Well, I don't know if I am going to make it through the  night.''   Your friend says, ``I would like to help you, but don't you know H.R.  8 passed and it was signed by the President. I can't spend a year in a  cage. Good luck tonight.''   Mr. Speaker, now, I am not going to ask you to imagine what happens  next because the Democrats saw fit to put into this bill a requirement  that you have an imminent threat of death. The threat has to be right  there upon you or great bodily harm.   What do they say?   Well, if you are just expecting a few bruises and maybe a punch, put  some ice on it.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues here today and I am  going to challenge the sponsors of this bill and those of them who  might think they would vote for this bill to consider whether it is  fair.   Is it fair to surround yourself with armed guards, with Capitol Hill  Police who have guns, with personal details, bodyguards, and ask the  people to pay for it when you make it harder for those same people to  protect themselves?   I don't think that is fair.   And for the fact checkers who are already hard at work on this  speech, I include in the Record this GAO report on the DOJ statistics  on background checks.   [From the United States Government Accountability Office, Sept. 2018]     Report to the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,   Science, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of                              Representatives      Law Enforcement--Few Individuals Denied Firearms Purchases Are    Prosecuted and ATF Should Assess Use of Warning Notices in Lieu of                                Prosecutions                            why gao did this study         In 2017, approximately 25.6 million firearm-related       background checks were processed through NICS, and about       181,000 of the attempted purchases at the federal and state       levels combined were denied because the individual was       prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state       law. Individuals who certify that they are not prohibited       from purchasing or receiving a firearm and are subsequently       determined to be prohibited could be subject to       investigation, and if prosecuted, a fine, imprisonment, or       both.        GAO was asked to examine firearms denials. This report (1)       describes the extent to which federal and selected state law       enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute firearms       denial cases; (2) examines related challenges faced by these       agencies; and (3) describes the circumstances that lead to       investigations and prosecutions. GAO reviewed laws and       regulations; analyzed federal and state data from 2011       through 2017; and interviewed officials from ATF       headquarters, 6 of 25 ATF field divisions (the 6 that       investigated the most cases), and the 13 states that process       all NICS checks within their state. Results from state       interviews are not generalizable but provide insights on       state practices.                             what gao recommends         GAO recommends that ATF assess the extent to which ATF       field divisions use warning notifications as an enforcement       tool, which would inform whether changes to policy are       needed. DOJ concurred with GAO's recommendation.                                what gao found         Investigations and prosecutions. Federal and selected state       law enforcement agencies that process firearm-related       background checks through the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS) collectively investigate and       prosecute a small percentage of individuals who falsify       information on a firearms form (e.g., do not disclose a       felony conviction) and are denied a purchase. Federal NICS       checks resulted in about 112,000 denied transactions in       fiscal year) 2017, of which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,       Firearms and Explosives (ATF) referred about 12,700 to its       field divisions for further investigation. U.S. Attorney's       Offices (USAO) had prosecuted 12 of these cases as of June       2018.        TABLE.--FEDERAL NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM (NICS) FIREARMS DENIAL CASES INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED, FISCAL YEAR 2017 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                    ATF Field Division         United States Attorney's                    Federal NICS Transactions                               Denials                   Investigations             Offices Prosecutions -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8,606,286.....................................................                       112,090                        12,710                            12 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         At the state level, officials from 10 of 13 selected states       said they did not investigate or prosecute firearm denials,       some citing competing resource demands and the lack of       statutes with which states prosecute as reasons. The       remaining 3 states investigated a high proportion of firearms       denials. One of the 3 states reported about 1,900 referrals       for prosecution in 2017 and about 470 convictions.        Challenges. ATF and selected states reported challenges in       investigating and prosecuting firearms denials. Officials       from six selected ATF field divisions said that investigating       the increasing number of denial cases referred to field       divisions--which increased from about 5,200 in fiscal year       2011 to about 12,700 in fiscal year 2017--has been time       intensive and required use of their limited resources. ATF       policy provides that field divisions may send ``warning       notices'' to denied persons in lieu of prosecution, but ATF       has not assessed field divisions' use of these notices, which       could provide greater awareness of their deterrence value and       inform whether any policy changes are needed. Officials from       the Executive Office for United States Attorneys said that       prosecuting denial cases can require significant effort and       may offer little value to public safety compared to other       cases involving gun violence. Selected state officials said       that denial investigations can take law enforcement officials       away from their core duties. State prosecutors said gathering       evidence to prove individuals knew they were prohibited was a       challenge.        Types of cases. ATF field divisions investigate denial       cases based on USAO criteria and generally only refer cases       to USAOs for prosecution when aggravating circumstances       exist, such as violent felonies or multiple serious offenses       over a short period of time. Officials from two of three       selected states refer all denial cases for investigation,       while one state uses risk-based criteria for selecting cases       that include conditions such as felony convictions and       misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. Prosecutors from       these three states said they generally pursue cases that       involve indications of violence, though individual       prosecutors had differing priorities based on public safety       concerns.     Mr. Speaker, I have a brief point to make. I wonder how  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle hold two thoughts in  contradiction simultaneously in their minds. They say that photo IDs  and excessive registration paperwork and whatnot disenfranchises  disproportionately minorities and the poor when they go to exercise  their right to vote. But today with H.R. 8 and the next bill that is  coming up, they are doing exactly that. They are causing there to be  increased fees, increased paperwork, and more photo IDs.   How does that not disenfranchise not just all Americans but  disproportionately minorities and the poor?   Mr. Speaker, I leave that to my colleagues to answer today.
