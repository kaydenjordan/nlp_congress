 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1163.   Our jobs recovery has been hampered by bloated COVID relief benefits  that paid people more not to work, while criminals and fraudsters were  lining their pockets with billions in taxpayer funds from expanded UI  programs.   We are not talking about everyday fraud or administrative error. We  are talking about fraud that was committed with intent, both  domestically and by foreign nation-state actors that, frankly, used  COVID relief to conduct economic warfare against American citizens and  put our national security at risk.  [[Page H2289]]    In my home State of Ohio, it was estimated that $1 billion may have  been paid in fraudulent unemployment from March of 2020 to June of  2022.   Now, my friends on the other side are arguing against this bill and  the administration has just released a Statement of Administration  Policy opposing this bill.   The fact is, the President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget request includes  several of the very same fraud recovery and prevention measures that my  colleagues across the aisle are railing against today. Three of the  proposals in the President's budget are nearly identical:   Allowing States to keep 5 percent of recovered overpayments and  reinvest those dollars in program integrity and fraud prevention;   Matching unemployment claims data against the National Directory of  New Hires to verify when somebody that is receiving unemployment  becomes employed; and   Extending the statute of limitations for criminal charges and civil  actions for prosecuting fraud from 5 to 10 years.   After declaring that ``the watchdogs are back'' in his first State of  the Union, it has taken the President nearly 2 years to finally embrace  the antifraud policies that we Republicans are calling for today.   Were the President to veto this bill, he would be vetoing the very  same policies he endorsed.
