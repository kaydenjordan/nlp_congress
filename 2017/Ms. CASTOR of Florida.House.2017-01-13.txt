 Mr. Chairman, I am compelled to come to the  floor this morning to oppose the Republican attempt to pull the rug out  from under American families.   Why are we going to a repeal bill without a replacement?   It is irresponsible. What you are doing is you are throwing American  families into quicksand. Here is a dirty little secret: this is also a  fiscally irresponsible move because this is likely to balloon the debt  and the deficit.   Now, what I hear from my families back home in Florida is that the  Affordable Care Act has been a godsend to them, and that includes the 9  million families that have private health  [[Page H499]]  insurance. The Affordable Care Act has provided vital consumer  protections to prevent them from being discriminated against for a  preexisting condition or being canceled if they do get sick, and it has  kept premium costs in check.   We also have a lot of Floridians who depend on Medicare; and because  of the ACA, Medicare is stronger. In 2015 alone, the average Medicare  recipient has put about $1,000 back into their pocket because the ACA  closes the doughnut hole.   I urge the House to vote ``no.'' Don't throw American families into  chaos and don't wreak havoc on our economy.
