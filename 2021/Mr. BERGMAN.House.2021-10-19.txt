 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Dr. Daniel Joseph Benishek, or as he was better known to those of us  in Michigan, Dr. Dan.   On Saturday, October 15, after a lifetime of service to the First  District and the State of Michigan, Dr. Dan passed away.  [[Page H5664]]    Through his dedication to his patients and constituents, Dr. Dan  changed the lives of countless Michiganders and was an indispensable  part of our entire community.   From his decades of service as a doctor, to his 6 years fighting for  the First District in Congress, he embodied servant leadership and was  an ally to all our veterans and all who were blessed to call Michigan's  First District home.   Dr. Dan's passing is a significant loss to our State. Those of us who  call Michigan home have each benefited from his life and service and  are grateful for the impacts he made. He did make a difference.   He loved the outdoors like no one you would believe, and he loved to  tell the stories of how his cabin was completely off the grid and that  he ate what he caught or hunted. He was a man truly of the Upper  Peninsula.   We all send our deepest condolences to his dear wife, Judy, and the  entire Benishek family and all of Team Benishek.   Please join me in a moment of silence to honor the memory of  Congressman Dr. Dan Benishek.                            ____________________
