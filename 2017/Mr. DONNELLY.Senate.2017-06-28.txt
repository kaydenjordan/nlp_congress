 Mr. President, for all of the discussion about delays,  politics, the process, vote counts, budget scores and analysis, it is  critical we remember that this healthcare debate is first and foremost  about people, our friends and neighbors, and their families. It is  about moms and dads, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, grandmas  and grandpas.   We all agree everyone needs access to quality, affordable healthcare.  Regardless of how healthy you are today, everyone needs the peace of  mind that if they get sick, they will be able to get the care they  need. We all know someone who has fought cancer, diabetes, multiple  sclerosis, or has a child battling a chronic condition or disease.   In our shared experiences and relationships are shared values. Each  of us wants our loved ones to be healthy and to live long, full, happy  lives. We want what is in the best interests of our families, our  friends, and our neighbors.   I have seen these values firsthand through the stories of Hoosiers  who recently wrote to me out of desperate concern about the Senate  healthcare bill. I have heard from everyone--from working parents to  students, to seniors--that access to quality and affordable healthcare  is critical to their ability to raise a healthy family, to contribute  to our communities, and to live our final years in dignity.   Take Conor, who is a lawyer, and Sarah, a nurse practitioner, and  their family in Fort Wayne, as an example. In 2015, Sarah was diagnosed  with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that attacks the nerves  in her brain and spinal cord. As Conor wrote me, ``Like everyone else  who suffers from MS, my wife didn't make this choice.  [[Page S3811]]  She did not choose this disease . . . sometimes people get sick or are  diagnosed with chronic conditions through no fault of their own.''   If untreated, she would become severely disabled, and her condition  would get progressively worse. The best possible outcome for Sarah is  controlling the disease and limiting the spread of the symptoms because  there currently is not any cure.   Conor and Sarah worry that under the Senate healthcare proposal, they  would be subject to annual and lifetime caps, making Sarah's treatment  unaffordable. Through the Senate healthcare bill, States could seek  waivers that would allow them to get rid of essential health benefits  and implement annual and lifetime caps, even for health insurance plans  that people receive through their work, just like Sarah does. For Conor  and Sarah and others who suffer from conditions like MS, the reforms  that prohibit limits on coverage allow them to have the peace of mind  that they can live full lives, despite their disease and their  diagnosis.   It is stories like Sarah's and Conor's that remind us why this is  such an important debate. It is inherently personal. It is about the  health, the well-being, and it is even about the life and death of our  loved ones. It is about not going to the ER just to visit a doctor. It  is about financial security. It is about financial security so our  families aren't one illness or one sickness away from bankruptcy.   Take, for example, Beth and Brad from Plainfield, IN. They are the  proud parents of Kyle. Kyle has special needs, and he relies on  Medicaid, not only for his healthcare but literally to help keep the  family together. Beth recently wrote me:         Kyle is on a home and community-based Medicaid waiver,       which is not mandated. If Medicaid is cut, Kyle and others       like him are in real danger of losing coverage for home       nursing and nutrition among many other things. Without home       nursing, Brad or I will also have to quit working. And       without enough income to pay for it ourselves, we'll be       placed in the horrific situation of either not being able to       give our child what he needs at home, or institutionalizing       our precious boy. We want to care for our son at home. We       want to work and pay for his primary insurance that reduces       the amount of Medicaid money needed. We want the       independence, freedom and responsibility that the minimal       supports through Medicaid allows.    And Lori from Kokomo, IN, wrote to me about her 3-year-old daughter  Savannah:         She has a long list of medical issues. She has had 2 open-      heart surgeries, 8 heart catheterizations, 1 pacemaker       placement, and countless other procedures. Her medical bills,       at 3 years old, are in the millions, and she still will need       more cardiac surgery in the future. Her annual care--just her       medications, appointments with specialists, therapies, etc--      are more than our annual income, despite my husband working 3       jobs. The Senate GOP bill puts her life in grave danger.        Lifetime limits and waiving of Essential Health Benefits       means she will lose her private insurance. Allowing       alteration or waiver of Essential Health Benefits will be       catastrophic for Savannah and others with preexisting or       chronic conditions. I will be forced to look at my child and       say, ``I'm sorry honey, Mommy and Daddy don't have enough       money for your surgery.''    As a dad, the health and well-being of my family is on my mind every  day, and I know that every mom and dad across our country feels the  same way. My faith teaches me that we are all God's children, and every  man, woman, and child should have a shot at being able to live up to  their God-given potential. We will move Heaven and Earth to take care  of our kids. These values are shared across Indiana and across our  entire beloved country.   My faith also teaches me that we all deserve to live with dignity.   Claudia from Muncie wrote to me:         I am a 55-year-old, medically-retired flight paramedic and       RN. My career was cut short when I was diagnosed with ALS--      Lou Gehrig's Disease--in 2005. Without Medicaid and the       waiver I would be institutionalized. Because of the things       Medicaid covers, I am still able to be a mother.        For two decades, I was the person who came to the aid of       others. Please, don't fail me or my family now.    This bill would fail Claudia and millions of others. It would force  Claudia's family and families across the country to pay more, not less,  or to even put critical healthcare out of reach. You don't have to take  my word for it, though.   The American Heart Association calls this bill ``heartless.'' The  Catholic Health Association says the bill is ``devastating.'' The  American Academy of Pediatrics says it ``fails children.'' The American  Cancer Society says the bill could ``greatly harm millions of cancer  patients, survivors, and those at risk for the disease.'' AARP, the  American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and  Catholic Charities oppose this bill.   Here in the Senate, we have been hired by the people we represent to  continue the proud American tradition of leaving our children a country  that is even better than when it was given to us. We owe it to the  people we serve to ensure they have healthcare that is affordable and  accessible.   Ohio's Governor, John Kasich, recently said, when he talked about the  challenges with our healthcare system, that this will never, ever be  solved with a one-party approach. He is right.   In order to strengthen our healthcare system, we would be a lot  better served by working together with a bipartisan effort and with  input from those who provide healthcare every single day--the doctors,  the nurses, the hospitals in urban communities and in rural communities  all across our country. Most importantly, we need to remember the  patients and the caregivers who rely on our healthcare system. We can  do this together, and a big dose of Hoosier common sense would be a  huge part of it.   I yield the floor.
