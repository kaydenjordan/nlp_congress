 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue  that is important for every American. I know the importance of each  vote and understand the difference one vote or six can make. Our  country was founded on the right to vote in fair and free elections and  faith in the election systems that conduct those elections.   Since Iowa implemented new voting laws in 2017, our elections have  seen record turnout and participation.   Right now, the majority is pushing a Federal takeover of elections,  overriding laws in States like Iowa.   The proposed legislation would limit voter ID laws, which are  supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans. It would also  allow politicians to use taxpayer dollars to run political ads; meaning  your money could go to candidates and issues you do not support.   Finally, it would implement a ``one-size-fits-all'' set of  regulations instead  [[Page H82]]  of allowing individual States to establish laws that work for them as  provided in our Constitution.   Voters in each congressional district across the country are best  informed to choose their congressional representation. They do not need  interference from Washington, D.C.   We should be working to pass bipartisan and commonsense voting laws,  not pushing a partisan agenda and playing political games. Let's make  sure that everyone can vote and that every vote counts.                            ____________________
