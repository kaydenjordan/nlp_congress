 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for  yielding.   China will stop at nothing to try and surpass the United States as  the world's greatest superpower, and we have the tools at our disposal  to counter this growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party. But this  nearly $325 billion bill prioritizes liberal Build Back Better and  Green New Deal provisions over real solutions to compete with China.    Mr. Speaker, $8 billion of the so-called America COMPETES Act funds  the United Nations' green climate slush fund, which destroys American  industry, harms American workers, and prevents us from competing with  China on a level playing field. In fact, the U.N. has awarded $100  million from this fund to China.   The House bill leaves out the critical fact that China is our  greatest political foe.   It also fails to mention the word ``genocide'' anywhere in describing  the CCP's systemic human rights abuses against the ethnic Uyghur  population.   Unfortunately, this bill only compounds the damages from the Biden  administration's $40 billion giveaway in no-strings-attached IMF money  to the CCP last spring. This is wrong.
