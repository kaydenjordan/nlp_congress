 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the passage of this  bipartisan public lands package. This broad, sweeping legislation is  important because it includes provisions that will permanently  reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but it will also  designate over 1 million acres of wilderness on Federal lands in States  across the West, including over 300,000 acres in California alone.   The bill also includes the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver  Act, or the WILD Act, a bill I am proud to colead in the House with my  Alaska colleague, Representative   Don Young.   The WILD Act reauthorizes the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program,  as well as the Multinational Species Conservation Funds, which will  include dedicated funds for rhinos, for tigers, for great apes, for  marine turtles, as well as for African and Asian elephants.   The WILD Act will also expand the Marine Turtle Conservation Fund to  include tortoises and freshwater turtles, establishing a new source of  funding for these priority species.   As we all know, over 60 percent of these 330 modern species are now  either threatened, are endangered, or, unfortunately, are now extinct.   The WILD Act will also protect ecosystems and wildlife from invasive  species through the development of strategic plans for reducing  invasive species populations on land or water managed by Federal  agencies.   Finally, the WILD Act also includes a newly created Theodore  Roosevelt Genius Prize, a concept that will encourage innovation in  wildlife conservation, combating wildlife trafficking and poaching,  protecting endangered species, as well as other areas.   The WILD Act, and S. 47 more broadly, will help wildlife and land  conservation efforts in the United States and around the world. I  strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.
