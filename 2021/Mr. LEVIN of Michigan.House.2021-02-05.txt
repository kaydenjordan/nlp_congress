 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 85,  I call up the bill (H.R. 447) to amend the Act of August 16, 1937  (commonly referred to as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'') and  expand the national apprenticeship system to include apprenticeships,  youth apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship registered under such  Act, to promote the furtherance of labor standards necessary to  safeguard the welfare of apprentices, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 447, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 447, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant and lasting hardship for  our Nation's workers. Millions of people are still without work, and at  least 7 million of the jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic will not  come back. During this historic economic downturn, we must use every  tool we have to help workers find jobs and prepare them for high- quality jobs and employment opportunities of the future.   The most successful of these tools that we have, without question, is  our registered apprenticeship system. Each year, hundreds of thousands  of workers count on registered apprenticeships to learn in-demand  skills, earn wages that grow along with those skills, and receive  nationally recognized credentials that lead to rewarding careers.  Registered apprenticeships are so successful that 94 percent of  apprentices are employed upon completion and they earn an average  starting wage of more than $70,000 a year.   Yet Congress has not reauthorized the National Apprenticeship Act  since it was first passed as part of the New Deal in 1937. Simply put,  we have left our Nation's very best workforce development initiative  underresourced at a time when we need it most.   In response, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 invests $3.5  billion in our national apprenticeship system; ensures consistency and  quality across apprenticeship programs; increases opportunities for  diverse groups of workers who have not traditionally been included in  the apprenticeship system; and expands registered apprenticeships in  emerging sectors, such as healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and  technology.   This investment alone will create an additional 1 million  apprenticeship opportunities--I am so excited to say that--and it will  yield more than $10 billion in benefits to taxpayers through higher tax  revenue and decreased spending on social safety net programs. There is  no better policy, Mr. Speaker, than helping people get great training  for great jobs.   Construction trades and their industry partners have long proven that  the registered apprenticeship model works. That is why trade groups,  industry associations, labor unions, and other stakeholders supported  both Democrats and Republicans in overwhelmingly voting for this bill  last November. Now we must come together again to pass the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021 so that workers across the country and  across industries can benefit from registered apprenticeship  opportunities.   Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not recognize Representative Pocan  of Wisconsin, who sponsored the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to  Rebuild National Skills Act, or the LEARNS Act; and Representative  Bonamici of Oregon, who authored the PARTNERS Act; and former  Representative, our dear colleague, Susan Davis of California, who  shepherded this bill in the 116th Congress, for all of their  significant contributions to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Jerry Nadler for the courtesy of  providing for discharge of the portion of the bill within the  jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                        House of Representatives,                                     Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, February 1, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: This is to advise you that we have now       had an opportunity to review the provisions in H.R. 447, the       ``National Apprenticeship Act of 2021,'' that fall within our       Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on       those provisions. We have no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 447, with the understanding that we do not thereby waive       any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions or       their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Education and Labor, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 1, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: In reference to your letter of       February 1, 2021, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 447, the ``National Apprenticeship Act of       2021.''        I appreciate the Committee on the Judiciary's waiver of       consideration of H.R. 447 as specified in your letter. I       acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite       floor consideration of H.R. 447 and does not in any way waive       or diminish the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdictional       interests over this or similar legislation.        I would be pleased to include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill to memorialize our joint       understanding.        Again, thank you for your assistance with this matter.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), who is a member of the  Committee on Education and Labor and a person whose life embodies the  value of apprenticeships not just to our industries, but to our Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), a hardworking member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor, and a scholar of the history of apprenticeship in  this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Trone), a colleague who knows a little bit about how  to help business in this country.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I look forward to discussing with  my colleague a program that allows workers to unionize in the United  States as freely as they do in Europe, and we achieve the same level of  unionization those countries with larger numbers of apprenticeships  have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams), a member of the Committee on Education and Labor and the  chairwoman of the Subcommittee for Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), a member of the  Committee on Education and Labor and my esteemed colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), another colleague with direct  experience of the value of registered apprenticeships to our companies  and our workers, and a member of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Suozzi), co-chair of the Labor Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a dynamic member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that the  grants in Title II do not have mandatory partners. They require  partners to the extent practicable in a given situation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Mrvan), a member of the Committee on Education and Labor, and a new  champion  [[Page H416]]  for workers in this House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jones), another new and valued member on the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning), another new member of  the Committee on Education and Labor and a native Michigander.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who has been fighting for workers  and small businesses in this House for decades.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a champion of the economic  development of workers and of businesses at the local, State, and  national level.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, as I have listened to the debate  back and forth, I feel like it hasn't covered much of what is so  exciting about this bill.   When I was the chief workforce officer of the State of Michigan, it  was during the implosion of the auto industry and then the Great  Recession. Michigan had the highest unemployment rate of any State for  49 consecutive months. It was in that difficult circumstance that I had  to try to help Michigan workers train and get new skills for new  opportunities.   There was a Senator from Illinois around that time; his name was  Barack Obama. And he got a piece of legislation passed that said that  States could use half a percent of their SAFETEA-LU money, their money  for highway construction, to help train the workforce of the future,  more women, more people of color, more poor people.   So, I worked with the apprenticeship directors of the highway  industry, with people advocating for more opportunities for people of  color, and we created pre-apprenticeship programs that helped new  people get apprenticeships and a road to the middle class in this  country by building our roads.   Mr. Speaker, the point is, we had to do that on our own. The  registered apprenticeship system didn't offer us guidance. It certainly  didn't offer us funding. This bill does so much to modernize and open  up our apprenticeship system.   It facilitates pre-apprenticeship programs. It facilitates youth  apprenticeship programs. It specifically encourages innovation and the  birthing of new apprenticeship programs in a wide array of new  industries. Mr. Speaker, despite the rhetoric, it is quite bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I thank some Representatives who have done a lot to help  bring this bill to fruition, including Representatives Norcross, Brian  Fitzpatrick, Suzanne Bonamici,   David McKinley, and   Don Bacon, all  of whom have provided critical leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 85, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc  amendment  [[Page H422]]  No. 1, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   These amendments will add ``ethnicity'' alongside race and gender to  the definition of ``nontraditional apprenticeship population'';   Expand outreach to title I schools and Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families programs to promote awareness of apprenticeship opportunities;   Clarify State plans' inclusion of nontraditional apprenticeship  industries and occupations;   Add childcare to the range of transition assistance options included  for formerly incarcerated people in apprenticeships;   Add ``media and entertainment'' and ``early childhood, elementary,  and secondary education'' to the list of nontraditional apprenticeship  industries eligible for support;   Make Job Corps Centers eligible for funding to run apprenticeship  programs;   Ensure that States facilitate the exchange of best practices between  grant participants;   And clarify the type of national, regional, and industry  intermediaries eligible for intermediary grants.   Mr. Speaker, these amendments make meaningful improvements to the  bill, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms.  Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Ms. Bush), my new colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my esteemed colleague.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H424]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina for continuing  to educate me on the process of the House as I learn.   I am reminded by Representative Bush's amendment of my experience  attending graduations from pre-apprenticeship programs and seeing whole  families turn out, seeing people turn out with their children to  celebrate the graduation from a pre-apprenticeship program that allows  people, returning citizens, people with disabilities, people who have  been excluded from economic opportunity before, to get into an  apprenticeship that can transform their lives, that can rocket them  into a middle-class life with a great wage and great benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support these en bloc amendments, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 85, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendments en bloc No. 2. These  amendments will add the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention in the Department of Justice as an agency the Office of  Apprenticeship shall coordinate with to ensure alignment of  apprenticeship programs and mentorship programs for individuals who are  exiting the juvenile justice system.   They will add agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, computer  science, environmental protection and conservation, and hospitality and  tourism to the list of nontraditional apprenticeship industries and  occupations supported by this bill.   They will add opportunities to partner with veterans service  organizations throughout the bill, increase flexibility and innovation  by allowing demonstration projects in the national apprenticeship  system, and direct the Office of Apprenticeship to cooperate with the  Department of Justice and State departments of corrections to promote  access to apprenticeship programs for individuals in correctional  institutions and to assist returning citizens to transition into  apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bloc of amendments, the  majority of which are bipartisan, that will strengthen this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I would just like to point out something that I also  think has not been emphasized enough in this discussion, which is how  cost-effective this bill is--these amendments only make it more so--and  how it will improve the fiscal situation of the United States.   We will have more tax revenue when more workers earn more money and  get more good jobs. We will have less people who need public  assistance. This bill not only provides tremendous opportunities for  American workers to earn and learn and avoid debt while they are  getting their credentials to get great jobs, but also really it is a  very prudent and wise investment on behalf of the American taxpayers.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 85, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 3.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendments en bloc No. 3.   These amendments will ensure the availability of user-friendly  materials, including materials in diverse languages, as part of the  outreach required by this bill.   They will add a representative of the Federal Communications  Commission as an ex officio member of the National Advisory Committee  on Apprenticeships.   They will strengthen States' efforts to ensure that low-income  individuals have equal access to apprenticeships.   They will clarify the inclusion of renewable energy in the list of  nontraditional apprenticeship industries and occupations supported in  this bill.   They will promote access to grants made under this bill for minority- , veteran-, and women-owned businesses.   They will increase support for apprenticeship hubs and workforce  development organizations that support nontraditional populations and  dislocated workers.   They will increase the ability of pre-apprenticeship programs to  offer stipends to participants.   And they will encourage employers to participate in apprenticeship  programs that target individuals with language barriers.   Again, Madam Speaker, just reading the list of these wonderful  amendments offered by our colleagues shows the spirit of innovation and  outreach that this bill represents. I urge you to support this bloc of  amendments that will strengthen the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Strickland).    Madam Speaker, the tired rhetoric about big  labor, big labor, big labor, the organizations that workers create and  pay for themselves to advocate their interests; yes, there is a lot of  support for this bill from the labor movement.   This bill is also endorsed by our mayors, by the National League of  Cities. It is also endorsed by our community colleges, their national  associations. It is also endorsed by multiple industry associations,  including associations representing areas that don't have a lot of  apprenticeships that hope to have more. And it is endorsed by many  equity organizations such as the National Urban League.   I also want to point out something else. No company or group of  companies has to register their program. They are perfectly free, in  this land of the free, to set up a training program, to pay for it  themselves, to partner with labor organizations or colleges, to  [[Page H428]]  even use the word apprenticeship. Nobody has to register their  apprenticeship. They are free to do whatever they want.   This is about the Federal Government developing and nurturing  training programs that we can proudly say meet high standards to give  real opportunities to preserve these kinds of statistics we are talking  about: People who complete an apprenticeship earning an average of  $70,000 a year; 94 percent of people who complete apprenticeships  getting good jobs.   Also, some of my colleagues keep saying that all registered  apprenticeships are controlled by the Federal Government. That is  simply not true. Half of the States have State apprenticeship agencies,  including the great State of North Carolina.   In this bill, we codify their important and autonomous role and, for  the first time ever, we provide annual funding because States have been  so successful at expanding apprenticeships through Department of Labor  grants.   Again, for the first time, we streamline the registration process and  create an in-the-box apprenticeship program to make it easier for small  and medium-sized businesses to get in this game.   Madam Speaker, this bill is such a wonderful improvement on an  already wonderful job training program. I urge everyone to support  these en bloc amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This amendment changes the word ``and'' to ``or,'' as my colleague  from Arkansas pointed out, and it may seem like a small change. But,  instead, it inadvertently could take away the employers' seat at the  table for apprenticeship grant partnerships. Let me explain why.   Although my Republican colleague likely introduced this amendment to  ensure that apprenticeship grantees do not have to partner with labor  unions, the unintended consequence of this amendment is that it also  ensures that applicants would not have to partner with an industry or  sector partnership at the expense of only partnering with a union.   Those in support of this amendment may not realize that nothing about  this amendment prevents partnerships with labor organizations as  industry or sector partnerships, as defined in the Workforce Innovation  and Opportunity Act, or WIOA, require three key stakeholders:  Representatives of multiple businesses or employers, including small  and medium-sized employers, labor representatives, and education or  training programs.   Any way you slice it, this amendment does not actually meet the  Republican goal of attacking labor unions but, instead, attacks small  and medium-sized employers that could be part of these grant programs.   At a time when small and medium-sized businesses across this country  are struggling to get back on their feet, thanks to the mismanagement  of this pandemic by the Trump administration, the last thing we need to  do is take away their ability to benefit fully from the apprenticeship  grants that are part of this bill.   I would urge my colleague to withdraw this shortsighted amendment and  ensure that we are doing everything we can to help small and medium- sized businesses and education partners have a seat at the table for  these apprenticeship grants. And if he does not, I would urge my  colleagues to support small businesses and vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   And finally, let me just say that I think my colleague eloquently  explained the situation where the practicable language was written for.  If  [[Page H429]]  there aren't any unions around you are not going to be able to partner  with unions, and so it is really not a problem.   So this amendment doesn't do what it is intended to do. It is  harmful, and I urge people to oppose it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me just explain a little  more for folks at home who may not be obviously reading all of the  details of this, the many pages of this bill, what we are talking  about.   This is about who is eligible to apply for grants, certain grants  under this bill; and it says that to be eligible to apply for a grant  under this title an eligible entity shall demonstrate a partnership  with two or more of the following, and then it lists quite a number of  different groups that they can partner with, State and local workforce  development boards, education training providers, State apprenticeship  agencies, Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations, industry partnerships,  Governors, labor organizations, community-based organizations, two or  more, two or more.   And then it says these words: To the extent practicable--a qualified  intermediary; and to the extent practicable, it shall be part of an  industry or sector partnership and partner with a labor or joint labor- management organization.   That is all it says. And the idea of changing that ``and'' to ``or''  would fundamentally change it. It would reduce the level of  collaboration, and it would possibly eliminate the industry or sector  partnership from the grant application or a labor organization.   But since WIOA requires the labor organizations, it is not going to  do what they think it does. It is a bad idea. It is not well crafted. I  urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1130     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, first, I include in the Record  a letter from the Manufacturing Institute in support of the bill.                                         Manufacturing Institute,                                                   February 2, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman of Ed & Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Representative Fitzpatrick: On       behalf of The Manufacturing Institute (MI), the workforce       development and education partner of the National Association       of Manufacturers, I am writing to express our support of H.R.       477, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.        Manufacturers' top challenge continues to be the ability to       attract and retain a qualified workforce, as noted in the       NAM's Quarterly Manufacturers Outlook Survey. At the end of       2020, there were nearly 500,000 open jobs in manufacturing.       The current health crisis in our country has left millions       without jobs and exacerbated the need for individuals to       receive training for the careers that are available now and       in the future.        Registered Apprenticeship programs are one tool that can be       utilized to support the  [[Page H440]]       business community in closing the skills gap and helping       individuals enter a rewarding career. The National       Apprenticeship Act of 2021, in addition to Congresswoman       Slotkin's (D-Ml-8) amendment, addresses many of the       challenges that manufacturers have long experienced in the       Registered Apprenticeship system by streamlining the       registration and approval process and providing a more direct       means of support for the companies and education partners       that wish to create or expand Registered Apprenticeship       programs.        The National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 improves an       established model of training and work-based learning that       can help to close the skills gap that manufacturers face. We       appreciate the bi-partisan agreement that has been reached on       this bill and we support its passage.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                       Carolyn Lee,                                                Executive Director.     Madam Speaker, this amendment undermines the  core premises behind the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which  would create 1 million more registered apprenticeship, pre- apprenticeship, and youth apprenticeship opportunities over the next 5  years.   Registered apprenticeships represent a proven earn-and-learn program.  Ninety-four percent of those who complete their apprenticeships are  employed upon completion, and they have an average starting salary of  $70,000.   This substitute amendment is nothing less than an attack on the  successful registered apprenticeship system. It makes deep cuts to  funding in H.R. 447, which will result in sparse growth in new  registered apprenticeships, while diverting scarce funds to untested  and unproven programs run by third parties.   Instead, it gives the Secretary of Labor and State apprenticeship  agencies open-ended authority to waive the quality and accountability  standards in this act. Authorizing funding for a program without  guardrails is not an approach Congress should be taking when working  with the executive branch of either party.   Allow me to address the specifics of the substitute amendment.   First, it allows the Secretary of Labor to divert funds for unproven  and untested programs, like the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship  Programs, or IRAPs, created under the Trump administration. Unlike  registered apprenticeships, there has been no evaluation of  unregistered programs like IRAPs--none. When DOL proposed the creation  of IRAPs, it received over 300,000 comments in opposition.   Congress should not be opening the spigots of taxpayer money for  programs that lack broad public support, especially when there is no  evidence that programs that do not meet registered apprenticeship  standards are effective at all. This is an irresponsible use of  taxpayer money.   Democrats are, in fact, leading on innovation. For example, an  amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas),  which was included in the en bloc amendments, allows the Secretary of  Labor to fund innovation in apprenticeships by allowing demonstration  projects in nontraditional sectors, subject to the recommendation of  the National Advisory Committee on Apprenticeships appointed by the  Secretary. These projects could even help with the COVID-19 response.   Second, the substitute amendment slashes funding for apprenticeship  grants from $3.5 billion to $1.1 billion over the next 5 years. It cuts  State apprenticeship formula grants from $475 million to $385 million  over 5 years. States have asked us for funding certainty so they can  scale up their apprenticeship efforts and have been documented to be an  engine of success for the growth of apprenticeships.   This cut is a 77 percent reduction in total funding, resulting in  only 219,000 new apprenticeship opportunities. This is an easy choice:  219,000 apprenticeship opportunities versus nearly 1 million  apprenticeship opportunities that the National Apprenticeship Act of  2021 provides.   We all agree that apprenticeships are a pathway to the middle class,  so why would we want to eliminate the rungs of opportunity for hundreds  of thousands of apprentices?   Third, this amendment eliminates the interagency agreement with the  Department of Education to create stronger alignment between the  education system and the national apprenticeship system. My colleagues  on the other side of the aisle often talk about wanting to create  pathways for students to pursue alternatives to a 4-year degree, but  this amendment eliminates provisions of the National Apprenticeship Act  that do that in a way that is sought by our institutions of higher  education.   As I mentioned earlier, our community colleges strongly support the  act as it is. Some say we are creating a one-size-fits-all approach  with this bill, but that isn't true either. We include new  apprenticeship models, such as competency-based and hybrid options, and  expand youth apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, something  employers have consistently requested.   This amendment is a step in the wrong direction. At a time when at  least 7 million people have permanently lost their jobs due to the  mishandling of the pandemic, and when the economy is facing a deep  recession, the underlying bill is focused on getting people back to  work with the best skills possible.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
