 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate will continue fulfilling  its constitutional duty to confirm the President's highly qualified  judicial nominees.   This afternoon, we will vote to confirm the 76th Federal judge since  the beginning of President Biden's term, Roopali Desai, nominated to  serve as a circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit.   Not long ago, a nominee like Ms. Desai would have been rarely seen in  the Senate. But under President Biden, the Senate is confirming more  and more nominees who break away from that norm. Over 75 percent of  President Biden's nominees are women and nearly half are women are  color. Let's not forget the bench. People say: Why shouldn't it be the  same percentage of the population? That is what we are trying to get  to, but we are way behind and putting more women and people of color on  the bench gets those percentages a little closer to the American norm,  but we have a ways to go.   Moreover, Ms. Desai will make history as the first South Asian judge  to serve on the Ninth Circuit and only the fifth AAPI woman ever to sit  on the Federal Circuit Court.   Ms. Desai's resume leaves no doubt she merits confirmation: a  graduate of Arizona School of Law; a clerk for Judge Mary Schroeder,  the first woman to ever serve as a Ninth Circuit chief judge. She has  excelled in every step of her legal career. She is one of Arizona's top  election lawyers, having played a crucial role in protecting her  State's elections in 2020. She has fought for everyone from children in  foster care to children in public schools during the pandemic.   As my Arizona colleagues Senator Sinema and Senator Kelly will attest  to, Ms. Desai is deeply respected by all corners of Arizona's legal  community and will make an excellent judge when we confirm her later  today.                            Senate Accomplishments    Mr. President, Senate Democrats are getting things done. This has  been one of the most productive stretches the Senate has seen in recent  times.   In the past few months, we have seen an amazing string of  achievements passed through this Chamber in extremely fast succession:  the first major gun safety bill in 30 years, the largest investment in  American manufacturing and science in a generation, the largest expanse  of veterans' benefits in decades. And just last night, we strengthened  NATO by approving the accession of Sweden and Finland, sending Russia a  signal that they cannot intimidate America or Europe. Gun safety,  CHIPS, PACT, NATO--getting any one of these accomplishments done is a  significant feat for the Senate. The fact is, we have done them all  since Memorial Day, and that is quite remarkable.   This doesn't even include a once-in-a-generation infrastructure bill,  a historic rescue package to vaccinate the Nation and lift America out  of the pandemic, and the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the  first Black woman to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I always said that when the opportunity arises, Democrats would be  ready to work with our Republican colleagues on important legislation,  and many of the accomplishments I have listed are examples of just  that. But when we must, Democrats have also made clear we are ready to  go at it alone to deliver big things that the American people sent us  here to work on, like fighting inflation and lowering healthcare and  prescription drug costs; like holding drug companies accountable and  making Big Business play by the rules, the same rules as everyone else;  like passing historic investments in clean energy to create millions of  good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for American families.                       Inflation Reduction Act of 2022    Mr. President, Democrats are going to deliver on all these things and  more when we pass the Inflation Reduction Act in coming days.   Let me talk a little bit about the Inflation Reduction Act. Soon the  Senate will vote on this groundbreaking legislation. I expect we will  have some late nights and extended debates here on the floor. But in  the end, we are going to make good on our word to pass the Inflation  Reduction Act.   For years, many in Washington have promised to tackle some of the  biggest challenges facing our Nation only to fall short. But with the  Inflation Reduction Act, Senate Democrats will finally hold drug  companies accountable and make prescription drugs cheaper.   Senate Democrats will lower energy costs while passing the largest  investment in clean energy ever. Our clean energy proposals will reduce  air pollution, prevent thousands of needless deaths each year, and  reduce asthma attacks by about 100,000 per year. We have all seen kids,  often in poor neighborhoods, struggling with asthma because they have  so much pollution put in their areas by transportation and factories  and whatever. Reducing that by 100,000 a year is amazing.   Senate Democrats will also close tax loopholes and reduce the  deficits and will ensure that no small business or family under  $400,000 a year will see their taxes go up. Leader McConnell, himself,  conceded yesterday that our proposal ``includes no new tax rate  increases, that's true.'' Those are McConnell's words: ``includes no  new tax rate increases, that's true.'' Let me repeat that again. Leader  McConnell concedes that now the Inflation Reduction Act includes no new  tax rate increases.   The American people overwhelmingly support these steps. A recent poll  by the well-respected Navigator shows 65 percent of Americans approve  of our plan to reduce drug prices, keep premiums low, and invest in  clean energy. A Morning Consult poll found that over 70 percent of  Americans--over 70 percent--support letting Medicare negotiate  prescription drug prices, which our plan will do. Another group, Data  for Progress, found the Inflation Reduction Act has a net approval of  51 points--51 points--wow.    It is not hard to understand why Americans feel this way. Democrats'  agenda prioritizes them. We prioritize the middle class and working  families instead of those at the very top. God bless them; they are  doing fine.   But when Senate Republicans had the majority, they tried to rip  healthcare away from millions of Americans and blew a $2 trillion hole  in our deficit in order to soak the ultrarich with massive tax cuts.   Just this week, one Republican called for ending the days that  Medicare and Social Security are guaranteed by turning them into  discretionary spending. Do you know what that means when we make things  discretionary? Do we want to tell our senior citizens that your Social  Security, which you paid into, was discretionary? That is what Senator  Johnson from Wisconsin wants to do. That is so wrong. But,  unfortunately, it represents a lot of the views of lots of Republicans  who don't want to say it publicly because they know it is so unpopular.   Back in February--listen to this one--the chair of the Republican  Senate Campaign Arm, the junior Senator from Florida, released a  platform for raising taxes not on the wealthy but on millions of low- income Americans. You can't make this stuff up.  [[Page S4006]]    They want to make your Social Security discretionary but then want to  raise your taxes. What kind of bull is that?   Just listen to this tsunami of disastrous proposals: taking away  people's healthcare, tax cuts for the rich, putting Medicare and Social  Security on the chopping block, raising taxes on working Americans.  These are just some of the things that Senate Republicans have openly  called for recently.   Democrats' agenda is something entirely different. The Inflation  Reduction Act will lower inflation, lower the cost of prescription  drugs, close loopholes long exploited by Big Business that pays no or  little taxes. That is what the Inflation Reduction Act is at its core.   It is what the American people want; it is what the country so  desperately needs; and it is what Democrats will deliver on in the  coming days.   I yield the floor.
