 Mr. Speaker, during this week of the State of the Union  Address, I rise today to recognize the lifetime of work of Sue  Daugherty, a champion for seniors across Ohio.   Sue and I are cheering the 8.7 percent cost of living increase for  seniors under Social Security and a cap on insulin costs for seniors at  $35 per month.   Sue serves as the founding executive director of Serving Our Seniors,  a nonprofit organization located in Sandusky, Ohio, that supports Erie  County seniors as they progress in life.   Ms. Daugherty's passion for gerontology was born out of her  experience as a nursing assistant in the summer following her freshman  year at Ohio University. She went on to receive her bachelor's degree  from Ohio University and earned her master of public administration  from Cleveland State University.   Sue has utilized her knowledge and experience to create an excellent  and friendly network for aging Ohioans to receive better treatment and  resources as they age. She helped establish a system for seniors to  seek proactive care instead of reactive care.   Ms. Daugherty has received nearly a dozen community service awards of  excellence throughout her career, including the 2002 Acts of Caring  Award from the National Association of Counties.   I am honored to honor her lifetime of achievement and her work.  Today, all of America salutes Ohioan Sue Daugherty. I thank her so much  for her service to America.                            ____________________
