 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Foxx for her comments,  and I will share a tip because I am a former small business owner. So,  there is this great thing called communication. You can chat with one  another and talk about some of their rights, so I recommend it for all  that ask.   Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the millions of women in the  workforce that to this day are still only making 82 cents on every  dollar. My amazing colleagues have identified lots of stats that are  very, very convincing with strong data.   I ask today that everyone consider the 15 to 20 percent of the female  workforce who have either paused or stopped their careers--or ruined  their careers, which many would say--because of the pandemic. It has  been devastating, as we all know.   The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by making it harder for employers to pay women  less than men for the same work.   When woman return to the workforce, and I pray that they do, we must  ensure that they are aware of their rights under legislation--verbally,  electronically, by any means; it all works--which is why I have  introduced an amendment that requires employers to display a poster in  their workplace or their employment worksite, or by email, or whatever  they can do, so workers clearly understand that they have rights under  this act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment and this  legislation so we can ensure equal work means equal pay.
