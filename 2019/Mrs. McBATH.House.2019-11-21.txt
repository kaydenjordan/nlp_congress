 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 5041, the  Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act.   Too many Americans have been injured and too many families have been  torn apart by domestic violence. One in four women and one in nine men  will experience some form of domestic violence in their lifetime.  Victims and survivors span all races, backgrounds, genders, and income  levels.   Domestic violence is not just a women's issue. That is why I am proud  to have introduced FVPSA, with Representatives Gwen Moore,   Tom Cole,  and   John Katko.   Though there are centers around the country doing incredible work,  too many people still are turned away each day due to lack of  resources. Our bill will provide adequate resources for prevention and  treatment services.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital bill. Together, we  fight for the people, help survivors of domestic violence, and prevent  such tragedies in the future.                            ____________________
