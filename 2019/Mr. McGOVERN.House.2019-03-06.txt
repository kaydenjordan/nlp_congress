 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to advocate for the  Federal nutrition programs that help our most vulnerable constituents  and to highlight why these programs continue to need our unwavering  protection and attention.   March 4 marked the beginning of National School Breakfast Week, which  is designed to show parents, students, and school officials the  benefits of fueling up for the day with a healthy school breakfast.   I am sure it comes as no surprise to many of you that learning  improves when students are not hungry. It is awfully hard to  concentrate when you don't have any fuel in your body.   Last week, I met with several anti-hunger organizations from my  district, and they shared with me stories from the people they serve on  how nutrition programs, food pantries, and school breakfast and lunch  programs impact their lives.   Many of them wrote their thoughts on paper plates, and I would like  to read a few of them to you.   Jay Keller from Jeremiah's Inn in Worcester said: ``These food  centers make a huge difference when it comes to preparing meals.  Without them, I would not be able to make ends meet. Please keep them  going. Many people may go hungry if they do not continue.''   A parent from Catholic Charities in Worcester said: ``SNAP and school  lunches help my daughter and I eat. It helps us get by, and I work  part-time. Very grateful for these programs.''   Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, school breakfasts and lunches are the only  opportunities a child has to receive a full meal. For example, a  student from Memorial Elementary School in Winchendon said: ``School  lunch is important because it keeps me full until I go home.'' Another  student from Pernet Family Health Services in Worcester wrote: ``If I  don't eat, my head hurts.''   While many nutrition program participants are children and persons  with disabilities, their reach extends to veterans. A veteran from St.  Anthony's Parish in Worcester wrote: ``My food bank provides myself and  fellow veterans with love and nutrients. Without you guys, it would be  a long month. Thanks to our nuns who help us always.''   When a family is worried about whether they can afford basic  necessities, nutrition programs and the food security they provide goes  a long way.    In 2018, a monthly average of 40.3 million people participated in the  SNAP program. Despite the fact that this number has been steadily  decreasing, the Trump administration has unveiled several baseless  attacks on these nutrition programs.   On December 20, 2018, the Trump administration proposed a rule that  will threaten the eligibility of SNAP participants who are considered  able-bodied adults without dependents. In an effort to, ironically,  ``restore self-sufficiency through the dignity of work,'' their rule  stigmatizes SNAP participants and limits a State's ability to waive 20- hour work requirements.   The able-bodied adult without dependents population is a complex  group. Many of them are veterans returning from overseas and having a  difficult time reintegrating into our community. Many of them are young  adults who have aged out of the foster care system. Some are ex-felons  who are products of mass incarceration. Some are workers who are not  given 20 hours of work per week.   Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of SNAP participants do work, but often in  jobs that are either unstable or don't pay enough to put food on the  table. It is not that the able-bodied adult without dependents  population is jobless by choice. Many are jobless because they lack  privilege and are trying to get on their feet.   This proposed rule also specifically goes against the will of  Congress by imposing restrictions that were specifically rejected for  inclusion in the farm bill signed into law just last year.   As if that weren't enough, the Trump administration also announced  its intention to propose changes to categorical eligibility.  Categorical eligibility, or Cat-el, is criteria used to determine  whether a family is automatically eligible for SNAP because they  already qualify for certain other low-income programs. Cat-el is fine  as it is because it eliminates redundancy and minimizes hurdles that  low-income families must overcome just to keep up with their basic  needs.   While the administration changes are forthcoming, I don't have much  optimism about how they will turn out.   The current administration is trying to solve problems that don't  exist, and they are creating problems that have clear solutions. That  is why we must  [[Page H2375]]  continue to raise these issues to the forefront of our agenda.   There is no excuse. We have the resources. It is on all of us to  prioritize basic hunger needs. Supporting school breakfast and lunch  programs, and maintaining reasonable eligibility for nutrition  assistance programs, are the least we can do to end hunger now.   We live in the richest country in the history of the world, and we  have millions and millions of people who are hungry. We should all be  ashamed of that.   Hunger and food insecurity are political conditions. We can solve  these problems if we have the political will. I urge my colleagues to  gather that political will.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, in 1997, I stood on this floor and urged action to fix  our broken campaign finance system. I spoke then about how newspapers  were filled with daily stories detailing how unregulated campaign  contributions were corrupting our political system and threatening the  very essence of our democracy. That was my first year serving in this  institution.    I am sorry to say that this problem hasn't only persisted, it has  gotten worse than many of us could have ever imagined.   Who could have thought that the Supreme Court would issue a disaster  ruling like Citizens United? that some would try to have us believe  that corporations are people? that we would have a President in the  White House who has taken the Republican culture of corruption to a  whole new level?   Now, I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker. The news that once made the  front page of the newspaper is now in front of us on our smartphones  nonstop.   We see over and over again how big money has infected our political  process and prevented action on things that the American people care  most about, how new roadblocks are being put in place to prevent some  eligible Americans from casting their ballots, and how some have used  their office to side with special interests over the public interest.   This legislation is about finally fixing our broken democracy,  including modernizing and securing our election system. We care so much  about this that the For the People Act is literally our top priority.  That is why it is H.R. 1.   Now, my Republican friends are talking about process like it is  something  [[Page H2384]]  to be ashamed of. Are they kidding? I mean, these are crocodile tears.  When they were in charge at the last Congress, their priority, their  H.R. 1, was a tax cut for the superrich. Ours is literally a bill for  the people.   And their H.R. 1, by the way, as you can see from this chart, had  zero hearings. None. Our H.R. 1 had five.   Our H.R. 1 had 15 hours of hearings. Do you know how many hours of  hearings their H.R. 1 had? Zero, a big fat zero. No hearings at all.   We had expert witnesses come to testify and give their input, pro and  con. They had none when they did H.R. 1.   Our bill, as we have a structured rule, we have made over 70  amendments in order. When they had their H.R. 1 bill to help the  superrich, do you know how many amendments they made in order? Zero.  None. A big fat closed rule.   The cost of our legislation to kind of cleanup our democracy is zero.  Do you know how much theirs was? At least $1.5 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here is how the legislative process is  supposed to work. And imagine what we could achieve once we get special  interests out of the way, whether it is lowering the cost of  prescription drugs or strengthening our healthcare system or passing  sensible gun safety legislation or protecting the Dreamers.   This is about ensuring that our elections actually reflect the  Constitution my friends on the other side of the aisle so often talk  about. The Preamble does not begin with ``We, the corporations'' or  ``We, the special interests.'' It says, ``We, the People.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join with the majority in  supporting this rule and the underlying legislation so we can finally  put our government back in the hands of the people.    Mr. Speaker, I am confused when I listen to the  gentleman from Illinois when he complains about process. He complains  that we have over 70 amendments in order, as if that were a bad thing.   We think that is a good thing. And when they did their H.R. 1, which  was a big, fat giveaway to big corporate special interests in this  country, they had no amendments. They had no hearings in any  committees.   The House Administration Committee happens to be the main committee  of jurisdiction, and they did a hearing and a markup. So did the other  committees. They all did hearings. I don't understand what the problem  is.   The problem is, you don't like this bill because it undercuts your  stranglehold on the political system where all of the big money,  corporate special interests can basically get their way with the  Republican majority. Enough.   People, whether they are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents,  have had enough of this corrupt political system that my Republican  friends have embraced. We are sick of it. They are sick of it. We are  going to change it and it begins here today with passing H.R. 1.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle: stand  with us, clean up our political system and support H.R. 1.
