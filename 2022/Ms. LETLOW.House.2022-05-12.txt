 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Clarence Fields  of Pineville, Louisiana, who is entering his final weeks in office  after an extraordinary career.   A lifelong resident of Pineville, Mayor Fields has led the city for  nearly 22 years. If you need any indicator of the amazing work he has  done, look no further than the fact that he was reelected to City Hall  six times and was unopposed in his last four elections.   During his time in office, Mayor Fields has been committed to  attracting investment to the community and creating good paying jobs  for residents. He is also known as a bridge builder--working across  racial, political, and geographic lines to deliver results for  Pineville and Rapides Parish. He has been an outstanding public  servant, and our region is better because he chose to share his talents  with the people of his hometown.   The mayor had planned on running again this year but decided to  retire to spend more time with his grandchildren. While I will miss  working with Mayor Fields, I wish him the best in his very well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
