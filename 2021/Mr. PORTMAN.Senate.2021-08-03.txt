 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the provisions of section 80603 for the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included in this amendment  provide clarity to information reporting requirements to improve tax  administration and tax compliance with respect to trading and digital  assets.   Senator Sinema has joined me in asking the nonpartisan Joint  Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical  explanation of section 80603, ``Information Reporting for Brokers and  Digital Assets,'' of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The  technical explanation expresses these Senators' understanding and  legislative intent behind this important legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the technical explanation  of section 80603 from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF SECTION 80603, ``INFORMATION REPORTING FOR  BROKERS AND DIGITAL ASSETS,'' OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS                                    ACT   Prepared by the Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation--August 2021            Information Reporting for Brokers and Digital Assets                                 Present Law       In general        The IRS gathers independent information about income       received and taxes withheld to verify self-reported income       and tax liability reported on tax returns. The use of       reliable and objective third-party verification of income       increases the probability of tax evasion being detected and       increases the cost of evasion to the taxpayer, thereby       decreasing the overall level of tax evasion by taxpayers.       Ample empirical evidence shows that the introduction of       third-party information reporting in tax administration leads       to more accurate reports of income on tax returns.        Information reporting assists taxpayers receiving such       reports to prepare their income tax returns and helps the IRS       determine whether such returns are correct and complete. The       reporting of most relevance to the determination of       individual income tax generally falls under one of two types.       First, there are reports and disclosures required from       taxpayers about themselves. Second, there are reports       required to be reported to the IRS with respect to       transactions with other persons, including employers, known       as third-party information reporting. Third-party information       reporting rules had predecessors in early tax statutes. The       first third-party information reporting requirement in the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, regarding payments       by persons engaged in a trade or business of $600 or more in       the course of the payor's trade or business, is a successor       to an almost identical provision in the 1939 Code, as is the       provision requiring reporting of dividends and corporate       earnings and profits.        Third-party information reporting has expanded       significantly since then, addressing numerous types of       payments. These include reporting with respect to advance       payments of credit for health insurance costs; gross proceeds       paid to an attorney; substitute payments in lieu of dividends       or tax-exempt interest; and payments by a Federal executive       agency for services. Congress continues to expand third-party       information reporting, reflecting the importance of IRS       access to reliable and objective third-party verification of       payments in detecting noncompliance.        Persons required to submit such returns generally must       furnish a statement that includes the information contained       on such return to the person whose information was reported       to the IRS. If a reporter prepares 250 returns or more, the       reporter must do so electronically. The scope of reporting       encompasses brokers of a variety of transactions, including       securities, real estate, and barter transactions, but to       date, no regulations under section 6045 have been issued to       address transactions involving digital assets.      Broker reporting        Section 6045(a) requires brokers to file with the IRS       annual information returns showing the gross proceeds       realized by customers from various sale transactions, when       required by the Secretary to do so. A return must provide       such details regarding gross proceeds realized by customers       from various sale transactions and other information as       required by the Secretary. Brokers are required to furnish to       every customer written statements with the same gross       proceeds information that is included in the returns  [[Page S5703]]       filed with the IRS for that customer. These written       statements are required to be furnished by February 15 of the       year following the calendar year for which the return under       section 6045(a) is required to be filed.        Because gross proceeds constitute income only to the extent       that they exceed the seller's adjusted basis, reliable       recordkeeping of original basis and necessary adjustments are       required. In 2008, the reporting requirements for brokers       were revised to provide that every broker that is required to       file a return under section 6045(a) reporting the gross       proceeds from the sale of a covered security must include in       the return (1) the customer's adjusted basis in the security       and (2) whether any capital gain or loss with respect to the       security is long-term or short-term. Specific rules for       determining a customer's adjusted basis are provided.      Covered securities        A covered security is any specified security acquired on or       after an applicable date if the security was (1) acquired       through a transaction in the account in which the security is       held or (2) transferred to that account from an account in       which the security was a covered security, but only if the       transferee broker received a statement under section 6045A       (described below) with respect to the transfer. Under this       rule, certain securities acquired by gift or inheritance are       not covered securities.        A specified security is any share of stock in a corporation       (including stock of a regulated investment company); any       note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness; any       commodity, or a contract or a derivative with respect to the       commodity, if the Secretary determines that adjusted basis       reporting is appropriate; and any other financial instrument       with respect to which the Secretary determines that adjusted       basis reporting is appropriate.        For stock in a corporation (other than stock for which an       average basis method is permissible under section 1012), the       applicable date of section 6045(g) is January 1, 2011. For       any stock for which an average basis method is permissible       under section 1012, the applicable date is January 1, 2012.       Consequently, the applicable date for certain stock acquired       through a dividend reinvestment plan and for stock in a       regulated investment company is January 1, 2012. A regulated       investment company is permitted to elect to treat as a       covered security any stock in the company acquired before       January 1, 2012. For any specified security other than stock       in a corporation or stock for which an average basis method       is permitted, the applicable date is January 1, 2013, or a       later date determined by the Secretary. Consequently, for a       note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or       for a commodity or a contract or derivative with respect to       the commodity, or for any other financial instrument treated       as a specified security, the applicable date is January 1,       2013, or a later date determined by the Secretary.      Time for providing statements to customers        February 15 of the year following the calendar year       reporting period is the deadline for furnishing certain       written statements to customers, including (1) statements       showing gross proceeds (under section 6045(b)) or substitute       payments (under section 6045(d)) and (2) statements with       respect to reportable items (including, but not limited to,       interest, dividends, and royalties) that are furnished with       consolidated reporting statements (as defined in       regulations). The term ``consolidated reporting statement''       refers to annual account statements that brokerage firms       customarily provide to their customers and that include tax-      related information.        To enable brokers to comply with these requirements,       section 6045A provides for broker-to-broker reporting under       which a broker or applicable person within the scope of       section 6045 that transfers to a broker a security that is a       covered security when held by that transferor broker must       furnish to the transferee broker a written statement that       allows the transferee broker to satisfy the basis and holding       period reporting requirements under section 6045. Section       6045B requires the issuer of a covered security to file a       return describing any organizational action (such as a stock       split or a merger or acquisition) that affects the basis of       the specified security, the quantitative effect on the basis       of that specified security, and any other information       required by the Secretary, and to provide copies of that       return to holders of specified securities and nominees like       brokers.      Penalties for failure to comply with information reporting           requirements        A person who is required to file information returns but       who fails to do so by the due date for the returns, includes       on the returns incorrect information, or files incomplete       returns generally is subject to a penalty of $250 for each       return with respect to which such a failure occurs, up to a       maximum of $3,000,000 in any calendar year, adjusted for       inflation. Similar penalties, also with a $3,000,000       calendar-year maximum, apply to failures to furnish correct       written statements to recipients of payments for which       information reporting is required. Brokers may be subject to       such penalties for failure to file the returns required under       section 6045, or for failure to provide statements to others       as required by section 6045A.      Cash received in trade or business        Section 6050I requires any person engaged in a trade or       business to report any transaction (or two or more related       transactions) in which the person receives more than $10,000       in cash. For this purpose, cash includes foreign currency       and, to the extent provided by the Secretary, any monetary       instrument (whether or not in bearer form) with a face amount       of not more than $10,000. Returns required under section       6050I parallel reports required from merchants and services       providers under the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to file such       returns and failure to provide customers with copies of such       returns are subject to the penalties under sections 6721 and       6722, respectively.      Current guidance on digital assets        Most of the statutory provisions requiring third-party       information reporting predate the advent of digital assets       and none expressly addresses its treatment. In 2014, the IRS       published its first guidance on digital assets in a Notice in       the form of frequently asked questions. The Notice refers to       ``virtual currency,'' defined as property that is ``a digital       representation of value that functions as a medium of       exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value.'' The       Notice further identifies a subset of virtual currency       (``convertible virtual currency'') as the only digital asset       within the scope of the guidance. The Notice defines       convertible virtual currency as virtual currency which has an       equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for       real currency.        The Notice stated that ``a payment made using virtual       currency is subject to information reporting to the same       extent as any other payment made in property.'' The Notice       refers to the need for reporting on a Form 1099-MISC,       Miscellaneous Income, if a payment of fixed and determinable       income is made in the course of a trade or business using       convertible virtual currency with a fair market value of $600       or more. This requirement parallels the requirements under       section 6041 and the regulatory guidance thereunder, which       provide that payments made in property rather than money must       be reported by including the fair market value of the       property paid. As the use of digital assets has developed,       the G-7 Finance ministers have committed to developing common       standards and principles to guide the public policy and       regulatory issues, while recognizing the potential benefits       of the market.                           explanation of provision         The provision amends section 6045(c)(1) so that the       definition of broker expressly includes any person who (for       consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any       service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of       another person. The change clarifies present law to resolve       uncertainty over whether certain market participants are       brokers. The change is not intended to limit the Secretary's       authority to interpret the definition of broker.        In addition, the provision specifies that the definition of       specified security includes a digital asset, which, except as       provided by the Secretary, is defined as any digital       representation of value which is recorded on a       cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar       technology as specified by the Secretary. A digital asset       acquired through a broker on or after January 1, 2023, is a       covered security subject to basis reporting under section       6045(g).        In section 6045A(a), the provision strikes the words ``a       security which is'' which makes clear that broker-to-broker       reporting applies to all transfers of covered securities       within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3), including digital       assets. The provision also adds new section 6045A(d), which       generally applies to transfers by a broker to a person that       is not a broker. Section 6045A(d) requires a broker to file a       return with the IRS for a calendar year, with respect to any       transfer (which is not part of a sale or exchange executed by       the broker) during the calendar year of a covered security       which is a digital asset from an account maintained by the       broker to an account which is not maintained by, or an       address not associated with, a person that the broker knows       or has reason to know is also a broker. The return will be in       such form as determined by the Secretary, showing the       information otherwise required to be furnished with respect       to transfers subject to section 6045A(a).        The reporting requirement in new section 6045A(d) is       limited to transfers that are not otherwise subject to       reporting under section 6045 (because those transactions are       already reported to the IRS, for example, in the case of a       transfer that is part of a sale effectuated by a broker) or       under section 6045A(a) (because those transactions are       already reported to transferee brokers, for example, in the       case of a direct broker-to-broker transfer of a digital       asset). The return required under the provision is added to       the definition of information return for purposes of section       6724 and related failure to file penalties under section       6721.        The provision expands the definition of cash solely for       purposes of section 6050I to include any digital asset (as       defined under amended section 6045(g)(3)). No inference is       intended that digital assets are treated as cash for any       other purpose.        Nothing in the provision or the amendments made by the       provision is to be construed to create any inference, for any       period prior to the effective date of the amendments, with       respect to whether any person is a broker under section       6045(c)(l) or whether any digital asset is property which is       a specified security under section 6045(g)(3)(B).                                effective date         The provision applies to returns required to be filed, and       statements required to be furnished, after December 31, 2023.
