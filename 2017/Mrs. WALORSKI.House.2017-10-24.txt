 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove  Representative Ed Perlmutter as a cosponsor of my bill H.R. 3798. He  was mistakenly added to the legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
