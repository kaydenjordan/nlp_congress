 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  his leadership on this. This Congress is better because of it, and this  Nation is better because of the gentleman's efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to be a voice for the voiceless. There is no  effort more important than our protecting the sanctity of life. As a  true political freshman, new to Congress and new to politics, I was so  proud that the first bill I put my name on was to defund Planned  Parenthood.   Most recently I introduced H.R. 4800, the Pro-LIFE Act. My bill would  close the ``valuable consideration'' loophole by prohibiting the sale  of human fetal issues. These are unborn babies' hearts, livers, bones,  and brains that are used in experiments. I urge my colleagues to please  sign on to my Pro-LIFE Act, H.R. 4800.   May God bless the unborn, and may God have mercy on us all.
