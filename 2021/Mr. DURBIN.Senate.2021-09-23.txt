Mr. President, October 2--9 days from today--is an  important date in the life of one of the bravest people I have ever  met. On October 2, 2005, Army SGT Eric Edmundson was on patrol near the  Iraq-Syria border when a roadside bomb exploded beneath his armored  vehicle.   He survived the blast, but went into cardiac arrest while awaiting  transport to an American military hospital in Germany. Doctors worked  for 30 minutes to restore his pulse. They did, but Sergeant Edmundson  had already suffered severe brain damage from lack of oxygen.   Doctors told his parents that Eric would spend the rest of his life  in a vegetative state and that the best thing they could do for him was  choose a good nursing home. But Eric's family refused to accept that  fate for him. They searched for the best rehabilitation hospital in  America, somewhere where Eric could receive the very best medical care  and make the fullest possible recovery.   The hospital they chose was the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago,  then known by its original name: the Rehabilitation Institute of  Chicago.   I visited him there several times. His family was always there, right  by his side. I will never forget the time Eric's dad told me, ``Eric  has a present for you.'' I couldn't imagine what it was. Then I watched  as that brave soldier stood up from his wheelchair and took several  halting steps. There wasn't a dry eye in the room.   Six months after he arrived, I watched Eric Edmundson, in his Army  dress uniform, walk out of that amazing hospital and into the arms of  his wife and their 2-year-old daughter.   I thought of Eric Edmundson and his miraculous recovery when I  learned earlier this month of the death of Dr. Joanne Smith, a medical  visionary and the longtime president and CEO of Shirley Ryan  AbilityLab. She died at home, with her family at her side, after  battling cancer privately for 5 years. She continued to lead Shirley  Ryan right up to the end.   Loretta and I offer our condolences to her husband of 33 years, Rory  Repicky, their children, Claire and Michael, Joanne's 16 nieces and  nephews, and her family, colleagues, and friends, who are too numerous  to count.   Dr. Joanne Smith was a once-in-a-lifetime leader and a national  treasure. With her brilliance, determination, and compassion, she  reinvented the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. As  president and CEO of Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, she imagined--and then  led the drive to create--the world's first-ever ``translational''  research hospital for rehabilitation medicine. She pioneered the  concept of a cutting-edge research facility within a hospital, with  scientists, innovators, technologists, and clinicians all working  together to heal patients. Seeing her team work miracles with wounded  veterans, injured police officers, or stroke survivors made you a  believer.   Joanne Smith originally planned to be a nurse but changed her major  to pre-med after working as a hospital orderly. A chance meeting during  medical school with a young girl at a free health clinic in Detroit  changed her life--and the future of rehabilitation medicine.   The young girl had had both legs amputated because of spina bifida,  but she had learned to walk using her arms as legs and her hands as  feet. She was happy. But her mother wanted her to have a more  ``normal'' appearance, so doctors fitted her with a sort of harness  that included two prosthetic legs and gave her a wheelchair.   Dr. Smith said it disturbed her to see how a once-happy girl became  sad and less able as a result of a change in her appearance to fit  society's biases and expectations. She would spend the rest of her life  working to discover cures that made patients more able, not less.   She came to Shirley Ryan, then called the Rehabilitation Institute of  Chicago, for her residency in 1988, fresh out of medical school, and  thank goodness, she never left. In 2006, a few years after earning her  MBA from the University of Chicago, she became president and CEO. At  that point, the hospital had been ranked at the No. 1 rehabilitation  hospital in America by U.S. News & World Report for nearly two decades.   If Joanne Smith had done nothing as president and CEO except more of  the same, she would have been at the top of her field. But ``more of  the same'' was not in her makeup. She resolved to create a new model  for rehabilitation hospitals--the research institute within the  hospital--so that new discoveries could reach patients in real time.   The reimagined hospital opened with a new name in 2017. Just  recently, it was ranked as the best rehabilitation hospital in the  Nation for the 31st year in a row, a record unmatched by any hospital.   Physical and rehabilitation medicine is a relatively new field of  medicine. It began after World War II, with doctors and researchers  searching for ways to help injured servicemembers regain as much of  their abilities as possible.   Today, advanced rehabilitation hospitals such as Shirley Ryan  AbilityLab work with children and adults with severe, complex  conditions--from traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, to  amputations or serious birth defects, enabling them to live as fully  and independently as possible. The demand for such medical innovations  is large and growing.   The partnership at Shirley Ryan of brilliant doctors and researchers  working with brave patients has resulted in some breathtaking  discoveries. In 2006, doctors there outfitted a man with a prosthetic  arm that he could move with his thoughts. With his thoughts. That  surgery--the first of its kind in the world--has since helped  revolutionize treatment for people who have lost limbs.   More recently, researchers at Shirley Ryan created the world's first  manual standing wheelchair, that allows users to move while seated or  standing.   Shirley Ryan serves more than 50,000 patients year from nearly every  State and more than 70 countries. It is miraculous, but it is not  alone. There are a handful of rehabilitation innovation centers like it  in America. These are the best of the best, cutting-edge research labs  within world-class hospitals that also prioritize training the next  generation of doctors and healers.   My friend, Senator Cassidy of Louisiana, has seen similar miracles at  TIRR Memorial Hermann, a world-class rehabilitation hospital in  Houston, TX, where many people from Louisiana and around the world go  for advanced treatment.   The discoveries at America's best rehabilitation innovations centers  are revolutionizing medicine, and they are reaching people far beyond  their own walls. But making such discoveries and propelling the field  of rehabilitation medicine forward costs money--more money than these  nonprofit centers can afford on their own.   That is why, today, Senator Cassidy and I are reintroducing our  bipartisan proposal to recognize and support some of America's best  rehabilitation innovation centers. Our bill does two things. First, it  directs the Department of Health and Human Services to set criteria for  such ``rehabilitation innovation centers'' and to share best practices  and teachings from these institutions with health providers throughout  the Nation and the world.   Second, our bill directs HHS to study whether Medicare's existing  payment system is adequate to support the groundbreaking treatment,  research, and medical education that is taking place at these  hospitals.  [[Page S6677]]    When I first introduced this bill in 2013, I had a different  Republican cosponsor, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois. In 2012, Senator  Kirk suffered a stroke that left him partly paralyzed and unable to  walk. A year later, after months of grueling work at R.I.C., he was  able to walk up the 42 steps to this Capitol Building.   In honor of the doctor whose brilliance and compassion helped  transform the field of physical and rehabilitation medicine that led to  the astonishing feat and so many others, Senator Cassidy and I have  agreed to rename our bill the Dr. Joanne Smith Memorial Rehabilitation  Innovation Centers Act.   I will close with this thought from another brave person who helped  to revolutionize rehabilitation medicine. Christopher Reeve was  America's Superman in the movies--until he was paralyzed from the  shoulders down in an equestrian accident in 1995.   During the last decade of his life, he regained limited movement in  his arms and legs. He also spent a great deal of time raising awareness  of and money for the kinds of cutting-edge treatments that are  pioneered at institutions such as Shirley Ryan.   In his last public appearance, he spoke at Shirley Ryan. He said,  ``It gets lonely sometimes to [urge people] `Come on, let's take  reasonable risks. Let's try and be safe--but let's be bold at the same  time.' ''   Christopher Reeve said, ``Doctors should take the word `impossible'  out of their lexicons.''   That courageous, bold optimism--be safe, but be bold at the same  time--is what drove Dr. Joanne Smith and what inspires the work at  America's best rehabilitation centers of innovation. Our bipartisan  bill, we hope, will help advance their work.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printing in the Record.
