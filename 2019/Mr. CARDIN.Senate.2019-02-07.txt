 Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)  Fairness Act of 2019, common sense legislation I am introducing with my  colleague from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen today. This legislation  seeks to eliminate a barrier that potential college students with  difficult personal and financial circumstances face when applying for  Federal financial aid that too often has left them without a path  forward to earning a college education and joining the middle class.   This body has worked to improve the college application process for  students and their families over the last several years and  successfully lobbied the Department of Education to allow students and  their families to submit their FAFSA application in October and utilize  prior prior-year tax data. These changes provide future college  students and their families with several months to submit their  financial information instead of a short time frame between January and  February to meet State and institutional-based deadlines for need- and  merit-based financial aid programs. These steps have made it easier for  students to sit with their families and make informed financial  decisions on which college or university will provide the highest  quality yet least expensive college education.   Despite our work, a number of our students are being left behind and  cannot take advantage of these changes. Many of these students face  difficult personal and financial situations. For instance, some have  left home due to abusive family environments; others may have parents  who are incarcerated. Still others may be unable to locate their  parents. All of the students in these circumstances are unable to fill  out the FAFSA application. Rather than fill out one universal Federal  financial aid application form, a potential college student must  contact each institution she or he is applying to and undergo a  ``dependency override'' process before a college or university will put  together an estimated financial aid package for the student. Under this  process, a student applying to one university in my State of Maryland,  for instance, must submit nine different pieces of financial  information, a personal statement, and references to verify their  independent status. These students, often first generation students  unfamiliar with the process for applying to school, may give up on the  dependency override process and fail to finish the college application  process or leave significant Federal financial aid on the table.   Mr. President, I think it is unfair that we place additional burdens  on these students. We should not make opening the door to a brighter  future harder than it is already. In Maryland, we know that access to a  high-quality, yet affordable, education is the key to success and  increasingly required for entry into the middle class. Regardless of a  student's background or the circumstances that he or she has fought to  overcome, it is my belief that this Congress should work to ensure  maximum access to higher education.   The FAFSA Fairness Act would seek to correct this inequity for some  of our most vulnerable students. If enacted, my legislation would allow  students in these difficult personal and financial circumstances to  fill out a FAFSA form as a ``provisional independent'' student and  receive a provisional determination of their Federal financial aid  award from the Department of Education. The colleges that the student  applies to would receive notification of the student's special  circumstances and conduct outreach to inform the student of the process  for completing a dependency override. After a student has completed the  dependency override form, the school would provide the student with a  final financial aid award package that includes Federal, State, and  institutional need- and merit-based aid so the student could bargain  shop for the best financial aid award package between multiple schools.  After such students have been admitted to college, this legislation  would allow them to remain focused on their classwork instead of annual  recertification of their independent status by maintaining the  dependency override decision for as long as they remain in school or if  the university is made aware of new information about their status. My  legislation would provide students with a pathway to complete the  FAFSA, one of the first steps towards applying to college and obtaining  a foothold in the middle class. It also provides students with an  opportunity to identify the colleges and universities that match up the  best with their financial situation and educational goals.   I am proud to lead this Senate effort with my colleague from Maryland  and appreciate the work of our delegation, especially U.S.  Representatives Elijah E. Cummings, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, and John  P. Sarbanes, who are introducing a companion bill in the U.S. House of  Representatives. I urge my Senate colleagues to join in this effort to  help some of our most vulnerable and disadvantaged students achieve  their dream of higher education despite their difficult family and  financial circumstances.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 416         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
