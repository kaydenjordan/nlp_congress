 Madam Speaker, instead of this laser focus on  impeachment, we should be doing the people's work and passing a bill to  help many Americans across this country who live in rural areas. My  bipartisan Rural Health Care Access Act, H.R. 2990, would do just that.   Between January 1, 2010, and March 19, 2019, 102 rural hospitals  closed in America. We are facing a crisis for rural America. These  closures are increasing almost every year.   While so many of our senior citizens must utilize Medicare, Medicare  is not reimbursing all hospitals in rural areas at a sustainable rate.  We need to designate all our rural hospitals as Critical Access  Hospitals.   Currently, this designation does not apply to those hospitals in  rural areas that are slightly less than 35 miles from another hospital.  My bill would get rid of this distance requirement, while maintaining  all other requirements. It would help stave off the rapid decline of  healthcare and protect vital jobs in rural communities.   I urge the Speaker to give my bill a chance.                            ____________________
