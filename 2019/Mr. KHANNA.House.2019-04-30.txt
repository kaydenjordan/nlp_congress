 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the sad story of Daniel  Desnoyers, who took his own life because he did not have the money to  buy the basic drugs that he needed for his mental health issues.   Daniel Desnoyers was a young man who struggled with depression and  psychosis, mental health issues that show no physical symptoms but take  a deep psychological toll on those whom they afflict.   Daniel did the right thing. He purchased health insurance through the  New York health insurance marketplace from Fidelis, a subsidiary of  massive international conglomerate Centene Corporation.   In March, Daniel went to the pharmacy to refill his prescription for  risperidone, an antipsychotic medication that he needed. He was  informed by the pharmacy that he no longer had health insurance and the  1-month refill would cost him $250.   Now, to some people, $250 may not seem like a lot of money, but to  Daniel it was. According to a 2018 study by the Federal Reserve, 40  percent of Americans would not be able to cover an unexpected $400  expense. Daniel, unfortunately, was one of them.   So he did not buy the medicine, and he began to ration his  antipsychotic medicine, taking it every other day until he could get  his insurance back. He contacted his provider, Fidelis, at the  beginning of April when he learned that they had canceled his plan  because he missed a $20 payment.   Fidelis didn't immediately reinstate the plan. Instead, the company  informed him that his coverage would not resume until May 1. This meant  another month without a refill of his prescription, another month  without the medicine Daniel needed to function. His ration of medicine  had run out.   On April 9, filled with thoughts of suicide--a listed side effect for  antipsychotic drug withdrawal--Daniel superglued his seatbelt shut,  posted a farewell message on Facebook, and drove his truck into the  river, ending his life.   Daniel Desnoyers died at the age of 29 because he was late paying $20  to a corporation that pulled in more than $60 billion in 2018.   Something is deeply wrong in this country where we let a young man  die because he cannot afford medicine that he needs and when his  insurance is taken away because of a $20 missed payment. Daniel died  because we have a system that puts profits over patients.   A healthcare system that does not guarantee basic care for all people  is a healthcare system that is broken. Medicare for All could have  prevented Daniel's death, and it could prevent the death of so many  others. Lloyd Doggett's pharmaceutical bill that would hold these  pharmaceutical companies accountable could have prevented Daniel's  death.   Twenty-eight million Americans are still uninsured, and millions more  are saddled with high deductibles and high premium plans which lead  them to forgo the care they need. Medicare for All is the plan that  will guarantee every American the basic care that they have a right to.   Daniel Desnoyers wasn't a perfect man and he didn't lead a perfect  life, but he tried, and our Nation owes it to him and others like him  to make sure that they have the medicine they need to live with  dignity.   I will continue to fight for Daniel, for his father, for his family,  and for all Americans.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to introduce  today's guest chaplain, the Reverend  [[Page H3310]]  Hardy Kim of Sunnyvale Presbyterian Church, which is in my district.   Since 1956, Sunnyvale Presbyterian Church has stood for peace and  justice in Silicon Valley. Pastor Kim began his service there 2 years  ago, hoping to unite our diverse community and delivering spiritual  comfort to the least fortunate.   His work is important for those families struggling to find  affordable housing and keep up with the rising cost of living often  overlooked in Silicon Valley's soaring wealth.   He also is an immigrant success story. He came here with his parents  from South Korea to Detroit and later received a bachelor's degree from  Harvard and a law degree from the University of Michigan. After a year  as a Presbyterian mission volunteer in Belfast, Northern Ireland, he  felt called to church ministry.   I have been honored to participate in dialogues he has led in the  community on immigration and gun control. I have learned a lot from him  about history. He recently told me that our separation of powers--such  an important concept today--is inspired in part by the Presbyterian  Church, and that one of my favorite Presidents, Woodrow Wilson,  apparently remarked that the highest honor of his life was not being  President of the United States, but it was being an elder in the  Presbyterian Church.   Pastor Kim has become a reliable and trusted voice in Silicon Valley.  I am very proud to introduce him to the House and honored that he would  grace us with the opening prayer.                            ____________________
