 Mr. President, let me begin by welcoming a true friend  to the United States, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who  will be visiting the Capitol later today. Over the years our nations  have built a strong and enduring relationship--a relationship grounded  in common values like democracy and individual freedom, a relationship  guided by a clear-eyed view of the threats that face us.   This relationship has grown closer and more valuable as terrorism has  become a constant threat to our homeland--something the Israelis have  known, literally, for decades and as Iran has sought to expand its  sphere of influence in an effort to remake the Middle East. I value our  relationship greatly. I know President Trump does as well.   Now is the time to strengthen and affirm this important partnership  as we move on from 8 years of often needless tension, as we turn the  page on an administration that chose as one of its last actions in  office to abandon our ally Israel, and in so doing to undermine any  semblance of a peace process by encouraging the Palestinians to forego  direct negotiations.   This afternoon I will reiterate to the Prime Minister my  determination, which I know many in Congress share, to work with our  new administration and underline America's commitment to achieving  peace with the Palestinians through a negotiated settlement in a way  that protects Israel's vital national security interests.   Our nations face many common threats. Strengthening this relationship  makes each of us safer. I hope colleagues will join me in extending a  warm welcome to Prime Minister Netanyahu on his visit to the Capitol  later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate has been acting to provide  relief from harmful regulations by utilizing the Congressional Review  Act, which provides the legislative tools needed to repeal them.   I am pleased to report that just yesterday the President signed the  first of several regulation-relief resolutions we hope to send him.  Later this week, he will sign a second resolution--a resolution  identical to the one I sponsored in the Senate that can bring relief to  thousands of mining families in Kentucky and across the country by  overturning the problematic stream buffer regulation.   Today, we will send him another one. In a few minutes we will vote to  protect the constitutional rights of Americans with disabilities. The  resolution will provide relief from an overly broad and legally  deficient regulation that threatens the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding Americans with disabilities.   Specifically, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the  Social Security Administration issued a rule that the ACLU and  disability groups across the country oppose because it unfairly treats  many Americans with disabilities.   Under this rule, the Social Security Administration must report to  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System anyone who  receives benefits for certain disabilities and whom the Social Security  Administration believes needs a representative payee to help manage  these benefits. As a result of being included on this list, many  disabled Social Security beneficiaries are barred from lawfully  purchasing a firearm, even though there has been no adjudication that  the beneficiary is ``mentally defective,'' which is the standard under  both the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the NICS Improvement Amendments  Act of 2007 for being barred from buying a firearm.   Numerous disability rights groups oppose the regulation as unfairly  stigmatizing the disabled. They agree with us on the need to stop the  regulation. The substantive problem with the regulation is compounded,  the groups note, by ``the absence of any meaningful due  [[Page S1166]]  process protections prior to the Social Security Administration's  transmittal of names to the NCIS database.''   The National Council on Disability, the nonpartisan independent  Federal agency charged with advising the President and Congress on  policies that affect people with disabilities, opposes the regulation,  too. The Council also urges us to use the Congressional Review Act to  repeal this eleventh hour regulation ``because of the . . .  constitutional right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule  legitimizes.''   Our colleague from Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader,  apparently disagrees with the ACLU, the National Council on Disability,  and disability rights groups across the country. He came to the floor  yesterday to discuss this issue. Like him, we are all deeply saddened  by the senseless loss of life due to gun violence. It is alarming  indeed that we have seen it increase in certain communities, like  Chicago. But the way to address this problem is not to stigmatize the  disabled or to deprive law-abiding Americans of their Second Amendment  rights without due process of law.   The Department of Justice states that ``firearms violations should be  aggressively used in prosecuting violent crime.'' The DOJ goes on to  state that such violations are ``generally simple and quick to prove.''  Under the Obama administration, however, there was a 35-percent  decrease in gun prosecutions as compared to the Bush Administration,  when measured over a 10-year period. In fact, gun prosecutions  decreased in almost every year of the Obama administration. I am  hopeful that the new leadership at the Justice Department will reverse  this alarming trend.   What is not helpful, of course, is the assistant Democratic leader's  implication that the Senate is addressing this regulation as some sort  of payback to the National Rifle Association. I would inform my friend  that almost two dozen groups oppose this last-minute regulation,  including nearly 20 disability rights groups.   Does he think the opposition to this regulation from groups like the  American Civil Liberties Union, the National Coalition for Mental  Health Recovery, and the American Association of People with  Disabilities is based on some sort of payback? The reality is that,  like us, they believe this regulation is simply bad policy. It places  an unfair stigma on those with disabilities and violates their  constitutional rights, which is why a wide array of groups oppose it.   I am glad the Senate will now join the House in protecting the  constitutional rights of Americans with disabilities by voting to undo  the unfair stigma this regulation imposes on them.   I want to thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who has  been a leader in addressing this regulation. He introduced the Senate  companion of the bill we will vote on today, with over 30 cosponsors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, our Democratic friends are getting a  lot of pressure from the far left to resist just about everything these  days--reality, for one.   The responsible route for Democrats would be to have some real talk  with the far left about how it is past time to come to grips with the  outcome of the last election. Instead, our Democratic friends have  allowed themselves to be pushed around by the fringes into a strategy  in search of a purpose--a strategy in search of a purpose.   They really can't prevent the President's Cabinet nominees from being  confirmed, and yet they have undertaken the most unprecedented  obstruction of Cabinet nominees in modern history. They have postponed  hearings repeatedly. They have boycotted committee meetings altogether.  They have forced unnecessary procedural hurdles to delay as long as  possible. It has resulted in this President's having the fewest number  of Cabinet Secretaries confirmed on a percentage basis at this point of  any incoming President since George Washington--and to what end?   It hasn't changed the results. What it has done is forced the  American people to go on for an unprecedented length of time without  leadership in some of the government's most important agencies.   We are determined to work through this pointless obstruction. We will  take the next step in that process soon with a vote to advance a  nominee to bring fiscal and regulatory sanity to our economy after 8  years of stagnation. Representative Mulvaney knows that making  government more effective and accountable is conducive to economic  growth, and he knows that getting our fiscal house in order goes hand  in hand with compassion. As he put it:         Fixing the economy doesn't mean just taking a green       eyeshade approach to the budget. Our government isn't just       about numbers. A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect       our most vulnerable.    That is just the kind of attitude we need in the Office of Management  and Budget. It is good to finally see new economic leadership in place  atop Treasury and the Small Business Administration. Now we can chart a  better direction for this important budgetary agency, as well, and  after we do, we will continue working through this unprecedented  obstruction to seat the rest of the Cabinet.   I would urge our friends across the aisle to work with us in doing  so. Without cooperation, then, under the regular order we are going to  end up working here well into the weekend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2 p.m. today; further, that the time  during the recess count postcloture on the Mulvaney nomination.    I yield back all the time on this side.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware for his  suggestion and giving me a moment here--I am not sure whether he is  finished--but to just ask unanimous consent on a matter.    So for the information of all Senators, under the  regular order, the Senate is scheduled to vote on the Pruitt nomination  on Friday afternoon. All Members should plan to stay here Friday to  complete consideration of the Pruitt nomination.   I yield the floor.
