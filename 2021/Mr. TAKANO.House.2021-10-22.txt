 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  Moreno Valley City Councilwoman, and true public servant, Victoria  Baca.   As the first Latina elected to the city council, Victoria broke  barriers and paved the way for so many others to follow in her  footsteps.   I knew Victoria during her time on the city council and remember her  as someone who was fiercely loyal to her community.   Victoria also served on the board of the Moreno Valley Unified School  District, where she was a strong advocate for special education  services in the Inland Empire and dedicated her time in office to  protecting and uplifting students.   She genuinely cared about others and worked tirelessly to make a  lasting difference. Her legacy with respect to education, diversity,  and economic growth in Moreno Valley will always be admired.  [[Page H5798]]    Victoria's death has left a void in the community and in the lives of  the people closest to her. I am honored to have known her and to have  witnessed the positive change she pioneered.   To the Baca family and all those who knew, loved, and respected her,  I offer my deepest condolences.                            ____________________
