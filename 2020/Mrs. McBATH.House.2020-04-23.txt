 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise to support the rule and underlying legislation to establish  the select committee, and I also support this bill that we will be  voting on later today.   Small businesses are the heart of a thriving community and vital to  the American economy, and there isn't one in Georgia or across the  country that has not been impacted by the pandemic.   This crisis demands we all continue our work together to ensure that  our American families are kept safe, American small businesses are  supported, and American workers receive the relief that they need. This  funding is one more step on the long journey toward recovery.   I want to take this time to offer my condolences to the victims who  have lost their lives to this awful disease. My prayers are with those  mourning in Georgia, across America, and around the globe.   To our doctors, nurses, and first responders: Americans everywhere  are looking up to your love, your sacrifice, and your uncommon courage.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying bill.
