 Mr. President, Livingston, MT, lost an incredible  member of the community on August 30 when Harold Dean Wilcoxson, son of  Carl and Harriett Esther (Swingley) Wilcoxson, passed away at age 94.  Harold spent much of his life operating the family-owned business and  Montana institution, Wilcoxson's Ice Cream shop. Wilcoxson's Ice Cream  has provided delicious ice cream and fond memories for Montanans for  over 100 years.   Harold was born on April 15, 1923, and graduated from Park County  High School in 1941. He pursued a certificate in electronics repair at  Kinmen Business University in Spokane, WA, and used his electronics  expertise for the rest of his life.   On September 15, 1942, Harold joined the U.S. Navy and served aboard  the  [[Page S6131]]  U.S.S. Quincey as an electronics chief during World War II. His ship  was located off of the French coast during the D-Day invasion of  Normandy in 1944 and was anchored in Sagami Wan during the signing of  the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in 1945.   Following his service, Harold returned to Montana to continue  building Wilcoxson's Ice Cream. Amidst long hours of building the  family business, Harold also enjoyed racecars. His love and passion for  fast cars lasted a lifetime.   From cleaning cream cans as a boy to fixing electrical issues and  managing new plant projects, Harold ensured Wilcoxson's Ice Cream shop  would continue in its legacy of gourmet ice cream and service to  Montanans for generations. Harold Dean Wilcoxson, beloved businessowner  and mentor, brought much to the Livingston community through his quiet  leadership and commitment to service and will be missed by  many.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing the administrators and volunteers of the Western Montana  Area VI Agency on Aging Foster Grandparent Program. Based in the small  town of Polson, MT, the program covers six mainly rural western Montana  counties and the area's lone Indian reservation. Every year, the lives  of dozens of children across Montana are changed for the better by the  Foster Grandparent program, and dozens of senior citizens are able to  use their time and skills to make a difference in the life of a child.   Foster grandparents are able to volunteer in many different settings,  including schools, afterschool programs, Head Start programs, teen  mentorship programs, and correctional facilities. With many communities  in western Montana facing high unemployment, as well as meth and opioid  drug crises, the Foster Grandparent program has a particular focus on  at-risk children. Foster grandparents support children who have been  abused or neglected, provide mentorship to teens, and help children  with disabilities.   This week, community members and the Western Montana Area VI Agency  on Aging are gathering to honor foster grandparents. Included in that  group is Navy veteran Karl Paddock, who is receiving a special award  for his service to the program. Our communities need more people like  Karl and all of the foster grandparents who are willing to step up and  make a difference in the lives of our most precious resource: our  children.   It is my hope that the Western Montana Area VI Agency on Aging Foster  Grandparent Program will continue to grow in the years to come. I  congratulate everyone involved in its success and the difference it is  making for the communities of western Montana.                            ____________________
