 Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening on  behalf of the more than 1 million people who are serving this country  and who rely on this Senate to put national security ahead of policy  disagreements.   With the overturning of Roe v. Wade, millions of Americans, including  tens of thousands of U.S. servicemembers, lost access to reproductive  care overnight. And I would just remind us all that the military relies  on almost 18 percent of its makeup on women. Most of those women are of  reproductive age.   Since the Dobbs decision, more and more States have put in place  prohibitions on reproductive care--care that was previously the right  of all Americans. Now, according to a recent RAND Corporation study, at  least 46 percent of female servicemembers no longer have unrestricted  access to care.   Now, as we all know, servicemembers and their families are stationed  based not on the needs of themselves and their families--so not  personal preference--but based on the needs of the Nation. And their  sacrifice and commitment to serve means that they are uniquely affected  by the restrictive healthcare laws that have come into effect in the  post-Roe era.   To address the harm that these healthcare prohibitions have on  servicemembers and military families, the Secretary of Defense issued  commonsense guidance that protects the readiness of the force and  family. And it is guidance that, I will remind everybody, the Secretary  of Defense is legally empowered to issue and implement and, as Senator  King so rightly pointed out, that has been in place for male members of  our military for years, as long as we remember.   But the senior Senator from Alabama has chosen to break with  precedent, to break with the decorum of this Chamber, and to hold 273  noncontroversial military nominations just because he disagrees--he  personally disagrees--with this policy. And as Senator King and Senator  Reed so eloquently pointed out, our servicemembers should not be used  as bargaining chips in policy debates.   Senator Tuberville's actions are jeopardizing our national security;  they are harming military families; and they are causing a whole  generation of senior military leaders to question whether they want to  stay in the military.   Worst of all, the Senator from Alabama knows exactly what the impact  is of these holds because he serves with all of us on the Armed  Services Committee. So he can't say this is not having an impact. He is  hearing, as part of the committee, what the impact is. He knows that  the unprecedented nature of his actions and the grave harm they pose to  our country and the military are real.   For those who don't sit on the Armed Services Committee, I want to  highlight some of the most grievous consequences of Senator  Tuberville's actions.   Military families are not able to enroll their children into new  schools on time. So we have a whole group of families with young  children who--during the summertime would be the time they would be  moving. They would be looking to get their children into new schools,  and they are on hold.   Military spouses can't go to the next assignment and find a job.   What is particularly concerning for many of these families is that  servicemembers are paid less than what they have earned. Just to give  you some idea, 22 officers who have been selected for their first star  will have to assume the duties of the higher grade while serving as a  field grade officer, not a flag officer, and these officers are losing  about $2,600 a month through no fault of their own. The last time I  talked to members of our military, they weren't making enough money to  be able to sacrifice an additional $2,600 a month. Twenty officers  selected to the grade of O-8 are two stars. They will assume the duties  of the higher grade while remaining in their current grade, and these  officers are losing nearly $2,000 a month while this blockade  continues.   Contrary to the misinformation that the Senator from Alabama has said  on this floor, there will be no backpay for these officers. Their pay  is tied to their rank, which is tied to their appointment to that rank,  and that can't occur until the Senate provides its consent. They ought  to be charging Senator Tuberville for this additional money they are  losing because it is on his back, these additional costs that families  are incurring.   Some of our most critical national security positions, like the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, are also unfilled, and this comes at a  time when we know that Russia is waging war in Europe and the People's  Republic of China continues to threaten our interests across the globe.   What is so incredibly hard to understand is that our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle I know are concerned about the PRC and the  influence of China. Yet they are not willing to call their colleague  out for what he is doing that provides a real opportunity for the PRC.  With every vacancy in our ranks, our adversaries are gaining an  advantage over us.   These holds affect real people who have dedicated their lives to  preserving our freedoms in this country. Those people who are affected  have earned more than being used as political pawns.   I want to take just a moment because we are here tonight to talk  about those 273 officers who are being held up. I want to talk about  some of those really incredible individuals whom the senior Senator  from Alabama is blocking.   The first is a colonel whom I met when I went to Lithuania for the  NATO summit. We went up to the base in Lithuania, Pabrade, and the  Deputy Commander of EUCOM pointed out that COL Kareem Montague, who is  currently the Deputy Commander of the 4th Infantry Division out of Fort  Carson, who is deployed temporarily to Lithuania, was one of those  general officers whose promotions are on hold.   The colonel has 28 years of service. He has been Executive Officer to  the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. He has been the Commander of the  5th Battlefield Coordination Detachment of U.S. Army Pacific, Joint  Base Pearl Harbor, in Hickam, HI. He has been the Commander of the 1st  Battalion, 321st Airborne Field Artillery Regiment, 18th Fires Brigade,  82nd Airborne, out of Fort Bragg. He has earned the Legion of Merit,  the Bronze Star, and the Defense Meritorious Service Medals. The  colonel doesn't deserve to be held up because the Senator from Alabama  has a personal beef with Secretary Austin's policy.  [[Page S3593]]    Then we have eight officers from the Marine Corps who have been  nominated to the rank of brigadier general. The first is Col. David  Everly. He is currently serving as Chief of Staff of the II Marine  Expeditionary Force. He has 28 years of service. He has been the Chief  of Staff to the 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade. He has been the  Commanding Officer of Command Element, 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade.  He has been the Commanding Officer of the Basic School Training  Command. He has multiple combat and contingency operation deployments.  He has received the Defense Superior Service Medal and the Bronze Star  Medal. Colonel Everly doesn't deserve to be held up.   Neither does Col. Kelvin Gallman, also in the Marine Corps, currently  serving as Senior Military Adviser to the Secretary of the Navy. He has  29 years of service. He has been the Division Chief, Deputy Division  Chief, Joint Capabilities Division, J-8, Joint Staff. He has been  Commanding Officer of Personnel Support Detachment. He has multiple  combat and contingency deployments, and he has received the Defense  Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit Medal, and the Bronze Star.   Col. Adolfo Garcia, also with the Marine Corps, is currently serving  as the House Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs. Some of us  may have run into him in that capacity. He has 30 years of service in.  He has been the Military Secretary to the Commandant of the Marine  Corps. He has been the Assistant Chief of Staff to I Marine  Expeditionary Force, the Commanding Officer of the 14th Marine  Regiment, 4th Marine Division. He has multiple combat tours. He has  earned the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Defense  Meritorious Service Medal. Again, he is on hold.   Then there is Col. Matt Good. Many of us know Colonel Good because we  traveled with him because most recently he served as Director, Senate  Liaison, Office of Legislative Affairs. I can tell you, having taken a  number of trips with Colonel Good, what a great job he does, how  committed he is, how committed he is to this Chamber, to the people  serving in the Senate. To have Senator Tuberville do to Colonel Good  and all of these members what he is doing is just unconscionable.  Colonel Good has 27 years of service. He has been the Commanding  Officer of the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, and commanding  officer of the 3d Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine  Division. He has been Chief of Plans and Chief of the Security  Cooperation Division of Joint Task Force North, U.S. Northern Command.  He has had multiple combat and contingency deployments. He has earned  the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Defense Meritorious  Service Medal.    Like all of these marines, like all of the people we are talking  about today, they have stellar records of serving this country, and  what does Senator Tuberville do to them? He puts their nominations on  hold. He denies them funding. He denies them the ability to get on with  their lives.   Col. Trevor Hall, U.S. Marine Corps, is currently serving as Chief of  Staff to the Marine Corps Forces Command. He has 29 years of service.  He was Commanding Officer for the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit;  Branch Chief, Trans-regional synchronization, U.S. Special Operations  Command; Commanding Officer, Division Training Officer, 3d Battalion,  8th Marine Regiment, 2d Marine Division. He has multiple combat and  contingency deployments. He earned the Legion of Merit Medal, the  Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal.   Col. Richard Joyce, also in the Marine Corps, is currently serving as  Commanding Officer, Marine Aircraft Group 29, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing,  with 28 years of service. He has been the Branch Head of the  Expeditionary Air Warfare N98, Office of Chief Naval Operations;  Commanding Officer, Special Projects Officer, Marine Light Attack  Helicopter Squadron 469, Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3d Marine Aircraft  Wing. He has had multiple combat and contingency deployments. He has  received the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and  the Distinguished Flying Cross.   Col. Omar Randall--also U.S. Marine Corps--is currently serving as  Director of Logistics, Combat Element Integration Division, Combat  Development and Integration. He has 27 years of service. He has been  the Branch Head, Futures Branch, Installations and Logistics,  Headquarters Marine Corps; Commanding Officer of Combat Logistics  Regiment 37, 3d Marine Logistics Group. He has had multiple combat and  contingency deployments. He has earned the Legion of Merit, the Defense  Meritorious Service Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal.   Then there is Col. Robert Weiler from the U.S. Marine Corps, who is  currently serving as Military Secretary to the Commandant of the Marine  Corps, with 28 years of service. He has been the Commanding Officer of  the 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division; Director of Inspections;  Commanding Officer of the 2d Battalion, 4th Marines; Senior Military  Adviser, Force Development, Office of the Secretary of Defense--Policy.  He has had multiple combat and contingency deployments. He received a  Purple Heart, a Silver Star, and a Legion of Merit. Senator Tuberville  wants to hold up his promotion.   Then I want to cite two people from the Navy who have been nominated  for appointments to the grade of rear admiral.   The first is CAPT Brian Anderson, who is currently serving as  Assistant Commander, Supply Chain Policy and Management, Naval Supply  Systems Command in Mechanicsburg, PA. He has 28 years of service. He  has been the Assistant Chief of Staff for Force Logistics Naval Air  Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, San Diego; Chief, Current Operations-Joint  Operations Officer; deployed to CENTCOM AOR, Camp African, Kuwait; and  Pakistan Liaison Officer. He has been assigned to the Defense Logistics  Agency in Fort Belvoir. He earned the Legion of Merit and the  Meritorious Service Medal.   Then there is CAPT Julie Mary Treanor. She is currently serving as  Chief of Staff in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, with 29  years of service. She has been Commanding Officer of Naval Supply  Systems Command Fleet Logistics Center in Norfolk; Naval Sea Systems  Command, Director of Industrial Supply Operations, Naval Sea Systems.  She also earned the Legion of Merit and the Meritorious Service Medal.   Both Captains Treanor and Anderson have been nominated to the grade  of rear admiral. Yet Senator Tuberville has them on hold.   I am going to stop with that list. We have a lot of folks on the  floor. We are going to continue to pick up the names of the people who  are on hold.   But simply put, it is not acceptable to turn policy disputes into  political brinksmanship when it comes to our servicemembers. As we have  all said, we are happy to debate our colleagues on policy any day of  the week, but that is not what we are doing. Instead, what we have is  the senior Senator from Alabama singlehandedly holding military  promotions hostage, using our servicemembers as political bargaining  chips for his own benefit. His actions undermine our military's  greatest strength--our people.   When he is asked about it, he says: Oh, it is playing really well at  home.   Well, that is not what this is about. This is about making sure that  we treat those people who serve in our military the way we ought to be  treating them and that we defend our Nation and trust those folks who  serve to make their own decisions about their own healthcare, just as I  believe our constituents sent us to Washington to debate policy  defenses, not to threaten the health and safety and welfare of those in  uniform or to hold our security interests hostage.   So I hope that Senator Tuberville will hear us tonight, that he will  let these qualified military officers get back to their work of  defending the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the city of  Portsmouth, NH, on the 400th anniversary of its first European  settlement.   Historians trace Portsmouth's earliest New World beginnings to the  1623 arrival of David Thomson. With a 6,000-acre land patent in hand  from the Council for New England, David and his wife Amias Cole Thomson  stepped ashore and constructed a settlement known as Pannaway  Plantation. The name is thought to mean ``place where the water spreads  out'' in the language of the Abenaki, one of the many Tribes that  inhabited, hunted, and farmed the land and fished local waters long  before the Thomsons arrived in Little Harbor. Pannaway found success as  a fishing outpost; however, the Thomsons and their crew left for  another settlement in Boston Harbor just a few short years later. A new  group of settlers directed by Captain John Mason and led by Captain  Walter Neale would return in 1630 and establish a colony along the  Piscataqua River known as Strawbery Banke. The port facilitated trade  that served fishing, lumber, and shipbuilding interests. It was  officially incorporated as the town of Portsmouth in 1653, an homage to  the English town in Hampshire County where Captain Mason lived.   In these early years, Portsmouth rose to prominence as a major center  for commerce and government. It was the colonial capital of New  Hampshire, and its dwellings housed wealthy merchants as well as  hunters, trappers, fishermen, shipbuilders, and other skilled crafters.  Portsmouth also played a pivotal role in our country's fight for  independence. Four months before shots were fired in Lexington and  Concord, a group of local men captured Fort William and Mary, a  military post that guarded access to the waters of Portsmouth Harbor  and the Piscataqua River, and distributed its gunpowder to towns around  the colony. Many historians consider the raid as one of the first acts  of overt defiance in the American Revolution.   The new Nation also relied on Portsmouth's expertise in shipbuilding  to build vessels for the Continental Navy. Captain John Paul Jones  lived in Portsmouth while supervising construction of the USS Ranger.  The first ship to fly the American flag into battle, the USS Raleigh  was built on nearby Badger's Island. The Raleigh is proudly depicted on  New Hampshire's State flag and the Great Seal of the State of New  Hampshire.   The area's rich heritage of shipbuilding as well as the deep, ice- free waters of Portsmouth Harbor made it an ideal location for a  Federal navy yard. In 1800, President John Adams established the  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. It is the U.S. Navy's oldest continuously  operating shipyard in the country, and its current workforce is  responsible for overhauling and repairing America's modern submarine  fleet. In the early 20th century, the shipyard and the city welcomed  delegates from Russia and Japan to negotiate an end to the countries'  year-and-a-half-long conflict. They arrived in Portsmouth in August  1905 at the suggestion of President Theodore Roosevelt, who received a  Nobel Prize for his efforts to broker an end to the Russo-Japanese War.  In Portsmouth, President Roosevelt could count on both the naval  shipyard to observe diplomatic protocols and the people of the city to  act as gracious hosts to both delegations. The friendly, relaxed  environment proved conducive to securing the first international treaty  to be signed on U.S. soil and an agreement that set the tone for  Pacific relations in the century to follow.   Portsmouth has witnessed so much since its first European settlement,  and city residents understand the social, cultural, and economic  benefits of preserving and celebrating this history. Its charming  downtown retains and blends four centuries of unique buildings,  architecture, landmarks, and community spaces, including the 1695  Sherburne House at Strawbery Banke Museum, the 1716 Warner House, the  1784 Governor John Langdon House, the 1855 reconstruction of the iconic  North Church, the 1878 rebuilding of the Music Hall, and 1954 creation  of Prescott Park. Efforts to sustain these treasures and more have  positioned the city as a popular heritage tourism destination with a  thriving arts and culture scene, boutique shops, and a variety of local  restaurants and cafes. They have also reinvigorated a sense of  community among Portsmouth residents by bringing to light their shared  history and the city's distinct local character.   Within these efforts, city residents devote special attention to  giving voice to the generations of people who contributed to  Portsmouth's long, complex story with little or no recognition in  previous town histories. They carefully consider and pay respect to the  Native Tribes--the Abenaki, the Pennacook, the Wabanaki peoples, and  more--who inhabited the area for thousands of years prior to European  contact. Local museums share the experiences and perspectives of  immigrants across the centuries who were drawn to Portsmouth with  prospects for a better life. The city is home to the Black Heritage  Trail of New Hampshire, an organization that strives to build  communities that are more inclusive by promoting awareness and  appreciation of African-American history, as well as the Portsmouth  African Burying Ground. After years of discussion and deliberation by a  city-organized committee, the 18th  [[Page S3618]]  century gravesite was rededicated in 2015 as a park titled ``We Stand  In Honor of Those Forgotten.'' The site is now a sobering memorial that  encourages reflection on the full, unvarnished history of the region.   Around the 300th anniversary of its first European settlement, the  city of Portsmouth worked alongside the local chamber of commerce to  create a new slogan that would attract new industry and accentuate the  high quality of life for residents of the community. They settled on  ``The City of the Open Door,'' an expression that conveys optimism and  invites people of every faith, every culture, and every background to  the city to help write the next memorable chapter of Portsmouth's long  and impressive story. City residents continue to exemplify this ethos a  full century later. I congratulate the city of Portsmouth on this  important milestone and wish the community all the best as it  celebrates its past and looks forward to its bright future.                            ____________________
