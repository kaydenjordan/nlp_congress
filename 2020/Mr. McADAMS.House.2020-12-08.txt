 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4902, which  is legislation renaming Utah's Federal courthouse in honor of Senator  Orrin G. Hatch.   Madam Speaker, I met Senator Hatch many years ago and have worked  with him since my time in the Utah State Senate and subsequently as the  mayor of Salt Lake County. I have always admired the service he  provided for his constituents and colleagues in the Senate alike.   Senator Hatch's accomplishments on behalf of Utah and our country are  a remarkable reminder of the bipartisanship we need to return to.   Senator Hatch worked with his longtime friend, Senator Ted Kennedy,  to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. He also  worked across the aisle to pass the Radiation Exposure Compensation  Act, which compensated Utahans who suffered radiation exposure because  of their proximity to the Nevada Nuclear Test Site.   Madam Speaker, Senator Hatch has been an exemplary public figure. For  over 40 years, Senator Hatch showed what it is like to work with folks  from all walks of life and all ends of the political spectrum. He  respected a difference of opinion. He welcomed a healthy debate, and he  knew that at the end of the day we are all trying to make our State and  our country a better place.   Senator Hatch cared deeply about the rule of law and the integrity of  the courts. Putting his name on the Federal courthouse in Utah is a  well-deserved and hard-earned honor marking his many contributions to  the judiciary, to his State, and to our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.
