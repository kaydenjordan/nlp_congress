 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H. Con.  Res. 33. This resolution would designate the George C. Marshall Museum  and the George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington, Virginia, as  the National George C. Marshall Museum and Library.   I would like to thank Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and Mr.  Brat for their work in bringing this legislation to the floor today.   It is only fitting that we consider this resolution on the week of  the 70th anniversary of George C. Marshall's speech at Harvard  University where he proposed a comprehensive foreign assistance  program--later coined as the Marshall Plan--to help rebuild the war- torn and devastated economies in Western Europe after World War II.   General George Catlett Marshall dedicated his life to public  service--serving honorably in the United States Army, as Army Chief of  Staff during World War II, Special Ambassador to China, Secretary of  State, and Secretary of Defense. He was one of only five five-star  generals ever to serve in our military.   From his allied plan to storm the beaches of Normandy to the Marshall  Plan, his leadership changed the world. The history of the United  States and the global community would be a different place if not for  the contributions of General Marshall.   At the recommendation of former President Harry Truman, the Marshall  Foundation was established in 1953. On May 23, 1964, the Marshall  Museum and Library was dedicated on the post of the Virginia Military  Institute--General Marshall's alma mater.                                time  1500    For over 50 years, the Marshall Foundation has devoted its mission to  educating the public about the important contributions of General  Marshall.   The museum has five extensive exhibits and houses General Marshall's  1953 Nobel Peace Prize. The research library collects, preserves, and  shares the largest collection of documents pertaining to General  Marshall's life.   Just last year, the Marshall Foundation reached a huge milestone with  the completion of the Papers of George Catlett Marshall. This project  began in 1977 with a goal to create a published record of every  document that General Marshall produced. The final project consists of  7 volumes and includes 4,260 documents spanning over 5,666 pages.  [[Page H4676]]    In addition to its extensive research work, the Marshall Foundation  provides educational opportunities for college students and future  military leaders.   The Marshall Undergraduate Scholars program sends college history  students to the Marshall Foundation to conduct primary research in the  library's archives. The Marshall Army ROTC Award Seminar also provides  the top ROTC cadet at each college in the United States the opportunity  to participate in a national security conference with fellow award  recipients and current Army leaders. The Marshall-Arnold Air Force ROTC  Award Seminar provides a similar opportunity to top senior cadets at  each college with an Air Force ROTC program.   Two years ago, the Marshall Foundation began the Marshall Legacy  Series--this multiyear series of exhibits, lectures, and events to  showcase General Marshall's contributions during the 20th century, and  connects those contributions to today's world.   This is just a snapshot of the important work the Marshall Foundation  conducts to honor and preserve the legacy of General Marshall. I am  honored to have such a distinguished institution in my district, the  Sixth Congressional District of Virginia.   General Marshall once said: ``Sincerity, integrity, and tolerance  are, to my mind, the first requirements of many to a fine, strong  character.''   I applaud the Marshall Foundation's work in sharing Marshall's vision  and character with a new generation of Americans. I urge passage of  this resolution to honor one of America's most sincere and  distinguished public servants by congressionally designating the museum  and library in Lexington, Virginia, as the National George C. Marshall  Museum and Library.
