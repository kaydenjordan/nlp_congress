 Madam Speaker, as mother of four, the wife of an  educator, and the daughter of a teacher, I know that we should never  underestimate the power of a high-quality education.   In the nearly 40 years since the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act was passed, the Federal Government has not fulfilled its  funding promise to our special education students. Not once.   This failure leaves our schools with extreme budget cuts that impact  every student and forces them to turn to our communities to bear the  burden through local tax levies.   That is why I am so proud to work with Representative Jared Huffman  and Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber on a bipartisan basis for IDEA  full funding, to make sure that every student, including those with  special needs, receives a high-quality education in their neighborhood.   Providing a high-quality education to all of our students is  something that we can all agree on, and we must work together to get  this done on behalf of our communities.                            ____________________
