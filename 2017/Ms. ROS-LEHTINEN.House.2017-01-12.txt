 Mr. Speaker, today marks the seventh anniversary of  the earthquake in Haiti which struck near its capital, Port-au-Prince,  leaving behind in its wake total devastation and tens of thousands  dead.   Haitians have been resilient in their efforts to come back from this  massive disaster, and the United States will remain committed to  helping Haiti get back on its feet.   I have had the privilege of visiting Haiti many times during my time  in Congress, and, most recently in October, I had the opportunity to  travel to Haiti with my dear Florida colleague Frederica Wilson weeks  after yet another terrible disaster, a hurricane, hit Haiti.   I would like to commend local organizations in south Florida led by  the Haitian Women of Miami, FANM, for holding a silent march this  afternoon, beginning at 4 p.m., from 62nd Street and North Miami Avenue  to the Little Haiti Cultural Center.   Mr. Speaker, let's continue to help Haiti and the Haitian people.                            ____________________
