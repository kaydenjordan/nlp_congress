 Madam Chair, as it stands now, this bill will make a  vast swath of land inaccessible, making it harder for wildfires to  respond.   This bill's approach to wildfires is backwards. The people of Montana  and across the West have seen too many fires scorch homes, businesses,  and forests. It has destroyed air quality, water quality, and  fisheries. They appreciate the bravery of the responding firefighters,  but I believe many would prefer never to see the wildfires in the first  place.   My amendment would have addressed root causes of wildfires by  clarifying language in statute that allows radical environmentalists to  delay the harvest of timber as per the Cottonwood decision, which has  made proper forest management near impossible.   The Cottonwood decision has delayed forest planning, wildfire  mitigation efforts, and ultimately weaponized the Endangered Species  Act, allowing special interest groups to line up like pigs at the  trough, lapping up legal fees and settlements, stripping valuable  resources from agencies and keeping them from carrying out their  mission.   In closing, I will say that I am appalled that Democrats will not  consider the commonsense amendments like mine, which would allow these  mitigation efforts to take place.
