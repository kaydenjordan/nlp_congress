 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  constituent and friend, Fausto G. Diaz.   A fellow member of the Christopher Columbus High School family,  Fausto was a successful Cuban-American entrepreneur and job creator  who, along with parents Remedios and Fausto and sister Rosie, took  their business to new heights.   Fausto was deeply patriotic, loved this country and never forgot  about his parents' native homeland of Cuba. He was a tireless advocate  for Cuba's freedom and the importance of keeping sanctions on the  brutal regime that strangles the island.   Above all, Fausto was a loving son, brother, father, grandfather, and  uncle who was so proud of his growing family.   Fausto passed away unexpectedly on the morning of Tuesday, May 30,  but his legacy lives on in his children, Jacqueline and Fausto; and  grandchildren, Victor and Katherine.   Rest easy, my friend.                            ____________________
