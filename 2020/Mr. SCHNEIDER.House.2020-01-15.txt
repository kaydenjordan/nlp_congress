 Madam Speaker, I rise today for our Nation's  communities saddled with stranded nuclear waste stockpiles because the  Federal Government has failed to meet its obligation to find a  permanent repository.   My constituents in Zion understand this all too well. After its  nuclear plant closed in 1998, 2 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel  remains.   Literally sitting on the shores of Lake Michigan, the more than 50  casks severely affect the quality of life of the residents of Zion. It  deters economic investment, depresses home values, drives up property  taxes, and stretches the city's already-thin budget.   Today, I am proud to reintroduce the STRANDED Act to, at last,  provide some compensation for these affected communities. Zion is not  alone. Across the country, there are more than a dozen communities with  nuclear plants at various stages of decommissioning, with more to come.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the support and leadership of  Committee on Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Subcommittee on  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Chairwoman Marcy  Kaptur in reintroducing this bill.   Together, we are fighting to make the Federal Government do right for  communities like Zion, and I urge my colleagues to join us.                            ____________________
