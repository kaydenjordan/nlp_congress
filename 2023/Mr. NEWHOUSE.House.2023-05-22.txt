 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, you probably didn't know this, but 50  years ago, President Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act into law,  which was designed to do two very important things: Prevent species  from going extinct and promoting their recovery.   Mr. Speaker, since then, hundreds of plants and animals have joined  the endangered or threatened species list, spurring conservation and  recovery efforts at all levels of government. While well-intentioned,  this law, unfortunately, has been abused and twisted so much that it  doesn't even begin to achieve its goals. In short, it is a failure.   Although there have been some successes in the past 50 years, only 72  of the 1,389 listed species have been recovered and removed from the  list. That is a 5 percent success rate. Only in the Federal Government  would anyone consider 5 percent a passing grade.   The Congressional Western Caucus has long advocated for improvements  to modernize the ESA and make it more effective for our species and  more transparent for the American people.   We have advocated on behalf of the rural communities that we  represent  [[Page H2492]]  who are severely impacted by ESA listing decisions and who, in many  cases, are working in collaboration with private landowners, community  groups, tribes, local governments to promote successful species  recovery and land conservation. We have advocated to administration  after administration to follow the science and fulfill the  congressional intent of the law which is to promote recovery of these  species and remove them from the endangered species list.   That is why I am really proud, Mr. Speaker, to host this Special  Order tonight where you will hear from my Western Caucus colleagues  about successful, locally-led recovery efforts that are taking place  across this country, about the need for conservation, not just  preservation, of our species, the different impacts that ESA listing  decisions have on local communities and economies, and some of the  legislative reforms that are needed to finally bring the ESA into the  21st century.   As we have seen over the past 50 years, ESA has become a weapon used  by extreme environmentalists and by serial litigators to slow or halt  critical economic development and land management projects in rural  communities throughout the United States.   From preventing the restoration of our forests to creating  excessively burdensome roadblocks to domestic energy development, the  ESA used in this way actually can do more harm than good.   These combative environmental groups use the ESA to drive a political  wedge to achieve their true ambition, the end of ranching, the end of  resource development, and the end of timber harvest on public lands. It  is not just a western or a public lands issue.   There are approximately 1.3 billion acres of private land in the  United States and 926 of the currently listed species are on those  private lands, which means cooperation with these communities and these  landowners is essential. It is crucial for recovery.   Unfortunately, ESA regulations often negatively affect the very  people we need as conservation partners through land use restrictions,  through reduced property values, and costly permitting requirements. In  effect, the law literally makes enemies out of the people most critical  to the species recovery.   We must empower our local, our State, and our Tribal partners to  collaborate on comprehensive recovery and conservation efforts, and we  understand more stringent regulations will not lead to more successful  species recovery.   In rural America, we value the responsible management of species, but  we have to do so in a way that does not destroy our economies, that  does not decimate our lands, or leave our communities vulnerable to  natural disasters.   We need flexible tools, not tools that are one-size-fits-all  regulations that come out of the Federal Government, to be successful  in our shared goal of recovery of our Nation's endangered species and  threatened species.   Tonight, as we always do, we are here to raise the voices of rural  communities across this country, and tonight we are focused on those  voices that are telling us how they have been impacted by the ESA and  make their message heard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for relating some of  the impacts that he sees in his State. You don't have to be in the  Western United States to be negatively impacted by some of the things  that are in the ESA that need updating. I thank him for relating that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Tiffany), one of the vice chairs of the Western Caucus, a  gentleman that represents another Midwestern State. I thank him for  being here tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tiffany. You are absolutely  right. In the ESA there have been some success stories and we need to  learn to celebrate them. More important, the resources that are being  used in successfully recovering those species could then be turned to  other resources that desperately need the help.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao),  one of the young Members of the House of Representatives and a friend  of mine.     Mr. Speaker, he had to go there. I thank Mr. Valadao  for his words. Sometimes going off script is dangerous at times, but I  think he made a really good point about right now in California, there  is an abundance of water, so much so that some communities are  flooding.   If we could just store that water, then we would not have to idle all  of that farmland that I hear is being set aside because there is not  enough water to irrigate. Communities wouldn't be struggling. We need  the food that California produces as a country. That is important to  us. These are the things that are not just affecting people in  California but the whole country.    Mr. Speaker, I think Mr. Valadao's time has expired,  but he makes some really good points, and I appreciate that. Since he  is a young man, I am always amazed at how much he has picked up in a  short amount of time here.   Next, I turn to someone that has really impressed with her knowledge  of natural resource issues, not just in her home State but throughout  the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better. Resources  are being used to keep the species on the list indefinitely.   We should be thinking about the good of the species and the success  of the recovery of the species. Instead, we want to keep them on this  list to be used for other reasons. That is what we have to get to the  bottom of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).  He is a dear friend. He is someone who came into Congress with me and  has risen to the chair of the Natural Resources Committee and is doing  just a great job. He is one of my star members of the Western Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Westerman for his remarks.   How appropriate it is to look at the original language, the intent,  to illustrate how far we have strayed from that mission. I thank  Chairman Westerman for those great words.   Next, Mr. Speaker, I turn to somebody who I visited in his district,  and I think he knows firsthand just to what extent the ESA has been  weaponized to stop some of the things that, as a country, we have to  accomplish.   Mr. Stauber from the great State of Minnesota happens to be one of  the vice chairmen of the Congressional Western Caucus. I would love to  hear what the gentleman has to say about this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber).    I couldn't agree more that the gray wolf in my State  has recovered, as well. They are prolific animals. They are flexible.  They are nomadic. We really should declare a victory that they have  recovered and celebrate that success and then use those resources to  focus on other species that need our attention.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the  chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and someone that knows, from  his perspective, not only a lot about agriculture but a lot about the  Endangered Species Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for elevating the  voices of the people of Pennsylvania on this important issue.   He is right. The conservation programs that we have in this country  have done a lot of good for species across the country.   That is why he is the chairman of the Agriculture Committee because  he understands things like that.    That too. We all do once in a while.   I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann), a great agricultural  State, and a beautiful district that I have visited.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Mann and appreciate his  pointing out how important it is to listen to people in the local area  who understand the environment, the climate that they live in, and that  often they are earning their living by farming.   We have heard from several different parts of the country represented  here with the different Members of Congress. So, I am going back to the  great State of California to another one of the Western Caucus vice  chairs, someone that is very outspoken on these issues, and has  tremendous background and knowledge on the Endangered Species Act.   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), for being part  of this conversation and also elevating the voices of the people he  represents.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. LaMalfa is correct, there are a lot of  things that we should talk about. We have a limited amount of time, but  he is very good at expressing the needs of the people that he  represents and making sure that people understand.    Mr. Speaker, in summation, as you have heard tonight,  the Endangered Species Act, signed into law 50 years ago--and I think  you probably picked this up--was designed to do two things: It was  designed to prevent the species from going extinct and to promote its  recovery. We need to return to that mission. We need to work with  landowners and local governments, Tribes, and always keep the well- being of the species in mind in that work.   Mr. Speaker, we also need to be transparent for the American people.  There is just too much at stake for us not to be. As members of the  Congressional Western Caucus, we are going to continue to elevate the  voice of the people of rural America on important issues like the  Endangered Species Act and so many others.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 15 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, May 23, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
