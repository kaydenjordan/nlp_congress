The purchaser typically requests offsets.       Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between       the purchaser and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of contractor representatives to Canada on an       intermittent basis over the life of the case to support       delivery and integration of items onto the existing F/A-18A       aircraft and to provide supply support management, inventory       control and equipment familiarization.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-42       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The following are included in this sale:        a. The AIM-9X Block II and Block II+ (Plus) SIDEWINDER       Missile represents a substantial increase in missile       acquisition and kinematics performance over the AIM-  [[Page S3011]]       9M and replaces the AIM-9X Block I Missile configuration. The       missile includes a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced       countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high angle of       attack airframe and the ability to integrate the Helmet       Mounted Cueing System. The software algorithms are the most       sensitive portion of the AIM-9X missile. The software       continues to be modified via a preplanned product improvement       (P3I) program in order to improve its counter-countermeasure       capabilities. No software source code or algorithms will be       released. The missile is classified as CONFIDENTIAL. The AIM-      9X will result in the transfer of sensitive technology and       information. The equipment, hardware, and documentation are       classified CONFIDENTIAL. The software and operational       performance are classified SECRET. The seeker/guidance       control section and the target detector are CONFIDENTIAL and       contain sensitive state-of-the-art technology. Manuals and       technical documentation that are necessary or support       operational use and organizational management are classified       up to SECRET. Performance and operating logic of the counter-      countermeasures circuits are classified SECRET. The hardware,       software, and data identified are classified to protect       vulnerabilities, design and performance parameters and       similar critical information.        b. The AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       Radar System is classified SECRET. The radar provides the F/      A-18A Hornet aircraft with all-weather, multimission       capability for performing Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground       targeting and attack. Air-to-Air modes provide the capability       for all-aspect target detection, long-range search and track,       automatic target acquisition, and tracking of multiple       targets. Air-to-Surface attack modes provide high-resolution       ground mapping navigation, weapon delivery, and sensor       cueing. The system component hardware (Antenna, Transmitter,       Radar Data Processor, and Power Supply) is UNCLASSIFIED. The       Receiver-Exciter hardware is CONFIDENTIAL. The radar       Operational Flight Program (OFP) is classified SECRET.       Documentation provided with the AN/APG-79 radar set is       classified SECRET.        c. The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is used by       Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, and allows aircraft to       attack well-defended targets in day, night, and adverse       weather conditions. AGM-154C carries a BROACH warhead. The       BROACH warhead incorporates an advanced multi-stage warhead.       JSOW-C uses the GPS Precise Positioning System (PPS), which       provides for a more accurate capability than the commercial       version of GPS. The JSOW-C incorporates components, software,       and technical design information that are considered       sensitive. The following JSOW-C components being conveyed by       the proposed sale that are considered sensitive and are       classified CONFIDENTIAL include the GPS/INS, IIR seeker, OFP       software and missile operational characteristics and       performance data. These elements are essential to the ability       of the JSOW-C missile to selectively engage hostile targets       under a wide range of operational, tactical, and       environmental conditions.        d. The Wide Band RADOME (WBR) is a high performance nose       radome designed for use with the Active Electronically       Scanned Array (AESA) Radar. The WBR is required to leverage       the full capability of the AESA Radar. The Radome will       provide superior RF performance over broader AESA Radar       operational bands which will give the user an advantage in       operational scenarios. Specifically, the WBR will provide       improved target detection with less interference and reduce       jamming vulnerability. Purchasing the AESA without the WBR       would significantly reduce the capability of the AESA and the       user would gain very little advantage with the AESA.        e. The Upgrades to the Advanced Distributed Combat Training       System (ADCTS), provides an aggressive program upgrade the       warfighting capability of the F/A-18. The program will       introduce new systems and weapons to the aircraft. In order       to have pilots ready to utilize the new technologies, it is       imperative that the user's Pilot Trainer (ADCTS) undergoes a       parallel upgrade effort. The ADCTS is an integral part of the       user's Pilot Training Syllabus and this procurement will       address this requirement. It will provide pilots the ability       to train with the new systems that will be resident in the       aircraft in a simulated environment. This procurement will       provide pilots the ability to maximize use of the new       capabilities that will eventually translate to the       operational environment and make the users Air Force a       significant contributor to international coalition       initiatives.        f. Software Development. The challenge facing the user       nation is that in order to add all the new capabilities and       weapons to the platform there is a parallel software effort       required to ensure all the new capabilities have a software       model that will support their integration and use. The       success of the aggressive procurement of the systems and       capabilities for the program will be dependent on the ability       to develop and test the requisite software. This is a       significant effort that will rely on Naval Air Weapons       Station China Lake to develop the required products. This       will entail development of the product, lab testing and       eventually flight testing of the software loads. There will       be some mutual software development, but the end result will       depend on U.S. Government engineers to provide final check       and approval of all software profiles. This FMS case funds       this effort. Additionally, the software effort will support       Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (A-GCAS). This       system is also referred to as Automatic Terrain Avoidance       Warning System (A-TAWS). This is flight control software that       uses a terrain elevation database to calculate the aircraft's       relative position above the ground. If it senses that the       aircraft is on a collision course with the ground that is       outside of normal parameters, it automatically commands the       aircraft to roll wings level and recover away from a ground       collision        g. The ADM-141C Improved Tactical Air-Launched Decoy       (ITALD) is unclassified. The ITALD vehicle is intended to be       delivered by sea- and land-based tactical aircraft, to cause       an increase in the number of apparent targets to enemy       defenses prior to or during air strikes. The ITALD system       consists of the flight vehicle, launch rack (Improved Triple       Ejector Rack (ITER)), Improved Decoy Tester/Programmer       (IDTP), Radio Frequency Payload System Tester (PSST), and       shipping/storage container. The ITALD is capable of       functioning in the vehicle test mode, mission programming       mode (using JMPS with ITALD UPC), GPS almanac uploading mode,       captive carriage mode, launch mode, jettison mode, and free-      flight mode.        h. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is classified       SECRET. JMPS will provide mission planning capability for       support of military aviation operations. It will also provide       support for unit-level mission planning for all phases of       military flight operations and have the capability to provide       necessary mission data for the aircrew. JMPS will support the       downloading of data to electronics data transfer devices for       transfer to aircraft and weapon systems. A JMPS for a       specific aircraft type will consist of basic planning tools       called the Joint Mission Planning Environment (JMPE) mated       with a Unique Planning Component (UPC) provided by the       aircraft program. In addition, UPCs will be required for       specific weapons, communication devices, and moving map       displays. The JMPS will be tailored to the specific       releasable configuration for the F/A-18A, with maximum       commonality with the most advanced United States Marine Corps       configuration of these aircraft.        i. The AN/ARC-210 RT-2036 (Gen 6) Radio's Line-of-sight       data transfer rates up to 80      kb/s in a 25 kHz channel creating high-speed communication of       critical situational awareness information for increased       mission effectiveness. Software that is reprogrammable in the       field via Memory Loader/Verifier Software making flexible use       for multiple missions. The AN/ARC-210 has embedded software       with programmable cryptography for secure communications.       Relative to the 5th Generation AN/ARC-210 radios, the 6th       generation AN/ARC-210 RT-2036 adds, in addition to newer       hardware, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability.       Access to the MUOS satellite constellation can be effectively       controlled by withholding the relevant order wire keys from       RT-2036 users.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware or software in this       proposed sale, the information could be used to develop       countermeasures which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advance capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the recipient       country, the Government of Canada can provide substantially       the same degree of protection for the classified and       sensitive technology being released as the United States       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance if the       United States Foreign Policy and National Security objectives       outlined in the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Canada.                            ____________________
