 Mr. Speaker, Michigan, like many States, continues to see  a skyrocketing number of COVID-19 cases. In my own family, we have  cases, serious cases, of this terrible virus.   This pandemic is far, far from over. It is actually getting worse,  and Congress has to do its job.   Families, seniors, small businesses, they need our support right now.  I have heard from thousands of constituents who are still struggling to  pay their bills, to put food on the table, to pay rent, and to protect  themselves.   This Congress needs to pass emergency relief now. It has been 6  months  [[Page H5803]]  since the House passed a COVID relief bill, a bill that would put money  in the pockets of workers, up to $6,000 per household; it would extend  unemployment benefits for those people who have lost their jobs as a  result of this pandemic; and it would support small businesses,  importantly, those small businesses that are just on the brink of  failure, to ensure that relief gets to those underserved communities  and especially to some of our nonprofits.   Sadly, the COVID bill sits on Mitch McConnell's desk, gathering dust.   This is a pandemic. It is a health crisis. It is an economic crisis.  We need to come together, put politics aside, negotiate with one  another, come to a compromise, and help the American people.                            ____________________
