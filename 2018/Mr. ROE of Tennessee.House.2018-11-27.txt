 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of the bill (H.R. 7163) to designate the outstation of the Department  of Veterans Affairs in North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet  Center Outstation, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
