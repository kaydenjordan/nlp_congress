 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Oran  Yeargan, a student at Glynn County Middle School in Brunswick, Georgia.   A student with a disability, Oran has been the water boy for the  Hurricane's football team for the past 3 years. This October, the coach  called him off the bench and Oran ran the ball for the last touchdown  of the game against Needwood Middle School.   He stood by the team with utmost dedication all year, and this  touchdown was not only really deserved, but an important lesson to us  all about commitment and overcoming life's obstacles.   Oran, we are proud of you. Congratulations.                            ____________________
