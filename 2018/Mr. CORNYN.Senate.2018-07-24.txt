 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, we will continue the  confirmation process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who, as we all know,  has been nominated by President Trump to serve on the U.S. Supreme  Court. I say we will continue the confirmation process because there  has already been a questionnaire issued by the Judiciary Committee to  which the nominee has responded. I know White House Counsel and others  are already trying to put their heads together with the George W. Bush  Presidential Library, down in Dallas, as well as with the National  Archives, to be responsive to the document requests that have been made  for the judge.   As the author of more than 300 published opinions, Judge Kavanaugh is  a well-known judicial nominee. I think his experience from the last 12  years on the DC Court of Appeals has clearly demonstrated he has the  experience that the job on the Supreme Court requires.   He is also enormously well respected among the legal community. We  have seen op-eds written by professors--all of them scholars--who say  that Judge Kavanaugh can more than hold his own when it comes to legal  analysis. We have heard this from people who share his judicial  philosophy and those who do not share his judicial philosophy. They  have a broad mutual respect for his intellect and his integrity.   We have heard about his mentorship of law clerks, both men and women,  liberals and conservatives. As I say, we have received testimonials  from professionals across the ideological spectrum. Last week, a group  of 80 former students from Harvard Law School, where Judge Kavanaugh  taught, sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. As you might  imagine, they have a variety of perspectives on judicial philosophy and  a wide range of political views, but they all agreed that Judge  Kavanaugh is a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and a gracious  person.   Lastly, we have heard from the nominee himself. On the night  President Trump announced his choice, Judge Kavanaugh said that he  believes an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our  constitutional Republic. He promised to keep an open mind in every  case, as a judge should, to uphold the Constitution of the United  States, and to preserve the rule of law. Those words and the opinions  from his many supporters demonstrate that Judge Kavanaugh is the right  person to replace Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Most people  agree that it is the Supreme Court's job to fairly interpret the law,  not to substitute their own  [[Page S5238]]  judgment--political, ideological, or personal--for that of Congress's  when Congress has spoken, and I believe Judge Kavanaugh understands  that deeply.   A number of our colleagues across the aisle have been left grasping  at straws given his outstanding qualifications and the fact that he was  confirmed back in 2006 to the second most powerful court in the Nation,  the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.   Judge Kavanaugh is a well-known nominee both to the Senate Judiciary  Committee and to the Senate itself, but some have recently criticized  Judge Kavanaugh for expressing opposition to the independent counsel  statute even though, once upon a time, they supported ending that very  same statute themselves. There was bipartisan consensus to essentially  let that statute lapse. So it is ironic that some are now using that as  a point of criticism.   For example, in 1999, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois,  called for getting rid of the statute, claiming that it allowed  independent counsels to be unchecked, unbridled, unrestrained, and  unaccountable. That just goes to show you--if you are in the Senate  long enough, you are likely to find yourself on both sides of an  argument. But in this case, there is no merit to any criticism of Judge  Kavanaugh for something that Democrats and Republicans both agreed to  do, which is to let the independent counsel statute lapse.   Another weakness in their argument is that there is a real difference  between special counsels, such as Robert Mueller, and independent  counsels under the old statute. They are not the same thing.   When Judge Kavanaugh spoke years ago about the independent counsel  statute, he was referring to a law that Congress ultimately agreed in a  bipartisan fashion to let expire and not renew because it was felt that  independent counsels--particularly the last independent counsel, Ken  Starr--had too much autonomy to investigate and prosecute any  misconduct without clear rules and guidance and without clear oversight  by Congress and the Department of Justice. We know that special  counsels are different. They are constrained by regulations and are  overseen by senior lawyers at the Department of Justice, and in the  case of Director Mueller, by the Deputy Attorney General himself. It  would be useful if our friends across the aisle would acknowledge this  difference and this history.   A new poll has shown that significant majorities of voters in States  such as North Dakota, West Virginia, and Indiana all want to see Judge  Kavanaugh confirmed. Support is even stronger among Independents. I  expect that as more Americans get to know him in the weeks ahead, those  numbers will rise.   This nomination for a vacancy on the Supreme Court is Chairman  Grassley's 15th Supreme Court confirmation hearing, and I have no doubt  that when he says this one will be the most searching and thorough of  all of them, he means it.   I look forward to working with all of our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee to ensure that Judge Kavanaugh has a full and fair hearing,  and not pull any punches whatsoever, but if the object is to delay for  delay's sake or to criticize for criticism's sake, we intend to call  that out during this process.   Based on what I have read and seen so far, I believe Judge Kavanaugh  will ultimately be confirmed.             Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States    Mr. President, there is one other item of business I want to mention,  and it is some very good news we received yesterday. The House and  Senate conferees announced an agreement on the National Defense  Authorization Act, the NDAA. I am glad to hear that the final version  included legislation I sponsored called FIRRMA, the Foreign Investment  Risk Review Modernization Act. The senior Senator from California, Mrs.  Feinstein, was my bipartisan cosponsor.   I thank Senator Crapo, the chairman of the Banking Committee, who  ushered this legislation through that committee, where it passed  unanimously, and Senator Inhofe for leading the conference here on the  Senate side and seeing that this important piece of legislation was  included.   In June, President Trump called on Congress to pass a strong piece of  legislation to modernize what is known as the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Now we are going to do  exactly that. The Senate version of the bill updates CFIUS so we can  guard against attempts--primarily by China but not only by China--to  acquire sensitive dual-use technology and know-how by exploiting gaps  in the U.S. rules on foreign investments.   This legislation takes a carefully tailored approach to updating the  review process without hamstringing our ability to meaningfully engage  in trade with partners around the world. It is not anti-foreign  investment--just the opposite is true--but it is all about protecting  our crown jewels when it comes to leading-edge technology that can be  easily acquired through creative investment strategies, and then, along  with the intellectual property and know-how, our competitors, such as  China, can gain tremendous advantage.   I appreciate the support we have gotten from Secretary Mnuchin, our  Treasury Secretary; Secretary Mattis, the Secretary of Defense; and  many others. I again thank Senator Feinstein for being the chief  Democratic cosponsor. This has been a bipartisan effort from day one.   The message is, we simply can't let China erode our national security  advantage by circumventing our laws and exploiting investment  opportunities for nefarious purposes. The backdoor transfer of  technology, know-how, and industrial capabilities has gone unchecked  for too long. That is why I am glad that once our bill becomes law, a  newer, stronger CFIUS process will better protect us from evolving,  investment-driven threats to our national security.
