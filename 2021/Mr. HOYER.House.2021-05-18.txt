 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, there is no place in America for hate. Well, at least  there should be no place in America for hate. There should be no place  in our country for exclusion, for bigotry, or racial violence.   And, frankly, I tell my friend from Texas, it is not enough just to  say that we are against that. We need to do something. This bill takes  a step to doing something.   Disturbingly, over the past few years, we have seen these evils  emerge out of their dark hiding places. While we have always struggled  as a nation to confront hatred and injustice, this past year we have  been tested in ways we have not seen in some period of time.   Madam Speaker, in particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an  onslaught of hatred directed against Asian Americans, and other  minorities as well. These men and women, our fellow citizens, have  endured vile words and violent blows. They have been made to feel  unsafe and made to feel apart.   Congress is taking action today, led by my friends Senator Hirono,  Representative Meng, Representative Beyer, and Representative Chu. I am  so proud to align myself with their efforts to make it clear that hate  crimes against Asian Americans will be prosecuted to the fullest extent  possible and that they will never be tolerated in our country, ever, as  they have been tolerated too often in the past.   Representative Chu, as chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus, has put forward a resolution condemning the deadly  shootings in Atlanta in March, which killed six Asian-American women  and two others. I am strongly supporting both her resolution and  Senator Hirono's hate crimes legislation, which has already passed the  Senate, 94-1. Mr. Hawley of Missouri was the sole exception, the  Senator who gave thumbs-up to the insurrectionists.    That bill is the companion to Representative Meng's legislation, and  she has instructed my office she wants to see this adopted as soon as  possible. We would have brought her bill to the floor, but she said,  no, let's do the Senate bill because it can move more quickly. And she  deserves full credit for bringing this issue forward.   Madam Speaker, I commend her for her tireless efforts to stand up  against hate targeting in the Asian-American community and in every  other community--indivisible, one Nation.   Together, as the Nation's representatives, we must make it absolutely  clear that racism and intolerance have no home here in America. Very  frankly, the people who look at this vote will not parse it. They will  interpret it as those who are against hate and those who thought this  bill wasn't perfect in saying that we are against hate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in sending that message  with a strong bipartisan vote on both of these measures. Let us reject  hate and remind our Asian-American brothers and sisters that we are one  Nation indivisible, standing together and building our common future  together.   We haven't always been that Nation. We haven't always been the  perfect union to which we inspire. Too often, we have held others who  are not like us as less than us. That has been a tragedy of mankind  wherever one lived. This is a small step, but it is an important step.  Let's take it.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 5 of House Resolution  403, I move to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 144, H.R. 204, H.R. 210,  H.R. 240, H.R. 707, H.R. 711, H.R. 1157, H.R. 1447, H.R. 1510, H.R.  1711, H.R. 2027, H.R. 2167, H.R. 2441, H.R. 2494, H.R. 2533, H.R. 2655,  H.R. 2695, H.R. 2704, H.R. 2788, H.R. 2878, and H.R. 3008.   The Clerk read the title of the bills.   The text of the bills are as follows:                   Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act                                  H.R. 144         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Early-Career       Researchers Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Nation's universities and industrial research labs       are facing unprecedented budget pressure as part of the       COVID-19 health crisis, resulting in considerably fewer       openings for research and teaching positions.        (2) Emergency funding is needed to forestall the loss of       research talent likely to occur if early-career researchers       are forced to seek employment outside of research due to the       sharp economic decline caused by the COVID-19 health crisis.        (3) The future of America's defense will rely on advanced       technologies to maintain its military superiority over its       rivals, including China. These technologies will require new       levels of scientific and engineering aptitude and       understanding. Early career researchers will play a critical       role in the development of these technologies, and the loss       of an entire generation of researchers due to the COVID-19       pandemic will be detrimental to the United States national       security.       SEC. 3. EARLY-CAREER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--The Director of the National Science       Foundation may establish a 2-year pilot program to award       grants to highly qualified early-career investigators to       carry out an independent research program at the qualified       institution of higher education chosen by such investigator,       to last for a period not greater than 2 years.        (b) Selection Process.--The Director of the National       Science Foundation shall select grantees under subsection (a)       from among citizens, nationals, and lawfully admitted       permanent resident aliens of the United States.        (c) Outreach.--The Director shall conduct program outreach       to recruit fellowship applicants--        (1) from all regions of the country;        (2) from historically underrepresented populations in the       fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;       and        (3) who graduate from or intend to carry out research at a       variety of types of institutions of higher education,       including--        (A) Historically Black Colleges and Universities;        (B) Hispanic-Serving Institutions;        (C) Tribal Colleges and Universities; and        (D) institutions of higher education that are not among the       top 50 institutions in annual Federal funding for research.        (d) Special Consideration.--The Director shall give special       consideration to an application from an individual who       graduated from or is intending to carry out research at an       institution of the type listed in subsection (c)(3).        (e) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the conclusion of       the second year of the pilot program, the Director shall       submit a report to Congress that includes--        (1) statistical summary data on fellowship awardees       disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, age, years since       completion of doctoral degree, and institution type;        (2) an assessment, drawing on feedback from the research       community and other sources of information, of the       effectiveness of the pilot program for mitigating the loss of       research talent due to the pandemic; and        (3) if determined effective, a plan for permanent       implementation of the pilot program.        (f) Qualified Institution of Higher Education Defined.--The       term ``qualified institution of higher education'' has the       meaning given the term in section 102 of the Higher Education       of Act of 1965, except that such term does not include an       institution described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of such       section.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director of       the National Science Foundation $250,000,000 for each of       fiscal years 2021 through 2022 to carry out the activities in       this Act.                            STEM Opportunities Act                                  H.R. 204         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``STEM       Opportunities Act''.

(c) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) Many reports over the past decade have found that it is       critical to our Nation's economic leadership and global       competitiveness that the United States educates and trains       more scientists and engineers.        (2) Research shows that women and minorities who are       interested in STEM careers are disproportionately lost at       nearly every educational transition and at every career       milestone.        (3) The National Center for Science and Engineering       Statistics at the National Science Foundation collects,       compiles, analyzes, and publishes data on the demographics of       STEM degrees and STEM jobs in the United States.        (4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of all STEM bachelor's       degrees, but major variations persist among fields. In 2017,       women earned only 20 percent of all bachelor's degrees       awarded in engineering and 19 percent of bachelor's degrees       awarded in computer sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor       Statistics data, jobs in computing occupations are expected       to account for nearly 60 percent of the projected annual       growth of newly created STEM job openings from 2016 to 2026.        (5) In 2017, underrepresented minority groups comprised 39       percent of the college-age population of the United States,       but only 18 percent of students who earned bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields. The Higher Education Research Institute at       the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while       freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an       interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same       rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino       students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8       percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields       complete their degree within 5 years, compared to       approximately 33 percent of White students and 42 percent of       Asian students who complete their degree within 5 years.        (6) In some STEM fields, including the computer sciences,       women persist at about the same rate through doctorate       degrees. In other STEM fields, women persist through       doctorate degrees at a lower rate. In mathematics, women earn       just 26 percent of doctorate degrees compared with 42 percent       of undergraduate degrees. Overall, women earned 38 percent of       STEM doctorate degrees in 2016. The rate of minority students       earning STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9 percent,       compared with 15 percent for bachelor's degree. Students from       underrepresented minority groups accounted for only 11.5       percent of STEM doctorate degrees awarded in 2016.        (7) The representation of women in STEM drops significantly       from the doctorate degree level to the faculty level.       Overall, women hold only 26 percent of all tenured and       tenure-track positions and 27 percent of full professor       positions in STEM fields in our Nation's universities and 4-      year colleges. Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about       6.8 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 7.5       percent of full professor positions. Many of the numbers in       the  [[Page H2483]]       American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or       Other Pacific Islander categories for different faculty ranks       were too small for the National Science Foundation to report       publicly without potentially compromising confidential       information about the individuals being surveyed.        (8) The representation of women is especially low at our       Nation's top research universities. Even in the biological       sciences, in which women now earn more than 50 percent of the       doctorates and passed the 25 percent level 37 years ago,       women make up only 25 percent of the full professors at the       approximately 100 most research-intensive universities in the       United States. In the physical sciences and mathematics,       women make up only 11 percent of full professors, in computer       sciences only 10 percent, and across engineering fields only       7 percent. The data suggest that approximately 6 percent of       all tenure-track STEM faculty members at the most research-      intensive universities are from underrepresented minority       groups, but in some fields the numbers are too small to       report publicly.        (9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities will comprise 52       percent of the college-age population of the United States.       If the percentage of female students and students from       underrepresented minority groups earning bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields does not significantly increase, the United       States will face an acute shortfall in the overall number of       students who earn degrees in STEM fields just as United       States companies are increasingly seeking students with those       skills. With this impending shortfall, the United States will       almost certainly lose its competitive edge in the 21st       century global economy.        (10) According to a 2014 Association for Women in Science       survey of over 4,000 scientists across the globe, 70 percent       of whom were men, STEM researchers face significant       challenges in work-life integration. Researchers in the       United States were among the most likely to experience a       conflict between work and their personal life at least       weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed said that ensuring       good work-life integration has negatively impacted their       careers, and, of researchers intending to leave their current       job within the next year, 9 percent indicated it was because       they were unable to balance work and life demands.        (11) Female students and students from underrepresented       minority groups at institutions of higher education who see       few others ``like themselves'' among faculty and student       populations often do not experience the social integration       that is necessary for success in all disciplines, including       STEM.        (12) One in five children in the United States attend       school in a rural community. The data shows that rural       students are at a disadvantage with respect to STEM       readiness. Among STEM-interested students, 17 percent of       students in rural high schools and 18 percent of students in       town-located high schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark,       compared with 33 percent of students in suburban high schools       and 27 percent of students in urban high schools.        (13) A substantial body of evidence establishes that most       people hold implicit biases. Decades of cognitive psychology       research reveal that most people carry prejudices of which       they are unaware but that nonetheless play a large role in       evaluations of people and their work. Unintentional biases       and outmoded institutional structures are hindering the       access and advancement of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in STEM.        (14) Workshops held to educate faculty about unintentional       biases have demonstrated success in raising awareness of such       biases.        (15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity       of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this       Act referred to as ``NASA'') completed a report that--        (A) is specifically designed to help NASA grant recipients       identify why the dearth of women in STEM fields continues and       to ensure that it is not due to discrimination; and        (B) provides guidance that is usable by all institutions of       higher education receiving significant Federal research       funding on how to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of       campus culture and policies.        (16) The Federal Government provides 55 percent of research       funding at institutions of higher education and, through its       grant-making policies, has had significant influence on       institution of higher education policies, including policies       related to institutional culture and structure.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are as follows:        (1) To ensure that Federal science agencies and       institutions of higher education receiving Federal research       and development funding are fully engaging the entire talent       pool of the United States.        (2) To promote research on, and increase understanding of,       the participation and trajectories of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in STEM studies       and careers, including persons with disabilities, older       learners, veterans, and rural, poor, and tribal populations,       at institutions of higher education and Federal science       agencies, including Federal laboratories.        (3) To raise awareness within Federal science agencies,       including Federal laboratories, and institutions of higher       education about cultural and institutional barriers limiting       the recruitment, retention, promotion, and other indicators       of participation and achievement of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in academic and       Government STEM research careers at all levels.        (4) To identify, disseminate, and implement best practices       at Federal science agencies, including Federal laboratories,       and at institutions of higher education to remove or reduce       cultural and institutional barriers limiting the recruitment,       retention, and success of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in academic and Government STEM       research careers.        (5) To provide grants to institutions of higher education       to recruit, retain, and advance STEM faculty members from       underrepresented minority groups and to implement or expand       reforms in undergraduate STEM education in order to increase       the number of students from underrepresented minority groups       receiving degrees in these fields.       SEC. 3. FEDERAL SCIENCE AGENCY POLICIES FOR CAREGIVERS.         (a) OSTP Guidance.--Not later than 6 months after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Director, in consultation with       relevant agencies, shall provide guidance to each Federal       science agency to establish policies that--        (1) apply to all--        (A) research awards granted by such agency; and        (B) principal investigators of such research and their       trainees, including postdoctoral researchers and graduate       students, who have caregiving responsibilities, including       care for a newborn or newly adopted child and care for an       immediate family member who is sick or disabled; and        (2) provide--        (A) flexibility in timing for the initiation of approved       research awards granted by such agency;        (B) no-cost extensions of such research awards;        (C) grant supplements, as appropriate, to research awards       for research technicians or equivalent positions to sustain       research activities conducted under such awards; and        (D) any other appropriate accommodations at the discretion       of the director of each such agency.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rural STEM Education       Research Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The supply of STEM workers is not keeping pace with the       rapidly evolving needs of the public and private sector,       resulting in a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills       shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) Many STEM occupations offer higher wages, more       opportunities for advancement, and a higher degree of job       security than non-STEM jobs.        (4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United States who       live in rural settings are significantly under-represented in       STEM.        (5) According to the National Center for Education       Statistics, nine million students in the United States--      nearly 20 percent of the total K-12 population--attend rural       schools, and for reasons ranging from teacher quality to       shortages of resources, these students often have fewer       opportunities for high-quality STEM learning than their peers       in the Nation's urban and suburban schools.        (6) Rural areas represent one of the most promising, yet       underutilized, opportunities for STEM education to impact       workforce development and regional innovation, including       agriculture.        (7) The study of agriculture, food, and natural resources       involves biology, engineering, physics, chemistry, math,       geology, computer science, and other scientific fields.        (8) Employment in computer and information technology       occupations is projected to grow 11 percent from 2019 to       2029. To help meet this demand, it is important rural       students have the opportunity to acquire computing skills       through exposure to computer science learning in grades Pre-K       through 12 and in informal learning settings.        (9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the United States       use high-speed broadband to work, learn, access healthcare,       and operate their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals in       the United States still lack access to high-speed broadband.       Rural areas are hardest hit, with over 26 percent of       individuals in rural areas in the United States lacking       access to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 percent of       individuals in urban areas in the United States.

Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act                                  H.R. 707         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ghost Army Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, comprised of the       23d Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Special Troops,       the 603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th Combat       Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal Service Company and the       Signal Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and       the 3133d Signal Service Company were top-secret units of the       United States Army that served in Europe during World War II.        (2) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, was actively       engaged in battlefield operations from June of 1944 through       March of 1945. The 3133d Signal Service Company was engaged       in operations in Italy in 1945.        (3) The deceptive activities of these units were integral       to several Allied victories across Europe and reduced       American casualties.        (4) In evaluating the performance of these units after the       War, a U.S. Army analysis found that ``Rarely, if ever, has       there been a group of such a few men which had so great an       influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''.        (5) Many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen-soldiers       recruited from art schools, advertising agencies,       communications companies, and other creative and technical       professions.        (6) The first four members of the 23d Headquarters, Special       Troops, landed on D-Day and two became casualties while       creating false beach landing sites.        (7) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, secret deception       operations commenced in France on June 14, 1944, when Task       Force Mason, a 17-man detachment of the 23d led by First       Lieutenant Bernard Mason, landed at Omaha Beach. Task Force       Mason conducted Operation ELEPHANT between 1 and 4 July,       1944, to draw enemy fire and protect the 980th Field       Artillery Battalion (VIII Corps) as part of the Normandy       Campaign.        (8) Operation ELEPHANT was a prelude to 21 full-scale       tactical deceptions completed by the 23d Headquarters,       Special Troops.        (9) Often operating on or near the front lines, the 23d       Headquarters, Special Troops, used inflatable tanks,       artillery, airplanes and other vehicles, advanced engineered       soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio trickery to create       the illusion of sizable American forces where there were none       and to draw the enemy away from Allied troops.        (10) The 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service Companies,       activated in Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York, at the Army       Experimental Station in March 1944, were the only two active       duty ``sonic deception'' ground combat units in World War II.        (11) Soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops,       impersonated other, larger Army units by sewing counterfeit       patches onto their uniforms, painting false markings on their       vehicles, and creating phony headquarters staffed by fake       generals, all in an effort to feed false information to Axis       spies.        (12) During the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d Headquarters,       Special Troops, created counterfeit radio traffic to mask the       efforts of General George Patton's Third Army as it mobilized       to break through to the 101st Airborne and elements of 10th       Armored Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne.        (13) In its final mission, Operation VIERSEN, in March       1945, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, conducted a       tactical deception that drew German units down the Rhine       River and away from the Ninth Army, allowing the Ninth Army       to cross the Rhine into Germany. On this mission, the 1,100       men of the Ghost Army, with the assistance of other units,       impersonated forty thousand men, or two complete divisions of       American forces, by using fabricated radio networks,       soundtracks of construction work and artillery fire, and more       than 600 inflatable vehicles. According to a military       intelligence officer of the 79th Infantry, ``There is no       doubt that Operation VIERSEN materially assisted in deceiving       the enemy with regard to the real dispositions and intentions       of this Army.''.        (14) Three soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special       Troops, gave their lives and dozens were injured in carrying       out their mission.        (15) In April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service Company       conducted Operation CRAFTSMAN in support of Operation SECOND       WIND, the successful allied effort to break through the       German defensive position to the north of Florence, Italy,       known as the Gothic Line. Along with an attached platoon of       British engineers, who were inflatable decoy specialists, the       3133d Signal Service Company used sonic deception to       misrepresent troop locations along this defensive line.  [[Page H2490]]         (16) The activities of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops       and the 3133d Signal Service Company remained highly       classified for more than forty years after the war and were       never formally recognized. The extraordinary accomplishments       of this unit are deserving of belated official recognition.        (17) The United States is eternally grateful to the       soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and the       3133d Signal Service Company for their proficient use of       innovative tactics throughout World War II, which saved lives       and made significant contributions to the defeat of the Axis       powers.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the       23d Headquarters, Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal       Service Company, known as the ``Ghost Army'', collectively,       in recognition of its unique and incredible service during       World War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Smithsonian Institution.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in       honor of the Ghost Army, the gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for       display as appropriate and available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,       particularly at appropriate locations associated with the       Ghost Army, and that preference should be given to locations       affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient       to cover the costs of the medal, including labor, materials,       dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDAL.         The gold medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national       medal for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States       Code.       SEC. 6.

It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) United States global engagement is key to a stable and       prosperous world;        (2) United States leadership is indispensable in light of       the many complex and interconnected threats facing the United       States and the world;        (3) diplomacy and development are critical tools of       national power, and full deployment of these tools is vital       to United States national security;        (4) challenges such as the global refugee and migration       crises, terrorism, historic famine and food insecurity, and       fragile or repressive societies cannot be addressed without       sustained and robust United States diplomatic and development       leadership;        (5) the United States Government must use all of the       instruments of national security and foreign policy at its       disposal to protect United States citizens, promote United       States interests and values, and support global stability and       prosperity;        (6) United States security and prosperity depend on having       partners and allies that share our interests and values, and       these partnerships are nurtured and our shared interests and       values are promoted through United States diplomatic       engagement, security cooperation, economic statecraft, and       assistance that helps further economic development, good       governance, including the rule of law and democratic       institutions, and the development of shared responses to       natural and humanitarian disasters;        (7) as the United States Government agencies primarily       charged with conducting diplomacy and development, the       Department and the United States Agency for International       Development (USAID) require sustained and robust funding to       carry out this important work, which is essential to our       ability to project United States leadership and values and to       advance United States interests around the world;        (8) the work of the Department and USAID makes the United       States and the world safer and more prosperous by alleviating       global poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other       infectious diseases, strengthening alliances, expanding       educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting good       governance and democracy, supporting anti-corruption efforts,       driving economic development and trade, preventing armed       conflicts and humanitarian crises, and creating American jobs       and export opportunities;        (9) the Department and USAID are vital national security       agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United       States power and leadership worldwide, and without which       Americans would be less safe, United States economic power       would be diminished, and global stability and prosperity       would suffer;        (10) investing in diplomacy and development before       conflicts break out saves American lives while also being       cost-effective; and        (11) the contributions of personnel working at the       Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow       the United States to maintain its leadership around the       world.

SEC. 1008. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRAINING TO NATIONAL                     SECURITY.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Department is a crucial national security agency,       whose employees, both Foreign and Civil Service, require the       best possible training at every stage of their careers to       prepare them to promote and defend United States national       interests and the health and safety of United States citizens       abroad;        (2) the Department of State's investment of time and       resources with respect to the training and education of its       personnel is considerably below the level of other Federal       departments and agencies in the national security field, and       falls well below the investments many allied and adversarial       countries make in the development of their diplomats;        (3) the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly       evolving challenges, many of which are science and       technology-driven, and which demand the continual, high-      quality training and education of its personnel;        (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on ``on-the-      job training'' and other informal mentorship practices, which       lead to an inequality in skillset development and career       advancement opportunities, often particularly for minority       personnel, and towards a robust professional tradecraft       training continuum that will provide for greater equality in       career advancement and increase minority participation in the       senior ranks;  [[Page H2493]]         (5) the Department's Foreign Service Institute and other       training facilities should seek to substantially increase its       educational and training offerings to Department personnel,       including developing new and innovative educational and       training courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; and        (6) consistent with existing Department gift acceptance       authority and other applicable laws, the Department and       Foreign Service Institute may accept funds and other       resources from foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and       other appropriate sources to help the Department and the       Institute enhance the quantity and quality of training       offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative,       and pilot model courses.        (b) Training Float.--Not later than 90 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       develop and submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a strategy to establish a ``training float'' to       allow for up to 15 percent of the Civil and Foreign Service       to participate in long-term training at any given time. The       strategy should identify steps necessary to ensure       implementation of the training priorities identified in       subsection (c), sufficient training capacity and       opportunities are available to Civil and Foreign Service       officers, equitable distribution of long-term training       opportunities to Civil and Foreign Service officers, and any       additional resources or authorities necessary to facilitate       such a training float, including programs at the George P.       Schultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, the Foreign       Service Institute, the Foreign Affairs Security Training       Center, and other facilities or programs operated by the       Department of State. The strategy shall identify which types       of training would be prioritized, the extent (if any) to       which such training is already being provided to Civil and       Foreign Service officers by the Department of State, any       factors incentivizing or disincentivizing such training, and       why such training cannot be achieved without Civil and       Foreign Service officers leaving the workforce. In addition       to training opportunities provided by the Department, the       strategy shall consider training that could be provided by       the other United States Government training institutions, as       well as non-governmental educational institutions. The       strategy shall consider approaches to overcome disincentives       to pursuing long-term training.        (c) Prioritization.--In order to provide the Civil and       Foreign Service with the level of education and training       needed to effectively advance United States interests across       the globe, the Department of State should--        (1) increase its offerings--        (A) of virtual instruction to make training more accessible       to personnel deployed throughout the world; or        (B) at partner organizations to provide useful outside       perspectives to Department personnel;        (2) offer courses utilizing computer-based or assisted       simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decision-      making in a crisis environment; and        (3) consider increasing the duration and expanding the       focus of certain training courses, including--        (A) the A-100 orientation course for Foreign Service       officers, and        (B) the chief of mission course to more accurately reflect       the significant responsibilities accompanying such role.        (d) Other Agency Responsibilities.--Other national security       agencies should increase the enrollment of their personnel in       courses at the Foreign Service Institute and other Department       of State training facilities to promote a whole-of-government       approach to mitigating national security challenges.

(5) A written explanation if any of the documentation       necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as       the case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4)       cannot be provided.

MSI STEM Achievement Act                                 H.R. 2027         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``MSI STEM Achievement Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Evidence suggests that the supply of STEM workers is       not keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the       public and private sector, resulting in a deficit often       referred to as a STEM skills shortage.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need one million additional STEM professionals       than it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, more opportunities       for advancement, and a higher degree of job security than       non-STEM occupations.        (4) The composition of the STEM workforce does not reflect       the current or projected diversity of the Nation, with       Hispanics, African Americans, and other racial and ethnic       minorities, significantly underrepresented in the STEM       workforce compared to their presence in the workforce more       generally.        (5) A stronger national commitment to increasing the       diversity of the STEM workforce is needed to help address the       STEM skills shortage.        (6) According to a 2019 National Academies of Sciences,       Engineering, and Medicine report entitled ``Minority Serving       Institutions: America's Underutilized Resource for       Strengthening the STEM Workforce'', 2- and 4-year minority       serving institutions enroll nearly 30 percent of all       undergraduate students--a percentage that is expected to grow       in the coming years--in the United States higher education       system and play a critical role in providing important       pathways to STEM-related education, training, and careers for       students of color.        (7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly successful at       educating underrepresented minority students in STEM fields       and can serve as best practice models for other colleges and       universities to further expand participation of       underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce.        (8) Increased investment in STEM infrastructure at HBCUs,       TCUs, and MSIs has the potential to increase these       institutions' ability to educate even more students in the       STEM disciplines.        (9) With the demand for STEM skills exceeding the supply of       STEM graduates, success of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in educating       and training science and engineering leaders is increasingly       important for United States economic growth and       competitiveness.       SEC. 3. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REVIEW.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       report to Congress--        (1) an inventory of competitive funding programs and       initiatives carried out by Federal science agencies that are       targeted to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs or partnerships with HBCUs,       TCUs, and MSIs;        (2) an assessment of Federal science agency outreach       activities to increase the participation and competitiveness       of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in the funding programs and       initiatives identified in paragraph (1); and        (3) recommendations of the Comptroller General to increase       the participation of and the rate of success of HBCUs, TCUs,       and MSIs in competitive funding programs offered by Federal       science agencies.

National Estuaries and Acidification Research Act of 2021                                 H.R. 2533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Estuaries and       Acidification Research Act of 2021'' or the ``NEAR Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Ocean acidification impacts human health, natural       resources, and the environmental, economic, and recreational       uses of the coastline.        (2) The current understanding of ocean acidification       impacts on estuarine ecosystems is inadequate to fully       prepare and manage for changing environmental conditions in       nearshore locations.        (3) While pH can be measured with high precision and       accuracy in open ocean environments, more understanding of       the carbonate system in estuarine ecosystems is needed for       precise and accurate measurements and observations.        (4) The interaction of multiple stressors, including       salinity, pH, temperature, sea level rise, and nutrient       input, within estuarine ecosystems is inadequately understood       for managing the health, economic, recreational, and       environmental impacts driven by these interactions.        (5) A better understanding is needed of how anthropogenic       influences in coastal environments affect estuarine       ecosystems.        (6) More integration and coordination is needed among       regional, national, and global environmental observations in       estuarine environments, supporting prior investments in       related topics such as nutrient loading, hypoxia, ocean       acidification, and harmful algae bloom research and       observational systems.       SEC. 3. STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND                     OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON ESTUARINE                     ENVIRONMENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall make       appropriate arrangements with the National Academies of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (referred to in this Act       as the ``National Academies'') under which the National       Academies shall conduct a study that--        (1) examines the existing science of ocean acidification in       estuarine environments;        (2) examines the challenges to studying ocean acidification       and ocean acidification's interactions with other environment       stressors in estuarine environments;        (3) provides recommendations for improving future research       with respect to ocean acidification in estuarine       environments; and        (4) identifies pathways for applying science in management       and mitigation decisions relating to ocean acidification in       estuarine environments.        (b) Contents of Study.--The study described under       subsection (a) shall include--        (1) the behavior of the carbonate system within estuarine       environments;        (2) the interactions of the carbonate system with other       biotic and abiotic characteristics of estuarine ecosystems;        (3) how environmental and anthropogenic changes or       disturbances could affect abiotic and biotic processes within       estuaries;        (4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic processes will be       affected under predicted environmental changes;        (5) the current state of data collection, interpretation,       storage, and retrieval and observational infrastructure of       abiotic and biotic parameters in estuarine ecosystems;  [[Page H2515]]         (6) the gaps that exist in understanding the socio-economic       and health impacts of ocean acidification in estuaries;        (7) future directions for scientific research; and        (8) pathways for applying science in management and       mitigation decisions.        (c) Report.--In entering into an arrangement under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall request that the National       Academies transmit to Congress a report on the results of the       study not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.

Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act                                 H.R. 2695         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Combating       Sexual Harassment in Science Act''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. Research grants. Sec. 5. Data collection. Sec. 6. Responsible conduct guide. Sec. 7. Interagency working group. Sec. 8. National academies assessment. Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the report issued by the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018       entitled ``Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and       Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and       Medicine''--        (A) sexual harassment is pervasive in institutions of       higher education;        (B) the most common type of sexual harassment is gender       harassment, which includes verbal and nonverbal behaviors       that convey insulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about       members of one gender;        (C) 58 percent of individuals in the academic workplace       experience sexual harassment, the second highest rate when       compared to the military, the private sector, and Federal,       State, and local government;        (D) women who are members of racial or ethnic minority       groups are more likely to experience sexual harassment and to       feel unsafe at work than White women, White men, or men who       are members of such groups;        (E) the training for each individual who has a doctor of       philosophy in the science, technology, engineering, and       mathematics fields is estimated to cost approximately       $500,000; and        (F) attrition of an individual so trained results in a loss       of talent and money.        (2) Sexual harassment undermines career advancement for       women.        (3) According to a 2017 University of Illinois study, among       astronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of women who       are members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 12       percent of White women skipped professional events because       they did not feel safe attending.        (4) Many women report leaving employment at institutions of       higher education due to sexual harassment.        (5) Research shows the majority of individuals do not       formally report experiences of sexual harassment due to a       justified fear of retaliation or other negative professional       or personal consequences.        (6) Reporting procedures with respect to such harassment       are inconsistent among  [[Page H2516]]       Federal science agencies and have varying degrees of       accessibility.        (7) There is not adequate communication among Federal       science agencies and between such agencies and grantees       regarding reports of sexual harassment, which has resulted in       harassers receiving Federal funding after moving to a       different institution.
