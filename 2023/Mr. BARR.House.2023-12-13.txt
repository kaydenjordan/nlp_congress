 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a proud Kentuckian, a  great American patriot, and my great-uncle, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.)  Francis D. Faulconer, who passed away on October 19 at the age of 100.   My grandfather's younger brother was better known to many of us in  central Kentucky as Fearless Frank Faulconer, the first weatherman for  WKYT, later WTVQ, and finally WKQQ, where he delivered for us the  weekly ``Fearless Frank's Five Day Forecast.''   What many don't know, however, is that before he became our  weatherman, Frank had a distinguished military career.   After graduation from Lafayette High School in 1941, he enlisted in  the United States Army in 1943 and took basic training at Camp Crowder,  Missouri, a signal training facility. Overseas in Europe in 1944,  Faulconer was transferred to the Liaison G3 Section of the First United  States Army. In this capacity, he traveled with Combat Command A of the  3rd Armored ``Spearhead'' Division from Meaux, France, to Roetgen,  Germany.   Service in the European theater of operation earned him five Bronze  Stars for his service in Normandy, northern France, Rhineland, Central  Europe, and the Ardennes.   Additionally, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award for  helping to escort the reserve elements of the combat command at night,  from the rear to the forward elements of the battle line.  [[Page H6874]]    I will always remember my uncle telling me about tearing down Nazi  swastikas from the churches along the battlefront so that American  flags could signal the path of liberation.   Frank has now taken his rightful place in Heaven and in the history  books, chronicling the story of American freedom alongside his beloved  brother, my grandfather, Major General J. B. Faulconer, Army veteran of  the Pacific theater, with the millions of other heroes of the Greatest  Generation.   God bless all these heroes. We thank them for their service and for  serving as a continual and powerful reminder to all of us that freedom  requires sacrifice. It must be fought for.   May their example, the example of the Greatest Generation, always  inspire us to continually fight for freedom and democracy.                            ____________________
