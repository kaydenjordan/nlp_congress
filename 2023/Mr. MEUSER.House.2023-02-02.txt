 Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman very much for his  leadership on what is a very important subject.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to support the simple yet necessary  resolution to denounce the inevitable corruption of socialism and the  suffering, death, and destruction it has brought upon hundreds of  millions of people throughout the world since its inception.   Our Founding Fathers built our Nation on the principles of freedom  and liberty, which leads to a free market economy, all tenets that  stand directly counter to the ideas and ideals of socialism.   Capitalism has produced prosperity for generations of Americans and  has shaped the American Dream that so many have sought by immigrating  to America for centuries.   Mr. Speaker, how many are fleeing capitalist countries like the  United States for socialist countries, I ask?   Overtaxed economies backfire. They have no growth, prosperity,  quality of life, or advancements in medicine, food, housing, or  education. Overregulation stifles business throughout national and  global markets and, on the State side, gives States like Florida and  Texas--and good for them--a great advantage over overregulated and  overtaxed States.   Historically, obvious metrics and clear results prove that capitalism  is far better for all societies, especially the United States of  America.   As President Reagan said, socialism only works in two places: Heaven  where they don't need it, and hell where they already have it.   Socialist governments culminate with absolute power, and absolute  power corrupts absolutely.
