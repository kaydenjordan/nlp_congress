 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4998, the Secure and Trusted  Communications Networks Act.   We must protect our critical communications infrastructure from  vulnerabilities, and today we are taking further steps to remove  suspected equipment from our networks and ensure its overall security  going forward.   This bill takes into account important concerns we have heard from  small, rural providers that were previously unaware of possible  security risks when selecting vendors and making purchasing decisions.  H.R. 4998 will help fix this information gap by ensuring they have  access to the information they need to keep their networks and  Americans secure.   It should not matter where you are trying to connect, whether you are  in rural America or anywhere else. We must ensure the entire  communications system is protected from bad actors.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4998, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4779, the U.S. SAFE WEB Act.  H.R. 4779 extends the U.S. SAFE WEB Act through 2027 and requires the  Federal Trade Commission to submit a report detailing how the  commission has used the program, how many cross-border  [[Page H10287]]  complaints the commission has received and acted upon, the  identification of foreign agencies the commission has cooperated with  on enforcement actions, the litigation the commission has brought in  foreign courts, and any recommendations the commission may have to  advance its international mission.   The SAFE WEB Act ensures the FTC has the tools it needs to protect  American consumers from foreign bad actors with respect to data  privacy, data breaches, spyware, spam, robocalls, and the like. This is  an important program to ensure cross-border data flows that are  critical for our small businesses to have a global reach in our ever- connected world. This act also reinforces our efforts to set a strong  Federal standard for consumer privacy to show the world we are united  in this undertaking.   I want to thank the Republican leader of the Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee, Mrs. Rodgers; Dr. Bucshon; Ms. Kelly; and the  chair, Chair Schakowsky, for their bipartisan work to extend this  critical program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and seeing  that I have no further speakers, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the chair for her work  on this legislation. I urge support of H.R. 4779 from this House, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Broadband DATA  Act.   Over the last several Congresses, I have been focused on improving  our broadband availability maps, so we not only inject fiscal  responsibility into our Federal programs but to also connect thousands  of my constituents who lack basic access to a meaningful internet  connection. As we approach the end of the second decade in the 21st  century, we must ensure all Americans are able to participate in the  digital economy.   Since passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the private sector  has invested roughly $1.7 trillion in their networks using different  technologies. This private investment in rural broadband deployment is  commendable and needed, but we must also make sure that government- supported solutions complement private investment instead of competing  with it. The Broadband DATA Act will do just that. It will improve our  Nation's coverage maps so that we can better pinpoint where internet  access is and where it isn't. This accuracy is vital in directing  Federal funds to communities that need it the most.   That is why I am pleased to see this important broadband mapping  legislation before us today. I have worked on this bill with my friends  across the aisle--specifically my good friend, the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Loebsack)--and in the Senate. I appreciate the renewed focus this  Congress has on improving the broadband maps because it is critically  important our future funding decisions are based upon data that is  verified, accurate, and granular.   As Members of Congress, we know our districts better than anyone, and  we hear from those who do not have service. When we compared our  knowledge with the existing maps, we recognized the need to take action  and fix the maps to reflect reality.   While the Broadband DATA Act will move us closer in that direction,  it is an evolving landscape and inevitably we will need to continually  evaluate their effectiveness. That is why this bill includes a robust,  user-friendly challenge process to appropriately dispute potential  inaccuracies within the coverage maps. The challenge process is yet  another layer to ensuring Federal funds are going to communities that  need it most and ultimately bridging the digital divide in Ohio and  across the entire Nation.   Mr. Speaker, today we are taking a meaningful step to promote  broadband deployment in rural America. I urge my colleagues to support  this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely important that we have rural  broadband access. It is not only to help our citizens but our students.  We have to make sure that our businesses and our farmers all have the  access they need to survive in this world that we live in today.   Mr. Speaker, I highly urge our Members of this House to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the MAPS Act. Combined  with H.R. 4229, the Broadband DATA Act, this bill will bring further  accountability to our broadband availability maps.   With millions of dollars directed toward broadband subsidies, it is  critical that those submitting coverage information to the Federal  Communications Commission do not intentionally mislead policymakers  with grossly inaccurate data.   This bill is intended to deter truly bad actors from overstating  their coverage, and it is an important piece to our overall goal to fix  our Nation's broadband maps.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the MAPS Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2647, the Safer Occupancy  Furniture Flammability Act, or SOFFA.   SOFFA adopts a national Federal standard for upholstered furniture.  [[Page H10293]]  SOFFA is important to ensure uniformity in the regulation of  flammability standards for upholstered furniture to avoid a patchwork  of State laws. This provides necessary certainty to the industry and  also safety for consumers who know, no matter what their ZIP Code is,  they will enjoy the same protections.   I am glad to see my friends across the aisle agree that the Federal  Government must act to establish a national standard here. This debate  is timely because we are having this very same discussion with respect  to online privacy.   As my good friends know, the internet knows no boundaries.  Upholstered furniture, like privacy, should enjoy a national standard  to avoid a patchwork of State laws.   If it makes sense here, it must make sense with privacy. We do not  want States regulating the internet differently. Consumer protections  should not depend on Zip Codes.   I am encouraged to see my colleagues agree today that, with  upholstered furniture, a national framework makes sense. I urge them to  apply the same to online privacy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) and  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith) for their bipartisan work on  this bill, and the chair, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), for her work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support SOFFA, H.R. 2647,  and pass this very important legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3172, the Safe Sleep for  Babies Act.   H.R. 3172 addresses the risk of suffocation that infants face related  to inclined sleepers. It bans all products with an inclined sleep  surface greater than 10 degrees to address tragic deaths related to  inclined sleepers. It also addresses the risk of suffocation infants  face related to padded crib bumpers.   I also want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas) for  his work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, the Safe Sleep for  Babies Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
