 Madam Chair, I point out that this is fentanyl  poisoning, and just because people use illicit drugs, they certainly  don't deserve to die from it.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the HALT Fentanyl Act. In  2022, roughly 75,000 Americans died from poisoning by synthetic  opioids, largely illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.   Illicit fentanyl poisonings are now the number one cause of death  among adults ages 18 to 49, as has been pointed out many times.   People who have died from illicit fentanyl poisoning are not just  statistics. They are someone's child, sibling, parent, family member,  or close friend. It is happening in every community across America. It  doesn't discriminate against socioeconomic class, race, or religion.   Just last week, a Federal grand jury indicted a man in Evansville,  Indiana, my hometown, for selling counterfeit prescription pills laced  with fentanyl over social media that caused at least three poisonings  and the death of a 19-year-old woman in 2022.   Last fall, a Federal grand jury indicted another man in Evansville  who sold fentanyl pills in 2021 that ended up killing a 3-year-old  toddler and resulted in nonfatal poisonings of two other children in a  home after they found illicit fentanyl pills in a nightstand and took  them.   These are heartbreaking stories, and we in this body have the power  to do something to help prevent more of them from occurring.   Let's pass the HALT Fentanyl Act and give hope to Americans whose  family, friends, and loved ones, who have been impacted by illicit  fentanyl poisonings, that their loved one's death was not in vain.  Support this bill.
