 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Lofgren and the vice chair  of the January 6 Select Committee, my colleague from Wyoming, Liz  Cheney, for their leadership in bringing this bill to us.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8873, the bipartisan  Presidential Election Reform Act. This bill makes important changes to  the laws that govern the cornerstone of our democracy, a peaceful  transfer of power.   These changes benefit no political party, and they do not give  political advantage to any particular candidate. This bill simply  protects the rule of law from those who would seek to upend it.   Our Republican colleagues who are opposed to this legislation, once  again find themselves on the side of violent extremists. Madam Speaker,  after what we saw on January 6 and what the Select Committee has  demonstrated, that those seeking to overturn the election were  exploiting the vulnerabilities in the law this bill remedies, I am not  sure how anyone could oppose this piece of legislation.   The choice before this body is clear: Protect the rule of law,  strengthen the Constitution, and vote against insurrection.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
