 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your friendship and your  kindness to the 435th most powerful person in Congress--that would be  me. I really do, brother, and I am going to miss you.   Mr. Speaker, after six terms representing Tennessee's First  Congressional District, Dr. Phil Roe is retiring at the end of this  year. Dr. Roe has focused his career in the House of Representatives on  fighting for our Nation's veterans and using his medical background to  tackle those tough healthcare issues.   As a matter of fact, during one of the State of the Union addresses,  someone dropped in the back. I turned back to Congressman Roe and I  said, ``Somebody has dropped,'' and before I could get ``dropped'' out  of my mouth, he was already out of the row providing medical care to  him.   When I arrived in Washington almost 2 years ago, Dr. Roe was the  first person to reach out and offer advice about serving in this  Chamber. He was a mentor throughout my first term, and we bonded over  our faith by attending weekly prayer breakfasts together. His  mentorship has quickly turned into a friendship over the last 2 years-- and he is an excellent guitar player, Mr. Speaker.   As a legislator, Dr. Roe has always looked out for America's brave  servicemen and -women. He served as chairman and lead Republican on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, helping pass bipartisan bills to improve  healthcare benefits for our brave veterans. Armed servicemembers  deserve the very best for their sacrifices, and Dr. Roe was always in  their corner.   Congress will be different next year without Dr. Roe, and I will miss  working with him on the issues most important to east Tennesseans.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Roe on a strong career in Congress,  and I wish him the very best in retirement.                       Congratulating Coach Gary Rankin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Coach Gary  Rankin and the Alcoa High School football team on their sixth  consecutive State championship title.   On Saturday, December 4, at the Tennessee Blue Cross Bowl, Alcoa  defeated Milan High in an impressive 35-0 shutout. This win marks the  Tornadoes' 19th State championship and Coach Rankin's 16th overall,  both of which are high school football records in Tennessee. It is  certainly a proud day to represent this team in the Halls of Congress.   Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, schools and their sports teams  had to adjust and readjust. Coach Rankin and his players were faced  with a season like none other, but they put in the hours, they  persevered, and they came out on top. This championship is a remarkable  achievement that I am sure this group of players will remember for the  rest of their lives.   I know I speak for many in east Tennessee when I say:  Congratulations, and go Tornadoes.                       Recognizing Bishop Richard Stika     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bishop  Richard Stika of the Knoxville Diocese. This week, Bishop Stika is  celebrating his 35th year as an ordained priest of the Catholic Church,  a remarkable career milestone.   Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Bishop Stika received a Catholic  education from elementary school through college. He capped off his  theological education by earning a master of divinity from Kenrick  Seminary.   Bishop Stika was ordained a priest on December 14, 1985, and for  nearly 24 years he served in several different parishes in the St.  Louis area. One of his greatest achievements during this time was  coordinating the visit of Pope John Paul II to St. Louis in 1999, Mr.  Speaker.   On March 19, 2009, he became bishop of the Knoxville Diocese, and  Bishop Stika has been making strong spiritual connections with east  Tennesseans ever since. At 11 years in the Knoxville Diocese, Bishop  Stika is the longest serving bishop in our diocese.   Bishop Stika and I share many values, including a strong belief in  protecting the lives of the unborn. Bishop Stika has made a positive  impact on many east Tennesseans throughout his tenure, and, Mr.  Speaker, I am confident he will continue to be a leader in our  community.                        Celebrating A.G. Heins Company     Mr. Speaker, the American entrepreneurial spirit is the  bedrock of our Nation's economy, creating good-paying jobs, solving  everyday problems, and providing the goods and services we rely on. I  rise today to celebrate the A.G. Heins Company, which rode the  entrepreneurial spirit from humble beginnings to 100 years of success  in our community.   Currently in its fourth generation of family ownership, the A.G.  Heins Company has long provided building materials to the east  Tennessee region. The company provides necessary resources to complete  projects of all sizes, from individual household repairs, to  construction at the University of Tennessee.   Staying in business for 100 years is no easy accomplishment, and the  A.G. Heins Company persevered through many challenging economic times,  such as the Great Depression and the Second World War. The company's  history is a reminder that small businesses can grow and innovate even  in the face of adversity, Mr. Speaker.   I extend my congratulations to the Heins family as they celebrate  their 100th year in business this month, and I wish them many more  years of success.                            ____________________
