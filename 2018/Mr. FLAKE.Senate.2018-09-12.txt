 Mr. President, in the annals of ``President's Say the  Darndest Things,'' last week's Twitter outburst will stand out, at  least for me, because the President attacked the Attorney General of  the United States for simply doing the job he swore an oath to do.   Of course, it wasn't the first time the President has so diminished  himself, but this particular slander was leveled at the Attorney  General for having the temerity to prosecute public corruption by  Members of Congress who also happen to belong to the President's  political party.   That is right. The President attacked Mr. Sessions by name for  refusing to cover up allegations of Republican misconduct. The  President's concern was not for justice but for the political fortunes  of the accused, because their congressional seats might now be at risk  of falling to Democrats. In doing this, the President is projecting a  vision onto the system of American justice that is both bizarre and,  more importantly, destructive.   Of course, the only truly shocking thing about this statement from  the President is that, given what all of us have become accustomed to  during this Presidency--or, even worse, have become numb to--this  Twitter eruption was not at all surprising. This numb acceptance is an  appalling statement on the very real threat to our democratic  institutions.   At this point, it might be too late for tutorials on the American  justice system, but it certainly bears repeating that in order for  justice to truly be served, justice must be based in empirical truth  and must be absolutely carried out independent of politics, period.   No President--any President--administers the justice system in  America, any more than he or she decrees what is objective truth. In  this country, justice and truth operate quite independent of the  dictates of even the most powerful of offices.   The reasons for this point are obvious to most, but we know by now  that this particular President seems to have a profound unease with  both justice and truth and so has been at unrelenting war with both,  virtually since the moment he swore the oath--not because there is any  deficiency in justice or truth that requires his intervention, mind  you, but for other less noble reasons. The President seems to think  that the office confers on him the ability to decide who and what gets  investigated in the United States and who and what does not.   Weekly, it seems, this President has been threatening to ``get  involved'' in the function of the Justice Department--sometimes  intimidating, sometimes plainly threatening to corrupt the independence  of justice in America.   He has overtly expressed a desire for his political opponents to be  investigated, and almost 2 years into his Presidency, he presides over  boisterous rallies where the last election is relitigated and chants of  ``lock her up'' fill the halls.   None of this is normal or acceptable, but his is not mere  recklessness. It seems to be a deliberate program, by which he intends  to weaken the institution of American justice, threaten its  independence, and perhaps set the stage for some future assault on it-- the firing of the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, and  perhaps even the special counsel.   It has been said that the President deserves to have an attorney  general of his choice, a top lawyer with whom he is compatible. This is  true. The President's appointment powers are clear, and all of his  appointees serve at the pleasure of the President. But what no  President deserves is a top lawyer who is simply there to do his  bidding. The Attorney General is not the President's personal lawyer,  and his job is not to protect the President from damaging facts or to  turn the power of American justice onto the President's enemies or to  direct Justice Department investigations in any particular way that is  either politically motivated or presupposes guilt or innocence or  favors any outcome whatsoever, other than that which is supported by  the evidence and truth. The Attorney General's job description, as  tweeted last week by the President, bears scant resemblance to the  Attorney General's job in a constitutional democracy.   So I rise today because the Founders gave us the article I branch of  this government that they conceived and the responsibility to curb such  reckless behavior.   Thus far, I believe we have all been so incredulous at the daily  excess and ever hopeful--hopeful beyond any reason--that this President  would at last begin to inhabit the office in a more responsible fashion  that we have been somewhat uncertain what to do.   First and foremost, we must speak out. We cannot be quiet when the  moment requires us to defend the democratic norms under which this  system functions, and without which our system ceases to function. The  President has repeatedly and over time heedlessly breached these norms.  If we say nothing, then, we become accomplices in the destruction of  these democratic norms.   The Senate is not the place to come for deniability. We must do what  we can to curb the destructive impulses of this White House. We must  encourage the administration of justice. That means voicing our support  for Mr. Mueller and his team. We have passed bipartisan legislation out  of the Senate Judiciary Committee--legislation to protect the special  counsel. I call on the majority leader to bring this legislation to the  Senate floor.   We must also say in no uncertain terms that to call this  investigation a ``witch hunt'' is wrong. To call Mr. Mueller's team  ``thugs'' is wrong. Relentlessly slandering the Attorney General of the  United States is wrong. It is a travesty, and it is unbecoming of the  Office of the Presidency.   I would say to the Attorney General: Stand firm. You spent your life  in public service, in the service of your country. At the risk of being  presumptuous, I will say that these days of your service, right now,  during this crucial period in which we have a President who in a malign  fashion is actively testing the limits of his power and the  independence of American justice, your determination to safeguard the  independence of the Justice Department at the same time that you have  been under assault by the President has verged on heroic. In your long  career, you will render no more consequential service to your country.  Stand firm, Attorney General Sessions.   I appeal to the leadership of this body to speak out. You don't have  to speak out at every Twitter outburst, but when the President so  blatantly calls for the Department of Justice to act as an arm of the  Republican Party, then, the leaders of the Republican Party in this  body need to stand and say that the President is out of bounds.   We all have our pulls to conscience. Most recently for me, I hear the  whisper so well described a few weeks ago--the whisper over my shoulder  that says: We are better than this. America is better than this. In a  time of rank tribalism, we need to remember that we are all Americans.  That is our only tribe. It is to the rule of law and the ideals of our  founding that we owe our allegiance.   I yield the floor.
