 Mr. Speaker, if our friends across the aisle are  concerned about paying our bills and they are alarmed by the debt, then  I think we should all get together, all 435 Members, and talk about  fiscal responsibility and pass a balanced budget amendment. That is the  way forward and to avert this financial catastrophe that we are  flirting with.   Let's be very candid, Mr. Speaker, about what we are doing here.  Let's be candid with the American people about what we are doing here  in this Chamber tonight.   This is about a debt ceiling limit increase to ram through more  wasteful and reckless spending.   We are renovating our house in Texas, and I found an old political  mailer, a 9-year-old mailer; and I was outraged about the fact that we  had a $14 trillion debt. Today that is $29 trillion.   It is not about placing blame on Republicans or Democrats, it is  about recognizing we have an issue that is going to destroy this  country if we don't address it. And we continue to kick the can down  the road and land that can on the backs of future generations like my  15-year-old son and my 12-year-old son.   There are failed states in this world. Here is a $100 trillion bill  from the Nation of Zimbabwe. It is worth maybe 40 cents. It is  essentially worthless. That could be what we end up with if we don't  recognize the fact that at the local level cities can't spend more than  they take in, counties can't, even States can't. So why does the  Federal Government get to? Because we own a printing press down the  street?   Let's be responsible. Let's work together. This Chamber 20-plus years  ago passed a balanced budget amendment, if I am not mistaken, and it  failed in the Senate. It is time to do the right thing, the courageous  thing, the American thing, and pass a balanced budget amendment.
