 Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues and members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, under the leadership of Karen Bass and both  coleaders here tonight, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett and  Steve  Horsford, for their leadership.   Last week, I lost a friend and a colleague, and Baltimore, Maryland,  and the United States lost a civil rights activist, a tireless activist  and leader.   I had the privilege of knowing the chairman for many years, since we  both served our State legislatures before coming to Congress. We  represented districts. I represented a district in Philadelphia, and he  represented a district in Baltimore. He got elected about 1982. I got  elected in 1981. We both had similar challenges. He did in Baltimore. I  did in Philadelphia.   A few months ago, I saw the chairman here on the House floor, and I  complimented him for being relentless in his commitment to civic  participation.   I had the pleasure of sitting with him on my very first State of the  Union Address. That day, we had the chance to talk about discussions  and challenges that we both faced in major urban cities.   Today, I am glad I said something when I had the chance. I told him  that I loved him. I told him that I loved him for all the things he had  been doing and all the relentlessness he has shown.   Now, it is all up to us who are still in this fight to carry on, to  make a difference.   So, Mr. Chairman, rest in power. We have to continue this fight.
