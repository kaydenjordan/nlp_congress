 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Tom Seipel, Jr., who passed away on February 13.   Tom had a heart for enriching the lives of countless children, and it  shined in all he did.   After graduating from Ohio State University, he moved to Seoul, South  Korea, to teach English to kindergartners. Tom then returned to the  U.S. to serve as a children's minister in Kentucky for several years.   He later selflessly moved to Nicaragua, where he opened and operated  a children's ministry to provide meals and afterschool tutoring for the  poor children of Managua. While there, Tom also taught at Nicaragua  Christian Academy.   In his final years before losing his hard-fought battle with cancer,  he received treatment in Savannah, Georgia.   Tom's legacy will surely live on for many years to come, and I am  thankful for the positive impact he made on countless lives. My  thoughts and prayers go out to all who knew and loved him, especially  the love of his life, Margarita, and their daughter, Mia Isabella.                            ____________________
