 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5346) to amend title 51, United States Code, to provide for  licenses and experimental permits for space support vehicles, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5346         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Space Support       Vehicle Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Section 50902 of title 51, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (21) through (25) as       paragraphs (23) through (27), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (20) the following:        ``(21) `space support flight' means a flight in the air       that is--        ``(A) not a launch or reentry; but        ``(B) related to launch or reentry services.        ``(22) `space support vehicle' means a vehicle that is--        ``(A) a launch vehicle;        ``(B) a reentry vehicle; or        ``(C) a component of a launch or reentry vehicle.''.       SEC. 3. LICENSING OF SPACE SUPPORT FLIGHTS.         (a) In General.--Section 50904 of title 51, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Space Support Flights.--        ``(1) The Secretary of Transportation may issue or transfer       a license for multiple space support flights of a space       support vehicle to a citizen of the United States, but only       if such citizen holds an operator license issued under this       chapter for launch or reentry of such space support vehicle       as, or included as a component of, a launch vehicle or       reentry vehicle.        ``(2) A licensee may only carry out a space support flight       of a space support vehicle under a license for carrying a       person or property for compensation or hire if such flight       lands at the same site from which the vehicle took flight.''.        (b) Limitation on Wavier of Requirements.--Section       50905(b)(3) of title 51, United States Code, is amended by       inserting ``, or the operation of a space support vehicle,''       after ``or a reentry vehicle''.       SEC. 4. EXPERIMENTAL PERMITS FOR SPACE SUPPORT FLIGHTS.         Section 50906 of title 51, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:        ``(d) The Secretary may issue a permit only for--        ``(1) reusable suborbital rockets or reusable launch       vehicles that will be launched into a suborbital trajectory       or reentered under that permit solely for--        ``(A) research and development to test design concepts,       equipment, or operating techniques;        ``(B) showing compliance with requirements as part of the       process for obtaining a license for launch or reentry under       this chapter; or        ``(C) crew training for a launch or reentry using the       design of the rocket or vehicle for which the permit would be       issued; or        ``(2) a space support vehicle, or a vehicle that is in       development to become a space support vehicle, operated by a       citizen of the United States for space support flights that       will be conducted under the permit for, or in support of, the       purposes described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of       paragraph (1).''; and        (2) by striking subsection (h) and inserting the following:        ``(h) No person may, under a permit, operate a reusable       suborbital rocket, reusable launch vehicle, or space support       vehicle for carrying any property or human being for       compensation or hire.''.       SEC. 5. COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY.         Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act       shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of       Transportation to discuss potential regulatory approaches,       potential performance standards, or any other topic related       to this Act and the amendments made by this Act with the       commercial space industry prior to the issuance of a notice       of proposed rulemaking.       SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY.         (a) In General.--The amendments made by this Act shall take       effect on March 1, 2019.        (b) Regulations.--The Secretary of Transportation may issue       such regulations as are necessary to carry out the amendments       made by this Act beginning on the date of enactment of this       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5346, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5346, the Commercial Space Support Vehicle Act, was  largely developed with input from a Department of Transportation report  on approaches for streamlining the licensing and permitting of hybrid  launch vehicles to enable non-launch flight operations. Hybrid launch  vehicles are those that have some of the  [[Page H5771]]  characteristics of aircraft and some of the characteristics of launch  vehicles.   Companies would like to utilize space support vehicles to train crews  and spaceflight participants by exposing them to the physiological  effects encountered in spaceflight or conduct research in reduced  gravity environments. Spaceports, like those in Florida and other  States, would like to attract those companies to operate out of their  facilities.   The DOT report concluded that: ``The option of having a single  statutory regime and regulatory office oversee a demonstrated  commercial space program throughout its operational life cycle would  allow consistent application of regulatory philosophy and safety  oversight and be more efficient and cost effective for the launch  operator as well as the licensing agency. For an evolving industry, a  regulatory environment that can adjust to accommodate changes would  allow for more flexible and more responsive oversight.''   Additionally, a GAO report issued last year recommended that the FAA  examine the FAA's current regulatory framework for space support  vehicles and suggest legislative or regulatory changes as applicable.   I believe H.R. 5346 provides the appropriate regulatory approach by  authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to develop the regulations  by March 1, 2019, allowing licensed space support flights. The intent  of timing is to include the development of regulations in the  regulatory reform process that the Vice President and the National  Space Council tasked the FAA to complete by that date.   Of course, I want to thank my friend of many, many decades,  Congressman Lawson from the great State of Florida, for his  cosponsorship and support of this bill, as well as Chairman Lamar Smith  and Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin, both of Texas, for advancing and  cosponsoring this great piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank the cosponsors on  both sides of the aisle. This has been about a 9-year journey to make  this much-needed change to our laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
