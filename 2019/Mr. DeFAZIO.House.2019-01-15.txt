 Mr. Speaker, the President has really made his wall  argument on the basis of stopping illegal drugs from coming into the  country.   Last week, I talked about the Maginot Line in France, an impenetrable  defense. The Germans went around it.   If drugs were being smuggled across the desert, another section of  wall isn't going to stop them. They will go around it. But that is not  the way drugs are coming into the United States of America. They are  coming through our legal border crossings. I talked about that last  week.   We need more personnel. We need more technology there to inspect a  larger number of the vehicles, all the vehicles coming across, with  high technology, to find the human smuggling, the drug smuggling, and  the weapons smuggling that is coming in that way.   But there is another way that drugs are pouring into the United  States of America, and here is, last year, just one of the incidents  that the Coast Guard intercepted. They intercepted $5.6 billion of  illegal drugs being smuggled in through maritime pathways.   The recently retired commandant said that is only about 20 percent of  the shipments. We could intercept more if we had more personnel. If we  had more and modern helicopters, if we had more fast-pursuit boats, we  could stop a much larger percentage.   But today is a really special day. These brave men and women of the  United States Coast Guard will miss their paychecks today, the first  time that I know of in recent history that members of the uniformed  military are not being paid by their government.   41,000 Active Duty coasties won't be paid. And guess what? The first  of next month, 50,000 retired coasties won't be paid. In addition to  that, there are 8,000 Coast Guard critical civilian employees who are  not being paid.   So if the President really wants to talk about intercepting drugs,  and he wants to talk about real border security, he should be talking  about giving more resources to the United States Coast Guard, not  stiffing them on their paychecks and not making them fly ancient  helicopters and 50-year-old cutters.   But he wants to waste $5 billion on a wall across part of the desert  that you can go around, if that is the way they were smuggling in  drugs. But as I said earlier, they aren't.    Let's have smart border security. Let's use our precious tax dollars  in an intelligent, 21st century way, not a vanity wall.                            ____________________
