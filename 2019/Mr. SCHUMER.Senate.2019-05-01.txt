 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we speak, Attorney General William  Barr is testifying before a hearing in front of the Judiciary  Committee.   There may not be a member of this administration with more to answer  for than the current Attorney General, and that is a pretty high bar.  His confirmation occurred only a few months ago. Yet, in a short time,  Mr. Barr's conduct has raised damning questions about his impartiality  and about his fitness.   Just last night we learned that Special Counsel Mueller sent a  private letter more than a month ago to the Attorney General that took  issue with Mr. Barr's early description of the Russia investigation's  conclusions.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated  March 27, 2019, to Mr. Barr.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                    The Special Counsel's Office,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2019.      Re Report of the Special Counsel on the Investigation Into           Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election           and Obstruction of Justice (March 2019).       Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General of the United States, Department of Justice,           Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Barr: I previously sent you a letter       dated March 25, 2019, that enclosed the introduction and       executive summary for each volume of the Special Counsel's       report marked with redactions to remove any information that       potentially could be protected by Federal Rule of Criminal       Procedure 6(e); that concerned declination decisions; or that       related to a charged case. We also had marked an additional       two sentences for review and have now confirmed that these       sentences can be released publicly.        Accordingly, the enclosed documents are in a form that can       be released to the public consistent with legal requirements       and Department policies. I am requesting that you provide       these materials to Congress and authorize their public       release at this time.        As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to       the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the       introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume       report accurately summarize this Office's work and       conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to       Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of       March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and       substance of this Office's work and conclusions. We       communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of       March 25. There is now public confusion about critical       aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens       to undermine a central purpose for which the Department       appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public       confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See       Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).        While we understand that the Department is reviewing the       full report to determine what is appropriate for public       release--a process that our Office is working with you to       complete--that process need not delay release of the enclosed       materials. Release at this time would alleviate the       misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer       congressional and public questions about the nature and       outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the       standard for public release of notifications to Congress       cited in your letter. See 28 C.F.R. 609(c) (``the Attorney       General may determine that public release'' of congressional       notifications ``would be in the public interest'').            Sincerely yours,                                            Robert S. Mueller, III,                                                   Special Counsel.     What a stunning indictment of the Attorney General,  whose principal job in all of this was to make sure--to make sure--that  he wasn't mischaracterizing or spinning results. This letter shows what  an awful, awful Attorney General Mr. Barr has been so far. I will have  more to say on this later.    Madam President, we have now had a day where the  Attorney General testified before the Judiciary Committee, and many  issues are not resolved because there are great discrepancies based on  Mr. Mueller's letter that has been made public--two letters, in fact,  that have been made public between what Mr. Barr has been saying and  what Mr. Mueller believes.   The cloud that hangs over our country because of Russian interference  in our elections--and, frankly, that hangs over the President because  of the actions Mr. Mueller outlined in his report--remains. There is a  great need to clear all of that up and to clear all of it up with no  ands, ifs, or buts.   I was shocked when I heard the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  my friend and colleague whom I have traveled with, Lindsey Graham, come  out of the hearing and say that he was not going to call Mueller for a  hearing. The fact that he on his own, despite the desires of many other  members of the committee, would simply say that Mueller is not going to  testify was so outrageous and wrong. So I went to my colleague here on  the floor--my friend Lindsey Graham. I said to him: How can you do  this? This is outrageous.   He said: I am just going to ask Mr. Mueller in a letter if Barr said  anything misleading or inaccurate but not have the hearing.   I was appalled.   Now I see on a tweet by a reporter, Emma Dumain, that Lindsey Graham  has slightly modified what he has said. He said that if Mueller tells  Graham in the letter that Barr said anything misleading or inaccurate  today, he would have the hearing. That is not good enough. That is a  game. He should not put the onus on Mr. Mueller, a straight arrow,  somebody who believes in a chain of command, to publicly state that in  a letter.   Mueller should come testify--no ands, ifs, or buts. Mueller should  come testify--no games as to what he answers in a letter.   What are our colleagues so afraid of on the other side of the aisle?  Are they afraid Mueller might say things that are different than what  Attorney General Barr said? Are they afraid for the country to discuss  the kinds of things the President has done, which nobody much seems to  like? Are they afraid that we talk about foreign interference in our  elections?    I would plead with my colleague Lindsey Graham to reconsider. I would  plead with my colleague Lindsey Graham to say: Mueller is coming; no  ands, ifs, or buts so we can question him, including our side of the  aisle. That is what Congressional oversight is about. It is not about  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee deciding what should be heard  and what should not be heard. That is not the job of the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, no matter who he or she is.   Special Counsel Mueller just concluded one of the most important  investigations in our Nation's history. The Senate and the American  people have a right to hear from the special counsel directly about the  threat of foreign interference in our elections and, yes, the conduct  of the President. It is one of the biggest takeaways from the hearing;  that we need the special counsel here to testify, to clarify the  discrepancies between what he and the Attorney General are saying. We  don't need a letter. We don't need conditions. That seems like a game,  a dodge, a ruse, a way to prevent Mr. Mueller from testifying.   In my view, Attorney General Barr routinely mischaracterizes the  special counsel's words, his intentions, his reasoning. We know, from  the special counsel's letter that was publicly released, that to be  true. It is likely that Attorney General Barr did so again in the  hearings. We need to hear from the special counsel himself to sort this  out and get the truth, not at the discretion of the Judiciary Committee  chairman but because America, our system of government, our rule of  law, demands it.   Congress has always had, from the days of the Founding Fathers, a  duty to provide oversight for the executive branch. Just because one  party doesn't feel like doing it because the President is from the same  party doesn't measure up to the grandness of our Constitution.   My dear friend from South Carolina, please rethink your position.  Back off of this idea that Mueller shouldn't testify or should only  testify if he meets certain conditions only set by you and call Special  Counsel Mueller in to testify.   I yield the floor.
