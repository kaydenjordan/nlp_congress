 Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress, I served as a  Pennsylvania State Representative. The legislation I was most proud to  be a part of was the bipartisan Act 89 infrastructure bill that helped  fix some of Pennsylvania's crumbling roads and bridges.   Signed into law by Governor Corbett in 2013, Act 89 was a serious  investment in our infrastructure, but it is not enough. Nationwide, we  know that an out-of-date infrastructure system is costly, energy  inefficient, and dangerous.  [[Page H2060]]    Today, in a moment of low interest rates and historic need and a  rapidly warming planet, we have an opportunity and an obligation to  invest in a stronger, greener, and better connected future.   The American Jobs Plan is that chance, a chance to build back better  and make a generational investment for our grandchildren's future. This  includes: roads, bridges, public transportation, drinking water,  broadband, and good, clean energy union jobs.   I worked with a Republican legislature and a Republican Governor to  help pass Pennsylvania's infrastructure bill. I hope we can get  together and work across the aisle for infrastructure investment for  the next generation.                            ____________________
