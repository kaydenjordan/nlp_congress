 Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H.R.  986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act, which  prohibits the Trump administration from promoting the sale of junk  insurance plans that do not fully protect Americans with preexisting  conditions. Today, we are taking a critical step to reverse a damaging  Trump administration policy.   With the Affordable Care Act, we sought to ensure that all people  covered in the same area are charged the same premium as everyone else,  regardless of their health status. Women cannot be denied coverage or  charged more simply because they are women, and more Americans now have  the freedom to start their own business or pursue work in the gig  economy without fear of losing coverage for preexisting conditions.  Coverage before the ACA was often tied to employer plans.   In California, we have taken a stance against the Trump  administration's sabotage of the ACA by protecting consumers from the  sale of junk plans, but not every State has followed our lead.   This legislation protects basic fairness and access to healthcare for  all Americans, not just those living in States that have sought  aggressive reforms, changes, and improvements to the law. We now have a  real opportunity to protect and build on the ACA's success, and I am  immensely pleased to be able to support such efforts on the floor  today.
