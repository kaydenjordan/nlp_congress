 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the CHOICE Act,  and I thank Chairman Hensarling for his strong leadership.   Imposing regulations meant for large, transnational firms on  community banks and credit unions may make sense to bureaucrats in  Washington, but to hardworking families on Long Island, it means you  can't buy that first home or you can't get that small-business loan.   Today we have the opportunity to remove the barriers to job creation  and prosperity that have given us the weakest economic recovery in  American history. The CHOICE Act will end taxpayer-funded bailouts,  restore accountability, and jumpstart innovation and job creation.   I strongly support this legislation, and I urge its adoption.
