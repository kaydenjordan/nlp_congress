 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate The Jane Pauley  Community Health Center, with locations across Indiana, on 10 years of  helping patients of all ages and backgrounds in need of care.   Founded in 2009, these healthcare centers continue to service  communities across the Sixth District, providing affordable healthcare  to Hoosiers. The Jane Pauley Community Centers embody the spirit of  humanity and altruism by serving those in need, regardless of the  patients' ability to pay.   Congratulations on a decade of service.      Congratulating the New Castle High School Women's Volleyball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the New Castle High  School women's volleyball team for winning the 2019 class 4A State  volleyball championship. This marks New Castle's third year in a row on  achieving this tremendous victory.   The coaching staff and players' hard work have brought pride to the  New Castle community. Congratulations to the Trojans, and a great job  on the three-peat.       Congratulating the Greenfield-Central High School Marching Band     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Greenfield- Central High School marching band for winning the class B Indiana State  championship.   I recently visited Greenfield-Central High School and was able to  meet some of the band members and see their incredible facilities  firsthand. The 160-member Cougar Pride Marching Band spent hours every  day working toward this goal, and it is an accomplishment they are sure  to remember for the rest of their lives.   I congratulate the Cougars on their awesome achievement.                        Congratulating Barbara Hinkle     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Barbara Hinkle of  Connersville for receiving the Archbishop Edward T. O'Meara Respect  Life Award.   As a member of the St. Gabriel parish, Barbara started the  Compassionate Visitors and Vigil Keepers Group, which serves local  nursing homes. Barbara started the group to bring, as she said, ``joy  and hope to the lonely and peace and comfort to the dying.''   I congratulate Barbara on her award and thank her for her servant's  heart.                     Congratulating Muncie Public Library     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation for  the Muncie Public Library receiving the Historic Preservation Education  Grant.   The funds from Indiana Humanities, in cooperation with the National  Endowment for the Humanities, will be used to help the library share  its history and preservation needs with the public.   Carnegie Library was the first library building in Muncie and one of  the first to be built in Indiana on a full donation from Andrew  Carnegie. This facility serves as an icon of history and a modern  workspace and receives my full support in Congress.                            ____________________
