 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss a true  American value: equal pay for equal work. This is something that we all  believe in, and tomorrow is National Equal Pay Day. It is a meaningful  reminder that equal pay remains among the challenges before us.   Women make the world work. We are breadwinners for our families. We  are also financial planners, nurses, and teachers. We have always been  a powerful force, and our progress has been hard-earned.   Women today are managers, entrepreneurs, public servants, and CEOs,  and our country is stronger for it. But despite these great strides,  there is more work to do to encourage prosperity for America's  families.   For nearly 4 years in this body, I have led discussions about equal  pay. I am encouraged by the interest from the White House on addressing  the workplace challenges that women face today. To that end, I have  reintroduced a proposal I believe will make a real difference for  families. It is called the Workplace Advancement Act.   The idea behind it is fairly universal and straightforward: equal pay  through empowerment. The bill aims to empower employees--especially  women--with information about wages so they can be informed advocates  for their compensation. When it comes to discussing wages in the  workplace, sometimes it can hurt to ask. A culture of silence and fear  of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their compensation  compares to others. The Workplace Advancement Act would lift that fear,  free up information, and create a more transparent workplace.   A simple principle is at play here. When workers, especially women,  have more information, they can more confidently pursue favorable work  and wage arrangements. Knowledge is power. With this flexibility, women  can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. For  example, they might be willing to accept less pay if they can have  Fridays free for doctors' appointments or family time or simply as a  day for self-care.   The Workplace Advancement Act contains language similar to an  Executive order that President Obama issued in 2014. Many congressional  Democrats requested this action, which is actually more limited in  scope than my legislation. Some even praised it. Senator Heinrich  called the action ``a critical step to ensure that every woman has a  fair shot at fairness and economic success.'' Congresswoman Susan Davis  of California said the action was a ``historic step forward.''   Importantly, for employers, the Workplace Advancement Act would not  impose new Federal regulations, and no employer would be compelled to  disclose salary information. It simply prevents retaliatory action  against employees who ask after it.   Fifty-three Republicans and five Democrats in the Senate supported a  version of the Workplace Advancement Act last Congress. With bipartisan  support like this, this bill is possible.   Let's take advantage of this rare moment when we have common ground  on a commonsense and straightforward solution. Let's come together so  we can look families in the eye and say: We heard you. We have heard  you on this issue, and we are going to take action on it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader    The majority leader is recognized.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week is an important one for the  American people, for the Supreme Court, and for the Senate. The  Judiciary Committee just reported out Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination-- the next step in considering the Supreme Court nominee before the full  Senate. It was unfortunate to see our Democratic colleagues on the  committee break with recent precedent and not support this clearly  well-qualified and widely respected Supreme Court nominee.   I would remind colleagues that in addition to simply agreeing to an  up-or-down vote on their nominations on the Senate floor, Republicans  offered each of the last four first-term Supreme Court nominees of  Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama at least some bipartisan  support in the committee votes. Judge Gorsuch is no less qualified than  those four nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama, and it is  disappointing he didn't get the same bipartisan support in the  committee today.   It now seems apparent that this well-qualified and widely respected  judge will be subject to the first successful partisan filibuster in  the history of the Senate--the first successful partisan filibuster in  the history of the Senate. This is a new low but not entirely  surprising given that the Democratic leader announced before the  nomination was even made that it was hard for him to imagine a nominee  this President would nominate whom he could support. He even went so  far as to say that he would be willing to fight the nomination ``tooth  and nail'' and might even ``keep the seat open'' in perpetuity. It is  not too late for our Democratic colleagues to make the right choice.   This week, the Senate will continue to debate Judge Gorsuch's  nomination here on the floor. This is a matter of great importance,  which is why we are planning to dedicate this week's floor time almost  entirely to continued robust debate of this nomination rather than  double-tracking it with legislative items, as has been done in the  past. Already, several Members from both sides of the aisle have come  to the floor day after day to offer their viewpoints on Judge Gorsuch.  I would encourage Members to take advantage of this time to continue  discussing his excellent credentials, judicial background, and broad  support from across the political spectrum in our country.   Let me remind colleagues the many ways in which Judge Gorsuch has  shown himself to be an outstanding nominee to serve on the High Court.   Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to his current position as a  Federal judge. Not a single Democrat opposed him then, including  Senators Obama, Clinton, Biden, Leahy, and Schumer. He has participated  in more than 2,700 cases since then. He has been in the majority 99  percent of the time. He has enjoyed the unanimous support of his fellow  judges 97 percent of the time.   The American Bar Association--a group the Democratic leader called  the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations--awarded him  its highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''   He has amassed a wide array of supporters, including Democrats and  Republicans, current and former colleagues, the legal community, and  editorial boards all across our country. They say Gorsuch is eminently  well-qualified. As Judge John Kane, a Carter appointee, put it, ``I'm  not sure we could expect better [than Judge Gorsuch], or that better  presently exists.''   They say that Gorsuch is independent. Neal Katyal, President Obama's  former Acting Solicitor General, said he has ``no doubt that if  confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule  of law'' because Gorsuch's ``years on the bench reveal a commitment''-- a commitment--``to judicial independence.''   They say Gorsuch is fair and impartial. The Denver Post editorial  board noted that ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind and talented  writer whom observers praise for his ability to apply the law fairly  and consistently.'' They went on: ``[W]e appreciate his desire to  strictly interpret the Constitution,'' the paper continued, ``based on  the intent of our nation's founders, even when those rulings might  contradict his personal beliefs.''  [[Page S2163]]    They say Gorsuch is highly revered by Democrats and Republicans. As  USA TODAY noted in its editorial endorsing Gorsuch's confirmation just  today, ``He has gotten an array of glowing references, including from  some Democrats and liberals.'' I mentioned some this morning; there are  many more.   Here is just one additional example of how praise for Judge Gorsuch  has bridged the political divide: Despite their ideological  differences, former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a Democrat, and  former Colorado attorney general John Suthers, a Republican, agree that  Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed. They said:         Gorsuch's temperament, personal decency and qualifications       are beyond dispute.        It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and       exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he       or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and       will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical       judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.    It reminds us of what David Frederick, a board member of the left- leaning American Constitution Society and longtime Democrat, recently  said: ``The Senate should confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no  principled reason to vote no.''   ``There is no principled reason to vote no.'' He is absolutely right.  So it goes without saying that there is no principled reason to block  an up-or-down vote on this supremely qualified nominee, either.   I look forward to joining my Senate colleagues in supporting Judge  Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court later this week.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
