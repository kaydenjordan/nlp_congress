 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.   This bill really should be uncontroversial. But, unfortunately, our  Nation's largest tech companies don't want any changes to the status  quo. They are content with little to no antitrust enforcement. They are  content with their own Gilded Age.   I regret, deeply regret, that some of my colleagues have agreed to do  their bidding. It is consumers and small business owners who are paying  the price in an economy that increasingly only works for large  corporations and for the ultra-wealthy.   Our antitrust enforcement system is beyond outdated. The last time  Congress updated the merger filing fees was in 2001, long before  companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Apple began their anticompetitive  and monopolistic frenzy of acquisitions.   This bill updates those filing fees and ensures that our antitrust  agencies have the resources they need to effectively combat the growing  concentration and monopolization of our economy in the hands of the  largest corporations.   I urge my colleagues to stand up to Big Tech and our largest  corporations and to vote for this bill.
