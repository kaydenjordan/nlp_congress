 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Mr. President, when President Obama signed the Iran  deal, we were led to believe that this rapprochement with the Iranian  regime would induce Iran to moderate its aggressive foreign policy and  that Iran would likely spend the money made available through that deal  on economic development for the good of its people. Instead, under the  direction of General Soleimani, Iran accelerated its effort at regional  domination, funding terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah in  the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq,  the Assad regime in Syria, and the Houthi rebels fomenting civil war in  Yemen. Iran did all of that with money from the Iran agreement.   Meanwhile, the suffering Iranian people staged widespread  demonstrations against their government, which were met with a violent  crackdown that killed hundreds. Years of appeasement didn't work, but  it looks like President Trump's deterrence is having positive effect.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, the Senate Finance Committee  and the entire Senate lost a dedicated public servant--and, by the way,  an all-around wonderful man--with the unexpected passing of Chris  Allen.   Chris had been a member of the Finance Committee tax team since 2018.  I was fortunate that he was willing to continue in that role when I  reclaimed the gavel last year after the retirement of my friend, and  former chairman, Orrin Hatch.   As Members, we are blessed with dedicated people like Chris, who come  to Capitol Hill to perform public service. They come here to make a  difference, no matter what their party or ideology. They come from all  walks of life, religious backgrounds, and from all over the country.  They work long hours, and sometimes their work is stymied by the  political headwinds we know about in the Congress of the United States.  But when an idea is a good one and the people pursuing it do so with a  full heart and focused mind, it will eventually become law.   Last year proved to be a year when a number of good ideas finally  became law in the area of retirement security, in no small part because  of Chris' hard work and dedication.   After more than 3 years, we were finally able to pass the Finance  Committee's Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act. We use acronyms  around here, and that is RESA. RESA became law after it was  incorporated into the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement  Enhancement Act, and that acronym is the SECURE Act.   Chris was very instrumental in helping navigate the long and, at  times, very contentious process that culminated in this important  package of retirement provisions being enacted just before last  Christmas.   Possibly even more important, Chris brought a very deep knowledge of  multiemployer pensions to bear over the past several years to help us  move forward on important reforms.   In the last Congress, Chris served as the staff director of the Joint  Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. Congress  formed this committee for the very important job of addressing the  impending insolvency of a number of multiemployer plans and the  projected insolvency of the multiemployer fund of the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation.  [[Page S222]]    With Chris' steady hand and his tireless efforts, the Joint Select  Committee laid a critical foundation in 2018 for addressing the  multiemployer pension crisis.   Throughout 2019, Chris carried that work forward as a member of my  Finance Committee staff. Through months of work with Finance Committee  member offices, and also working with the HELP Committee, working with  the PBGC, and, most importantly, stakeholder groups that are affected  by any reform we do, Chris was the one leading the effort to build on  the Joint Select Committee's work of the previous year. That effort led  to the development of the Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and  Reform Plan that Chairman Alexander and I released in  November. Resolving the multiemployer pension crisis remains a top  priority, and now there is another important reason to see it done in  Chris' memory because he put so much effort into where we are at this  point.    While Chris has been a key asset to the Finance Committee on  retirement and pension policy, his depth of knowledge was much deeper  than just that issue. Prior to joining the committee, Chris served as  Senator Roberts' senior tax policy adviser for 7 years. Chris played a  key role in helping us develop and pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of  2017. In that effort, he focused heavily on the tax rules affecting  farmers and ranchers across the Nation. Farmers and ranchers are a key  interest of Senator Roberts and the State of Kansas.   A close look at Chris' resume shows that he was very successful in  working for the National Association of State Treasurers and then with  another organization, the Financial Accounting Foundation. He also  worked at other firms linked to his expertise in financial services,  regulation, and legislation.   What stands out about Chris is his ability to bring folks with very  different views together in the classic legislative process. And boy, I  watched him in meetings on the multiemployer pension issues and how he  navigated all that, and I thought to myself: Without Chris, this  couldn't be done.   He had great ability with numbers and great dedication to public  policy. That is what made Chris stand out. I am confident that had the  Good Lord not taken Chris last week, he would have remained a fixture  on the Finance Committee staff for many years to come. Public service  was very simply at the core of Chris' identity as a professional.   A key to Chris' success was his genial nature. You might not know it  by looking at him, but he had a very quick wit. It seems like everybody  felt comfortable with Chris, and Chris was comfortable with them. He  had a lot of contentious meetings. I had a chance to observe some of  them and his working with the stakeholders on multiemployer pensions. I  saw the comfort they had with him, even when he was trying to go in  just a little different direction than certain interest groups might  have wanted to go because Chris knew that to get anything done in this  body, you have to compromise. As you can tell, policy work was fun for  Chris. Policy work was important, and he saw policy work as sustaining  over a long period of time.   I hope I am pointing out that this type of goodwill and dedication  was infectious. Every day was meaningful. Every day was a source of  joy.   As I said in my statement on Friday night after I learned of Chris'  passing, Chris was a public servant who brought a deep well of  knowledge to his work. We all know he is going to leave behind a legacy  of impact on so many lives that he was able to improve with his  expertise, with his confidence, and the example he set with his hard  work. But he never let that keep him from living life to the fullest,  especially where his family was concerned.   You learn these things about a staff member's family with the crisis  of a passing, but Chris was a devoted father to two wonderful  daughters, Lucie and Sophie. Chris was a loving husband for nearly 30  years to his wife, Lynda-Marie. Chris was a thoughtful and  compassionate son and brother. Chris was a fierce friend to so many who  came to know him during his 58 years. Chris knew how to live life.   Losing Chris is extremely difficult for all of us. At times, the  finger of God reaches down and takes a person who we know and love. It  is not for us to know why that happened. What we know is we all got to  know Chris and got to know him well. He was part of our lives, and we  all benefited from the time that we had with him. We are all blessed to  have that.   For his family and the countless others who had the good fortune to  know and work with Chris Allen, a piece of him will live on with each  of us in every memory of him. Whether it was of Chris' positivity and  sincerity, or the endless way he could inject humor into a very  difficult situation, Chris was a blessing to those who were fortunate  enough to know him.   Rest in peace, my friend, Chris Allen.   God bless Chris' family and may He show them His grace as they take  these next steps in their own life's path.   Chris will be greatly missed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I start my remarks, I think it is  important for all Senators to know that when there were negotiations  going on between the White House and the Democrats in the House of  Representatives, one of the real sticking points was enforcement. I  think everybody expects a trade agreement to be enforced, but a lot  more had to be done than what was originally agreed to when the  agreement was signed.   I want to recognize Senator Wyden and Senator Brown because months  before, maybe even years before--I don't want to take away from how  hard they were working on some ways of improving enforcement--but at  least they had an idea out there that was salable to both sides. I  don't know whether it was 100 percent or 90 percent or 80 percent that  was incorporated in this bill, but their laying the groundwork was the  basis for getting an agreement between the White House and the House of  Representatives so we could move this to the point where the Senate is  going to pass it tomorrow, I hope. So I thank Senator Wyden and Senator  Brown, who is not here, but maybe you can tell him I said thank you.    It is said that good things come to those who wait.  Others say it is better late than never. Either way, we can agree that  this day has been a long time coming.   With the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by what  will be an overwhelming margin here in the U.S. Senate, America's  economy will continue to thrive and drive prosperity for hard-working  American farmers, workers, and taxpayers all across our economy.   You have heard the old saying: ``A rising tide lifts all boats.'' The  new NAFTA, the bill that we are working on, puts a bigger oar in the  water for our trilateral trade relationship with our northern and  southern neighbors. It is important to point out that we wouldn't be  here without the bold leadership and the determination of President  Trump. The President is doing exactly what he said he would do.   So many people running for President run on a platform, but they  don't stand on that platform. He ran on a platform of doing something  about what he considered were bad trade agreements, and, of course, he  is standing on that platform.   Undaunted by those who set to throw him out of office since day one,  President Trump forged ahead for the good of the American people. He  forged ahead to update and improve NAFTA for Americans. We heard,  during the campaign, that it was the President's opinion that it is the  worst agreement that has ever been made. I might not agree with the  extreme of that, but I do know, as Senator Wyden has pointed out, that  there were a lot of things that weren't even negotiable 30 years ago  when we first sought NAFTA, and at least an updating needed to be done.   The President has done more than update. As the President promised  during his campaign, at the end of the day, President Trump  successfully steered that final trade pact into the 21st century. He  did so with a tireless and tenacious team of advisers, especially the  leadership of the U.S. Trade Representative, Bob Lighthizer. Senator  Wyden just gave more adjectives to Bob Lighthizer's work, and I  associate myself with the remarks and the description that Senator  Wyden gave to Bob Lighthizer's heavy lift to get this job done because  Bob Lighthizer worked in good faith to broker and fine-tune the USMCA.   Mr. Lighthizer built a strong and sweeping coalition to strengthen  and  [[Page S226]]  expand markets for U.S. agriculture, manufacturing, and service  exports. Mr. Lighthizer built a broad and sweeping coalition to improve  labor and environmental protections in a balanced fashion, and Mr.  Lighthizer built a broad and sweeping coalition that will end up  growing wages for our workers. He ensured that all of this would be  subject to strong enforcement, which is the bedrock of any good trade  agreement, and it is in that enforcement that he took good ideas from  Wyden and Brown.   Unfortunately, these efforts that I just described to you became  entangled in a time-wasting partisan roadblock from the House of  Representatives. It is unfortunate for the American people, especially  our farmers, ranchers, and workers, that public policymaking took a  back seat to a partisan obsession of impeaching the 45th President.  That is a shame.   The President is upholding his promise to put America and Americans  first. His message resonates with tens of millions of Americans who  want to restore the American dream for their children and  grandchildren. These Americans want the next generation to have the  same opportunity to lay claim to the American dream that nine  generations before, going back to the Colonies, have built upon so that  each generation can live better than the preceding generation.   That American dream is that if you work hard and play by the rules,  you can earn a good living, get ahead, and stay ahead. A big plank in  President Trump's platform is fixing broken trade agreements. USMCA is  not the first of it because he has worked with Japan, and he has worked  with Korea, and today we saw the signing of phase one of the Chinese  agreement, so he is making great progress.   The President is determined to stop America's farmers and  manufacturers and workers and consumers from being taken for a ride.  When it comes to unfair trade agreements, we are finding out now that  the buck stops with President Trump. I am not sure, 3 years ago, I  would have said that, but I think after 3 years and USMCA, the Chinese  agreement, the Korean agreement, the Japanese agreement, and some other  things he has done in trade, he ought to wake everybody up that what he  ran on in his platform he has carried out.   With NAFTA, when it took effect 26 years ago this month, the digital  economy and the commercialization of the internet didn't even exist.  The USMCA creates the first U.S. free trade agreement with a digital  trade chapter. These important measures will help the $1.3 trillion  U.S. digital economy to flourish and grow faster. It improves efforts  to stop importers of counterfeit goods from ripping off consumers,  producers, and content creators. It provides for copyright and patent  protections to uphold trade secrets and to secure data rights so that  American ingenuity and innovation will drive economic growth, create  jobs, drive up consumer choices, and drive down prices for goods and  services our consumers need.   The USMCA levels the playing field for the U.S. auto industry by  encouraging companies to use more North American content and higher  wage labor. USMCA also fixes enforcement flaws that hog-tied NAFTA from  keeping everyone accountable to their commitments.   Speaking of hogs, the new NAFTA is good news for American farmers and  ranchers. My State of Iowa happens to benefit from this to a great  extent because my State is the Nation's No. 1 pork producer. In 2018,  Canada and Mexico bought more than 40 percent of U.S. pork exports.  These exports support 16,000 U.S. jobs.   USMCA preserves critical, duty-free access to Mexico and Canada. It  removes unfair restrictions on U.S. farm and food products. For the  first time ever, U.S. eggs and dairy exports will be sold in Canada.  This is very good news. It means an additional $227 million for dairy  exports to Canada and $50.6 million of exports into Mexico. My home  State of Iowa also is the No. 1 egg producer in the country. USMCA will  increase U.S. exports of poultry and eggs to Canada by $207 million. It  also addresses restrictions that kept U.S. wheat and wine out of  Canada.   I thank the former Iowa Governor and previous Agriculture Secretary,  Tom Vilsack, because, as the leading Democrat in the State of Iowa, he  set aside partisan motives embraced by other Members of his party to  work together with Senator Ernst, Governor Kim Reynolds, and me to  champion USMCA.   According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the USMCA will  raise real GDP by more than $68 billion, and USMCA will create nearly  176,000 jobs. So, all told, the trade pact is forecast to boost farm  and food exports by at least $2.2 billion. Considering the slump in the  farm economy, it is really shameful that passage of the USMCA was  stalled for over a year and nearly derailed by a partisan agenda,  including the impeachment.   Under the Trump economy, the United States is enjoying the longest  economic expansion in U.S. history. Ratification of the USMCA will help  America's economic engine fire on all cylinders and refuel prosperity  in rural America.   If you remember, I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that  passage of the USMCA is better late than never, and while I am looking  forward, I also take this opportunity to call on Canada to quickly  ratify the agreement. Now that Mexico has ratified and the United  States will soon be done with our ratification, all eyes will be on  Canada to get the job done quickly so that we can all work together to  implement this agreement. I don't have any doubt that Canada is going  to do that because I had opportunities earlier last year, several  times, to visit with the Canadian Foreign Minister, and she was very  certain that they would be passing this.   Let's not delay the people's business on other important matters  before us, such as drug pricing and retirement and pension legislation  that would provide peace of mind for Americans for their healthcare and  financial security.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
