 Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of seersucker  manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I wish everyone  a Happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American fashion has a  storied history dating back to 1909. The first seersucker suit was  designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street facility in New Orleans,  LA. Louisiana is proud to have played an important part in introducing  the country to seersucker apparel.   This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has  been worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot  summer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: ``Hot is hot, no matter what  you do for a living.''   In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by Members of this  Chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly resumed this  tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of Representatives and continued  this tradition in the U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to designate  Thursday, June 7, as the fifth annual National Seersucker Day. I  encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to commemorate this  traditionally American clothing.   (At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, tie following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)  [[Page S2515]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:           Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Monday, May 7,  2018, at 5:30 p.m. to hold a hearing on the following nominations:  Christopher Krebs, of Virginia, to be Under Secretary of Homeland  Security for National Protection and Programs, and David Williams, of  Illinois, and Robert M. Duncan, of Kentucky, both to be a Governor of  the United States Postal Service.  [[Page S2528]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, the nomination before us is for the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, specifically for Judge Kurt  Engelhardt, and I rise today to voice my strong support.   Judge Engelhardt is a Louisiana native, earning both his bachelor's  degree and law degree from Louisiana State University. I should note  that Judge Engelhardt was a member of the Golden Band from Tigerland as  a law student, one of the great college marching bands. He may have  missed all of that marching because he took up marathon running a few  years ago and has now completed 13 full marathons, including the Boston  Marathon and the New York City Marathon. All of this is to say that the  man has a personal life that is active and vigorous, but he also has a  legal life.   After law school, Judge Engelhardt clerked for Judge Charles Grisbaum  of the Louisiana Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He then practiced law  at Little & Metzger in Metairie before becoming an associate and then  partner at Hailey, McNamara, Hall, Larmann & Papale in Metairie.   In 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Judge Engelhardt for a  seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote in December 2001,  demonstrating that this body gave him bipartisan support as the quality  candidate he was. He has been the chief judge of the Eastern District  of Louisiana since 2015.   Judge Engelhardt has been an active member of the New Orleans Chapter  of the Federal Bar Association, serving on the board of directors for  10 years and as chapter president in 2011. He has active memberships in  the Federal District Judges Association, the Louisiana State Bar  Association, the New Orleans Bar Association, the Jefferson Bar  Association, and the Fifth Circuit District Judges Association.   In 2004, Judge Engelhardt was appointed by the Supreme Court to serve  on the Judicial Conference Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction for  two terms, and he has also served on the Louisiana Supreme Court's  Judiciary Commission.   Judge Engelhardt was also very active in serving the New Orleans  community, having served on the board of directors of the Cancer  Association of Greater New Orleans for more than 20 years.   Judge Engelhardt was confirmed out of the Judiciary Committee on  February 8, 2018, on a bipartisan basis. The committee recognizes that  confirming good, qualified judges who uphold the Constitution is one of  the Senate's top priorities.  [[Page S2529]]    Judge Engelhardt is the kind of fair-minded and experienced person we  need to serve on the bench. He has served the people of Louisiana well  as an article III judge for the past 17 years, and I have no doubt he  will continue to serve with the same high standards on the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   I support the nomination of Judge Kurt Engelhardt and urge all of my  colleagues to do so as well.   Thank you.
