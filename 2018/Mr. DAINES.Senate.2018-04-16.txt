 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote in  support of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.   My legislation is about bringing jobs to the most economically  disadvantaged communities in Montana and empowering Indian Tribes to  determine their own destinies. In fact, for 14 years, the Federal  Government has placed prohibitive regulations on tribes, which has  infringed on their rights and cost them jobs and economic  opportunities. Now Montana's Tribes and the Tribal communities across  the country suffer from some of the Nation's highest unemployment. This  legislation will restore the parity between Tribal governments and  Federal, State, and local governments as well as protect and respect  the Tribes' right to sovereignty.   It is time for the Federal Government to step out of the Tribes' way  so they can make the right decisions for their communities, for their  people, and create good-paying jobs on reservations.   On behalf of Montana's 12 federally recognized Tribes, as a member of  the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, as the chair of the Senate  Western Caucus, and as an original author of this legislation both in  this Congress and the last, I urge my colleagues to make the right  choice and support the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader
