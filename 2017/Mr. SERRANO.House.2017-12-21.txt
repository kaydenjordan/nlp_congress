 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   I rise to sadly oppose this disaster supplemental, which does not do  enough to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   This is a bill created by Republicans with little Democratic input.  At some point, they decided that rather than working in a bipartisan  manner, they wanted to try and address these disasters without taking  into account some of the most important Democratic priorities.   In particular, it does not address many issues crucial to Puerto  Rico's recovery in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. For instance,  it does nothing to address the looming Medicaid cliff, which will  devastate health kits access and delivery on the island early next  year. It does not waive numerous local cost share requirements, which  will make it extremely difficult for the government of Puerto Rico to  access large parts of the Federal funding made available here.   It does not do enough to help States like New York and New Jersey and  others that have generously opened their arms to our fellow citizens  displaced by these storms.                                time  1500    It expands the powers of the Puerto Rico Fiscal Oversight Board,  giving them authority to approve the recovery plans of Puerto Rico's  government.   The end result of all of this is further delay in Puerto Rico's  recovery. This is not the message that we want to send to 3.4 million  American citizens this holiday season.   As I look at my notes and as I look at what this debate may become  today, it really comes down to one point: we as Americans, we as the  United States Congress, we as the U.S. Government still have not come  to grips with the fact that, yes, we have territories, that, yes, we  have colonies.   If you ask the American people, ``Are the people of Puerto Rico  American citizens?'' you would be shocked before all this information  went out on the hurricanes how many would say: ``I don't know. I served  with some in the Army, but I don't know if they are citizens.''   Well, I think, more and more, we need to know that the Virgin  Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands, and  Puerto Rico are part of the American family. It is not as a long gone  member of my party once told me when I said: What are we going to do  about Puerto Rico in this bill?   He said: Well, we have no money left over.   I said: Did you have money left over for the 50 States?   He said: Well, they go first.   I said: Why do they go first? Why can't the whole family go together?   So my plea that I have made for years, I continue to make. There is a  bigger issue than the one we are discussing today, and that is the fact  that we have territories. We have colonies. They are part of the United  States. They should be part of our family. We should treat them as  such.
