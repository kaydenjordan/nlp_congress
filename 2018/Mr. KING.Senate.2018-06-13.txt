 Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from Texas for  his leadership both on the juvenile justice provision of the National  Defense Act, and also, very importantly, on foreign investment. We  often hear around here testimony about all-of-government efforts. What  we are facing is an all-of-society effort from some of our  competitors--principally, China. Their private sector and their public  sector are sometimes indistinguishable when it comes to investments.  That is why this modernization act that the Senator from Texas has  taken the lead on and has included as an amendment in the National  Defense Authorization Act is vitally important to national security.   I just want to thank the Senator for his leadership on a very  important issue and commend the work of the committee in including it  in the bill. Like the Senator, I look forward to supporting this bill.  I think it is important on many levels, but since the Senator is on the  floor, I wanted to commend him for his leadership on these issues.                                 Food Labels    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a regulatory  issue. It would be easy to joke about it, and I will probably not be  able to resist a few puns along the way, but it is very serious.   The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing food labels. They want  to make them more understandable. They want to make them more  informative to people when they are purchasing food in the grocery  store. They have increased the font size on the calorie serving size,  the number of servings in a container, and this all makes sense. But  there is a place where the proposed rule of the FDA goes off the rails,  if you will, and that involves maple syrup and honey, which the agency  is suggesting should have on its label ``added sugar.''   Well, maple syrup and honey essentially are sugar. And in pure maple  syrup, in pure honey, which we produce in our State and other States in  the Northern Tier, nothing is added. To add the phrase ``added sugar''  to maple syrup and honey makes no sense and is indeed confusing to the  consumer because if you read a label that says ``maple syrup'' and it  says ``added sugar,'' your natural assumption is somebody has put more  sugar in there. That is what you would take from that.   Indeed, that is what this label requirement that has been proposed  would do. It would actually undermine the good work that has been done  by the maple syrup industry and the honey industry over the years to  explain to consumers the difference between pure honey and pure maple  syrup and other products that have other things in them and may have  sugar added.   This is a photograph of where maple syrup comes from. This is a maple  tree, and the farmer is tapping it. These tubes all lead to a maple  house. Making maple syrup is not easy. It takes 40 gallons of sap to  make one gallon of syrup. That is why we call it liquid gold. It is a  wonderful product. It is a pure product. There is nothing that is added  between the tree and the jar that you buy in your grocery store if,  indeed, it is real maple syrup. Nothing is added.   Last week, I visited a wonderful guy in Maine who is known as the Bee  Whisperer, and he--or rather his bees--makes honey. We were out in a  back field where the hives are. I said: How many bees are out there? He  sort of scratched his head and said: About 3 million. Bees are in the  hives in this back field of the Bee Whisperer up in Maine and when the  honey comes into the combs, they scrape the wax off the top. The wax is  created by the bees, by the way, so it is a totally natural product.  The honey then comes out, and here it is coming out into a jar.   This is pure honey. To add to this label ``sugar added'' makes no  sense because it is not. There is nothing added, except what the bees  produce.   So this is a case where I think what we are talking about is a well- meaning attempt on the part of this agency, the FDA, to inform  consumers, but, in the process, what they are really doing is  misinforming them.   Honey comes from the bee to the jar--nothing in between. Maple syrup  comes from the tree to the jar--nothing in between. Nothing is added.  The only thing that is added by this proposed regulation is confusion,  and confusion is the whole thing we are trying to avoid here.   We are not adding sugar. Sugar isn't added into maple syrup and into  honey. If you put ``added sugar'' on the label, it will make the  consumer think that this isn't a pure product, and it will undo 50  years of effort to make the public understand the difference between  pure maple syrup and pure honey and something that may indeed have some  added ingredient.   MaryAnne Kinney--by the way, MaryAnne's husband is the guy that was  tapping the tree that I showed a minute ago--is a State legislator in  Maine, and she is also a maple producer, and she is in Washington this  week spreading the word about this issue. I just want to add my voice  to it because this would have a significant impact on these industries  nationwide. These are important businesses. In  [[Page S3884]]  Maine, maple syrup is a $20 million-a-year business.   I have to admit that one day years ago, when I was the Governor of  Maine, we used to tap a maple tree in the front yard of the Governor's  residence every year. It was a ceremonial event. The press was there. I  went out one year to tap that tree, nailed one of these guys into the  tree, and then the sap dripped out into the bucket. This is the old  fashioned way. The new way is what I showed before; the tubes run right  to the sugar house.   The press was there, and they said: Governor, what do you think of  Vermont maple syrup? I said: Vermont maple syrup? Are you kidding me?  We use that in cars in Maine; we don't eat that stuff. Well, it started  a war with the Governor of Vermont, which we settled amicably, I might  add.   Maple syrup is important to us. I think this is would be a funny  issue if it weren't so serious for producers. As a matter of fact, when  you say they are going to put ``added sugar'' on a label for maple  syrup, most people think it is kind of funny, but it is not funny to  the industry.   So I can't resist, Mr. President: I am hoping for a sweet ending to a  sticky mess and that the FDA this week will do the right thing.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
