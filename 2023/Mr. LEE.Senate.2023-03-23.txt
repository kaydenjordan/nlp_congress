 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are abdicating our constitutional duty.  Sometimes we do this when we delegate law-making power to the executive  branch. Sometimes we do this when we shirk in our responsibility to  declare war.   Today, I want to focus on the latter. By passing my amendment, we  have the opportunity to ensure that all Americans have a voice in  matters of war and peace.   For decades, Presidents of both parties have used authorizations for  use of military force to conduct military operations without meaningful  oversight or accountability to Congress.   The Founders jealously guarded war powers and the power to authorize  military force. They understood what it meant to be subjected to an  executive with unfettered military authority. And, indeed, this is one  of the essential distinguishing characteristics between our system of  government and that of England.   Prior to the American Revolution, our Founders became very familiar  with the British system, under which one person, the Monarch, could  take the entire country to war. It was up to Parliament, at that point,  to fund it and up to the people to fight it. But one person could take  the country to war.   The Founders understood this, and they understood that unchecked and  unaccountable wielding of military force is, in fact, the stuff of  Monarchs, of dictators and tyrants, which is exactly why the Founders  entrusted this authority only to the people's representatives, in the  branch of the Federal Government most accountable to the people at the  most regular intervals.   Throughout history, when Kings waged war, it was the people who  fought and died. One of the many things that makes our system of  government unique is this principle our Founders enshrined into our  Constitution, which gave every American a voice when they were faced  with the prospect of sending their sons and daughters to war.  Unfortunately, we have strayed from our founding principles.   My amendment, which can pass today, is a recognition that we, as  elected representatives, have a duty and an obligation to reclaim the  authority to declare war that rightfully belongs to the American  people. My amendment does precisely that. It implements a 2-year sunset  for all future authorizations for use of military force, absent renewal  by Congress.   In no way would my amendment hinder military planning or weaken our  national security posture. To the contrary, it would induce a proactive  approach rooted in the present day and time. It would reaffirm our  resolve and strengthen our military planning. It would show that we, as  representatives of the American people, are committed to conducting  military operations with oversight and accountability.   It accomplishes this by requiring a joint resolution of extension to  renew future AUMFs each Congress. Under this process, Congress may  choose to let an AUMF expire or renew it under a joint resolution of  extension with expedited procedures. This is a fast-track process,  requiring only a simple majority in the Senate, designed to make AUMF  renewals as easy and seamless as possible, so as not to hinder military  planning.   My amendment gives Congress the ability to review and reevaluate our  involvement in the wars and adjust them, if necessary, to better meet  the specific objectives of the conflict or engagement. This flexibility  and agility is nearly impossible under the current system, which has  opened the door for overly broad applications and interpretations of  existing AUMFs, sometimes past decades before the moment of a  particular conflict or engagement, which in turn leads to endless wars.  It would be a way for Congress to rein in this abuse without hindering  our ability to adequately respond to present-day national security  threats.   Now, some have argued that we don't enter into wars to withdraw; when  we must fight, we must win. But this argument has it exactly backward.  What could be stronger than a resolution reaffirming our commitment to  a given conflict?   And given that every Member of the House of Representatives is up for  reelection every 2 years and one-third of the Members of this body in  the Senate are up for election every 2 years, we resolve some of the  uncertainty that our partners and our adversaries might see, might  fear, might wonder about if, in fact, we are not regularly renewing  each AUMF in each Congress.   This is about accountability to the public. It is about the  republican form of government as a whole. It is about restoring  Congress's article I authority to declare war and authorize the use of  military force.   Let us do what we were elected to do: ensure that all Americans have  a voice in matters of great importance, especially when it comes to  matters of war and peace, and that no President has  [[Page S922]]  the power historically reserved for Monarchs, despots, and tyrants.   I implore my colleagues to pass this amendment and thus restore the  balance of powers mandated by the U.S. Constitution.                               Amendment No. 22     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 22 and ask that it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
