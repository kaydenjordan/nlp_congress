 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, on January 22, our Nation  mourned the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the treacherous ruling  that paved the way for the murder of more than 60 million innocent  babies, all precious, all worth saving, and all made in the perfect  image of God.   Thankfully, the victorious Dobbs ruling overturned Roe v. Wade last  year, rightfully returning the issue of abortion back to the States.  However, while we champion this momentous win in the fight for the  unborn, we cannot forget the millions of lives lost to the evils of  abortion.   Today, I introduced a resolution to recognize January 22 as the ``Day  of Tears'' to honor and mourn the loss of these unborn children.   But in the face of President Biden's pro-abortion agenda, we must do  more to defend the sanctity of human life. May God raise up more  warriors to protect innocent life because life, after all, is our first  and foremost fundamental unalienable right.   Last week, I proudly introduced--with nearly 90 original cosponsors-- the Protect the UNBORN Act to block and defund President Biden's pro- abortion executive orders. Congress must take action to protect the  unborn and prevent taxpayer dollars from funding the left's radical and  destructive abortion agenda.   We must never downplay the evils of abortion. As an unapologetic pro- life advocate, I am proud to defend the unborn and fight for the  sanctity of life.
