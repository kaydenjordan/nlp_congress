 Mr. Speaker, America should always pay  its bills, and we must do everything under the Sun to avoid a default.  Failure to do so would trigger massive job loss, a recession, and  rising costs.   Mr. Speaker, our national debt is over $31 trillion, and we must look  at ways while working together, Democrats and Republicans, to get this  under control.   I encourage the President and congressional leaders to put the  American people first. We must depoliticize debt ceiling negotiations.   Mr. Speaker, eastern North Carolinians elected me to fight for  higher-paying jobs, policies that will boost our economy, and to end  high prices. A default goes against all of this, and it would only make  life harder for my constituents.                            ____________________
