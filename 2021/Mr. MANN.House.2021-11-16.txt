 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the gross misuse of a  noble process called reconciliation and the President's apparent lack  of concern for the well-being of rural and middle-class Americans.   The reconciliation process exists to do exactly what its name  suggests--to direct Congress with a tool of compromise to reduce the  national deficit with a simple majority vote in both Chambers.  President Biden, Speaker Pelosi, and House Democrats are, instead,  using this process to jam partisan legislation through a deadlocked  Congress. This is shameless, and American taxpayers will bear the cost  in both their wallets and their consciences.   The reconciliation package is chock-full of policy moves that will  damage our country and compromise our integrity as a nation. Among them  are the expansion of welfare without work requirements. At a time when  our supply chains are in crisis and we have help wanted signs at every  corner, this will only worsen the issue. Another troubling provision  would give the IRS $80 billion to hire 87,000 new agents and ramp up  audits on individuals and small businesses.   Just a few other terrible provisions include increasing penalties for  businesses who don't comply with OSHA vaccine mandates which are an  egregious Federal Government overreach, imposing new fines on the oil  and gas industry, and punishing States like Kansas who have opted not  to expand Medicaid.   Perhaps the worst part of the entire reconciliation package, though,  is what is not included. Democrats have excluded the Hyde amendment, a  longstanding bipartisan amendment that protects Americans who oppose  abortion from being forced to pay for these abortions from their tax  dollars.   While the President is on a tax-and-spend spree for his party's  leftist wish list, the price of nearly everything is skyrocketing in  this country. Americans are heading into the holiday season more  financially insecure because of this administration's policies.  Consumer prices have increased over 6 percent since last year--the  highest rate of inflation in over 30 years. Should this massive  spending package become law, Mr. Speaker, you can expect prices to keep  going up.   While the White House has stated this bill will cost $1.75 trillion,  the true cost of the reconciliation package could be as much as $3.98  trillion according to some models. As if adding to our Nation's already  enormous debt wasn't enough, this bill will drive up inflation and end  up taxing the middle class.   This bill is twice as long as the Bible, it is toxic for the American  people, and it is a gross misuse of a usually noble process. I stand in  opposition to it on numerous counts.   Mr. Speaker, the BBB is bad, bad, bad for America, and I urge this  Congress to join me in strongly opposing it.                            ____________________
