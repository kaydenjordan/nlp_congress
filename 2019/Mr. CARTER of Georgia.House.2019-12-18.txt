 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Democrats' sham  process, which makes a mockery of the rules of the House and is,  frankly, dangerous to this country.   Since day one, the Democrats have made it clear that they wanted to  move toward impeachment well before any of the accusations took place.  What Democrats, unfortunately, don't recognize is the damage that this  will cause for our political institutions and America's trust for years  to come.   Every American should be concerned that Speaker Pelosi doesn't trust  our citizens to let them decide who should lead our great country.   This impeachment process isn't focused on strengthening and  protecting our political foundations but, rather, shaping public  opinion.   I ask you: Is it worth that?   Not only is the process alarming, but it is wasting taxpayer dollars  and valuable time that elected officials could be using to move our  country forward. That includes: securing our borders, addressing  student loan debt, and bringing down the cost of healthcare and  prescription drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, while considering these  articles, to ask themselves whether this is truly being done for the  good of the country.
