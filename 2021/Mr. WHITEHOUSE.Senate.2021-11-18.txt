 Madam President, I rise today to honor Janet Coit,  one of Rhode Island's most respected environmental advocates. Ms. Coit  is the newly appointed Assistant Administrator for the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service. She  joined NOAA after a decade of committed service leading the Rhode  Island Department of Environmental Management under three Governors.   After graduating from Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School,  where Ms. Coit was a member of the Environmental Law Journal, she  served as counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Environment and  Public Works. She went on to serve as counsel and environmental  coordinator for the late Senator John Chafee and, subsequently, his son  Senator Lincoln Chafee.   Ms. Coit then returned to Rhode Island and began a decade of work as  the State director for the Nature Conservancy, where she oversaw some  of the State's largest land conservation projects.   Ms. Coit went on to be appointed by Governor Lincoln Chafee to serve  as director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.  Governors Raimondo and McKee wisely kept her in that position. Her  legacy at DEM includes streamlined permitting processes, new  opportunities for families to connect with nature, and improved  customer service. As the longest serving chief executive in DEM's  history, she focused on public parks, promoting local food systems,  Rhode Island's fishing and shellfish industries, and climate solutions.  She seized opportunities to coordinate regional efforts, including  addressing equity and justice issues, improving water quality, managing  PFAS contamination, and fighting the climate crisis. In this capacity,  she also served as chair of the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change  Coordinating Council and on the board of directors for the Regional  Greenhouse Gas Initiative. She has received numerous awards for her  outstanding contributions at DEM.   In June, the Biden-Harris administration appointed Ms. Coit to lead  NOAA Fisheries, where she oversees fisheries management, protected  species, and fisheries habitat conservation. She also serves as the  Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and  Deputy Administrator, supporting and managing NOAA's coastal and marine  programs.   We are fortunate that exceptional people like Ms. Coit choose to  dedicate their careers to public service. I am proud to recognize her  today and thank her for her many contributions to the State of Rhode  Island and the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor an  accomplished policymaker, a protector of environmental and public  health, and my State representative: Lauren Carson. Representative  Carson represents Rhode Island's 75th district and has a long history  of working on issues related to sea level rise, reducing waste, and  protecting the health and safety of Rhode Islanders.   Representative Carson holds a bachelor's degree from Ramapo College  and two master's degrees from the University of Rhode Island. She is a  businessowner and an environmental advocate who worked for several  years with Clean Water Action.   Representative Carson also served her community through several  organizations, including the advisory board of the Alliance for a  Livable Newport, the Newport Energy and Environment Commission, the  Rhode Island Green Infrastructure Coalition, and the Environmental  Council of Rhode Island.   In 2014, Representative Carson successfully ran for a seat in the  State legislature. At the statehouse, she has moved policy forward to  protect Rhode Island's environment. Among many other accomplishments,  Ms. Carson created and led a commission on the effects of rising seas.  She introduced a bill that created a uniform statewide process for  permitting solar panel installations. She cosponsored legislation to  phase out polluting cesspools. Earlier this year, she was appointed as,  deputy majority leader, a role which she used to steward the 2021 Act  on Climate into law, setting statewide net-zero goals for 2050 across  all sectors. She coleads the Aquidneck Island Climate Caucus to give  voice to the importance of preventing and preparing for a warmer world  and focus the island's efforts on sea level rise.   I am glad to recognize Representative Carson's dedicated service and  to share my appreciation for all of her contributions to our State and  our environment.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor one of  Rhode Island's most respected oceans and environmental policymakers,  who happens to also be my State Senator, Dawn Euer. All of us whom have  worked with Senator Euer recognize her deep commitment to Rhode Island  and to safeguarding the future of the planet by fighting the climate  crisis.   Senator Euer earned a law degree from Roger Williams University.  While in law school, she served as a legal intern in my office, where I  saw firsthand her dedication to public service and to using the law to  better the lives of others.   Senator Euer began her political career as an activist and organizer.  She was instrumental in the fight to make gay marriage the law of the  land in Rhode Island.   Senator Euer has served on the boards of the Environmental Justice  League of Rhode Island and Bike Newport. She has also advised the  Newport City Council on energy efficiency, renewables, sustainable  planning, and other environmental matters.   In 2017, Senator Euer successfully ran to represent parts of Newport  and Jamestown in the Rhode Island State Senate. Running in a district  on the front lines of climate change and sea level rise, Senator Euer  advocated for substantial investments in renewable energy and  resiliency. In the last legislative session, Senator Euer delivered on  that promise in a big way. She succeeded in passing the Act on Climate  bill, the most comprehensive climate legislation in State history. As  the lead sponsor, Senator Euer developed an actionable plan to create  mandatory and enforceable emissions reduction goals that chart a course  to a safer future. With that legislative victory in hand, Senator Euer  recently traveled to COP26 in Glasgow to help show the world that  American climate leadership is back.   For my friend Senator Euer's tireless efforts in championing the 2021  Act on Climate and for all of her hard work on behalf of the people of  Newport and Jamestown, I stand today to recognize her.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor Meg  Kerr, a staunch advocate for the environmental movement. Ms. Kerr  retired earlier this year after a successful career of climate  leadership and service to the State of Rhode Island.   After graduating from Brown University and the University of North  Carolina, Ms. Kerr began the early part of her career as a scientist.  She worked for the Environmental Protection Agency across North  Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., where she partnered with  States to standardize water quality reporting aligned with the Clean  Water Act.   Ms. Kerr then moved back to Rhode Island and quickly established  herself as a prominent advocate for the environment, taking on roles at  the Rhode Island Rivers Council, the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program,  and Clean Water Action. Ms. Kerr closed out her impressive career as  the Audubon Society of Rhode Island's Senior Director of Policy.   To add to the list of her accomplishments, Ms. Kerr was a founder of  the Rhode Island Green Infrastructure Coalition and helped launch the  Providence Stormwater Innovation Center. She also helped found the  annual Land and Water Conservation Summit that brought together  hundreds of environmentalists from the State and region for over a  decade. Ms. Kerr is passionate about pollinators, as demonstrated by  her work organizing the Bee Rally to bring attention to the threats  faced by our beloved bugs.   Ms. Kerr is a fierce and respected leader for the environment and a  familiar face at the Rhode Island statehouse. Her expertise, mentorship  of others, and ability to get things done for Rhode Island's  environmental community has made a real mark on our State. I am proud  to recognize her service and thank her for all she has done to protect  our environment.                            ____________________
