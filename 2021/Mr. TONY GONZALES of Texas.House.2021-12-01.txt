 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  my bill, H.R. 4706, the Blackwell School National Historic Site Act.   The Blackwell School is located in the heart of my district, Marfa,  Texas. This week we are voting on legislation that makes this landmark  a national historic site under the National Park Service.                                time  1345    When it comes to recognizing lands as national historic sites or  national parks, it is paramount to look outside traditional parameters.  We must identify and preserve our history from all walks of life and  share stories of forgotten Americans, including the history of Mexican  Americans and their struggle for equality.   The Blackwell School operated from 1909 to 1965 as a segregated  school for children of Mexican descent. While segregation was mandated  by law for African Americans, it was optional for school districts to  segregate Mexican students. Marfa chose to segregate. Children who  attended the Blackwell School were banned from speaking Spanish and  even had to bury slips of paper with Spanish words in a mock funeral  ceremony.   The school operated during a time of American history when separate  but equal dominated our culture. Segregation is an ugly stain on  America's legacy, and while we have progressed as a country, we must  acknowledge the painful role segregation played in our Nation's  history.   Establishing the Blackwell School as a national historic site ensures  that the building is maintained properly so generations to come can  understand its rich but complicated history. The impact of establishing  this landmark as a national historic site goes beyond cultural  influence as well. My district is home to eight of Texas' 16 national  parks such as Big Bend National Park. As I traveled through my  district, I have seen the positive economic and societal impacts our  national parks have on our communities. Establishing the Blackwell  School as a national landmark would bring increased tourism and  increased economic activity to Presidio County and Marfa.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend, Fil Vela, for  cosponsoring this bill; Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva; and,  of course, Ranking Member Bruce Westerman for prioritizing this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, most importantly, I would  like to thank the Blackwell School Alliance and the National Parks  Conservation Association for their commitment to giving this landmark  the recognition it deserves. The Blackwell School has been an important  piece of history for west Texas and many Mexican Americans across the  country, and we are ready to share it with the world.
