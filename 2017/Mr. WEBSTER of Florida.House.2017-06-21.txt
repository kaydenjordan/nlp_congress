 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 392 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1873.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1504                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1873) to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976  to enhance the reliability of the electricity grid and  [[Page H5023]]  reduce the threat of wildfires to and from electric transmission and  distribution facilities on Federal lands by facilitating vegetation  management on such lands, with Mr. Womack in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Webster) and the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today marks the Committee on Natural Resources' Subcommittee on  Water, Power and Oceans' first step in advancing an infrastructure  agenda that aims to improve our Nation's infrastructure and expedite  the development of new infrastructure.   As vice chairman of the subcommittee, chaired by the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), I have already seen a number of bills advance  through the committee that, like the bill in front of us today, employ  simple, pragmatic solutions to improve our Nation's infrastructure and  advance an all-of-the-above energy and water strategy.   The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, a bipartisan  bill offered by my colleagues, Mr. LaMalfa and Mr. Schrader, is about  avoiding electricity blackouts, preventing forest fires, and promoting  healthy habitat for wildlife on Federal lands.   This bill represents a simple, pragmatic solution to an issue that is  born out of a lack of communication and consistency within a Federal  agency.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Conaway for agreeing to help expedite  consideration of this bill today.   I commend my colleagues, Mr. LaMalfa from California and Mr. Schrader  from Oregon, for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of  legislation.   I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                       Washington, DC, May 19, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1873, the       Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. It is my       understanding that, on April 27, 2017, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered the bill reported with amendments.        This legislation contains provisions within the Committee       on Agriculture's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your       having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite       this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on       Agriculture will forego action on the bill. This is being       done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so       will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Agriculture with respect to the appointment of       conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in the Committee Report and       in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of       this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                       Washington, DC, May 22, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 27, 2017, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered reported as amended H.R. 1873, the       Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, by a       bipartisan roll call vote of 24 to 14. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Agriculture.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Agriculture represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural       Resources to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I also thank Mr. Webster for managing this  legislation for us here on the floor today. I appreciate it.    I rise today as a sponsor in strong support, of course, of H.R. 1873.  It is indeed a commonsense vegetation management bill that reduces  forest fire danger possibilities and electricity blackouts, while  cutting through the bureaucratic red tape in the process.   I also want to thank my colleague Mr. Schrader from Oregon for his  strong support in making this a true bipartisan effort for something  that really should have no partisan roots at all.   As we have heard several of my colleagues speak earlier in testimony  on the floor here today, there are gross inconsistencies and  impediments in the way the Forest Service and BLM manage transmission  lines, particularly in the West, where many of these lines run through  difficult terrain and dense forest.   One electric utility in my district, the City of Redding Electric  Utility, uses helicopters to engage in vegetation management along the  rights-of-way on Federal lands. Such remote and forested areas make it  especially difficult to effectively manage an area so large and dense.   Rapid agency response is needed to help electric utility requests to  conduct routine and emergency vegetation maintenance along Federal  rights-of-way. It is absolutely essential to avoid wildfires and  blackouts.   Another benefit this bill brings to utility companies is much-needed  safeguards in instances where the Secretary fails to allow them to trim  or remove a hazardous tree. There was an unfortunate incident in La  Pine, Oregon, in which a rural electric utility company was unjustly  billed for a $300,000 fire suppression bill when its request to remove  a tree in imminent danger of falling on a transmission line was denied  by the Forest Service.   This bill would provide the electric utility companies the confidence  and means to manage and maintain their own transmission lines from  overgrown and unmanaged trees along rights-of-way, something the  Federal Government should already be doing in the first place.   You see from the example here that electricity frequently is  generated in rural parts of our country, and long, long transmission  lines are needed to get to the urban parts of the country. So we are  all in this: blackouts for the urban areas and, indeed, black skies in  our rural areas where the forests are from unneeded wildfires.   The Forest Service's own document shows that, between 2012 and 2013,  approximately 350 forest fires were caused by this interface of damaged  trees, dying trees, falling trees falling into the different types of  lines you would find in rural areas in order to move the power.   These changes to status quo are long overdue. This bill is an answer  to many of the problems electricity companies are having with the  management of electricity rights-of-way on Federal lands. Too many  dying and dead trees have fallen unnecessarily on power lines, sparking  devastating forest fires that could have been prevented had they had  that ability to remove the tree in question.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.   Mr. LaMALFA. By providing the utilities with the tools they need to  ensure the reliability and the longevity of our national forests, we  can bolster investment in energy infrastructure and enhance the lives  of all Americans and do much better to preserve the habitat of these  areas that we treasure.   I urge swift passage of the bill today and favor in the Senate when  it gets over there. Indeed, I thank my colleagues for helping this  process along today.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, it really is amazing that the bureaucratic  tangle that has been caused by our so-called environmental laws has now  reached the point that even dead trees on public lands that threaten to  fall on power lines and cause major forest fires cannot be removed  without permission from Federal bureaucrats. And then to add insult to  insanity, when the bureaucracy denies or delays permission and a fire  results, the cost of the fire is paid by the utility's customers  through higher household electricity bills.   Mr. LaMalfa mentioned a situation in La Pine, Oregon, where the  Midstate Electric Cooperative begged the Forest Service for permission  to trim trees that were threatening their power lines, and they were  refused. Well, sure enough, when one of those trees fell on a power  line and started a fire, the utility's customers were forced to pay the  firefighting costs that resulted, a third of a million dollars.    Carbon Power & Light warned the Forest Service of trees threatening  their lines. The Forest Service required them first to conduct $1.6  million of environmental studies paid by the utility's customers. If  there had been a fire in the meantime, they would have had to pay those  costs as well.   Mr. LaMalfa's bill basically does two things:   First, it exempts such projects from time-consuming and costly  environmental reviews. After all, there is nothing more devastating to  the forest environment than a forest fire. Our environmental laws are  now causing these fires.   Second, when a Federal agency delays or denies permission for a  utility to remove or trim hazard trees and they end up causing a fire,  the liability is placed where it belongs: on the agency and its  bureaucrats, not on the utility and its customers; and it gives  utilities permission to remove imminent threats to power lines before  they can cause a fire.   Mr. Chair, you may have noticed, common sense is not exactly common  to government. Let's change that today by adopting this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers and I  am prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers and I  am prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I commend the bill's  sponsors for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of  legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, the goal of H.R. 1873 is to  provide certainty to utilities, their line workers, and their  consumers, not forcing unnecessary, one-size-fits-all regulations.   Each plan can be tailored by an individual utility based on the  service territory, region, and other characteristics. Some utilities  may not choose to submit plans because they are satisfied with their  local Forest Service office. Others, especially those who have rights- of-ways that predate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, may  not want to trigger Federal paperwork costs that are ultimately passed  on to their consumers.   This amendment, if adopted, would significantly burden Federal Land  Management agencies by inundating them with all kinds of submittals.  Additionally, if you want to increase the cost of this bill, then this  amendment will do just that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I would  inject additional bureaucracy into the bill that is unintended to do  exactly the opposite of what this bill intended to do.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment, but I am not opposed to it.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment prohibits any  loss of funds for wildfire suppression activities. The bill also  provides electric utilities with the certainty that they need to ensure  that downed trees do not fall on power lines, which would prevent many  of these wildfires from starting in the first place.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5031]]
