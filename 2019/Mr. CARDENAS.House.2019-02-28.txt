 Madam Speaker, I have the honor and the privilege of  being a Member of the House of Representatives.   I also am speaking without notes because, over 40 years ago, I lost a  teenage friend of mine just a few yards from my front door in what was  perhaps one of the first drive-bys in the history of Los Angeles, a  senseless killing where a young man on drugs decided to shoot through a  wall of someone's home--my friend's home. With one shot, Rudy died at  the age of 16.   Today, I had the honor and the privilege of voting on a bill that  would make our streets safer--not solve every problem, but reduce the  amount of crying and dying that goes on in too many communities around  America.   I must say this--and it is unfortunate to have to clarify--because I  am Latino, people are assuming that the person who shot Rudy was a  Latino or a Black male or what have you. He was not. He was a young  man--a victim, himself, of drug abuse--a White young man.   It should never happen to anyone, and people should never assume that  it only happens to certain people in certain communities. Tens of  thousands of human lives are lost every year in the greatest country,  America, and we need to make it better.                            ____________________
