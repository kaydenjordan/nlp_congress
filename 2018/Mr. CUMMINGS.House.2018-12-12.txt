 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind everyone that the  enrollment period to sign up for 2019 health plans on healthcare.gov,  and in many States like my home State of  [[Page H10106]]  Maryland, ends in just 3 days. That is Saturday, December 15.   I have often said that voting for the Affordable Care Act was the  most important vote of my career. When Congress passed the Affordable  Care Act in 2010, we enshrined into law the promise that all Americans  have a right to accessible and affordable health insurance coverage in  this great country.   By strengthening the individual health insurance market, protecting  people with preexisting conditions, and expanding Medicaid, we brought  this promise closer to reality. We promised that individuals would not  have to worry about affording health insurance or paying outrageous  rates because of preexisting conditions. We safeguarded access to care  for people who need it by preventing health insurance providers from  placing limits on their coverage.   Because of the ACA, individuals and families across this country do  not have to live with the daily fear of financial disaster they could  face if they got sick while they were uninsured. In total,  approximately 20 million Americans gained health insurance coverage as  a result of the ACA.   During the November election, the American people reminded us that  they want their elected officials to protect their access to affordable  healthcare. In my home State of Maryland, the uninsured population is  at an all-time low of 6.1 percent. As more people have gotten coverage,  the cost of uncompensated care in Maryland hospitals has gone down by  $400 million from 2013 to 2017.   The open enrollment period that is quickly coming to a close in many  States is the only time during which people can act to protect  themselves and their families by purchasing coverage through  healthcare.gov or their State health insurance marketplace.   Quality health plans for 2019 are more affordable than many people  may realize. Eight in ten people using healthcare.gov qualify for  financial assistance, meaning that most people can find a health plan  with a premium of less than $75 per month.   According to data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services through December 1, enrollment is down 11 percent on the  Federal exchange compared to last year.   I am proud that Maryland has embraced the ACA to help people in our  State secure the coverage they need to keep their families healthy and  safe. I am proud of all the hard work the Maryland Health Connection  continues to do to make it easier for people to get enrolled.   The Trump administration has focused their efforts on sabotaging the  ACA by making it harder for Americans to sign up for coverage through  actions such as shortening the enrollment period, slashing funding for  marketing and outreach programs, and lowering spending by more than 80  percent on local in-person assistance through the navigator program.   Because of these efforts, there is fear about the future of ACA. I  want to make one thing very clear: The ACA is not going anywhere,  despite the efforts of the Trump administration to sabotage this law.  Please know that I intend to do everything in my power to keep the ACA  intact and to make sure that people have health coverage that is  meaningful, affordable, and accessible.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone in the next 3 days to discuss your  options and find out how to get the best plan for you as an individual  and for your family.   Everyone deserves access to healthcare that will improve their lives.  Healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and I pledge to do my part to  protect that right.                            ____________________
