 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Leger Fernandez for  convening this Special Order hour to discuss the urgent topic of  immigration reform.   Last week, I had the opportunity and privilege of visiting the U.S.- Mexico border to bear witness to the carceral system that undergirds  our immigration policy and practices.   I gained a firsthand understanding of how our Federal policies impact  the conditions at the border. While there, I visited a Catholic  Charities shelter that centered its work around caring for newly  arrived asylum seekers. This shelter operates on a shoestring budget  and relies on FEMA to retroactively reimburse spending for essentials  like food, a funding process that is never certain. And most of the  workers there were volunteers from across the country. While their  facilities lacked resources, it was abundant with care.   I then saw inside a well-funded Customs and Border Protection, or  CBP, facility, where law enforcement had put over 10 men, who had not  been tested for COVID, together in one small cell, sleeping on the  concrete floor, even when other cells were sitting empty.                                time  1915    For context, the current year, the funding level for CBP is more than  $15 billion.   In New York's 16th Congressional District which I represent, one- third of my constituents are born outside of the United States. I  represent thousands of undocumented constituents, refugees, and  immigrants living and working in the Bronx and Westchester who have to  navigate our immigration system on a regular basis with fear from ICE  agents. In our home State of New York is Ellis Island which reads:       Give me your tired, your poor,      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,      The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.      Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,      I lift my lamp beside the golden door!    The U.S. Mexico border is the new Ellis Island, yet these newcomers-- a darker hue than those who came to Ellis Island with welcome arms--are  met with punishment, walls, and harm. We send our tired and our poor to  prison-like detention centers without proper medical care and little  food and produce a retraumatizing experience for those who already made  a scary and life-threatening trek across the border.   I heard stories of mothers traveling with their 1-month-old babies  across the river, carrying their babies on their heads as they waded  through the waters. Now imagine the level of desperation in your home  country, Madam Speaker, where you would risk the life of yourself and  your 1-month-old baby to come to this country with no guarantee that  you were going to be able to remain here.   We need to reimagine and redesign our immigration system and the  support we provide to our immigration neighbors. If we want to live up  to the ideals of this country, our system must be rooted in care and  inclusion, not militarization, surveillance, detention, and forced  deportation.   As a Black man in America and as Black people in America, we have  been experiencing mass incarceration since the end of slavery. Our  brothers and sisters coming in through the Mexico border to the U.S.  are experiencing mass incarceration and mass deportation under the  hands of CBP.   The differences in funding and capacity at the Catholic Charities  shelter, which heavily relies on donations, versus the CBP facility was  startling and disheartening. The vast majority of CBP apprehensions,  Madam Speaker--over 90 percent--were determined by Border Patrol to not  be criminals. Over 90 percent, the Border Patrol told me. Yet the vast  majority of our annual funding to this region goes to law enforcement.  We need a fundamental shift in our priorities to move away from funding  detention and militarization at our border.   This is especially true given how past U.S. policies, such as the  U.S. occupation of Nicaragua in 1912 and other Latin American  countries, and our historic empowerment of corrupt governments have  contributed to instability, violence, and economic oppression; all of  which force people to flee their home countries and seek asylum here.   Yes, our immigration policy is connected to our foreign policy and  connected to our capitalism. We have stolen land and resources from  foreign countries and caused their political and economic systems to be  disrupted and taken over by violence. The guns that get to many of  these countries come from here. So we have caused this harm and  disruption, yet we won't allow those who are looking for peace to flee  into our country.   We also need to create a pathway to citizenship for all of the 11.4  million undocumented immigrants as part of the next reconciliation  package. The young adults whom we met with in Laredo, Texas, whose  family members had been deported deserve a pathway to citizenship.   By the way, once CBP, which seemed to be hunters in this situation,  detain someone and they need long-term detention, they pass them over  to the ICE agents. Then the ICE agents put them in detention, and they  are so isolated they can't receive calls from family and friends, they  can't receive letters, and they can't receive visits. Finally, when  someone finds a way to make a connection with the detention center, the  person who was in the detention center is lost, often never to be  found.   The young adults whom I met with in Laredo whose family members have  been deported deserve a pathway to citizenship. The high schoolers in  my district who fear they won't be able to file for DACA status and  stay in our country for college deserve a pathway to citizenship. From  Laredo, Texas, to the Bronx, to Westchester, to St. Louis, Missouri,  there are millions of people who should be able to stay in this country  and continue to help our communities thrive.   We have the power to provide stability and a sense of belonging to  our immigrant communities this Congress, and we cannot wait any longer.   I will end with this: during the last administration there was so  much fear  [[Page H4281]]  instilled in our immigrant families and communities that one student in  the Bronx thought that her mom was deported from home, but the mom  actually ran away so she wouldn't be deported. But because the student  thought that the mother was deported, the student fell into a deep  depression and committed suicide because she thought her mother was  taken from her.   This is what we are dealing with when it comes to our immigration  policy. It is inhumane, and it is evil. Our immigrants make us a  stronger nation, not a weaker one. It is time for a 21st century  Marshall Plan to help rebuild Central and South America. But those who  come in here should be welcomed with open arms as they are just seeking  peace, safety, care, and security. If we are as a nation to live up to  the ideals of our democracy and our Constitution, then we must welcome  them with open arms and with love so that we can build a better nation  back better.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Leger Fernandez for her  leadership.
