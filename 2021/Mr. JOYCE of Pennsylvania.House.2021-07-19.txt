 Mr. Speaker, at the grocery store and at  the gas pump American families are facing a harsh new reality. Rising  prices have effectively created both a tax hike and a pay cut for our  workers.   At the height of summer, families are now paying 3 percent more for  fruits and vegetables, 9 percent more for milk, and 18 percent more for  bacon.   Instead of addressing this crisis, President Biden and liberals in  Congress are doing what they always do, spending money that we don't  have and asking taxpayers to cover the difference.   Another $3.5 trillion spending bill is not what our country needs.   Passing the Green New Deal under another name will not help American  families.   In Pennsylvania, inflation has harsh consequences on our local  businesses like Guy Chemical in Somerset County who has seen a 30 to 50  percent rise in costs.   Let's make it clear: President Biden's failed policies are putting  American businesses and American families at risk.  [[Page H3638]]                                ____________________
