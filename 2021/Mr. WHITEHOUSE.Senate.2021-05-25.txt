 Mr. President, here we go again. Just a few weeks  ago, the Senate debated Vanita Gupta's nomination for Associate  Attorney General, so let's review the bidding from that.   Gupta was eminently qualified for her role. She had support from the  foremost law enforcement leaders and groups in the country. She had  proven herself handling high-level government responsibilities. But  Republicans set their hair on fire trying to take Ms. Gupta down. They  grasped for something, anything, to dent her prospects. Eventually they  landed on contorting an 8-year-old op-ed, even calling her accurate  responses to their questions about it lies. It wasn't pretty.   Now we are back on the floor with Republican hair aflame again, this  time over the nominee to run the Justice Department's Civil Rights  Division, Kristen Clarke. Like Ms. Gupta, Ms. Clarke is eminently  qualified. She knows civil rights law inside and out. She has run one  of the Nation's leading civil rights organizations. She is a superb,  well-trained, experienced lawyer.   Conservatives have endorsed her, like President George W. Bush's DHS  Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Republican National Committee  Chairman Michael Steele. Law enforcement organizations like the Major  Cities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs  of Police support her.   She ought to have flown through committee and been a quick vote here  on the floor, but, no, it is hair-on-fire time again. Why all the coifs  aflame? Look behind the smokescreens and remember that the No. 1  strategy of the Republican Party for 2022 is to keep voters from  voting. And guess what. Ms. Clarke will run the voting rights section  of the Department, and Ms. Gupta, who used to run that same Civil  Rights Division, will supervise her as Assistant Attorney General.   Behind the ruckus over Ms. Gupta and now Ms. Clarke is a dark money  operation out to suppress the vote. It has the trade craft of a covert  operation--cutouts, front groups, secret money--and that covert  operation is now focused on preventing, as our colleague Senator  Warnock says, ``some people'' from voting. And Ms. Clarke and Ms. Gupta  will be the lawful, legal opposition to the dark money, voter- suppression apparatus.   Here is what we know. When Trump was in power, this covert op ran a  dark money-funded apparatus within the Federalist Society to select  Federal judges. For 4 years, the Federalist Society's operation was the  gatekeeper to the Federal bench. Virtually every judicial candidate who  passed through this dark money-funded turnstile was approved by big,  anonymous donors out to control the courts. Donors got to approve  judges and Justices who would have their backs.   That dark money turnstile was step 1. Step 2 was dark money-funded  political campaigns for Senate confirmation of the nominees who got  through the turnstile. For Trump's three Supreme Court nominees, this  was done by the Judicial Crisis Network, headquartered literally down  the hall from the Federalist Society--not just the same building, the  same hallway, but they also share staff. In each Supreme Court  confirmation, a $15 million or a $17 million check from a secret donor  would fund the advertising campaign.   Step 3 is dark money-funded front organizations appearing before the  donor-selected Justices in orchestrated flotillas with common donors  behind them, undisclosed to the Court.   When Trump lost, of course, step 1 and step 2 lost their salience and  closed up shop. But with Trump judges still on the court, these front  groups are still at it. In one case before the Supreme Court right now,  50 organizations--50 organizations--that filed briefs received funding  through rightwing groups involved in this operation.   Dark money funding can't be traced back to its original donors,  obviously, because it is dark money, but a 2019 Washington Post  investigation revealed that one guy, Leonard Leo, while executive vice  president of the Federalist Society, from 2014 to 2017 coordinated $250  million--a quarter of a billion dollars--across a network of the front  groups engaged in this court capture operation. Recent testimony in my  Courts Subcommittee raised that number to over $400 million--nearly  half a billion dollars--through 2018. Four hundred million is a lot of  money, but a captured court, that is a pearl beyond price.   This Leo operation worked wonderfully during the Trump Presidency.  Donors got their judges. Judicial Crisis Network and Leonard Leo got  their dark money. But then that Post investigation came out, and  Trump's polling started to tank. So, like a burned agent, Leonard Leo  bugged out.   Where did he bug out to? Well, Leo surfaced early last year with a  group called the Honest Elections Project. These phony-baloney front  groups love to have the name that is the exact opposite of what they  are actually doing. So this one is called the Honest Elections Project,  and it has been running voter suppression activities in key  battleground States, sending threatening letters to local election  officials, and filing lawsuits to restrict voting--and, of course, all  dark money-funded.   But poke a little further and you discover that the Honest Elections  Project is a legal alias of something called the Judicial Education  Project, which is--you guessed it--the sister group to Judicial Crisis  Network--yep, Leo's judicial confirmation attack-ad organization. And,  of course, behind this covert op was dark money, much of it run through  DonorsTrust, the identity-laundering, dark money ATM established by the  Kochs' donor network. Before it took on this Honest  [[Page S3392]]  Elections Project alias, more than 99 percent of the Judicial Education  Project's 2018 revenue was a single, anonymous $7.8 million donation  that came through, of course, DonorsTrust. There is no way to know who  cut that check   What does all this dark money finagling and front group subterfuge  tell us? As a reporter for the Guardian observed, the Honest Elections  Project, so-called, melds two goals of the rightwing dark money  operation: One, pack the Federal judiciary, and two, bring voting  rights cases before the packed courts. Rigging elections by keeping  ``some people'' from voting is now a Republican priority, and if Trump  judges will help, so much the better.   Just recently, we actually learned more about the covert voter  suppression operation. The watchdog group Documented and the magazine  Mother Jones uncovered a video of a presentation by the dark money  group Heritage Action to its top donors. In the video, the presenter  brags about getting what she called ``key provisions''--``key  provisions''--into voter suppression legislation in dozens of capitals  around the country.   She tells the donors, and I am quoting here, ``In some cases, we  actually draft them for them''--they actually draft the laws for the  State legislatures--``or,'' she said, ``we have a sentinel''--a  sentinel; what a creepy word--``we have a sentinel on our behalf give  them the model legislation so it has that grassroots, from-the-bottom- up type of vibe.'' Big donors love that grassroots, from-the-bottom-up  type of vibe.   There is lots of dark money that fuels this covert op. Heritage  Action says it plans to spend $24 million in eight battleground States  to ``create an echo chamber'' of relentless lobbying for voter  suppression bills. They say they will be coordinating with known Koch  network groups like the Susan B. Anthony List, Tea Party Patriots, and  FreedomWorks.   This operation is the kind of stuff that we might want our  intelligence services to do in enemy countries to create disruption and  discord and provide secret influence. The idea that creepy billionaires  are running covert operations in and against our own country, that  ought to make you cringe.   Not only is this behavior morally corrupt, it may have broken rules.  One State legislature has already floated an ethics probe into Heritage  Action's sentinels jamming phony bills through their chamber.   So back to Senate Republicans getting their hair on fire over Kristen  Clarke and Vanita Gupta. These two women scare the daylights out of  this dark money operation behind Republican voter suppression. Ms.  Clarke knows the Voting Rights Act cold; she won voting rights cases  against voter suppression laws all over the country. Put Jim Crow 2.0  up against a Department of Justice Civil Rights Division led by Kristen  Clarke, and that dark money voter suppression operation has a problem.  So the big dark money donors behind this covert operation will raise  whatever ruckus they can--first, to try to stop Vanita Gupta, which  didn't work, and now to stop Kristen Clarke, which won't work--all in  an effort to protect their dark money scheme to prevent some people  from voting. You have to look behind the smokescreen sometimes to  understand what is going on. It is not pretty, but it is the truth.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, before I begin, let me just say a  word of thanks to my two colleagues from Oklahoma for this moment that  we have had on the Senate floor.   I was privileged to be waiting to give my remarks to hear them speak,  and I thought this was a wonderful moment. We have our challenges  around here, but if we had more moments like this, we would get through  our challenges better. I congratulate and thank both of my colleagues.                              U.S. Supreme Court    Madam President, there is a scheme afoot, a scheme I will be talking  about in weeks ahead--a long-running, rightwing scheme to capture the  Supreme Court.   Special interests are behind the scheme. They control it through dark  money--hundreds of millions of dollars in anonymous hidden spending. We  will dwell in later speeches on how the scheme operates.   This first speech seeks its origins. The scheme is secret, and  because of its secrecy, it is hard to know exactly where the story  should begin.   The one place you could begin is with a corporate lawyer--the  Virginian Lewis Powell. An authorized biography of Lewis Powell by his  fellow Virginian, renowned UVA law professor John Jeffries, reveals  Powell to be a tough and incisive lawyer, willing and able to make  sharp, even harsh, decisions, but a man of courtly and decent matters,  well settled in the White male social and corporate elite of Richmond,  VA. There he developed his legal and business career through the 1950s  and 1960s.   A successful corporate law practice often entailed joining corporate  boards. Richmond was a home to Big Tobacco, and Powell's legal career  led him on to Richmond's tobacco and other corporate boards.   Richmond was Virginia's sibling rival to Charlottesville, which could  boast of Thomas Jefferson's nearby Monticello, his renowned University  of Virginia, and all the cultural and academic vibrancy bubbling around  that great university. Richmond--Richmond was the working sibling,  hosting the State's capitol and its political offices and serving as  its corporate center.   Powell was an ambitious Richmond corporate lawyer, and the turbulence  of the 1960s was broadly distressing to America's corporate elite. The  civil rights movement disrupted Jim Crow across the South, drawing out  and exposing to the Nation the racist violence that had long enforced  the social and legal norm of segregation and upsetting America's all- White corporate suites and boardrooms.   Anti-war protesters derided Dow Chemical Company's manufacture of  napalm and scorned the entire military-industrial complex. Women's  rights protesters challenged all-male corporate management structures.  The environmental movement protested chemical leaks, toxic products,  and the poisons belching from corporate smokestacks. Public health  groups began linking the tobacco industry to deadly illnesses, and lead  paint companies to brain damage in children.   Ralph Nader criticized America's car companies for making automobiles  that were ``Unsafe at Any Speed'' and causing carnage on America's  highways. America's anxious corporate elite saw Congress respond with  new and unwelcome laws and saw courts respond with big and unwelcome  verdicts. Something had to be done.   Powell's prominence in Virginia's civic, legal, social, and corporate  circles had brought him attention in Washington, DC. And a new client  of his, the Washington, DC-based U.S. Chamber of Commerce, asked Powell  for his help. The Chamber commissioned from Powell a secret report, a  strategic plan for reasserting corporate authority over the political  arena.   The secret Powell report, titled ``Attack on American Free Enterprise  System,'' was telling. It was telling, first, for the apocalyptic  certainty of its tone. Powell's opening sentence was: ``No thoughtful  person can question that the American system is under broad attack.''  By that, he meant the American economic system, but that assertion was  footnoted with the parallel assertion that--and I am quoting him  again--``The American political system of democracy under the rule of  law is also under attack.''   This was, Powell asserted, ``quite new in [American history].''   ``Business and the enterprise system are in deep trouble,'' he wrote,  ``and the hour is late.''   The secret Powell report was an alarm.   The report is populated with liberal bogeymen: the bombastic lawyer  William Kunstler; the popular author of ``The Greening of America,''  Charles Reich; the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whom Powell said  there should be, and I am quoting here, ``no hesitation to attack.''   Against them, Powell set establishment defenders like columnist  Stewart Alsop and conservative economist Milton Friedman. Powell  cloaked the concerns of corporate America as concerns of ``individual  freedom,'' a rhetorical framework for corporate political power that  persists to this day.   The battle lines were drawn. Indeed, the language in the Powell  report is the language of battle: ``attack,'' ``frontal assault,''  ``rifle shots,'' ``warfare.'' The recommendations are to end compromise  and appeasement--his words: ``compromise'' and ``appeasement''--to  understand that, as he said, ``the ultimate issue may be survival''-- and he underlined the word ``survival''  [[Page S3414]]  in his report--and to call for ``the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of  American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.''   Well, for this, you had to have a plan, and the Powell plan was to go  big. Here is what he said:   ``Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and  implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of  years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort,  and in the political power available only through united action and  national organizations.''   Powell recommended a propaganda effort staffed with scholars and  speakers, a propaganda effort to which American business should devote  ``10 percent of its total advertising budget,'' including an effort to  review and critique textbooks, especially in economics, political  science, and sociology.   ``National television networks should be monitored in the same way  that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance,'' he said.  Corporate America should aggressively insist on the right to be heard,  on ``equal time,'' and corporate America should be ready to deploy, and  I am quoting him here, ``whatever degree of pressure--publicly and  privately--may be necessary.'' This would be ``a long road,'' Powell  warned, ``and not for the fainthearted.''   In his section entitled ``The Neglected Political Arena,'' Powell  recommended using political influence to stem ``the stampedes by  politicians to support any legislation related to `consumerism' or to  the `environment.' '' And, yes, Powell put the word ``environment'' in  derogatory quote marks in the original.   ``Political power,'' Powell wrote, ``is necessary; . . . [it] must be  assiduously cultivated; and . . . when necessary . . . must be used  aggressively and with determination.'' He concluded that ``it is  essential [to] be far more aggressive than in the past,'' with ``no  hesitation to attack,'' ``not the slightest hesitation to press  vigorously in all political arenas,'' and no ``reluctance to penalize  politically those who oppose'' the corporate effort. In a nutshell, no  holds barred.   And then came the section of the secret report that may have launched  the scheme to capture the court. It is called ``Neglected Opportunity  in the Courts.'' This section focused on what Powell called  ``exploiting judicial action.'' He called it an ``area of vast  opportunity.''   He wrote: ``Under our constitutional system, especially with an  activist-minded Supreme Court''--I will intervene to say, of course, we  have today, as a result of the scheme, the most activist-minded Supreme  Court in American history, but back to his quote--``especially with an  activist-minded Supreme Court, the judiciary may be the most important  instrument for social, economic and political change.''   Powell urged that the Chamber of Commerce become the voice of  American business in the courts, with a ``highly competent staff of  lawyers,'' if ``business is willing to provide the funds.'' He  concludes: ``The opportunity merits the necessary effort.''   The secret report may well have been the single most consequential  piece of writing that Lewis Powell ever did in a long career of  consequential writings. The tone and content of the report actually  explain a lot of decisions in his future career. Yet this secret report  received no attention--not even a passing mention--in Professor  Jeffries' detailed, authoritative, and authorized Powell biography.   The secret chamber report was not disclosed to the U.S. Senate in  Senate confirmation proceedings when, shortly after delivering his  secret report to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Lewis Powell was  nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon.   The secret report was dated August 23, 1971. Two months later, on  October 22, Nixon nominated Powell to the Supreme Court. Lewis Powell  was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on January 7,  1972, less than 6 months after this secret report was delivered to the  chamber.   To be continued.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
