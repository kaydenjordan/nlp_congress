 Mr. Chair, just 2 weeks ago in my district, six lives  and six families were forever changed by gun violence in a 6-day  period. Four people were killed and two were injured in six different  shootings. One person was 28. The other five were 16, 17, and 18. They  were teenagers. My heart goes out to all of those victims' families.   Thoughts and prayers are no longer enough. It is long past time that  our actions speak louder than our words. No matter which State we are  from, with over 40,000 gun violence deaths last year, every State has  been severely impacted by gun violence.   The public health crisis has been politicized and weaponized as a  means to divide us, despite the fact that it is a crisis that should  bind us together, and we must come together.                                time  1330    Background checks are the foundation of commonsense gun policy, and  they are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans. Our  current system fails us in two ways, but the bills we are looking at  this week are designed to address that.   Under current law, firearm sales can proceed regardless if a good  background check comes back within a 3-day period, and it doesn't  capture all the sales. So this puts an incredible burden on law  enforcement and an incredible burden on ATF agents who have to go and  reclaim guns that are sold, despite the owner of the gun not being able  to pass the background check. So for too long those in a position to  act have failed to do so. But that ends now.   I strongly support the commonsense gun legislation in H.R. 8 and H.R.  1112.
