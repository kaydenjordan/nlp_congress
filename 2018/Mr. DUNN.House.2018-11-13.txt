 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be here today for the opportunity to  speak on this bipartisan, commonsense bill to provide much-needed  modernization and updates of the Coastal Barrier Resources System maps.  I thank Chairman Bishop for his work throughout this process, as well  as my colleague on the other side of the aisle, my friend,  Representative Blunt Rochester, for her work on this issue as well.   The Coastal Barrier Resources Act, signed into law in 1982, is meant  to preserve our Nation's barrier islands by barring Federal funds and  financial assistance from being used there, which therefore  disincentivizes development. This bill maintains these protections for  our Nation's barrier islands while simply providing for more precise  digital maps to distinguish the CBRA zones.   For decades, some of my constituents throughout the Second District  of Florida have been burdened by being erroneously included in the CBRA  zones. In some cases, this is due to the width of the pencil marks  outlining the boundaries on the original outdated, hand-drawn maps.  This was unacceptable in 1982, and it is outrageous in 2018.   Now, more than ever, in the wake of one of the most devastating  hurricanes in American history, a lack of access to Federal resources  is particularly debilitating for residents in coastal communities  across the Florida panhandle. This means no flood insurance, no FEMA  assistance, or no SBA loans. Being included in the CBRA zones actually  precludes the use of the funds from the BP oil spill in 2010.   I am grateful that this bill will provide a remedy for some people  who are dealing with these unnecessary burdens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  encourage the Senate to take it up before the end of Congress.
