 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 774 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 774         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5376) to       provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con.       Res. 14. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-18,       modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) two hours of debate equally       divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Budget or their       respective designees and the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 716, agreed to       October 12, 2021), is amended by striking ``November 18,       2021'' each place it appears and inserting (in each instance)       ``December 3, 2021''.                                Point of Order     Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me first begin by suggesting, and I say this  seriously, that the gentleman from Missouri take a chill pill. We ought  to be able to discuss serious matters without getting hysterical and  yelling and screaming all the time. The American people expect us to  debate serious issues seriously.   First of all, let me just say, this is another tactic to try to  derail an effort to help reduce premiums for more than 9 million  Americans, lower prescription drug costs, ensure that seniors never pay  more than $2,000 a year for their drugs under Medicare part D.   This is an effort by my Republican friends to derail a bill that  would lower insulin prices; it offers access to universal and free  preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, which would save American families an  average of $8,600 per year per child. That is what they are fighting  against here.   This effort by my Republican friends is an attempt to derail a bill  that would support the construction of affordable homes, boost our  housing supply, deliver much-needed rental and downpayment assistance  to our constituents; it would enhance and expand home energy and  efficiency tax credits; it would bolster our domestic supply chains;  creates thousands of new good-paying jobs right here in the United  States of America; it would make historic investments in coastal  restoration, forest management, and soil conservation; provides  resources to reduce emissions and support our farmers; it creates a  diverse new workforce for the establishment of the Civilian Climate  Corps, which will conserve our land and improve resilience.   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle were talking about the  cost. They are worried about the cost. Boy, it is nice that they  finally worry about the cost of things. They rammed through a tax cut  bill for the wealthy, for billionaires, for big corporations, and they  never paid for it. It added $2 trillion to our debt. Where were they  then?   But here is the good news, Madam Speaker. This bill is fully paid  for. The Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House has provided  much of the detail. I appreciate the fact that my friends would rather  shout than debate, but the American people expect a debate, expect a  conversation.   When people, by the way, come to the Rules Committee, they get as  much time as they want to be able to speak, and we welcome the  diversity of opinion.   Madam Speaker, we also know that the Build Back Better bill will not  become law without a CBO score. It will not go through the Senate  without a CBO score. That will be coming, and my friends know that.   So the bottom line is, this is a red herring. They are not concerned  about a CBO score. They are not concerned about cost, they never have  been in the past on any of their legislative priorities that benefit  the well-off and the well-connected. The idea that somehow they are  fighting for the middle class or those struggling to get in the middle  class; give me a break. People know the record of my Republican  friends, they know the priorities of the Republican Congress, they know  the priorities of the previous occupant of the White House.   Nobody buys that this is about protecting the middle class because  most of my friends on the other side of the aisle never gave a damn  about the middle class or those struggling to get into the middle  class.   So this is an effort to try to basically derail or stall or obstruct  all the things that I mentioned. Madam Speaker, there is no merit to  what my friends are complaining about here today, but they will  complain, and they have a right to do so. We will grin and bear it. At  the end of the day we will deliver for the American people.   We have two major pieces of legislation that we want to get enacted  into law: one is the Build Back Better initiative, which I just talked  about all the priorities in it; the other is the infrastructure bill  that was bipartisan over in the Senate, and maybe we will see if it is  bipartisan over here, I hope so. It is about investing in our roads and  our bridges and our water and our sewer facilities, and giving America  basically a facelift because we have neglected our infrastructure for  too long.   And here is the difference. When they were in charge, when the  previous occupant of the White House was in charge, we got  infrastructure weeks and infrastructure months and infrastructure press  releases, but no money, no resources to help build one single  infrastructure project. That is going to change with this majority and  this President.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject what my friends are  peddling here today and vote ``yes'' on the question of consideration.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Committee on Rules  reported a rule, House Resolution 774. The rule provides for the  consideration of H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, under a closed  rule. The rule provides 2 hours of debate equally divided among and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Budget and the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Ways and Means. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman Yarmuth and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same day authority through December 3.   Madam Speaker, when Franklin Roosevelt stood before the American  people in Chicago, Illinois, and accepted the Democratic nomination for  President nearly 90 years ago, he promised them a New Deal, one built  on equality  [[Page H6217]]  and fairness. That work is bigger than a single President or a single  era, and it continues to this day.   All these years later, this Congress is working to fulfill that  promise. We will be considering a bill that will transform the lives of  most people in this country for the better.   The Build Back Better Act will help Americans access stronger and  more affordable healthcare, better family care, and will set up a  stronger response to the climate crisis. It will lower prescription  drug costs, capping the cost of insulin at $35. It will establish paid  family and medical leave and provide universal and free pre-K.   Madam Speaker, I have talked to so many of my constituents who are  sick and tired of working hard but falling behind. All they want is a  country and a Congress that looks out for their interest and puts their  needs first. That is what the policies contained in this bill will do.   These are the kind of priorities that make me proud to be a Democrat.  They are the kind of advancements that the American people have been  demanding for decades.   The Build Back Better Act finally turns the page on four decades of  failed trickle-down economics. It invests in the people who built this  country; in our workers, the middle class, and everyone fighting hard  to get there. And at a time when the wealth gap between the richest and  the poorest families in this country has more than doubled, this bill  will stem the rising tide of income inequality by asking those at the  very top to pay what they owe, to pay their fair share. It is bold. It  is consequential. And it will transform the lives of so many Americans.   By expanding the child tax credit, more than 35 million families with  children will see their taxes go down.   Older Americans and those with disabilities will also see expanded  access to home care as part of this bill. People working two or three  jobs to make ends meet--17 million of them--will have hope for a better  future with access to an education that extends beyond high school.   Parents of three- and four-year-old kids can breathe a sigh of relief  as they gain access to universal pre-K, meaning that they can go to  work safe in the knowledge that their kids are learning while they are  earning.   Nine million Americans will save money on their premiums through  changes to the Affordable Care Act, and folks in States that have been  cut out of healthcare--four million of them--will finally get  healthcare because this bill closes the Medicaid coverage gap.   By making the biggest investment ever to combat climate change, the  Build Back Better Act will advance environmental justice and give more  communities a fighting chance to respond to this crisis. There are  resources here to cut pollution, grow small businesses, improve care  for our veterans.   This bill accomplishes all of this while being fully paid for. It  finally demands that the largest corporations and the wealthiest  Americans pay their fair share. And importantly, it keeps the  President's promise not to raise taxes on those making under $400,000,  not even one single penny.   This is a seismic shift after my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle exploded the deficit to give tax cuts to the rich and the well- off.   And let me just say to all those Republicans who have been urging  action on the COVID-caused supply chain issues, you should join us and  support this bill because there are provisions here to bolster our  supply chain and prepare for the next pandemic and future supply chain  issues.   Madam Speaker, I will put the values contained in this bill against  the priorities of my colleagues on the other side any day of the week.   It is about damn time that the wealthy were asked to pay their fair  share. It is about damn time that workers and small businesses get a  tax break. And it is about damn time that we focus on the middle class  for a change.   My Republican friends may stand here today and complain about the  process, but the truth is 13 committees of jurisdiction have spent more  than 165 hours marking up this legislation. They considered more than  850 amendments. And all that was before the Committee on Rules did its  work. Before the Committee on Rules met, not once, but twice, and  talked about this bill--even before it was final.   The committees have done their work. Members in this Congress, in  this House and all across the Capitol have debated this bill over and  over and over again.   The American people are demanding action. Now is the time. Time for  us to make real the promises of the New Deal. Time for us to put our  government back on the side of working people in this country. And time  for us to deliver the agenda that the American people voted for last  November.   Madam Speaker, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle, and  especially staff. I know that this has been a long day and a long week.  We have our differences, but I thank all of my colleagues for their  patience.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Morelle), a member of the  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am not going to spend any time  debating my friend from Oklahoma. We have spent 12 hours in the Rules  Committee debating. But I do want to say that I have genuine admiration  for him as well as for Dr. Burgess, Mrs. Fischbach, and Mr.  Reschenthaler. We have strong disagreements, but I respect their  service to this Congress and to this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), who is the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), who is the distinguished  chairwoman from the Committee on Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished  chairwoman for the Committee on Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, in a moment I will ask to amend the rule  to correct a clerical error in the Rules Committee report. The  amendment reinserts the text of the manager's amendment posted on our  website yesterday which was inadvertently omitted from the copy of the  report filed today. This is purely a clerical fix.                      Amendment Offered by Mr. McGovern     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the  pending resolution with an amendment that I have placed at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Burgess and Ranking  Member Cole for their courtesy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the distinguished chairman on the Judiciary Committee.                                time  2100     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the chairman of the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a November 4 Vox  article titled, ``This May Finally Be the Year Congress Lets Medicare  Negotiate Drug Prices.''                               [Nov. 4, 2021]  Vox: This May Finally Be the Year Congress Lets Medicare Negotiate Drug                                   Prices                              (By Dylan Scott)         Democrats in Congress have managed to revive a prescription       drug reform proposal that would allow the party to finally       deliver on a campaign promise they've been making for 15       years: letting Medicare negotiate drug prices and lowering       drug costs for patients.        The breakthrough was the result of negotiations with a few       moderate members of the Democratic conference who were uneasy       with an earlier version. That version was briefly dropped       from the Build Back Better Act, Democrats' wide-ranging       social spending bill.        Nothing can be considered final until both the House and       the Senate pass the legislation, but the new draft of the       Medicare drug negotiations proposal appears to make some       concessions to centrists who share the drug industry's       concerns about the effect of price controls on medical       innovation.        Still, the new plan would also be a rare loss for the       pharmaceutical industry, which fervently opposes every       version of such a proposal and has lobbied aggressively to       stop it.        Under the revised plan, the maximum price Medicare would       pay would be 75 percent of what commercial US insurers pay on       average for drugs that have been on the market between 9 and       12 years, with the maximum decreasing the longer the drug has       been available. Democrats had originally set a maximum price       of 120 percent of the average of what other wealthy nations       pay for the same drug. The change should lead to drug makers       losing less revenue, the goal of moderates, though no CBO       score is yet available.        Fewer drugs would also be subject to negotiation. Under the       new plan, the government would start by negotiating the cost       of 10 drugs in 2025, before gradually ramping up to 20 after       a few years. Under the original plan, the government would       have negotiated the price of 25 drugs immediately and that       number would have eventually increased to 50.        The plan now also includes a moratorium on negotiations for       drugs that have been on the market for less than 9 years (for       small-molecule drugs) or 12 years (for biologics). Drug       companies would be penalized for price hikes that are higher       than inflation under  [[Page H6223]]       the new proposal, a holdover from prior versions of the plan.        Overall, the new plan would save the government about half       as much money ($250 billion, by the White House's estimates)       as the original plan ($450 billion). That has forced Dems to       cut down their health care spending plans, for example, by       nixing a progressive proposal to add dental and vision       benefits to Medicare. Nevertheless, Democrats can take the       savings from their new drug pricing plan and use it to lower       drug costs for seniors.        The Build Back Better Act would set a hard cap on how much       seniors who enrolled in Medicare's prescription drug benefit       pay for prescription drugs: $2,000 out of pocket annually. It       would also require private Part D plans to cover more of the       cost of expensive drugs, which experts say may motivate those       plans to try to extract lower prices from drug makers on       medications not included in the new government-led       negotiations.        The new proposal also adds a provision that requires all       insurers to cover insulin, so patients pay only $35 a month       of their own money for the medication.        Democrats have finally built sufficient momentum to approve       Medicare negotiations for the first time. They have wanted to       do this since at least 2003, when Medicare Part D was first       created. While the party still has a long way to go on       figuring out what comes next in its health care agenda, this       was one priority they knew they wanted to get done.        And with the moment of truth upon us, it looks like they       will.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With the Build Back Better bill, we are on the verge of finally  allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which will bring down the  cost substantially for consumers.   This has been decades in the making and is overwhelmingly supported  by the American people. There is even a provision that caps insulin  costs in this bill to just $35 a month. This is a big deal for so many  of our constituents.   We are making history here today. This bill will transform people's  lives for the better.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Johnson), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I don't know what my Republican friends find so  offensive about making historic investments in healthcare and family  care and combating climate change. Maybe we just have different values.  Maybe they are just angry that we are investing not in the wealthy as  they did, not in large corporations as they did, but in our workers,  and in the middle-class families all across the Nation.   I am proud that we are finally allowing drug prices to be negotiated,  proud that we are establishing universal free pre-K. I am proud that we  are making the biggest expansion in healthcare coverage in a decade;  proud that we are making the most transformative investments in  caregiving in American history; and I am proud that we are making the  biggest investments to combat climate change ever.   I didn't run for office to help the well connected or just to hold  the title. I came here to actually get something done for workers, for  students, and for the next generation so we are not saddling them with  a planet whose climate is out of control. I ran for office to pass big,  bold, transformative legislation like this.   This is the agenda the American people voted for in November. They  demanded a clean break from the Republicans. They entrusted a  Democratic Congress and a Democratic White House to use their power to  change people's lives for the better. Today, we are delivering.   I know it took a while to get to this point, some ups and downs, and  I know this isn't everybody's idea of a great and wonderful and fun  Friday night, but it is testament to this President, to the Speaker,  and to the Democrats on both sides of the Capitol.   We are on the doorstep of delivering once-in-a-generation legislation  that builds on the New Deal and the promise that President Roosevelt  made over 80 years ago. I urge all of my colleagues to seize this  chance to vote for this rule and the underlying legislation so that the  American people can truly have a fair shot in the 21st century.   The system, as it exists, is still rigged against workers, against  too many families, against too many who are struggling in our country.  Let us change that reality. Let us pass the infrastructure bill, the  BIF bill, and then let us pass the Build Back Better bill and let's  transform this country for the better. I am proud to be here today to  advocate for this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution, as amended.
