 Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator Mike Crapo,  I rise today to honor our friend Dr. Mark Peters. Dr. Peters, who led  the Idaho National Lab INL--for 5 extraordinary years, will be stepping  down from his position as director of the INL to pursue a new role with  Battelle Energy Alliance.   Throughout his long and distinguished tenure at the INL, our national  laboratories, and other highly respected research institutions, Dr.  Peters has earned a reputation as a leading voice in the U.S. nuclear  community. He is highly respected by Congress, the administration,  industry, and stakeholders because of his knowledge and his engaging  and inclusive style. Simply put, Dr. Peters is a giant in the nuclear  industry. He has served as a senior advise to the U.S. Department of  Energy on nuclear energy matters and as a fellow of the American  Nuclear Society, a prestigious recognition for his outstanding  accomplishments in nuclear science and technology.   As INL director, Mark led the State's fifth largest employer and  skillfully managed its team of more than 4,000 scientists, engineers,  and support staff at our country's premiere nuclear, cybersecurity, and  scientific research laboratory. Thanks to his leadership, the Lab is  thriving and its future is bright. It would be difficult to list every  one of Mark's many accomplishments at the Lab, but there are several  key achievements that have propelled the INL to new heights.   Mark played a pivotal role in getting the Nuclear Energy Innovation  Capabilities Act signed into law. He also succeeded in bringing the  National Reactor Innovation Center to Idaho, ensuring that the Lab will  continue to lead the development and deployment of advanced nuclear  reactor designs well into the future.   Furthermore, Dr. Peters was instrumental in growing the mission of  the Lab. Mark invested time and energy into making the INL a world  leader in industrial control systems cybersecurity to match its well- established reputation for nuclear energy. This research arm has helped  ensure the safety and security of our Nation's critical infrastructure  while acting as a boon to eastern Idaho's economy.   Recognizing the inherent opportunity in its expanding cybersecurity  practice, Dr. Peters worked closely with the Sate of Idaho to construct  two new buildings at the Lab's Research and Education Campus. These  world-class centers facilitate cutting-edge research by government and  private industry, while providing Idaho students with opportunities to  develop modeling, simulation, and cybersecurity skills for in-demand  careers in Idaho and beyond.   The Idaho Falls community not only benefited from Mark's leadership,  but that of his wife, Ann Marie Peters. Her tireless efforts to expand  programs and acquire the latest technologies at the College of Eastern  Idaho have provided thousands of students with unprecedented high- quality educational opportunities. Throughout the community, Mark and  Ann Marie are known for their willingness to take time out of their  busy schedules to help young people navigate college and career  opportunities and for their generous support of organizations like the  Idaho Falls Arts Council and United Way.   We wish Mark, Ann Marie, and their family the very best in their new  endeavor. We thank them for their service and dedication to making the  Lab and surrounding communities such a vibrant place to work and call  home. Eastern Idaho is a better place because of the Peters family, and  for that, all of Idaho is deeply grateful.                            ____________________
