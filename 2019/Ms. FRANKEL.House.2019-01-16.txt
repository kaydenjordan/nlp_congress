 Madam Speaker, I stand with millions of Americans who  say it is time to end this irresponsible and cruel Trump shutdown.   In Florida, where our borders are surrounded by water, we rely on men  and women like Coast Guard Petty Officer Seth to keep us safe. Now,  like 800,000 other government workers, our Coast Guard is not getting  paid, and that leaves Officer Seth and his wife, Beth, and their two  sons at home worried about money for food, for diapers, for paying  their mortgage, for getting their gas.   Now, lawmakers, we can debate about what is needed for a secure  border, but innocent people who show up to work every day to serve the  public should not be held hostage by the political whim of a President.                            ____________________
