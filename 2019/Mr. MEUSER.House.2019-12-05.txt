 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mahantongo Valley  Farm owners Larry and Joanne Snyder, who reside in Pennsylvania's Ninth  District and whose farm is located in Schuylkill and Northumberland  Counties.   One of their beautiful Christmas trees was selected by the President  and First Lady to adorn the Blue Room in the White House during this  holiday season.   The Snyder's magnificent 23-foot Douglas fir was personally delivered  last week by the Snyder family to the White House, where they were  greeted by First Lady Melania Trump.   Mahantongo Valley Farms has been in the Snyder family for over 200  years, but this is the first time one of their trees has won the  National Christmas Tree Contest. There are over 13,000 Christmas tree  farms across the country, making this a truly remarkable  accomplishment.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Snyder family for their  contribution to this wonderful Christmas tradition and for making  Pennsylvania and particularly Pennsylvania's Ninth District very proud.                            ____________________
