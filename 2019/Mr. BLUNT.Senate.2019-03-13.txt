 I want to talk a little about the Green New Deal, but I  can't pass up the opportunity to point out that we are now starting 30  hours of debate on the Director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   It is outrageous. Everybody knows it is outrageous. If you start the  clock right now, there will not be an hour of debate--there might not  be 10 minutes of debate--on the Director of the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, but what our friends on the other side have done is ensure  that we can't do any other business during that 30 hours, and, at some  point, once it is too late to do anything else this week, they may even  waive some of that time back.   This has to change. I certainly would like to see Members on the  other side of the aisle work with us to make that change. The bill I  have reported out of the Rules Committee that we have reported out of  our committee to change this is given more verification every single  week, as we try to let the President put a government in place, as we  try to do our job of confirming judges to judicial vacancies. That has  to stop, and I believe it is about to stop. I would like to see some  cooperation from our friends on the other side so we can move forward  in the way the Senate should move forward.                              The Green New Deal    Mr. President, the Senate has also been talking about legislation  called the Green New Deal. A dozen of our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have put this legislation in place. When you sponsor a  piece of legislation, it usually means you are for that piece of  legislation and think it needs to be debated, and it sure does.   This is a huge piece of legislation. Anything called the green  anything would mean you would think it would be mostly about climate  change or environmental things, but actually most of it is about other  things. I want to talk for a few minutes about what it says about  healthcare.   It is estimated that one part of the Green New Deal would cost $36  trillion over the next 10 years. That is about the same amount of money  we would spend for everything else over the next 10 years of the money  we appropriate. It is such a big number; it is hard to imagine how you  would even describe it, but $36 billion would be 100 times what it  would cost to rebuild the entire Interstate Highway System. If you can  imagine the entire Interstate Highway System, and you wanted to build  it all over again--build it again, go in and tear it up, and build it  again--do that 100 times over the next 100 years or however many years  it would take, that is $36 trillion. I might have even said earlier $36  billion, but it is $36 trillion, 100 times what it would cost to build  the entire Interstate Highway System all over again.   It is an absolutely enormous figure, but the government is accepting  an absolutely enormous new obligation, an obligation that, just in  terms of the healthcare part of this bill, would again be more than all  the money we would expect to spend over the next 7 years.   That would take us through fiscal year 2025. Everything we would  spend on Social Security, everything we would spend on Medicare,  everything we would spend on Medicaid, everything we would spend on  defense, on education, on homeland security, on interest on the debt,  and everything else would be less money than we would spend in the  first decade on Medicare for All.   If you look at this legislation, it is pretty obvious that Medicare  for All would, for a lot of reasons, be Medicare for None. One is that  big of a system probably wouldn't serve anybody very well, if at all.  Two is that Medicare would be eliminated. It would just be part of a  big healthcare system. If you are planning on benefiting from Medicare  as we know it today, that will not be there if this bill passed because  everybody would have something that would be theoretically like  Medicare is now, but there wouldn't be Medicare; there wouldn't be  Medicaid; there wouldn't be military TRICARE; there wouldn't be the  Children's Health Insurance Program. None of the things we have now  would exist. They would all become part of this big system of Medicare  for All.   In fact, it actually would eliminate private health insurance. We are  in this debate way beyond the debate of the days of when President  Obama said over and over again, if you like your current healthcare  insurance, you can keep your current healthcare insurance. Nobody even  pretends with Medicare for All that would be the case. In fact, this  legislation specifically says: ``It is unlawful for a private health  insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits  provided under this Act.'' You will have no choice but to look at  Medicare for All.   So when they say Medicare for All, they really mean Medicare for All.  The other forms of healthcare coverage would be gone.   One of our colleagues who is also running for President said: ``Let's  eliminate all of that.'' ``That'' in the question was private health  insurance. ``Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on.''   Well, what moving on would look like would be everybody, again,  thrown into one system. There would be a single-payer, the Federal  Government. There would be a single system. You could call it Medicare  for All or anything else you want to call it, but there would be one  place to go.   We are now spending about $6 trillion over the next 10 years on  Federal healthcare systems. This would go from $6 trillion to $36  trillion.   I could spend a lot of time talking about, how could we afford that?  What would the taxes look like? The point is, it is an outrageous  proposal, particularly for the millions and millions of Americans who  like the insurance they have, who get insurance at work. It has been a  benefit in our country that workers first started getting right after  World War II. It has been a benefit at work that workers have never  paid taxes on. It has been a benefit at work that an awful lot of  people have been well served by.   We need to fill in the gaps. We need to create more options. We need  to do lots of things. This isn't one of them. When people lose their  healthcare options, when people begin to have to stand in line for  healthcare like people do in Canada, they are quickly persuaded that,  whatever turn was made, it was made in the wrong direction.   This would be a turn in the wrong direction. It would be something  the government can't afford and individuals and families will not want.  It would be something that people who have actually depended on  Medicare being there when they qualify for Medicare--and people pay  into it all their working lives, just like they do into Social  Security, except there is no cap, so many people pay a lot more into  that fund than they do the Social Security fund--but it would be gone.  Medicare for All would be Medicare for None.   I think there is a reason sponsors of this bill aren't eager to talk  about a lot of it and don't even want to vote on it. If I had sponsored  it, I might not want to vote on it either.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
