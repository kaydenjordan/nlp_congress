 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  Securing America's Future Act. It is obscene to bring this deeply  flawed bill to the floor when thousands of children have been ripped  from their parents.   Americans across the country are outraged over the Trump  administration's actions to separate families at the border. And  Trump's answer? An executive order that cages families indefinitely and  will be immediately challenged in court.   Unfortunately, this bill before us would do nothing to stop any of  this. Instead, it criminalizes every undocumented man, woman, and child  in this country and subjects them to the same cruel policy being played  out at our border. It is shocking we are even considering this bill.   Let's be on the right side of history. Let's stop tearing families  apart. Let's stop caging people fleeing violence.   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and defeat this repugnant  bill.
