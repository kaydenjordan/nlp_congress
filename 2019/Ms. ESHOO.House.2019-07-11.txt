 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Khanna, for  yielding.   I rise in strong support of amendment 423, and I want to thank all of  the Members who have worked so hard on this.   I am proud to have written legislation in early April of this year,  the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act, which enjoys 79  cosponsors and prohibits the President from using any funding  appropriated by Congress to take military action in or against Iran  without authorization from Congress. This amendment mirrors and  complements that legislation by prohibiting the use of any funding in  this year's NDAA to carry out unauthorized military attacks against  Iran.   It is very important to have this amendment on the floor because the  Trump administration seems determined to provoke military confrontation  with Iran, and the President and his hawkish advisers have publicly  stated that they don't need authorization from Congress to carry out  preemptive attacks.   They are wrong. The U.S. Constitution is clear. Article I, Section 8  gives Congress the sole authority to declare war, allowing the American  people to decide, through their Representatives in Congress, whether  military action is in the best interest of the country.   We carry no grief for Iran, not one of us, but this amendment should  pass.
