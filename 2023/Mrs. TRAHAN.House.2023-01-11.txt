 Madam Speaker, in every State where abortion rights were  on the ballot last year, Americans voted to protect lifesaving  reproductive care.   In Republican strongholds like Kentucky and Montana, voters rejected  attempts to restrict or ban abortion. In Vermont, Michigan, and  California, voters codified abortion rights into their State  constitutions.   After such a resounding defeat for anti-abortion politicians, you  would think that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  have gotten the message.   But rather than listening to voters and bringing forward legislation  to codify the reproductive rights our mothers and grandmothers fought  so hard for, the new Republican majority is catering to demands of  extreme Members in their conference who have called for a national  abortion ban.   The partisan bills on the floor today will do nothing to protect  women. Instead, they will undermine access to  [[Page H168]]  reproductive care that millions of women rely on.   Madam Speaker, the women we represent deserve better. Our daughters  deserve better. I urge my colleagues to oppose these pieces of  legislation.                            ____________________
