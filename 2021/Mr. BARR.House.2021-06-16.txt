 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1187, with all due  respect to my good friends from California and Illinois. We have  enjoyed a robust discussion and debate on this, which I would argue is  a very important topic.   Mr. Speaker, the statutory mission of the Securities and Exchange  Commission is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and  efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. Its mission,  though, is not to reduce carbon emissions. Its mission is not to solve  climate change.   Now, those may be laudable public policy objectives, but they are  best handled by the Congress or other Federal agencies. This is simply  not the job of the SEC.   This bill is, unfortunately, the next episode in the Democrats' saga  to weaponize financial regulation to achieve partisan social and  environmental goals. Congressional Democrats and the Biden  administration know that they cannot pass the Green New Deal and other  extreme far-left policy priorities through a Democrat-majority  Congress, so they are corrupting an independent Federal financial  regulator to do their bidding.   The majority claims that this bill is an effort to improve corporate  governance when, in reality, it is a thinly veiled attempt to open a  back door to achieve their socialist wish list and cut off financing to  legal but politically unfashionable industries that they despise.   The result will be higher energy costs for the American people, a  regressive energy tax on the people in this country who can the least  afford it.   As always, the Democrats think that the government knows best and is  better equipped than the private market to meet demand. They give no  consideration to the impacts of significant cost increases, the bill's  effect on retail investors, or the actual utility of the information  they are requesting and its materiality for informing investment  decisions.   My friend from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) made this point. But the seminal  Supreme Court case that defines the materiality standard was TSC  Industries v. Northway. In that majority opinion, Justice Thurgood  Marshall wrote, and it bears repeating: ``If the standard of  materiality is unnecessarily low, not only may the corporation and its  management be subjected to liability for insignificant omissions or  misstatements, but also management's fear of exposing itself to  substantial liability may cause it simply to bury the shareholders in  an avalanche of trivial information, a result that is hardly conducive  to informed decisionmaking.''   So, this is not about investor protection. This is about weaponizing  Federal securities law to discriminate against law-abiding American  energy companies. This is an effort to pick winners and losers in the  marketplace by the government. It is an effort for central planning of  our economy. It is not about markets. This is about market distortion  by the Federal Government.   In committee, I tried to make a commonsense change to ensure the bill  covers only material information so that investors aren't buried by  that avalanche. The majority rejected my amendment. This shows they are  more interested in naming and shaming companies than providing useful  information to investors.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, my last point is this: the job of the SEC is to protect  investors, but this bill would compromise investor returns by elevating  nonpecuniary factors above and ahead of financial performance.   How do we know this? Because fees of ESG funds are 43 percent higher  than non-ESG funds. And many low-ranked ESG stocks not only  outperformed top-ranked ESG stocks, they outperformed the market  overall.   We must not harm American investors. We must not harm American  retirement savers by subordinating investor returns to promote  nonpecuniary policy objectives like social justice, diversity quotas,  and lower carbon emissions.   Financial regulations should not be a tool for social change.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, once again, the bill we have been considering today is  puzzling for Republicans, as it probably is for a large number of my  Democratic friends as well.   On the one hand, the far left seeks to blame so much of what is bad  in the world on large public companies. But then they turn around and  claim that these same companies will see the light and embrace extreme  leftwing policies if only they disclose more of their activities in  obscure SEC reports. Mind you, these are perfectly legal activities,  too.   But no serious Member of the House can believe the world works like  this. The far left wants to claim they are heroes using the Securities  and Exchange Commission to fight the scourges of our time, from foreign  dictatorships to environmental degradation. But in reality, they are  weaponizing financial regulation, and their support for this bill comes  in the form of empty political rhetoric masquerading as sound corporate  governance. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this bill is about  politicizing securities regulation.   Far from this fantasy land live the majority of House Members who  understand that there are actual urgent problems we can solve only if  we work together to address them.   Perhaps the gravest of these problems is represented by the goals of  the Chinese Communist Party, which is perpetrating the great crime of  our age against the Uighurs and other minorities in China. Beijing is  also working to stamp out the vibrant democratic  [[Page H2844]]  culture in Hong Kong, hoping all the while that Congress will look the  other way.   If we are truly concerned by public companies that may be working  with bad actors--particularly bad actors responsible for China's worst  human rights abuses--then burying their names on the SEC's website will  achieve absolutely nothing. We need to ensure that they are referred to  the Treasury Department so that we can impose sanctions, and that is  what my motion to recommit will do.   Under this MTR, instead of reporting on malign Chinese companies to  the SEC--an agency that has long acknowledged its lack of expertise  and, frankly, its lack of capability and interest in pursuing foreign  policy goals--we will instead make sure that entities in corporate  supply chains are flagged for the Treasury when public companies have  reason to believe they are involved in atrocities in Xinjiang, from  mass surveillance to forced labor and other violations of basic human  rights.   Companies will also be able to sound the alarm on entities complicit  in China's assault on Hong Kong's freedoms, allowing OFAC at the  Treasury to determine whether it can impose new sanctions.   We must cut off offenders from the global economy until China changes  course. We must rely on appeals to their bottom line and not their  conscience. That is the power of U.S. sanctions.   Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the  Committee on Financial Services to consider my amendment to H.R. 1178.  My amendment doesn't pretend we can fight genocide, authoritarianism,  mass detentions, mass surveillance, and other human rights violations  with meaningless rhetoric on corporate transparency, none of which  keeps China's leaders up at night.   There are over 1 million Uighurs detained in China and over 100  facilities covering millions of square feet suspected as sites of  forced labor. It is an insult to Beijing's victims to claim that  disclosure tweaks from the SEC will stop this. Securities regulation  will not stop this.   Mr. Speaker, we can either pass half measures that we know won't work  and then wring our hands later when the problem remains unresolved, or  we can articulate what we want to target and take real action. The  former is beneath the dignity of this House.   Measly disclosures in securities filings, transforming 10-Ks from 100  pages to thousands of pages, that is not going to solve the problem.  The former is beneath the dignity of the House. The latter is embodied  in my amendment: sanctions, OFAC using the power of the U.S. Department  of the Treasury.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
