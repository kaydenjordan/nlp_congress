 Madam Speaker, this is an important time. We have got  people who are demanding that the Senate do what they hypocritically  refused to do here in the House, and that is to have a fair  investigation and have fair hearings.   And, in fact, we know the majority is the majority; they can change  the rules anytime they want to. But they didn't even bother to change  the rules. They just said: Do you know what? Even though the rules say  that the minority can have a minority witness day, we are going to just  ignore that and move on, because time is of the essence.    So we didn't need any evidence to show that our friends were not  being completely genuine with their comments, no, because we heard:  Clear and present danger; urgent; urgency; got to happen now; we can't  wait; we can't follow the rules; we can't hear witnesses here in the  House; we have got to have this impeachment done.   And then they sit on it for over a month. Seriously, that says what  anybody needs to say.   This was never serious to begin with in the respect that there was a  serious charge. There was no serious charge. It is supposed to be about  treason, bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors. All of those are crimes,  including misdemeanors.   Look at the charges: abuse of power, obstruction of Congress. Those  are the two charges that those pushing impeachment are guilty of, not  this President.   Madam Speaker, this is a scam. It is a shame.   The Senate should just go in and have a trial, follow the Clinton  rules, and that is it. Let's get this done. Let's get it over with. A  proper verdict is not guilty, not removed.
