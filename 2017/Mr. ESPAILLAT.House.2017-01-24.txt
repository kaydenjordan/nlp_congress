 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of every  woman's right to make her own informed decisions about her health,  including access to family planning and reproductive health care.   While the rest of the world moves forward, we are turning the tide  clock back to the era of ``Mad Men.'' However, unlike President Trump  and my Republican colleagues, I have heard the voices of hundreds of  thousands of people I marched with last Saturday.   I accept the overwhelming research opposing the outrageous policies  that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress have placed at the  center of their agenda, policies like the global gag rule and H.R. 7,  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. These dangerous and  irresponsible policies are a disgraceful attack on women's rights  domestically and throughout the world.   Let's get this straight, Madam Speaker. What this is about is keeping  low-income women from accessing the health care they so rightfully  deserve.                            ____________________
