 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the House's work  that aims to improve outcomes for children with complex medical  conditions.   As a physician, I have delivered more than 10,000 babies and seen  firsthand many of these complex and complicated conditions, often when  babies are born prematurely.   Today, there are 33 million children dependent upon Medicaid in our  country. Two million of these cases are considered medically complex.  It is imperative that we take a compassionate look at the way in which  this care is being provided to some of our most vulnerable patients.   I am proud of the legislation the House recently passed to address  the way that care is provided for these children. Last week, we passed  the IMPROVE Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. This legislation  included the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act that aims to put  our Nation's sickest kids and their families first by improving their  care.   These children and their families already face many challenges. Thus,  our healthcare system has to work with them by making access to care  more manageable and easier to navigate.   Too often, these children are forced to see multiple doctors,  sometimes requiring them to go across State lines for treatment. This  can be costly, time consuming, and confusing. This bill reduces the  burden on families by no longer making them jump through hoops for  their children's coverage.   The ACE Act also ensures that each child gets the coverage they need  by helping hospitals coordinate across State lines and provides  additional resources to families to help them navigate the healthcare  system. This coordination will likely reduce emergency visits and  inpatient hospitalizations and, ultimately, lower the overall cost of  care for these children, while at the same time provide for better  outcomes.   In Kansas, 41 percent of children with special healthcare needs are  covered by Medicaid. I appreciate the opportunity to make Medicaid a  more caring, comprehensive, and efficient system for each and every  child with a serious, long-term illness.                        Importance of Internet Access     Mr. Speaker, as I have traveled across Kansas, I have  heard how a strong Internet connection can impact communities, boost  local economies, and create jobs.   Access to the Internet allows small businesses to sell their products  across the country and the world. It enables students to access  additional learning tools and gives doctors the ability to treat  patients in the most remote parts of the district.   Far too often, I am reminded of the complications my district has to  get connected. I rise today to highlight the recent steps taken to  advance broadband deployment in rural America.   Last week, the Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted to  provide additional funding to carriers utilizing the Universal Service  Fund high-cost program. The high-cost program helps providers deploy  broadband infrastructure in extremely rural and hard-to-reach places  where the cost to connect is just too high.   I am also excited that the United States Department of Agriculture is  working to expand broadband access to our ag producers.   I was grateful to join Secretary Perdue as he announced details of a  new broadband pilot program last week at the Department of Agriculture.  The program, called ReConnect, targets funding in the forms of grants  and loans to areas currently lacking a reliable Internet connection.   Farmers and ranchers need a broadband connection to monitor their  operations and increase efficiencies on their farms, which ultimately  drives down the cost of doing business.   Connectivity is such a vital part of everyday life, and its  importance continues to grow. People's access should not be affected by  where they choose to live.   I want that thank Secretary Perdue, Chairman Pai, and President Trump  for making broadband deployment a priority.                            ____________________
