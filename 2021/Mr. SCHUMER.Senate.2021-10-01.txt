 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:50 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 8:05 p.m. when called to  order by the President pro tempore.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this resolution concerns a lawsuit filed  in Federal court in the District of Columbia against the Select  Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Warner, that attempts to force  the committee to release to the plaintiff the full report of the  Committee's in-depth study of the CIA's terrorist detention and  interrogation program. Plaintiff claims that he has a common law right,  never before applied to Senate records, to review this committee  document despite the report being classified and despite the committee  having not chosen to release the report publicly and having submitted  it to the Senate confidentially.   It is important to note that the committee has already released the  lengthy executive summary and the findings and conclusions from the  report, after a declassification review; so the public has been  informed of the committee's work and the findings and conclusions of  its study.   Plaintiff's attempt to force the Senate to release to him the full  report not only contravenes the Senate's constitutional prerogative to  decide which documents to keep confidential, but also interferes with  the independence of the Senate in conducting its legislative and  oversight duties. This resolution would authorize the Senate legal  counsel to represent the Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman  Warner in order to seek dismissal of this suit.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a lawsuit filed  in Federal court in the District of Columbia against the Secretary of  the Senate and her office and that seeks to force the Secretary to  provide the plaintiff with a copy of the Senate security manual. That  manual, which is for internal Senate use and is not publicly available,  sets forth the procedures for handling classified national security  information within the Senate. Plaintiff claims that he has a common  law right, never before applied to Senate records, to review this  Senate document despite the security manual being restricted to  internal Senate distribution given the sensitivity of the procedures  for protecting classified information maintained by the Senate.   Plaintiff's suit seeking to compel the production of this Senate  document encroaches upon the Senate's constitutional prerogative to  decide which documents to keep confidential and interferes with the  independence of the Senate in establishing its own internal rules and  guidelines for handling information necessary to carrying out its  legislative and oversight responsibilities. This resolution would  authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent the Secretary and her  office in this case in order to seek dismissal of this suit.
