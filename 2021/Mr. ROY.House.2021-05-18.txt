 Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, nobody in this Chamber believes that there isn't work  to do in the area of ensuring that crimes are not committed against any  American but, in particular, due to their race, their color, their  national origin, or anything about who they are.   Many on this side of the aisle, including the gentlewoman who spoke  before from California, raised concern about the sort of nature of this  legislation and a lot of the concerns that have been raised about its  continued focus on hate crimes in many ways at the expense of our  focusing on crime, crime itself.   In the findings in this piece of legislation, of course, we reference  the terrible tragedy that unfolded in Atlanta,  [[Page H2469]]  Georgia, and much of that was a rush to be included in the form of hate  crimes when the facts being borne out in the investigation among  prosecutors and the investigators in Georgia are indicating that that  was not at all or didn't seem to be the motivation. And I use careful  words like ``seem to be'' because, as a former Federal prosecutor, I  like to wait until you do the investigation before you jump to the  conclusion of what the motive was or what actually went into the crime  at hand.   As in the words of Chief Justice Roberts when he said that it is a  ``sordid business, this divvying us up by race,'' I think we do our  Nation a disservice when we spend every waking moment on this floor  divvying us up by race. Increasingly, that is what we are doing.   This legislation is well-intended, but this legislation, in the eyes  of many in this body, is flawed, in terms of having in it things like  the Health Equity Task Force or designate an officer or employee at DOJ  whose responsibility shall be to facilitate the expedited review of  hate crimes. We have provisions in the legislation to encourage the  collection of data, encourage local law enforcement to collect data on  hate crimes, but to seek to do so specifically to focus on hate crimes.   It is the contention of many of my colleagues that this is, in fact,  a continued focus of division in our country, rather than focusing on  the fact of the crime itself, the murder itself.   We all, of course, thought that the crime in Georgia was awful. But,  again, the crime doesn't seem to have been motivated by race, yet it is  being brought into the context of a hate crime.   Perhaps we should spend some time investigating sex trafficking and  human trafficking in the form of massage parlors and people who are  basically indentured servants or slaves in the form of the sex trade;  the cartels that are along our southern border that are forcing young  girls into the sex trade; the people who were bound in a car in Boerne,  Texas, in suburban San Antonio, being forced into the sex trade en  route to a stash house in Houston, Texas, because they were being run  by the Cartel del Noreste of Los Zetas out of Nuevo Laredo--literally,  just occurring in the district that I represent in Boerne, Texas.   Perhaps we can focus on this kind of criminal activity and what that  actually means for young women and young individuals in our country.                                time  1430    We talk about is it a hate crime when we have seen data of a young  Black male in San Francisco hitting an elderly Asian man on the streets  of San Francisco. We have seen that footage. It's probably a hate  crime, but it is a crime. If that guy was a White guy or a Black guy,  it is a crime. It is a crime going after this elderly man, an American  citizen.   And I think when we think about justice, the reason the blindfold  exists on Lady Justice is we are supposed to have blind justice. We all  acknowledged that we have not had blind justice at many points in the  history of our country, but that blind justice is what we seek when we  seek equal justice under law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman said, as a 34-year-old, the  end product may look okay. This 48-year-old may not be able to make a  similar statement.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia reminds me--and  we have not discussed this--that I first met the gentleman from  Virginia when I was in college at the University of Virginia and he was  the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and I was an instructor for a golf  camp that summer in Charlottesville for his daughter, I believe  Stephanie. Pulling out of my memory banks. And that is where I first  met him. Again, 20--whatever I was--23 or 22 years old, right out of  college.   But he reminds me that one of my college teammates at the University  of Virginia was a gentleman by the name of Lewis Chitengwa. Lewis is  not somebody you all would know, but you do know the name Tiger Woods.  And Tiger  [[Page H2470]]  was asked after his infamous 1997 year when he won the Masters-- obviously breaking down the color barrier at Augusta Masters. He was  asked if he had ever been disappointed in sports. And he said he was  disappointed once when he lost the Orange Bowl, the biggest amateur  tournament down in Miami, where you would expect that to be. And he  lost it to my friend, Lewis Chitengwa.    Lewis is the first Black to win the South African Open. It was a  monumental event, I believe in the early 1990s, when he won that  tournament before he came to the University of Virginia, where he  ultimately graduated. Unfortunately, he passed away 20 years ago this  summer from meningitis.   He had played golf in the Canadian tour in Vancouver and shot, I  think, 68-69 Thursday or Friday, and passed away Saturday morning. Talk  about a pandemic. He passed away from viral meningitis.   I raise Lewis just because Lewis, when he went home, he passed away  that summer, they had to wait about a month to bury him because of the  AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe, where he was from.   Lewis was the recipient of unspeakable hate when we were in college  around the Charlottesville community in the 1990s. And we would often  discuss that and talk about that and about those changing times. But it  was fascinating for me to watch a man like Lewis, who came from  Zimbabwe and experienced a lot of what was apartheid in South Africa  and being the first Black to win the South African Open, to him talking  about the greatness of this country and justice in this country and  what this country has meant as a beacon for people around the world and  justice. And we talked about it at length.   I understand the intent behind this bill, and I just want to say that  I share that intent; and I know in speaking for Mr. Jordan, who had to  relinquish the time to me, that we share that intent. We just have  serious reservations about defining hate crimes and going down the road  of collecting data and the way we are doing it and how that divvies us  up by race.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do think it is important what the majority leader just  said. I mean, first of all, we will never be a perfect union. All we  can do is strive, of course, to achieve the ideals set out in our  founding and throughout our history.   But I do take issue; as the distinguished majority leader knows, I  stood on this floor recognizing my concerns about January 6. But to  suggest that the Senator from Missouri, Senator Hawley, is somehow  giving a thumbs-up to insurrection, as opposed to engaging in speech  and debate about his beliefs and his beliefs under the Constitution; I  think that is wrong.   And I think we are continuing to go down this road of back and forth  on these issues, as opposed to having a deep discussion about what  occurred and what didn't occur. But, importantly, on this issue, you  know, taking the Senator's word that he has some concerns, as I do.   I mean, I have sat here and expressed my solidarity and hope and  desire, again, as a former Federal prosecutor, figuring out how to root  out hate and stop crime. I happen to believe that we should do that  through the lens of being color blind, and attacking our criminal  justice system the way we should to try to root it out, but not to  embed in our code the continued  [[Page H2471]]  divvying us up by race. That is just how I view it.   That is how I view it with a number of friends of mine of all walks  of life, of all political persuasions, of all racial persuasions; and I  think that we should be mindful of that.   And the majority leader, I think, gave it up a little bit in saying  that, you know, this vote will be seen either as A or B, right? It will  be seen as you are either for hate or you are against hate. That is, I  think, one of the fundamental problems we have in this body, is that we  can't engage in a reasonable debate about what we are seeing here and  concerns we might have. And being equally opposed to hate, or equally  opposed, or wanting to go root out crime, but have a differing view  about how we get there; that doesn't mean it is A or B, you are for  hate or you are against hate.   But that is what we do; we drop a $2 trillion, 2,000-page bill on the  floor, and you say, well, you are either with us or against us. Vote  for this bill, it is named fill-in-the-blank. Right? Come up with a  great name, you can't oppose that.   Suddenly then, that is what is put out in the headlines, you know,  Chip Roy votes for hate, right, instead of having an actual, robust  debate here on the floor about how we want to carry the country  forward. I think that is what we ought to have.   I actually enjoy this part of our job. I enjoy having numbers of  Members on the floor engaging back and forth about these issues that  are important, rather than just seeking the headline and running out to  the triangle and giving a press conference, divvying us up further in  our ideologies, or in the name of a certain or particular bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from California earlier made a good  point, and I am going to use my own words to paraphrase what she said  when she said that we can't legislate away hate.   The perspective of many of us is that we don't need new laws, we  don't need more committees, and we don't need more bureaucracy. We need  to give our police the resources they need to do their job. We need to  make sure that we are rooting out crime wherever it may exist between  whatever communities it may exist. We need more emphasis on family,  more emphasis on community, more emphasis on the Lord Almighty, and  less reliance on the Federal Government to make our communities better.   As I said earlier, I can get into the intricacies of the bill, but we  have already gone over it. The concern of many on my side of the aisle  is in this continued sordid business of divvying us up on race and  focusing on race.   We have spent the better part of the last year rightfully concerned,  focused, and outraged on what we saw with respect to Mr. Floyd. But we  have had a continued focus on race over the last year, and I think one  can look at the impact on communities and the impact on Black  communities throughout the United States' cities, businesses that have  been closed down, and crime sprees that have occurred and wonder what  this continued focus on race is doing to better our great Nation.   I would posit that we are a far better country when we follow Lady  Justice with the blindfold and that we seek to achieve that recognizing  our failure to do so in the past but seeking our desire to achieve that  blindfolded justice going forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, right now, we are facing a critical question  for our country. It is a question about whether our country wants to be  first or last.   A lot has been made, obviously, of the former President's agenda,  which he referred to as ``America First.''   I think, unfortunately, we are sitting here right now, and our  country is now too often looking at America last.   There are a number of issues that are facing the constituents that I  represent, but I believe this is true for people all across the  country. I have spoken many times here on this floor about this.   In Texas, our border is under siege. In Texas, it is a very real  impact on our life, our communities. I share that with my colleagues  all across the country, all 50 States represented here.   It is very real in Texas, but it is very real in our country about  the impact of the broken border. It is very real right now with people  who run small businesses and need to hire people and they can't because  we are paying people more not to work than to work.    It is very real when people are going to buy gas at the pump, and it  is well over $3 a gallon.   It is very real when you try to buy a house, and lumber is up 470  percent.   It is very real when you want to go get the healthcare of your choice  and you can't.   It is very real when you turn on the TV, and you watch what was  Middle East peace now turning into chaos as our friends in Israel are  being attacked.   There are consequences to our choices in elections. There are  consequences to the leadership you have in your country. There are  consequences to the decisions we make.   I would think that all Americans, regardless of which side of the  aisle you fall, whether you are in Congress or you are back home  watching, you want America to be first. You want America to succeed.  You want America to do well. You want our allies to succeed.   As you see, I am putting a comparison here of what the world looks  like with America first and what the world looks like with America  last.   Admittedly, we had the intermittent reality of dealing with the  pandemic. But just over a year ago, we were dealing with record low  unemployment, record levels of employment for minority communities in  our country, a booming economy, with strong economic growth. America  was leading and moving the world forward.   Today, we have jobs that are vacant, not being filled. Small  businesses coming up to me, saying: ``Our whole livelihoods are getting  destroyed; we are going to lose everything we have built, because we  can't hire anybody.''   I go to restaurants and I see ``help wanted'' signs. They are  struggling to have anybody there to serve. People are going back. It is  not the virus. People are going back. They just can't get service.  Every businessperson I talk to in the State of Texas faces the same  dilemma, the same problem: They can't hire anybody.                                time  1915    Now why might that be? Could it be that in the infinite wisdom of  this body that we have spent $6 trillion over the last year--$6  trillion over the last year--and that, as part of doing that, we have  funded unemployment at levels that is making it more attractive for  Americans to choose not to work than to work. Americans are logical  human beings. When presented with that choice, they are going to make  that choice. Some aren't, but many do.   And now, you are owning a restaurant and you are trying to have wait  staff or people to bus tables or cooks, and you can't hire them. You  are trying to run a landscaping company, you can't hire them. You are  trying to run a cleaning business, you can't hire them.   This is real, and it is happening right now in real time. The result,  an economy stagnating. We are not taking off with growth. Now we have  got inflationary pressures because we just spent $6 trillion. You run  the risk of stagflation, low economic growth, higher cost of goods, all  while we are now dealing with the uncertainty of a world in chaos.   A year ago, small businesses were thriving. Now, small businesses are  getting crushed. A year ago, not too long ago, gas was $1.77 a gallon.  Now we are looking at gas over $3 per gallon. As I said, lumber prices  are up 478 percent; copper is up, I think, 50 to 70 percent.   My parents right now are trying to go through building a house, and  they are not sure if the dollars they have got set aside to do it are  going to work, because all of these prices are going up, up, up at  extraordinary rates.   There is a cost to bad leadership and bad decision-making. Our border  was well on its way to becoming secure. In April last year, we had  20,000 apprehensions. How many apprehensions did we  [[Page H2526]]  have this year in April? 178,000. We have had over 530-something  thousand apprehensions from January 1 through the end of April. We have  had almost 600,000 apprehensions to date, based on the information I  have through mid-May. My sources at the border tell me that we have had  300,000 individuals who have gotten away or who have been released.   I went down to the border, one of the many trips I have taken to the  border because the district I represent is about 150 miles away. I went  down at night, and I met with about 50 different migrants who had just  come across the Rio Grande. This was a group that I just met with, and  they are driving back down the road. I actually followed them in my  truck with the headlights on, so they weren't just walking in the  middle of the darkness to go get over to where the processing center  is.   America first looks like this. Significant amounts of immigration.  Legal immigration hasn't dipped below a million per year in some 20  years. America's doors are open, you-all. The idea that people want to  say ``Close our doors,'' that is not the case. But you want to have  operational control of your border.   I am going to talk about Israel in a minute. Israel put fences in  place because they wanted to control their borders. You know what? They  worked. Of course they worked.   We have fences in place in southern California. Illegal immigration  in the 1990s, which was astronomical, over half a million, dropped to  40- or 50,000. Why? Fences work. In Brownsville-McAllen, there is  fences and there is infrastructure around Brownsville. There isn't in  McAllen. Guess where the traffic goes? McAllen.   This is not rocket science. When you are putting America first, you  put in infrastructure. Border Patrol wants it, they have asked for it.  It works. Yes, some people go around, yes, some people try to go over,  but if you have ever spent a minute at our southern border--side note I  would offer to the Vice President of the United States, that should she  actually wish to do her job in supposedly running this whole border  security task force, come on down to Texas. So far she hasn't. In the 2  months that she has been allegedly in charge, our Madam Vice President  could come see that instead of security, we have utter chaos.   Here is the thing. These are human beings. These are not political  pawns. These are human beings, seeking a better life. I don't begrudge  any one of these immigrants who are seeking to come to our country. God  bless them. I would try to help any one of them that were coming across  to figure out where they needed to go. They are human beings, all of  God's creatures, but they shouldn't be endangered because we are  sending up false signals that it is a good idea for people like the 7- year-old girl that I talked to on the border who was all by herself  coming from Guatemala to America. She didn't have a parent, didn't have  an uncle, didn't have an aunt, didn't have a brother, didn't have a  sister. She was by herself. The young man who was right next to her, I  said, ``Where did you meet this young girl?'' He said, ``Midway through  Mexico.'' She was 7, you-all, 7.   Depending on which nonprofit, nonpartisan groups you listen to, we  know that upwards of 20 to 30 percent of women that are on this journey  get abused. We know the cartels are making massive amounts of money  moving human beings for profit.   We know that fentanyl, the most dangerous narcotic that is currently  out there, or one of the most, we have now had more in 2021 in this  calendar year in 4\1/2\ months than in all of 2020. Fentanyl. Our kids  are dying. There is an opioid epidemic.   What does this administration do? Hey, I have got a good idea, let's  have processing centers in McAllen, let's have all of the Border Patrol  go down to McAllen and have to run processing centers instead of  actually policing our borders between the ports of entry and trying to  stop the flow of fentanyl and dangerous narcotics into our country.   There is a consequence to not doing your job. This administration is  not doing its job. This administration, worse than not doing its job,  it is purposely harming our country in the false name of compassion.  Instead of having secure borders, instead of allowing people to come to  our country legally, safely, we endanger immigrants and say that that  is somehow being compassionate.    How is that compassionate? How is it compassionate when the Gulf  Cartel, the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel is making millions of  dollars moving human beings for profit? How is it compassionate when  the Cartel del Noreste of Los Zetas in Nuevo Laredo is making millions  of dollars moving human beings for profit?   When the district attorney in Kendall County, Nicole Bishop, a county  I represent, and I visited, and she talked about the nine illegal  immigrants found in an automobile being driven by an American citizen  employee of that Cartel del Noreste. It had nine illegal immigrants in  there, two tied up in the trunk, and they were being taken to a stash  house in Houston, Texas, to be put into the human trafficking and sex  trafficking trade.   America first is about jobs, economic growth, a strong border,  standing with our friends in Israel, affordable commodities like gas.  America last is a wide open border in which Americans are endangered,  ranches are overrun, cartels are empowered, immigrants are abused,  prices go up, commodity prices go up, businesses can't hire people, and  we abandon Israel.   America first versus America last. I have got more to say about this,  which will surprise no one. But my friend from Pennsylvania is here,  and I would certainly love to turn the floor over to my good friend  from Pennsylvania should he wish to opine.    Is the gentleman aware that the Vice President was tapped by  the President to take charge of this crisis?    To your knowledge, has the Vice President visited the  southern border of the United States in the now almost 2 months that  she has been allegedly in charge?    When you think about the various things it is impacting--you  represent constituents in Pennsylvania, and I in Texas--you talked  about the reach of illegal immigration, narcotics, cartels, and gangs  into Pennsylvania.    Does the gentleman agree, when we had the previous administration  putting America first, does the gentleman agree that our economic  situation and job situation and price of goods and services situation  was far better and that small businesses were thriving versus today  when small businesses can't hire anybody?   Does the gentleman agree that commodities--gasoline, wood, housing  supplies--were cheaper and more affordable, and today they are now  skyrocketing through the roof after $6 trillion of spending?   Does the gentleman agree that the border was becoming secure under an  America First agenda, and now it is wide open and being abused?   Does the gentleman agree that we had historic Middle East peace with  our friends in Israel, and making our country safer, by the way, in the  process in holding the line against Iran and our enemies, and now we  have got Israel under attack and an administration saddling up with our  stated enemy, Iran?   Does the gentleman agree that all of these are stark contrasts?    I will be mindful of your time whenever you have to go on,  but would you agree that if you go back and say, all right, let's go  look at how the America First agenda was performing a couple of years  ago, that the unemployment rate in April 2018 was 3.6 percent, that  today the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, that the poverty rate in  2019 was 10\1/2\ percent, that the poverty rate today is 13.7 percent  projected, that the Consumer Price Index in April 2019 was 2 percent,  that today the Consumer Price Index is at 4.2 percent and skyrocketing.   If you compare where we were with respect to energy a couple of years  ago--and I know that my friend has a heart for energy; obviously, it is  very important to his State as it is to mine in Texas--that under the  Trump administration for the first time in nearly 70 years, the United  States became a net energy exporter, right?    Making us freer, stronger, with more abundant, more  affordable energy, we became the number one producer of oil and natural  gas in the world, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.   Natural gas production reached a record high of 34.9 quads in 2019  following record production in 2018 and 2017. The average American  family saved $2,500 a year in lower electric bills.   Now, what do we have? A shutdown Keystone pipeline, and an  administration saying we can't frack in Western lands.   We rejoined the Paris climate agreement to have the United States  foot the bill, billions to the United Nations climate fund.   We have suspended the leases on Federal lands. As I said, a complete  Federal land ban would increase foreign dependence by 2 million barrels  a day. Gas prices are at a 7-year high. I could go on and on.   Does the gentleman agree that there are consequences to an agenda  like the previous administration's that puts the country first versus  an administration that is perfectly fine putting the country last in  order to go achieve some sort of, I don't know, fealty to the European  social welfare state and make yourself seem, I don't know, welcomed in  Davos?    Yes, a piece of plywood.    I was just explaining, before the gentleman arrived, that my  parents are in the midst of building a house. They are beginning to  wonder now whether or not they are going to be able to afford it by the  end of the build because of the price of lumber, because of the price  of concrete that is going up, because you have to have forms for the  concrete and you have to have labor.   Now, we are having a shortage of labor because we are paying people  more to not work than to work, in the infinite wisdom of my colleagues  on the other side of aisle who believe you can throw $6 trillion into  the economy and not have consequences.   Is the gentleman aware that it only took us $4.1 trillion in today's  dollars to win all of World War II from beginning to end? Yet, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle felt like it would be a good  idea to dump $6 trillion into the economy and believe that it wouldn't  have the consequence of inflation, that it wouldn't have the  consequence of paying people more not to work than to work, and destroy  jobs, destroy livelihoods, destroy small businesses.    Now, we see the America First energy policy under the previous  administration where we had abundant oil, abundant energy, and now an  America last where you have lines. I mean, who is President? Is it  Jimmy Carter or Joe Biden?    I saw a photograph today that had a person who was driving a  Tesla. And God bless Tesla for making technology. I am all for it. But  the person in their virtue-signaling, self-congratulation of driving  their Tesla is driving around with a license plate that says: ``NO  FUEL,'' right? Does somebody want to go, ``Wait. Hold on,'' knock on  the door and say: ``Excuse me, where do you think the power is coming  from?'' Is it magic power? ``Well, we just get power from  electricity,'' as if the electricity comes from nothing, as if the  Tesla is just magically powered and suddenly just drives around without  having abundant availability of energy.   Is the gentleman aware and would he agree with me that China has  about 70 percent of the world's rare-earth reserves, and that when we  are going down the road of solar panels and other alternative forms of  energy--and, again, Texas embraced wind power; Texas embraced solar  power. We can have these as part of our grid, but then what happens on  a windless, cloudy day? You have China being empowered.   One more question for the gentleman: Is the gentleman aware that we  just saw a report that China is producing more of the emissions and  CO2 than the rest of the world combined? My colleagues on  the other side of the aisle want us to join the Paris Agreement, which  we were outperforming without being a part of it. They want us to bow  down to the altar of the Chinese and say: ``Oh, please let us be a part  of this whole exercise,'' while China is pumping out more actual  pollutants and more CO2 than anybody else in the world.    Is the gentleman aware that human life expectancy, if you  track it on a chart, is almost directly correlated to the availability  of abundant energy and that we have seen the lifesaving advances that  cause human flourishing, the ability to save people's lives, the  advancement of modern technology for medicine, to be able to spread  that around the world?   There are still 3 billion people in the world right now who are not  living with abundant energy, and what do we want to do as the greatest  country in the history of the world? We want to slam the brakes on this  great economy with this magic unicorn dust of a view toward how we are  going to have our energy policy while we throttle us back, empower  China, allow China to be able to continue to pollute what they want to  in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, human beings suffer.    I heard the gentleman, who I should thank for his military  service, his long career in serving in our Armed Forces. I appreciate  your service. I know the gentleman is concerned a lot about national  security, as well.   With respect to pipelines, you alluded to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  I believe today we learned that the administration was backing away  from sanctions,  [[Page H2529]]  which is perfectly fine, having the Nord Stream 2 pipeline funneling  all sorts of fossil fuels to Germany, but forsaking our friends in  Ukraine, by the way, in doing so.   You get a twofer out of this administration: undermine our national  security while harming our friends in Ukraine who are trying to push  back against Putin. But, oh, by the way, you are advancing a pipeline  over there while you refuse to have pipelines in the United States of  America.    I know the gentleman probably has things he needs to do, but  before he leaves, I wanted to address one other issue on national  security because I know he has a passion for this, as well.   We have talked about the impact on our economy of America First  versus America last. We talked about the impact on the border of  America First versus America last. We talked about the impact on energy  and availability of energy of America First versus America last.   Now, let's talk a little bit about the impact on the stability in the  world on Middle East peace, on our national security and the national  security of our friends and allies, and, in particular, our friends in  Israel.   I know the gentleman, like I, has traveled to Israel. I have been  there a couple of times. I am sure the gentleman has been there a few  times. In my experience in Israel, it is an extraordinary place with  extraordinary people with a pluralistic culture, a multifaith culture.  But it is a burgeoning democracy, a strong economy, and it is probably  our strongest ally in the world--if not in the world, certainly in the  Middle East. The previous administration was doing what for decades  previous administrations had said was impossible and was striking  historic peace deals with Arab nations, working and interacting with  Israel, with direct flights from Arab nations to Israel occurring. The  Abraham Accords, we had significant peace in the Middle East, yet what  do we have today? In a few short months under the wisdom of the current  administration, we have massive attacks on our friends in Israel.                                time  1945    We have massive loss of life. And God bless the previous  relationships with our country and Israel to produce the technology  that Iron Dome offers to the people of Israel so that they are not  getting slaughtered by the rockets that are coming from Hamas, being  supported, by the way, by the policies of this administration, in  empowering Hamas to be taking shots at our friends in Israel, where our  friends in Israel are under attack.   Thank the good Lord above that we have Iron Dome and the ability to  protect our friends in Israel and work with them so that we also have  strong missile defense technology.   Would the gentleman agree that that is the current state of affairs?    I saw the same stories that my friend from Pennsylvania saw  about some of our democratic colleagues, I think here in the House and  in the Senate, who were starting to say that we needed to back off of  that and not provide the hellfire missiles or any of the resources that  we worked in collaboration with our friends in Israel in order to make  sure they are protected, and particularly in the use of the Iron Dome.  Literally protecting millions of people, by the way.   There is 150,000 rockets sitting in Lebanon, sitting and pointing  right at northern Israel. By the way, the populated area in that  northern part of Israel is about the size of a portion of the district  I represent in that stretch between San Antonio and Austin.   I took a helicopter tour going up to Jordan, up the north side of  Israel, back down to Tel Aviv and back down to Jerusalem in a few  hours.   Can you imagine? That is the size of Israel.   And they have 150,000 rockets in Lebanon pointing from the north, and  they have got Gaza over here firing all these missiles coming in from  Gaza. Hamas launching them in at Israel, and they are actually  benefiting from the technology we are providing. And now you have got  Democrats saying they want to pull that away.   Now, the good news is I also saw a story today with a couple of them  starting to walk that back, because hopefully they are starting to feel  the pressure the American people want us to stand with Israel. The  American people want us to stand with our allies who stand with us, and  that is what Israel has done.   And I would tell the gentleman, I am sure he has experienced what I  experienced when I was at the Sea of Galilee. And I was on the floor  the other night with Brian Mast, your fellow veteran, who lost his legs  in service to our country. He also served 2 years in the Israel Defense  Forces. Well, Brian and I were both sharing the story about when we  were sitting on a pier in the Sea of Galilee, and the Israelis, who  were on that pier, stood up and looked at us and they all sang ``God  Bless America.'' And they all stood up and thanked us one by one for  what we do in defense of Israel and our partnership with them.   And this administration is walking away from that. This  administration is hugging Iran. This administration wants to cut deals  with Iran, provide resources to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which  undermines Israel and undermines our national security. And the  American people, when they know this, they don't want it.    It has been great.    You know something about that?    Is the gentleman aware that a few of our colleagues actually  were lamenting that Iron Dome was preventing casualties in Israel  because, for some reason, that might be seen as disproportionate with  respect to whatever damage and casualties might be occurring in Gaza?   And it seemed to me that the simple answer--I mean, just color me  crazy here, my friend from Pennsylvania--might be stop firing rockets  from Gaza, stop firing rockets at Israel.   Would the gentleman also agree that our friends in Israel, the  Israelis, call ahead, give them notice, tell them the missiles are  coming in?   They say, ``vacate the block because in 15 minutes that building is  going to be gone.''   And then we heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  lamenting that somehow AP or Al Jazeera were in a building that was  taken out.   Yet there is ample evidence that they knew full well that Hamas was  operating in that building. They knew it, yet they were doing it anyway  and they didn't care.    Does the gentleman agree that Israel not only has a right to  defend itself--and I was thankful to hear the President at least utter  those words, that they have a right to defend themselves.   Does he not agree with me that they have a duty, a responsibility to  defend themselves in the same way that we would if 1,500--well,  actually, up to 3,300 rockets have been launched by Hamas in the last 8  days.   Can you imagine what the American people will be saying and doing if  I was sitting in San Antonio or Austin and 3,300 rockets were coming at  us from Nuevo Laredo, from across the border in Mexico?   Would we just be sitting back and saying, well, I mean, I wonder what  kind of proportionate response should look like?   Or would you just be responding back with overwhelming force to say  under no circumstances do you shoot one rocket into our country, much  less 3,300?    The gentleman is welcome to stay as long as he wants, but I  think he has other places to go. But I would just say that I appreciate  the gentleman joining me.   I know he agrees with me that an ``America first'' agenda that is  pro-jobs, pro-affordable prices, pro-border security, pro-Israel, pro- national security, pro-abundant energy is much better than an ``America  last'' agenda in which we abandon our own allies, abandon our own  national security, have wide open borders, have skyrocketing prices,  inflation going through the roof, and joblessness because people can't  find jobs, because people are getting paid more not to work than to  work.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, I would close a little bit here out on Israel by  saying just a few things I didn't get into in terms of the details,  because these matters. These details matter.   I said before, in the last 8 days, Hamas has launched more than 3,300  rockets at our friends in Israel. Think about that. We have had 10  people in Israel been killed--both Jews and Arabs.   I read a story of a young Indian woman, who was visiting Israel, who  also lost her life.   Iron Dome has intercepted 90 percent of the rockets. Hamas is trying  to overwhelm the defense system and destroy Israel.   Madam Speaker, 70 percent of Israel civilians have run into a bomb  shelter this week. Parents and children were being woken up in the  middle the night by sirens alerting them that they have 90 seconds to  get inside a bomb shelter.   We had Esther Schlesinger huddled with her 1-year-old son on Tuesday.  When speaking about the event, Esther said: I didn't have time to grab  anything. I didn't have time to grab my phone. We just ran into the  shelter and kept hearing explosion after explosion. I feel terrible for  these parents who have to try and explain what is going on. I literally  was holding my son in the bomb shelter, and I am thinking I am grateful  he isn't old enough to understand why I had to quickly grab him.  Despite all this, I don't doubt my decision to live here. Even in these  crazy times. It is so important for me to be here as a Jew.   Madam Speaker, we are seeing the result of a failed policy of this  administration. When you think about it, President Trump called Prime  Minister Netanyahu 2 days after his inauguration. The current President  took over a month to call the Prime Minister of Israel--arguably, our  closest ally in the world, certainly our closest ally in the Middle  East.    When asked, President Biden's secretary couldn't even say whether  Israel remains, ``important ally of the United States.''   The Biden administration has emboldened Iran, the number one state  sponsor of terrorism, dedicated to the destruction of Israel in the  United States, by restarting negotiations on the failed 2015 Iran  nuclear deal. They rewarded the PA by restoring millions of dollars in  funding to the West Bank in Gaza; undermined Israel and international  organizations by restoring $150 million in funding to the UNRWA and  rejoining the Israel-hating United Nations Human Rights Council without  much-needed reforms.   It is one hit after another, one punch to the gut after another to  our friends in Israel, while we are funding Hamas and their ability to  fire rockets at our friends in Israel. This is a pattern.   I will just tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, to ask  yourself a question for the American people who are watching all of  this: Do you want America to be first? Or do you want America to be  last?   Because the current administration, the current policies of this  body, the current policies of the Senate are taking us down a road  which we had long since left behind in the days of the Carter era, in  the late 1970s, when you had long lines at the gas pump, skyrocketing  gas prices, inability to get jobs, stagflation, inflationary pressures.   Most people today don't really remember. I remember when my parents  [[Page H2531]]  got their mortgage rate down from 14 percent, 12 percent, 10 percent-- man, when they got to single digits. Today, those rates have been  hovering around 3 percent.   People don't understand what they are facing, and they are going to  see it soon, as they are seeing these prices skyrocket and they can't  afford houses and they can't afford gas and they can't afford basic  commodities and goods and services, and they can't hire people, and  their small businesses are going out of business because of the  policies of this administration.   America first. People have jobs, businesses thrive, gas is  affordable, housing is affordable, our border is becoming secure. A  border, by the way, that still allowed people to legally migrate to our  country, but to do so in a much safer way; without empowering cartels  to be able to move human beings for profit, put them into the sex  trafficking trade, the human trafficking trade, make millions of  dollars in the process.   America first is putting our friends in Israel first and standing  alongside them for their interest, yes, but also for our national  security interest.                                time  2000    One or two more thoughts on the border because it has hit so close to  home in the State of Texas, which I represent.   Now, I have taken multiple trips to the border, and I have spoken  about it many times on this floor and elsewhere. But it is not just  some esoteric concept that doesn't impact our whole country, but it  certainly impacts Texas very directly.   I said we had 178,000 migrants apprehended in April, we are now over  600,000 for the calendar year, 300,000 that have been released or got- aways that have gotten into our country. Those are real numbers, they  are published numbers. Some of them are--the got-away numbers are  numbers you get when you talk to people who know what is going on who  work in DHS or work down at the border.   April's CBP's numbers show more fentanyl seized in the first 5 months  in 2021 than in all of 2020. Fentanyl is a dangerous narcotic. Do we  not care? I mean, it is a legitimate question. Do my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, do they literally not care? I have never once  heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle address this  issue, not once.   I put something out on social media the other day telling the Vice  President that I would be happy to meet her anywhere, anytime, to  debate the issue of border security. She is allegedly in charge of it.  Well, Madam Vice President, I am here on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives, Article I in the Constitution; you are now  serving in Article II as the Vice President, with a foot over in the  Article I Senate as President. I am happy to debate anytime, anywhere,  the status of the border of the United States, and how it is  endangering American citizens, endangering ranchers, endangering border  patrol, endangering law enforcement officers, endangering Texans,  allowing fentanyl and dangerous narcotics to flow into our communities,  empowering the sex trafficking trade and the human trafficking trade,  and empowering cartels to be able to carry out their heinous  activities.   They just uncovered a burial pit just across the Rio Grande, where  these dangerous cartels bury people that they murder. Stories of people  being locked into bars, chained doors, and the building lit on fire,  people being hung from bridges, people being burned alive. This is all  happening literally across the Rio Grande, and we are empowering it. We  are empowering it with an America-last agenda where cartels are  empowered, our borders are run by cartels, human beings are mistreated  in the name of compassion.   The American people are tired of all of the swamp drama. That is all  we get here is swamp trauma, every single day. We have more  conversations about splitting us up by race. We have more conversations  about January 6 commissions. We have more conversations about masks or  not masks. Meanwhile, the American people are hurting.   The American people can't hire people. The American people are  dealing with wide open borders. The America people can't afford goods  and services. The American people can't have their kids in schools  without worrying about what is happening to their kids. All of the  videos we are now seeing pop up with children testifying at school  board hearings, saying, I have been spending a year wearing a mask, and  I have been being yelled at, and I have been beat up because I am being  told, you know, I got to wear a mask, and shut my ability to see  people. I want to see people's faces. What are we doing to our  children? We are decimating a generation of Americans.   The American people are tired of this. We spent $6 trillion in the  last year, you can't really make it up. What are we doing? I mean, with  all due respect to the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, and the majority  leader, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, What are we  doing? We are destroying the American economy. We are killing small  businesses. We are destroying our own dollar, our own economy. We are  driving up the prices of goods and services. We are preventing people  from being able to hire people. We are scaring the heck out of our  children. We are allowing our schools to shut them down and not teach  them. We are siding with our enemies in Iran instead of our friends in  Israel. We are allowing wide open borders to endanger our people with  fentanyl. We are empowering cartels.   How on Earth is the people's House allowing this to happen to the  United States of America? The American people have had it. The American  people want sanity, they don't want us talking about tweets and talking  about all the drama in this town and what positions people have or  don't have. They just want us to lead. They just want us to come into  this body and not be here, like I am right now, by myself, with all due  respect to the Madam Speaker, but by myself addressing an empty  Chamber.   This is what debate has been reduced to, and I have talked about that  before, but I will keep talking about it. This is what debate has been  reduced to. I chastised the majority leader earlier today because we  were talking about a bill that was labeled a hate crimes prevention  bill that came over from the Senate, and the majority leader said:  Well, if you are for this bill, you are against hate; if you are  against this bill, you are for hate. And that is how that is going to  be seen.   And I told the majority leader, I said, that is the problem. I mean,  do you really believe that is true? That if I have a different view  about how divvying us up by race is a bad idea and how categorizing us  in categories of race, and then creating thought crimes, and having  government going around and policing our thoughts and go tracking us  down, based on what we say or do, as opposed to: Hey, you committed a  crime. But if I vote against the bill, oh, I am for hate. That is what  we have reduced this body to.   And, again, I get it, these are political slogans to my left and  right, right? There is a purpose to this. There is a purpose to me  putting this up, and saying, American first versus America last. Okay.  I would love it if we could sit here in this Chamber, and say, you know  what, maybe spending $6 trillion is a bad idea.   Why don't we rewind some of those dollars and see if we can tone down  that inflation? Why don't we tighten our belt a little bit. Why don't  we get the dollars flowing in for unemployment that is crippling the  ability of businesses to hire people? Why don't we pull that back a  little bit? Why don't we just sit down at a table, roll our sleeves up,  and figure out how to make it work?    Why don't we say, Hey, wide open borders being run by cartels is a  bad idea. Let's figure out how to secure the borders. We are a  sovereign Nation, that is not a crazy thought. Why don't we say, Hey,  what are we getting out of our relationship with Israel and peace in  the Middle East, and standing side by side, and the strength that that  makes for our country and for them.   Madam Speaker, I am nearing the end of my time, and I have a  colleague over here that I believe is going to have a few thoughts to  share, and so I will wind down here in the next couple of minutes. I  will alert my friend.   But I would just say, you know--first of all, let me just say, I  appreciate the staff who are down here and keep this place running, and  you have to sit  [[Page H2532]]  here, and the stenographer is writing everything down that we are  saying and, you know, the clerks that keep everything going. You are  here because we are here, and I appreciate it. As a former staffer  myself, we very much appreciate you all being here.   It is an honor to serve in this body, but it is an honor because of  what we need to achieve, not what we are doing. It is an honor to serve  in the House of Representatives because of where this country can go,  where it needs to go on behalf of its citizenry, not because of what we  are doing today. Because what we are doing today is undermining the  health of this Republic.   I will just close by saying that one of the things that I have been  talking to my constituents about when I go home is asking the very  simple question: Are we free? Are we actually free? Are we free if we  have $30 trillion of debt and we are undermining our economy? Are we  free if people can't hire people in their small businesses in order to  survive?   Are we free if we have open borders that are being run by cartels?  Are we free if we are not standing with our allies, but instead, we are  standing with some of our enemies? Are we free if China controls much  of our supply chains? Are we free if the unborn never get a shot at  life? Are we free if our children are being taught that America is evil  in the schools?   I would argue that we are not as free as we ought to be. We are not  as free as we need to be. And that we are not as free as is necessary  to ensure that our kids and grandkids can inherit this great birthright  of being an American citizen. I believe we should put America first. I  do not believe that we should have America in last place.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
