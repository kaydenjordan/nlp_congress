 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding me time.   On the morning of Saturday, October 7, Hamas launched the most brutal  and expansive surprise attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War 50  years ago.                                time  1630    The world stood in shock as reports and images began to surface of  civilians murdered, young children beheaded, and Holocaust survivors  being dragged into Gaza as hostages. Like many of my colleagues in this  Chamber, I spent the past weeks engaging with the Jewish community  leaders in my district, reassuring them of their communities' safety  and speaking with constituents who had to flee back to the United  States.   I stand here in support of this overwhelming bipartisan resolution,  which has almost every single Member of the House of Representatives as  a cosponsor.   As the House of Representatives, we support Israel's right to self- defense and survival. We stand against Hamas, against its terror, and  against its masters in Tehran. We stand with Israel in its fight for  survival and against anti-Semitism in all of its forms.
