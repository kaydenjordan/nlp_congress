 Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank Chairwoman Lowey for her  leadership and the staff on both the Republican side and the Democratic  side for working so hard.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairwoman Roybal-Allard,  Ranking Member Kay Granger, and, of course, all the members, the  conferees, who worked so hard to come up with this bipartisan,  bicameral spending package. The conferees worked together to make sure  that we seek an acceptable funding solution for the different sides we  have.   Now, what do we have here? It is a matter of vision. There are some  people who see the border as a crisis, and I respectfully disagree with  them. There are some of us who live on the border who see the border as  a place of community, opportunity, where we raise our families, where  we send our kids to school, and where we have trade and tourism.   In that place called the border, I will tell you that if you look at  crime rates, the border crime rate is lower than the national crime  rate. I am not going to pick any selective cities, but I can tell you  that I can pick any city, and the crime rate in the cities of some of  my colleagues are higher than the border crime rate that we have.                                time  2000    We came up with a balance between what those two visions were. What  we did is we found a way to provide technology at ports of entry, found  a way to balance border security, but, at the same time, provide  security.   On the border, we don't believe in open borders. We want to see smart  border security, and I think that is what this bill does. We were able  to get together. It is a bill that provides funding not only for border  security, but, keep in mind, there are six other bills that provide  money for agriculture, transportation, education, and healthcare.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to vote ``yes'' on  this conference report.
