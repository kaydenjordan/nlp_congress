 Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy 65th anniversary to  Garry and Jackie Small of Chico. The couple wed in 1955 after meeting  as students at Chico State University, but that is not where the close  ties to the university stop.   Garry was a lifelong administrator, with titles ranging from director  of plant operations to associate vice president for administration.  Jackie worked at the bookstore working her way up, and eventually  retiring from the Meriam Library on campus.   The Smalls have three daughters, Kari, Julie, and Lynn, and two  grandsons, Keaton and Tyler.   Mr. Speaker, again I congratulate Garry and Jackie on 65 years and  send them my best wishes and blessings for many years to come.                            ____________________
