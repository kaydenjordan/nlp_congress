 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise as a mother  who went to many parent-teacher meetings and a few sessions with the  principal, and a grandmother who just loves to see my own child's  engagement in my grandchildren's education.   Today, the Congressional Republicans are mimicking my home State,  Florida's extreme, rightwing, cruel policies.   Alarmingly and sadly, in Florida, today, lawmakers are banning books.  They are threatening to jail teachers. They are bullying LGBTQ+  students, and they are suppressing history.   In Florida, a teacher can actually go to jail for putting a book  about Rosa Parks or the Holocaust on a child's table. Teachers can be  fined for comforting a gay child who is being teased for her gender.  Schools can lose funding if they promote diversity or they teach Black  history.   Really?   Mr. Speaker, parents want guns banned. They want their children to  feel nurtured. They want their teachers to be paid well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) for yielding and for organizing this session  tonight. I am happy to be with all of my colleagues who are here  tonight, also.   I am very proud to be a Congresswoman in one of the most diverse  Congresses in our history. It is the most diverse. We now have 94  Democratic women. We even have quite a few Republican women, which is  great.   Listen, I am here as a mother and grandmother as we celebrate Women's  History Month. It is a time to reflect on the historic gains women have  made and reclaim our efforts as we march to equity.   This is a time that we pay tribute, sister--I will call you sister; I  feel like you are my sister--to the strong, fearless, and selfless  women who paved the way for us all.   When I think about it, just about every one of us here was first at  something, but we know we are not going to be last. We are first but  not last. In that regard, I am going to do a couple of shout-outs.   I want to shout out to our Vice President, Kamala Harris, the first  woman Vice President of the United States, who, of course, graced our  Senate.   I want to shout out to the first woman of color ever elected to this  Congress, Patsy Mink, who was the first Asian American and also the  author of Title IX, which has meant so much for women to advance in  education.   I am also going to do a shout-out to someone who was one of my very  good friends, who I miss already as she retired last year, and that is  Lucille Roybal-Allard, a very proud California Member, the first  Mexican-American woman to be in Congress.   It is not really their ethnic identity that I think about. Because I  got to serve with Lucille Roybal-Allard, I remember her grit, her  determination, the first woman of color cardinal in charge of an  Appropriations Committee subcommittee and a lot of battles as chair of  the Homeland Security Subcommittee.   I want to tell you what she left. She left a quote: ``One thing that  I hope is that the people that I have represented over the years know  that I have worked as hard as I possibly could on their behalf and that  I served them honorably and that, hopefully, I made a positive  difference in their life.''   I will tell you this, Lucille Roybal-Allard, if you are listening to  this: You made a positive difference in many, many people's lives.                                time  1945    Now, Mr. Speaker, let me talk about someone who is a personal heroine  of  [[Page H1398]]  mine, Bella Abzug. Bella Abzug, what a trailblazer. We know her for her  hats. She always wore a hat. She was a giant of the women's rights  movement, whose shoulders we all stand on today. ``Battling Bella'' as  she was affectionately known, was on the front line of every issue of  her time.   She was born to Russian immigrants in the Bronx, and even as a young  girl working in her father's butcher shop, she knew she wanted to be a  lawyer. She went to Hunter College where she was on the student  council, and then set her sights on Harvard, but the school had other  thoughts. They ultimately rejected her because of her gender.   Columbia University was much more astute and she earned her law  degree there. She became a lawyer at a time when very, very few women  were practicing law. She defended Black clients in the South. She  dedicated her time to fighting labor rights, tenant's rights, and civil  liberties. She worked with the ACLU and the Civil Rights Congress.   She marched for equal rights, feminism, environmentalism, and the  LGBTQ+ community. She organized the Women's Strike for Peace in the  1960s. She brought together tens of thousands of women across America  to protest nuclear testing and the Vietnam war.   In 1970, decades into her career, she was elected to the Congress  where she served until 1976. In these Halls, she introduced bills to  remove troops in Vietnam, she fought for the equal rights amendment,  access to abortion care, funding for childcare, and gay rights.   She led the charge to make it illegal for credit companies to  discriminate against applicants based on the basis of sex, race,  religion, and marital status or age. Believe it or not, sister, there  was a time that women couldn't even get credit in their own name.   Outside of Congress, Bella founded the National Women's Political  Caucus with other feminist icons: Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, and  Gloria Steinem.   Bella Abzug was a true force to be reckoned with, a passionate and  compassionate leader who wore many hats--literally and figuratively-- and fearlessly stood up for her values regardless of political  consequences.   She once said of herself, sister--and I think her description  probably describes a lot of the women in this room tonight. She said: I  have been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man  hater, you name it. They call me ``Battling Bella,'' mother of courage.   There are those who say I am impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude,  profane, brash, and overbearing. Whether I am any of these things or  all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am, and this  must be made very clear at the outset, I am a very serious woman.   She was a woman to be taken seriously, and she did not back down from  the biggest fights of her generation. She did not give up creating a  better world for her children or her children's children. As women  Members of Congress, looking back on her legacy, we take courage from  her actions, and we will continue to fight, to build the equitable  world that she dreamed of.   Bella never backed down and neither will we.
