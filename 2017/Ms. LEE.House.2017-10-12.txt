 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking member for yielding  time to me and for her tireless leadership.   Mr. Speaker, as a Representative from northern California, let me  just say that my thoughts and prayers are with our neighbors in the  North Bay.   I remember the Oakland Hills. I represent Oakland and Berkeley,  California; and just as many helped us then, we will help our neighbors  now.   I am deeply grateful to our firefighters and our first responders who  have been working around the clock to extinguish these fires.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this emergency  supplemental. Our neighbors in the North Bay, the Gulf Coast, Puerto  Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, they need our help, and they need  it now. Communities are devastated, and many are still without power  and water. This is a life-and-death situation for so many.   Make no mistake, the recovery process is just beginning, and we  cannot forget our Caribbean neighbors who are also suffering.   Mr. Speaker, the supplemental is a good first step. It is a good  first step in a very long process, but we must provide more long-term  assistance to help communities rebuild and to help them recover very  quickly, and we must leave no one behind.
