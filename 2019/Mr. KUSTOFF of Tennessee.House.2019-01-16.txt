 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  recognize a true public servant and a friend of mine, Bob Kirk, from  Dyersburg, Tennessee.   Bob has served as an alderman for the city of Dyersburg for 51 years.  He leaves this position this month not only with many years of  dedicated service, but also as the longest serving elected official in  the State of Tennessee.   Bob Kirk's service to the Nation and to our State started immediately  following his high school graduation, when he dedicated 4 years to the  United States Air Force. After serving in the military, Bob returned  home to start his career at Colonial Rubber Works, where he was a loyal  employee for 30 years until his retirement in 1996.   During Bob's tenure as an alderman, he played an instrumental role in  securing a Tennessee Highway Patrol office in Dyersburg, and he has  been present and active for so many economic wins on behalf of the city  of Dyersburg.   In addition to his elected position, Bob has remained extremely  active in numerous community organizations. Last spring, the Tennessee  Municipal League honored Bob by creating a new award in his honor that  will bear his name. It is the Bob Kirk Local Government Leadership  Award. This award is going to be given annually to outstanding public  servants who not only go above and beyond the call of duty, but also do  a great job in serving their communities.   To Bob and to his wife, Carol, I speak on behalf of west Tennessee  and the State of Tennessee and I say thank you for your service to the  city of Dyersburg. Thank you for your service to Dyer County. You  epitomize public service and your love for the community.                            ____________________
