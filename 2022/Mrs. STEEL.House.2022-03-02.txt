 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Huntington Beach  Police Officer Nicholas Vella who was tragically killed in a crash  while responding to a call in Newport Beach on February 19.   Officer Vella served as a law enforcement officer for 18 years and  spent 14 years with the Huntington Beach Police Department. He  dedicated his life to protecting our community. My heart goes out to  his wife and daughter, the Huntington Beach Police Department, and all  who loved and knew Officer Vella.   I am so thankful every day for our brave law enforcement officers.  They put their lives on the line for us, and I am so grateful for their  service and sacrifice. I want to thank their families, too, because  their sacrifice does not go unnoticed.   I will be praying for Officer Vella and his family.                            ____________________
