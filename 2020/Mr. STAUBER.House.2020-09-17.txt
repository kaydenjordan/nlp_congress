 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mark  Sertich.   A hockey legend and leader in the Duluth community, Mark passed away  last month at 99 years old.   Upon graduation from Duluth's Denfeld High School in 1939, Mark  served his country in World War II as a radio operator under General  Patton. When he returned home from the war, Mark dedicated his time and  efforts into growing the game of hockey in the Duluth community because  he knew the true power of hockey was its ability to bring people  together.   Mark helped build hockey rinks, coached youth teams, and served as  the head of the Duluth Amateur Hockey Association--all helping to  ensure his passion would pass down to the next generation.   Mark's love for the game of hockey lasted his entire life. In fact,  he holds the Guinness World Record as the oldest hockey player, and he  continued to play with my former colleagues in the Duluth Fire  Department for over 30 years. I had the great honor of playing  [[Page H4494]]  with Mark during some of those games, and I am thankful to everyone at  the Fire Department who made those games possible.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Mark Sertich is already missed by his  family, friends, and all of the Duluth community, but I hope they are  comforted in knowing that his life as a hockey legend, community  leader, World War II veteran and a member of the greatest generation  will be long remembered and celebrated.                            ____________________
