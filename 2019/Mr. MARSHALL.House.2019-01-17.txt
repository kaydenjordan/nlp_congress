 Madam Speaker, I am horribly disappointed and ashamed  that, today, taxpayers remain the top funding source for America's  abortion leader, Planned Parenthood.   As an obstetrician and gynecologist, I have delivered thousands of  babies from Kansas. I dedicated my career to protecting the sanctity of  life, and I firmly and wholeheartedly believe that life begins at  conception.   There are countless stories that I could share today, and I can tell  you that some of the children I delivered are now in college. Some are  star athletes. Some are leaders at their church and in their  communities. And some are at the top of their class.   They are nurses and soldiers, doctors and pharmacists, police  officers and teachers, clergy and judges. Perhaps most importantly,  many are now moms and dads themselves.   I know these stories because, as I travel throughout Kansas, I see  the moms, the moms I have delivered, and I see their children. They are  now adults leading their own lives.   What no one on this Earth can do is tell the stories of the babies  that were aborted and given no chance to share their gifts with the  world.
