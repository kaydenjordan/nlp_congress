 Mr. President, I listened carefully to the presentation  by my colleague and friend, Senator Graham of South Carolina. I wanted  to come to the floor to make it clear that he didn't tell you the whole  story. In fact, in some ways, he didn't even get close.   Who is this judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson? How could she even be  considered for the Supreme Court if she is the preferred pick of the  radical left? Well, let's take a look at her background: an  extraordinary story of a daughter of two public school teachers; the  daughter of a father who decided he was going to go to law school,  basically stopped working full time. Her mother supported the family.  She was a little girl at the time. She remembers it well because there  would be law books stacked on the kitchen table. She would come in as a  little girl and bring her coloring books to sit next to her daddy while  he was studying for law school. He went on to become a lawyer. Family  members were policemen. One of her uncles turned out to be the chief of  police in Miami. She grew up in a very ambitious, determined, orderly  family, and she certainly had respect for her family ties to law  enforcement.   She was on the debate team in high school. One of the trips took her  from Florida up to the campus of Harvard University. She was dazzled,  believed that this just might be the answer to her dreams.   She came back to her high school and sat down with her high school  counselor, who said to this young Black woman: Honey, you are shooting  too high. I don't want your heart to be broken. Think about other  schools. Don't think about that Harvard University school.   Luckily, she ignored that advice, applied, and was accepted.   She told the story before the hearing about being on the campus at  Cambridge, not sure that it was the right decision, looking around,  seeing a much different world than the one she grew up in, a much  different group of people than she was used to socializing with. She  must have shown it in her face because as she was walking across the  campus one day, an African-American woman saw her, looked at her, and  said: Persevere. Persevere.    Just that simple word captured everything for her, and she did. She  persevered and completed her education at Harvard and went on to  Harvard Law School. She was an outstanding student at the law school,  so much so that she became a clerk to the Federal district court. She  did such a good job, she was promoted to become a Federal circuit court  clerk and then--the ultimate prize for any graduating law student in  America--clerk to a Justice of the Supreme Court--Ketanji Brown  Jackson--and what an irony that she worked for Justice Stephen Breyer,  whose retirement has created the vacancy which she seeks.   Along the way, she staffed the Sentencing Commission. She worked in  the Public Defender's Office. She became a Federal district court  judge, cleared by this committee, the Judiciary Committee. This was her  fourth time before the committee. Each time she appeared, there was  bipartisan support, including the Senator who just spoke against her.  Then, ultimately, the opportunity of a lifetime to fill a vacancy on  the Supreme Court.   For the hearing itself, first, I want to commend my Republican  colleague Chuck Grassley. As chairman of the committee, a Democrat  couldn't be any luckier than to have sitting in the chair next to you  Chuck Grassley. He is a gentleman. He is a strong, faithful Republican,  but he is a gentleman. We were determined to make this hearing for this  judicial nomination to the Supreme Court different than some that had  gone before.   I want to commend the Republicans on the committee. There are 11 of  them. The majority of those Republicans asked tough, probing questions,  as they should. They never got personal. They never raised their  voices. They were respectful throughout, the majority of them. I am  sorry to say that in a few instances, there were exceptions on that  side of the aisle. But I think the hearing, by and large, was a good  hearing despite a few differences, which I will note in a minute.   At the end of the day, you could not help but leave that hearing and  think you had just seen, you had just witnessed a moment in history-- not just the first African American to aspire to serve on the Supreme  Court but also a pillar of strength during her hearing. They threw it  at her in every direction.   I can't tell you how many people have come up to me everywhere I have  gone since that hearing and said the same thing: How did you sit  through that? How could you put up with that?   And I thought, and I said to them: Think about her sitting in front  of her husband and her daughters and some of the things that were said  about her, things said again this morning on the Senate floor. She came  out a pillar of strength, grace and dignity under pressure.   I looked up at that table several times and thought, Judge, if you  stood up at this moment and said ``Enough. I am taking my family, and  we are out of here,'' I would understand. But she never did. She never  wavered. She was solid as a rock, and that is why it is my honor to  support her and believe that she is going to make history.   Some of the things they said were outrageous. This case they want to  make about her sentencing guidelines when it comes to sex crimes  involving children and child pornography--what did she say about it?  She said they were horrible and despicable crimes. But she didn't just  say it before the committee when she was under assault. Listen to what  she said in one of her cases, United States v. Hillie, a case involving  sexual misconduct toward children. The true nature of these offenses,  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said, lies in how they affected the  children who you tormented for nearly a decade when you lived on and  off with their mother. That is a substantial portion of their  childhood. These two children carried a burden no child should have to  shoulder--the burden of protecting themselves from a man charged with  their care but who instead exploited them.   Then she went on to say:         This family has been torn apart--    she said to the defendant--       by your criminal actions. You saw it on the faces of those       women. You heard it in their voices. And the impact of your       acts on those very real victims who are still struggling to       recover to this day makes your crimes among the most serious       criminal offenses that this Court has ever sentenced.    Does that sound like she is soft on crime? Does that sound like she  didn't remember she is a mother of daughters who cared for the impact  those criminals had on the children and the family? Not in any way  whatsoever.   You would draw a much different conclusion if you just listened to  the arguments being made recently here on the floor, and it would be an  unfair conclusion.   The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is this: What they have  left out in the presentation is critical to the very truth of their  allegations. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is in the mainstream of  sentencing when it comes to these cases. Seventy to eighty percent  [[Page S1881]]  of Federal judges divert from the guidelines as she has in some cases.  And, let me add, her accusers have been voting for Federal judges  proposed by President Trump right and left who do exactly the same  thing she does.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a New York Times article of March 25, 2022, entitled ``Jackson's  Critics Backed Judges With Like Rulings.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Mar. 24, 2022]             Jackson's Critics Backed Judges With Like Rulings                               (By Linda Qiu)         Washington.--Several Republican senators repeatedly and       misleadingly suggested during this week's Supreme Court       confirmation hearings that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson had       given uncommonly lenient sentences to felons convicted of       child sex abuse crimes.        But all of the Republican critics had previously voted to       confirm judges who had given out prison terms below       prosecutor recommendations, the very bar they accused Judge       Jackson of failing to clear.        Just 30 percent of offenders who possessed or shared images       of child sex abuse received a sentence within the range       suggested by nonbinding federal guidelines in the 2019 fiscal       year, and 59 percent received a sentence below the guideline       range. And in general, it is not uncommon for judges to       impose shorter sentences than what prosecutors have       recommended.        ``I listed these seven cases in which you had discretion       and you did not follow the prosecutor's recommendation or the       sentencing guidelines,'' Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of       Missouri, said at Judge Jackson's hearing on Tuesday. ``I'm       questioning how you used your discretion in these cases.''        Mr. Hawley's point was echoed by three of his Republican       colleagues: Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom       Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Cruz said the       sentences imposed by Judge Jackson in cases involving images       of child sex abuse were 47.2 percent less than the       prosecutor's recommendations on average.        ``You always were under the recommendation of the       prosecutor,'' Mr. Graham told the judge on Wednesday. ``I       think you're doing it wrong, and every judge who does what       you're doing is making it easier for the children to be       exploited.''        But Mr. Hawley, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cotton and Mr. Cruz all       voted to confirm judges nominated by President Donald J.       Trump to appeals courts even though those nominees had given       out sentences lighter than prosecutor recommendations in       cases involving images of child sex abuse. Mr. Graham had       also voted to confirm Judge Jackson to the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2021 in spite       of the sentencing decisions she had made as a district judge.        In 2017, Judge Ralph R. Erickson was confirmed by a 95-to-l       vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,       with Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Graham voting in the       affirmative. (Mr. Hawley was not yet a senator.) While       serving as a district court judge in North Dakota, Judge       Erickson imposed sentences shorter than the prosecutor's       recommendations in nine cases involving child sex abuse       imagery from 2009 to 2017, averaging 19 percent lower.        In the case with the greatest discrepancy--in which a 68-      year-old man pleaded guilty to possessing and transporting       such illicit materials--prosecutors asked for 151 months and       Judge Erickson imposed a 96-month sentence.        Judge Amy J. St. Eve was confirmed by a 91-to-0 vote in       2018 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.       While serving as a district court judge in Illinois, Judge       St. Eve imposed lighter sentences than prosecutor       recommendations in two such cases. In United States v.       Conrad, she sentenced a man who transported images of child       sexual abuse to 198 months, 45 percent less than the       prosecutor's recommendation of 360 months.        All four Republican senators voted to confirm Judge Joseph       F. Bianco to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit       in 2019. Previously, as a district court judge in New York,       Judge Bianco sentenced three defendants to prison terms       shorter than what prosecutors had sought.        At a 2013 hearing for a 25-year-old defendant who possessed       and distributed illicit materials, Judge Bianco stated that       the court had ``discretion'' to impose such sentences and       spoke of ``mitigating circumstances''--an echo of what Judge       Jackson repeatedly told the senators during this week's       hearings. The defendant received a 60-month prison term,       while prosecutors had asked for ``a sentence above the 60       months.''        ``The guidelines here are just way disproportionate under       the facts of this case, and I don't view them as particularly       helpful in this case.'' Judge Bianco said at the time. ``I       disagree with the government that this case is sort of in the       heartland of normal cases. There are a number of mitigating       factors in this case that I believe are compelling.''        Most recently, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Hawley voted to       confirm Judge Andrew L. Brasher to the U.S. Court of Appeals       for the 11th Circuit in 2020. (Mr. Graham was not present for       the vote.) As a district court judge in Alabama, Judge       Brasher had sentenced a defendant to 84 months in prison,       below the prosecutor recommendation of 170 months.        In a 2019 hearing before he issued the sentence, Judge       Brasher noted that ``one of the things that I'm required by       law to evaluate and consider with respect to'' the defendant       ``is disparities between offenders who are similarly       situated.''        That, too, was similar to an explanation that Judge Jackson       gave for her sentencing decisions.        ``Judges all over the country are grappling with how to       apply this guideline under these circumstances,'' she told       Mr. Hawley on Wednesday. ``The judge is not just evaluating       what the government says in these cases. In every criminal       case, a judge has to take into account all sorts of       factors.''     It tells a story, and the story is very clear. We have a  situation in this country where we have not upgraded the child  pornography and sexual misconduct statutes in years. Across the board,  70 to 80 percent of sentences by Federal judges take the same position  as Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. These so-called deviations from the  guidelines have become commonplace. As I said, the overwhelming  majority of Federal judges are doing this.   Well, is there a problem? There is. But the problem is that we have  not upgraded the statute. We bear responsibility for this. The decision  was made before the Supreme Court that these guidelines would not be  mandatory. It was a decision joined by Antonin Scalia--the originalist,  the conservative. It put the burden back on Congress, and we have not  picked up that responsibility.   So you say to yourself: Well, if she were so soft on crime, it surely  would have shown up in other places. Well, let me tell you what  happened. The American Bar Association did a review of her career as a  prosecutor, as a defender, on the bench. They interviewed 250  individuals--judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, other counsel who  worked with her.   And I asked, pointblank, Judge Ann Williams, who led this  investigation by the ABA: Did you hear from anyone who said she was  soft on crime; that she somehow was not in the norm when it came to  sentencing?   None. Not one. Two hundred fifty people interviewed, and not one came  up with it.   All we have heard against her has come out of the mouths of three or  four people on the committee, and that is it because there is no record  for it.   Well, how did the American Bar Association grade her when it was all  said and done? Unanimously ``well qualified.'' Unanimously ``well  qualified.'' It doesn't sound like the same person just described, does  it, because it isn't. What you have heard on the floor here is a  mischaracterization of her record, and I am sorry to say it is unfair.  And I wish it hadn't been part of the record today.   What about Guantanamo? Well, I have some serious differences with the  Senator from South Carolina about Guantanamo. Hundreds of detainees  have been sent to Guantanamo since the War on Terror began. Many of  them should have been there, but hundreds and hundreds of them have  been released by Presidents, Republican and Democratic. We are now down  to 39 detainees. We are spending over $10 million for each one of them  each year at Guantanamo Bay.   And when it comes to the resolution of who was responsible for 9/11,  the families have come and testified before us. They have waited over  20 years, and they still don't have an answer. They understand that the  approach at Guantanamo Bay is not leading to justice, and it is not  answering the basic factual questions.   So what is her situation? Why would she dare to call the Republican  President of the United States a war criminal? What was she thinking?  Well, it sounds like a terrible charge until you read the facts.   The facts were she presented a brief, and the brief referred to a  body of law known as the Alien Tort Statute. And the person she was  representing in this brief was arguing that he was tortured and  mistreated at Guantanamo Bay. So he filed a claim under the Alien Tort  Statute. When you do that, you sue the President of the United States  and the Secretary of Defense. They were the named defendants. That  included President Bush.  [[Page S1882]]    What the Senator from South Carolina failed to disclose was that, as  that case was winding its way through, the administration changed, and  if there was an allegation of a war crime against President Bush, it  was the same allegation that was made when the administration changed  and the name of the defendant changed to Barack Obama.   To argue that this was a personal charge against the President of the  United States as a war criminal is a gross exaggeration and unfair on  its face. The named defendants were required under the Alien Tort  Statute for the allegations that were made. That wasn't her decision;  that was the decision of Congress to write the specifics of the Alien  Tort Statute.    The third point I want to make is immigration. Yes, we have  challenges in immigration. I think we all know it. But to blame her and  say that she is somehow responsible for the invasion--you saw the crowd  of people coming across the border--is really unfair.   What happened was there was a lawsuit filed challenging a Trump  decision on policy, and she was asked to rule on it. And she ruled in  one direction. The appeal was taken, and she was reversed at the  circuit court.   Now, according to the Senator who just made the presentation,  evidence she is in the pocket of the radical left when it comes to  immigration, evidence that George Soros somehow is controlling her  decisions, is preposterous. The fact of the matter is, if you look at  almost 600 decisions handed down by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, you  will find a small, small percentage that were actually reversed.   And if you are looking for a second case to build the theory that she  is on the radical left, I don't even think you found the first one. She  has a balanced approach. She has ruled for and against Democratic and  Republican Presidents. She has shown the kind of balance we expect on  the Supreme Court.   I would say this notion that somehow Joe Biden has chosen someone who  is radical is a shame. She is not. She is as solid as they come, and  her testimony and her appearance before the committee proved that over  and over again.   I also want to say I have nothing against the South Carolina judge  who was in the finals but wasn't chosen by the President. In fact,  President Biden has asked that she be promoted from the Federal  district court to the Federal circuit court, and I would like to get  that done as quickly as we can. I think Judge Childs is well deserving  of that opportunity. She certainly is a good jurist.   But the choice by President Biden was clear, and it was the right  choice. These charges that somehow she is soft on crime because she is  an African-American woman and she was a public defender belie the  actually record of this woman.   We should all be judged on our records. This notion that we are asked  to identify ourselves by labels--we know that story, the 100 of us who  sit on this side of the Capitol in the Senate Chamber. We are attached  to labels which we embrace and some we don't embrace, but most people  who are fair will say: I am not going to judge you by your label; I am  going to judge you by your record.   If you judge Ketanji Brown Jackson by her record--written opinions,  the fact that this was the fourth time she appeared before the  Judiciary Committee and had been approved the three previous times,  serving on the Sentencing Commission and so many other things--you know  that it is an outstanding and stellar record, but you know it almost  has to be. If you want to be the first, you have to be the best. She is  the best.   Despite some of the things that have been thrown at her today and in  other places, the American people came out of that hearing and felt  better and stronger about her nomination than before the hearing began.  It is evidence of the strengths that she brings to this nomination and  the value that she will bring to the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
