 Mr. Chair, I would just close by saying, once again, the  intent of this is to study and make sure we have the best possible  system going forward.   I know that Representative Sarbanes and others have studied the  existing mechanisms out there to try and implement this kind of small  donor matching system. I am sorry it didn't work out in Arizona, but I  think we have a great plan here going forward.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
