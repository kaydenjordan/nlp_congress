 Madam Speaker, with so much talk about infrastructure in  the air lately, let's do a quick review.   The last sizeable infrastructure bill was done in 2015, to the cost  of about $300 billion. Now, what we see is a so-called infrastructure  plan put out by the Biden administration and the House and Senate  Democrats nine times that size, $2.7 trillion.   We can probably find that much infrastructure to do, except there is  a whole lot in this bill that is not infrastructure. Much is social  spending and other things that might be good in a different bill, but  not this bill.   Also, in order to pay for it, they would seek to dismantle the 2017  tax reforms that did so much to promote and boost our economy and bring  jobs back to the United States. It unleashed record growth. Instead, we  would hurt that economy by what is in the plan.   How about, instead of tax hikes to cover what is essentially  socialist spending tucked into a bill being labeled as infrastructure,  let's focus on the work needing done: highways, bridges, levees, dams  for water storage, and broadband. These are the things people need and  can actively use. What they don't need are choking taxes that harm our  economy.                            ____________________
