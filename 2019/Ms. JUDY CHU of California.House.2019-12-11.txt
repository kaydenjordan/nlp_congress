 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of  H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Americans are sick and tired of getting fleeced by Big Pharma and  have had enough of skyrocketing prescription drug prices.   In my district, an uninsured patient with diabetes has to pay $655  for a monthly supply of Novolog Flexpen, a popular brand of insulin.  But, in Canada, that same supply of insulin can be purchased for just  $47.   This is outrageous. Why should Americans have to pay so much more  than any other developed country for the exact same medications? Why  should my constituents have to plan trips to Mexico and Canada to get  the medications they need to stay alive? Because even with the cost of  travel, it is still cheaper to buy their insulin abroad. And why are  drug company profits soaring while patients go bankrupt? This is simply  not right.   H.R. 3 is a landmark piece of legislation. It gives Medicare the  power to negotiate for lower prices directly with the drug companies.  It makes those lower prices available to those with private insurance.  Seniors will not have to pay more than $2,000 out-of-pocket for their  drugs. And drug companies can no longer rip off Americans while  charging other countries less for the same drug.   This bill is an important first step in addressing the skyrocketing  cost of prescription drugs. I am proud to stand here today as a  cosponsor of H.R. 3. And I am committed to continuing our work for the  people to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.
