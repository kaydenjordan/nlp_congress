 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for yielding, and I thank  Ranking Member Kay Granger for her work.   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to do a video, as we all are  communicating with one another virtually, about my colleague and friend  with whom I have served for over three decades, Nita Lowey.   I went to school in Nita Lowey's district many, many years ago. When  she came here, we became friends. Shortly thereafter, she came on the  Appropriations Committee, and we served together, as Speaker Pelosi  said, on the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I served on that  committee for 23 years. I have great affection for that committee.   We served under a gentleman named Bill Natcher from the State of  Kentucky. He used to stand when he presented that bill to the floor and  say: ``This is the people's bill.''   Mr. Speaker, this is the people's bill.                                time  1915    This is a bill that must pass. They say that good things come to  those who wait. They have waited too long, had too much pain,  physically; too many deaths; too much psychological damage; too many  lost jobs. This is, however, a good thing that will come to those who  need it so badly.   I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey, who has performed such  extraordinary service on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies for a long time; and the  Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for a  long time; and for the Appropriations Committee.   I want to thank my friend, Kay Granger. We are perceived as being  awfully partisan, and this has been a partisan project as well. It took  us from May 15 until today to get this done. We passed, in the interim,  October 1, another bill of substantially lesser sum than the one we  passed in May, and a little more than what we are passing--actually,  twice what we are passing today. All of it was needed.  [[Page H7308]]    The American people have been waiting and watching and hoping that  Congress would not only be able to avert a shutdown but also to provide  much-needed COVID-19 relief.   Mr. Speaker, we now have a bipartisan agreement, and the legislation  will achieve both of those aims.   Kay Granger, as I said, is somebody who was a mayor in Texas, and  mayors know they have to get things done, and Congresswoman Granger has  been somebody who wants to get things done. She and Nita Lowey have  been a team in getting things done. I thank both of them.   This bill completes the appropriations process by investing in the  American people, in our national defense, in economic opportunity, in  strengthening safety net programs that keep Americans out of poverty.   As I said, I thank both Nita Lowey and Kay Granger.   I particularly want to thank an extraordinary Member of this body.  She is not called a Congresswoman. She is not a Member of this body,  but she is a person without whom we would not be nearly as successful  as we have been over this last year. She has made this year less  painful for millions and millions and millions of Americans.   Her name is Shalanda Young. She sits right behind me, an  extraordinary talent whose leadership makes seminal contributions to  all the sections of this bill and to previous bills dealing with  appropriations and the COVID-19 pandemic.   She is, in many ways, an indispensable person when we come to dealing  with bills of this magnitude. She works for Mrs. Lowey, as does Chris  Bigelow. Both have done extraordinary service.   Shalanda Young, Mr. Speaker, represents the best of us. I say that  because she represents a lot of the staff we have here. She is  extraordinarily talented, extraordinarily patriotic, and  extraordinarily dedicated to the work of the American people, and  extraordinarily underpaid.   Members are going to be underpaid in this bill, too. We beat our  chest, and we have money in there that says we don't get a COLA one  more time. Aren't we so courageous. I am disgusted by that, Mr.  Speaker, and I want all of America to know; I want all of my  constituents to know. Every Member in this place, whether I agree with  them or not, is worth a COLA, at least trying to keep them even with  the cost of living in this country. We struck it one more time, as we  pretend that we think the COLA is unjust.   However, that is de minimis to this bill, but, certainly, will not  dissuade me or ought not to dissuade anybody from voting  enthusiastically, energetically, and proudly for this bill.   As a result of this omnibus, the next President will be able to start  his administration focusing on immediate challenges instead of trying  to finish the previous year's work.   I want to say something on that one more time. I have talked to Ms.  Granger, who is going to be here. There is no reason, Mr. Speaker, why  we can't pass appropriation bills by September 30, the ending of the  fiscal year, October 1 being the beginning of the new fiscal year.   I am frustrated, as the majority leader who is supposed to be able to  make things work here, with my colleagues. We did make it work here,  but our Senate colleagues did not pass a single bill prior to the  election, so here we are.   In addition, this end-of-the-year package includes critical clean- energy legislation passed by the House earlier this year that makes  important progress toward addressing the climate crisis while ensuring  that America can create good jobs by leading the clean-energy economy.   We were also able, in this bill, Mr. Speaker, to include legislation  that protects patients from surprise bills by removing them from the  fight between insurers and providers and implementing a fairer process  for resolving disputes.   On COVID-19 relief, while we were unable to secure agreement on every  priority that Democrats and some Republicans wanted--we don't always  get everything we want. So be it. That is the process.   We were able, however, to include many of the provisions we included  in previous bills on May 15 and October 1, which I referred to earlier,  for which Democrats have been fighting for months and that Americans  desperately need.   These include resumption of expanded unemployment benefits, another  round of direct payments, relief for renters, and assistance to make  sure that Americans can put food on the table. In the richest country  on the face of the Earth, we have people in food lines who can't feed  themselves. That is not only wrong, but it is immoral and inconsistent  with my faith and, I think, the faith of most.   There is additional help for small business--appropriate--and  resources to help schools reopen safely.   In addition, we secured another $3.36 billion for GAVI, and I thank  the chair. It is a small program, relatively speaking, but it is about  keeping people healthy around the world.    We are a shrinking globe, and this COVID crisis came from abroad-- wherever it came from, Europe, contrary to the President saying it came  only from China. It came from Europe; it came from China. We have a  moral responsibility to make sure that it doesn't keep coming and that  we help our brothers and sisters abroad as well so that we, too, can be  healthy.   In the new year, we will continue to work to ensure that our country  can meet the challenges of COVID-19, including help for State, local,  Tribal, and territorial governments that are on the front line. Who is  delivering the shot in the arm? States and local governments.   No compromise is perfect, of course, and this is not perfect. So many  people have said that, but that goes without saying. We don't do  perfect. We are human beings. If we do the right thing, we do the best  we can. It is essential that we move forward and do our jobs for the  American people.   That is why the House did its job by passing the Heroes Act in May  and again in October and why we passed appropriation bills to fund  nearly all of government by July 26.   It is disappointing, as I have said, that the Senate waited until  November to begin serious consideration of appropriation bills. I don't  mean the subcommittees didn't work; they just didn't report anything  out.   Thankfully, though, we are taking action together. America, we are  taking action together. And you can be pleased when you see the board  light up, mostly overwhelmingly green.   I urge the President to sign this legislation without delay, just,  Mr. Speaker, as I urge him to sign the National Defense Authorization  Act in which you played such a critical role, Mr. Speaker, and we  passed earlier this month. I fear that he will veto this bill for an  unrelated, totally nongermane issue, and we may be back here on the  28th.   If we are not here on the 28th, again, Nita Lowey, I want to say to  you: Thank you. How much we appreciate your contribution, and how much  we appreciate the contribution of all of those who might be leaving  either voluntarily or involuntarily. We thank them for their service.   Mr. Speaker, let's finish the work of the 116th Congress.
