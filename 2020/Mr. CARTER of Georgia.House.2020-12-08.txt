 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms.  Myrna Ballard on her retirement from serving as Valdosta-Lowndes County  Chamber of Commerce president after 23 years.   Myrna has been a pillar to Valdosta and Lowndes throughout her time  serving in the chamber because of her work in economic development,  infrastructure building, and supporting pro-business legislation.  Thanks to her diligent and consistent efforts, the chamber has  continuously received the 5-star accreditation by the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce.   The accreditation program defines standards of excellence in chamber  planning and performance, and shows chambers how they can reach and  maintain these standards. It also recognizes folks like Myrna who have  helped set high standards for chamber members and staff to contribute  to the good of their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Myrna the best as she begins her retirement.  Congratulations again.                              Honoring Meg Heap     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chatham  County District Attorney Meg Heap.   Since she was elected DA in 2012, Meg has fought hard to secure  justice, prevent crimes, and improve our community. Her lifelong  passion for working with victims of crime and senior citizens helped  pave her way to law school at Mercer University. A Savannah native,  Meg's career and time as DA was marked by her love for Chatham County  and its people, which is why she worked so hard to establish the many  new programs and innovations to improve the district attorney's office.   Some of the many programs she started include the Youth Intercept for  at-risk youth and the Pretrial Diversion for youthful, non-violent  first offenders. Meg also helped establish the Chatham County Family  Justice Center to assist special victims find the services they need in  just one space.   I am thankful for Meg's many years of hard work, as Chatham is truly  a better place because of her.                     Honoring the life of Daniel Zeigler     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Mr. Daniel Zeigler of Savannah, Georgia, who, sadly, passed away  on December 4 at the young age of 33.   Daniel was a graduate of the South University School of Pharmacy and  worked as a pharmacist at Medicap Pharmacy. One of his greatest joys  was taking care of his pharmacy patients, and he did it with unmatched  kindness and intentionality.   Daniel loved the Lord and attended services at Compassion Christian  Church's Henderson Campus. Like his father, he also had a passion for  cars and was an avid member of various organizations. Daniel was the  youngest member of the Oglethorpe Driving Club, and cofounded the  successful Cars and Coffee, which was a group for car lovers across  Savannah.   He dedicated much of his joy and much of his time every December to  helping out with the Toys for Tots toy drive, which benefits kids in  need.   Mr. Speaker, my prayers, Amy's prayers, and all of the friends at  Carter's Pharmacy's prayers go out to all the lives that Daniel  touched, including his patients, his family, his parents, Donna and  Jay, his brother, Jason, and all of his friends who were blessed to  know him.                            ____________________
