 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Save Local  Business Act. I have heard from dozens of businesses and employees in  my district that have faced uncertainty under the expanded joint  employer definition, which threatens job creation, it increases costs,  and discourages entrepreneurs from opening up new businesses.   The National Labor Relations Board's decision ignored decades of  settled labor policy by changing the joint employer definition and  putting all businesses and their workers at risk. We should be making  America the most competitive place in the world to do business, not  saddling our job creators with unnecessary and confusing regulations.   This bill would take the right step to reinstate sound, widely  accepted standards, and I urge all of my colleagues to support its  passage.
