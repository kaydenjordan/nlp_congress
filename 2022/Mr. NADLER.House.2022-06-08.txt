 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1153, I call  up the bill (H.R. 7910) to amend title 18, United States Code, to  provide for an increased age limit on the purchase of certain firearms,  prevent gun trafficking, modernize the prohibition on untraceable  firearms, encourage the safe storage of firearms, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7910.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, our Nation has been through trying times these last  few weeks as we have tried to process the mass shootings in Buffalo,  Uvalde, Tulsa, and all too many other cities. Just this past weekend,  we learned of yet another horrific incident in Philadelphia and yet  more carnage in Tennessee, Arizona, Virginia, and South Carolina. And  those are just the stories we saw in the news.   Day after day, we see more lives lost to gun violence in our schools,  on our streets, in our houses of worship, and in our homes, touching  every region of the country. And we hear the urgent calls from our  constituents crying out for us to take action. Today, we heed that  call.   H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act, is comprehensive legislation  to address the scourge of gun violence, a blight that killed nearly  45,000 Americans in 2020 alone.   It builds on the work of several of our colleagues, including:   Anthony Brown's Raise the Age Act, which would raise the lawful age  to purchase an AR-15 styled semiautomatic assault rifle from 18 to 21  years old;   Robin Kelly's Prevent Gun Trafficking Act, which would establish new  Federal offenses for gun trafficking and straw purchasing;      David Cicilline's Untraceable Firearms Act, which would ensure that  ghost guns are subject to existing Federal firearms regulations;   A trio of gun storage proposals--Rosa DeLauro's Ethan's Law, Elissa  Slotkin's Safe Guns, Safe Kids Act, and Sheila Jackson Lee's Kimberly  Vaughan Firearms Safe Storage Act--which would establish storage  regulations that keep guns out of the hands of children and award  grants for firearm storage assistance programs;   Dina Titus' Closing the Bump Stock Loophole Act, which would build on  existing regulations banning the manufacture, sale, or possession of  bump stocks for civilian use;   And Ted Deutch's Keep Americans Safe Act, which would ban the sale,  manufacture, and illegal possession of gun magazines that hold more  than 15 rounds of ammunition.   I thank each of them for their contributions to this bill and for  making this country safer for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, all of us in this Chamber were shaken by the images of  parents in Uvalde standing in line to match their DNA to the remains of  their 9- and 10-year-old children, parents who should be picking up  their children from school right now but who, instead, are picking up  the pieces of their lives shattered by this unimaginable loss.   But the question today is: Who among us will have the courage to do  something about it? Who will be able to tell mothers and fathers that  their children need not go to school in a fortress just to keep them  safe? Who will be able to tell children that they did all they could  today to ensure that their parents will return safely from the  supermarket or their office or an evening out? Who will be able to tell  their constituents that they stood with them and not with the gun  lobby?   Americans are watching. They are begging us to protect them and their  loved ones from gun violence. Who among us will answer their call?   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this Protecting  Our Kids Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the cosponsor of the bill and  a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), a cosponsor of the bill and the chairman of  the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article dated  May 31, 2022, from The New York Times titled ``California has America's  Toughest Gun Laws, and They Work.''                  [From the New York Times, May 31, 2022]         California Has America's Toughest Gun Laws, and They Work                             (By Shawn Hubler)         The grotesque toll of gun violence is again being debated       in Congress. As Luis Ferre-Sadurni and I reported over the       long weekend, states are not holding their breath.        Particularly this state: In ways that have tended to be       underreported, California has significantly lowered gun       deaths, Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency room doctor and       longtime firearm violence researcher, told me this week.        ``For the last 20, maybe even 25 years--except for the two       years of the pandemic, which have increased homicides and       suicides across the country--our rates of firearm violence       have trended downward,'' said Dr. Wintemute, who directs the       Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of       California, Davis, Medical Center in Sacramento. ``And this       has been at a time when most of the rates in the rest of the       country have gone up.''        California's rate of firearm mortality is among the       nation's lowest, with 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 people in       2020, compared with 13.7 per 100,000 nationally and 14.2 per       100,000 in Texas, the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention has reported. And Californians are about 25       percent less likely to die in mass shootings, compared with       residents of other states, according to a recent Public       Policy Institute of California analysis.        I asked Dr. Wintemute how California is different. Here's a       lightly edited excerpt from our conversation, which took       place on Memorial Day after his emergency room shift:        Just a couple of weeks ago, California had a mass shooting.       By what measures are our policies a success?        You have to look at it on a population basis. We do have       more mass shootings in California, but we're also by far the       largest state. I looked a while ago at the rates of firearm       violence across the 21st century--homicide and suicide       together--and the rest of the country was up, but       California's rates were so far down that the average was       flat.        We always hear that nothing works, that even California's       strict gun laws are ineffective.        That's because we evaluate policies one at a time, in       isolation. The results for one policy might be mixed or even       negative. But what California has done over a number of       decades has been to enact a whole bundle of policies that I       think work in synergy, to measurable effect.        It sounds like the ``Swiss cheese model'' public health       experts have used to address Covid.        Yes. The idea is to prevent the holes in the policies from       lining up. But if we rank the states, California's rate of       firearm violence ranks 29th out of 50 states for homicides       and 44th for suicides.        Can you share some examples?        California has done a lot to prevent high-risk people from       purchasing firearms. We've broadened the criteria for keeping       guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger to       themselves or others due to mental illness. If you're       convicted of a violent misdemeanor in California, you can't       have a gun for the next 10 years; that offense has to be a       felony in most states.        We require background checks, and not just from licensed       retailers; in most states, purchases from private parties       require no background checks or record keeping of any kind.       We have a system, that we're evaluating now, for getting guns       back from ``prohibited persons''--people who have been       convicted of violent crimes or who are facing domestic       violence restraining orders. And we enforce these policies,       unlike a lot of other states.        What else?        In the early 1990s, cheap handguns--``Saturday Night       Specials''--were almost entirely manufactured around Los       Angeles. It was a few companies making upward of 800,000       cheap handguns a year. So the state imposed standards for       design and safety. One of the companies has since gone to       Nevada. The rest went belly-up and no one else has come in to       fill the gap.        What about gaps?        Every time California sets a new standard, the gun industry       tries to outwit it. Unregulated ghost guns have become       immensely popular here, precisely because we're such a       tightly regulated market. And the state program to recover       guns from prohibited people has never had the level of       funding it needs to do the whole job--there are only about 40       trained agents for the whole state and a backlog of at least       10,000 people whose guns need to be taken.        Overall, what could the rest of the country learn from       California?        The lower the prevalence of ownership, the lower the rate       of firearm violence--that's been one of the most robust       research findings for decades. Rates of gun ownership are       lower here, in part because of this bundle of state measures.       In the United States overall, something like 25 percent to 30       percent of individuals own guns. In California, it's about 15       percent to 18 percent.     Madam Speaker, the evidence doesn't lie. California's  rate of firearm mortality is among the Nation's lowest, with 8.5 gun  deaths per 100,000 people in 2020, compared with 13.7 per 100,000  nationally and 14.2 per 100,000 in Texas. Gun safety laws work. It is  that simple.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).

Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a May 27, 2022,  piece from CNN titled ``States with weaker gun laws have higher rates  of firearm related homicides and suicides, study finds.''                          [From CNN, May 27, 2022]     States With Weaker Gun Laws Have Higher Rates of Firearm Related                    Homicides and Suicides, Study Finds                  (By Emma Tucker and Priya Krishnakumar)         A new study published Thursday by a leading non-profit       organization that focuses on gun violence prevention found       that there is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun       laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides,       suicides and accidental killings.        The study by Everytown for Gun Safety determined that       California had the strongest gun laws in the country. Hawaii       topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the       country while Mississippi led the country with both the       weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.        ``What this project does, is show what we've been saying       for years: Gun laws save lives,'' said Nick Suplina, senior       vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety       Support Fund. ``We think this is going to be a really       important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that       have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make       that case clearly.''        To compile its list, the group used data from the Centers       for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state's       rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50       policies that they say are scientifically proven to be       effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.        The research team then weighed the list of gun safety       policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its       implementation of those policies and compared that score with       the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.        The CDC's data includes homicides, accidental killings and       suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000       people in the United States were killed with a firearm in       2020--more than half died by suicide.        The analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the       top of the list for gun law strength--a composite score of       84.5 out of 100, with one of the lowest rates of gun deaths       per 100,000 residents, at 8.5 out of 30 and below the       national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun       deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law       score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with       firearms in 9 percent of households, the data shows.        As state legislatures begin to convene for their 2022       legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of       bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across       various states.        ``I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have       done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and       effective,'' said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA). chair of the       House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. ``Gun laws work,       and we need them across the board to ensure that felons,       domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can't       simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws       meant to keep guns out of their hands.''        CNN has reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA)       to comment on the research, but it declined to do so before       seeing the data.        Mississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out       of 100 and has the highest rate of gun deaths per 100,000       residents--28.6 out of 30, the research shows.        Massachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the       second-lowest rate of  [[Page H5381]]       gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety       policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US.       Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the       highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.        ``Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can't pretend to be       ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at       this report,'' said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand       Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since       the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut       that killed 20 children and six educators.        Mother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence       problem in Indianapolis is ``tearing our community apart.''        Nearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre       ``Dre'' Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a       birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a       confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived       after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and       he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic       paralysis.        ``As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that       was taken away,'' Dycus said. ``My son was a dreamer. He was       a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.''        ``But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made       such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it       pertains to what it looks like to survive,'' she said. ``Dre       has embodied that.''        Everytown designated a list of five foundational laws that       have proven to be the most effective in lowering gun violence       rates. These include requirements for a background check and/      or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed       guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection       of `Stand Your Ground' laws; and the enactment of `extreme       risk' laws that temporarily remove a person's access to       firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk       to themselves or others, according to Everytown.        Last year, several conservative states--such as Texas,       Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming--passed       legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as       President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to       address gun violence following several high-profile mass       shootings.        In Texas, the controversial ``constitutional carry''       legislation went into effect in September that allows most       Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public       without obtaining a permit or training.        Supporters of the bill have argued that by removing the       licensing requirement they are removing an ``artificial       barrier'' to residents' right to bear arms under the       Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to ``the       protection of themselves or their families'' in public. But       law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns       that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult       for police to quell violence.        ``As we've seen gun extremism continue to rise in this       country, we've also seen people who open carry start out at       marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials'       homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th       at the US Capitol,'' Watts said.        According to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school       in December that killed four students is a ``textbook       example'' of why laws that require the secure storage of       firearms are essential to gun safety.        The alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan       Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and       wounding several others on November 30. His parents were       charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the       same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.        Prosecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the       suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four       days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan's       alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting       could have been prevented.        Only 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure       storage requirement, Watts said.        Last year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure       storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others,       according to Watts.        During this year's legislative session, Watts said the       organization will work with lawmakers in hopes of passing       such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California,       Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind       legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure       storage.        Everytown's research shows that 21 of the country's states       have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals       to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they       can safely walk away from the situation.        Despite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects       of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For       example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in       the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much       weaker gun laws, Suplina says.        According to Suplina, this could explain why such a high       number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago.       Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six       Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of       firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were       recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes,       including murder.        Gun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More       than two-thirds of the country's 40 most populous cities saw       more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were       a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of       police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates       of homicide continued into 2021.        While experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are       varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The       increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI's 2020       Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77 percent of       reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from       74 percent in 2019. The agency reported that the number of       homicides increased by nearly 30 percent from 2019, the       largest single-year jump the agency has recorded. There is no       federal database of gun sales, but other independent surveys       have found that gun sales have soared during the Covid-19       pandemic.

Too many cities in this country have become a shorthand for mass  shooting: Newtown, San Bernardino, Charleston, Las Vegas, Parkland,  Santa Fe, El Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde. The list goes on.   How many more communities must be visited by tragedy before we take  action?   How many more parents need to bury their own children because an 18- year old with an AR-15 assault rifle stormed into their school?   How many more children must grow up without a parent because a high- capacity magazine allowed a shooter to spray dozens of bullets through  a supermarket?   Let today be the day that we begin to end this cycle of gun violence  and we take meaningful action to protect our communities and, most of  all, to protect our kids.   You know, the Republicans tell us that we want to defund the police.  We  [[Page H5388]]  don't want to defund the police. President Biden just said the other  day we want to fund the police.   They want to defund the police. They want to disarm the police. What  chance does a policeman, with a regular service revolver, have against  someone with an AR-15 assault rifle? None at all.   They want to make sure that our police have no chance at all to  resist the dishonest people who use weapons of war because weapons of  war overwhelm whatever any policeman may have. That is the problem  here.   The problem here is that they want to defund--or I shouldn't say  defund. They want to disarm our police, compared to the crooks and the  murderers who have the weapons of war which can outweigh the service  revolvers that any police officer will have.   So we want to protect the police officers. We want them to not be  outgunned by the murderers. That is where we are. That is what this  bill does. That is perhaps why they are afraid of this bill.
