 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs.  Vera Dulaney, who, after 36 years of official service to her community,  will retire from her position as Scotts Bluff County clerk and election  commissioner.   Vera is a faithful public servant who works to protect the integrity  of our elections and sets an example for many others in her family and  community to follow. In fact, her daughter, Kathy, is the city clerk of  our city of Gering.   For over 30 years, Vera has served as a member of the board of  directors for Oregon Trail Days, which is held each year to showcase  the history and culture of western Nebraska. In cooperation with the  Boy Scouts of America, Vera continues to provide leadership for the Ed  Dulaney Canoe Derby, which is named after her late husband, who started  it over 45 years ago.   When she was recently presented the Community Volunteer Award for  public service, Vera said she could think of many others who she  thought were actually more deserving of the award.   Please join me in honoring an incredibly humble, hardworking, and  selfless advocate of western Nebraska, Mrs. Vera Dulaney.                            ____________________
