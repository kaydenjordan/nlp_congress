 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R.  2, the farm bill.   Our ag community has faced far too much uncertainty and challenges  this past year, and I am glad to see we are finally able to reach a  consensus that sets our country forward on a better path to help  farmers, ranchers, and rural communities throughout America-- communities like mine.                                time  1230    The bill addresses the urgent needs of rural communities and  agricultural communities, including those in Michigan's 10th  Congressional District.   First, the bill authorizes a huge investment in rural broadband, $350  million a year. As hard as it may be for people to believe, access to  stable, high-speed Internet is not commonplace in rural America. It  hinders economic development. It hinders the economic opportunity. It  hinders them in many ways.   This bill also raises the minimum standards for rural broadband and  targets grants and financial support to communities that are most in  need of assistance.   The farm bill also assists our dairy producers, especially the small  dairy producers like in my community who have faced real challenges  with dairy prices, by expanding affordable coverage for all producers  of all sizes.   It maintains the sugar program urgently needed in my district to  protect American farmers from anticompetitive foreign programs that  dump sugar at artificially low prices.   Lastly, the conference report makes important changes to protect the  financial integrity of the SNAP program and to make it more effective  for recipients. We need to be concerned that we cannot keep people on  SNAP forever who can work. We have to help people return to the labor  market and support themselves, despite what my colleague may believe.   I am pleased we were able to come to a consensus, finally, with the  Senate, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the rule and  the underlying bill.
