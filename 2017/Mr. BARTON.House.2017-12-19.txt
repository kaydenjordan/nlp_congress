 Mr. Speaker, I am one of the few Members that was here  back in 1986 when we had the last major tax cut before this body. The  President was Ronald Reagan and the Speaker of the House was Tip  O'Neill. They worked together on a bipartisan basis to cut taxes across  the board. The result was the economic growth of the late 1980s and the  early 1990s, up until the early 2000s, when we had 9/11. It is one of  the best votes that I have ever taken as a Member of this body.    Well, now we are here on another major tax bill. The problem this  time around is that there is no bipartisanship.   Why is that, Mr. Speaker?   It is not because the Republicans don't want to be bipartisan. It is  because the Democratic leadership this time around has just said no.   This tax bill is a good bill.   The distinguished gentleman from Vermont who just spoke is correct in  that it is not revenue neutral. But, Mr. Speaker, revenues are at an  all-time high. We are going to raise more money this year than we have  ever raised before at the Federal level. Let me repeat that: raise more  money than we have ever raised before at the Federal level.   Isn't it time to give hardworking Americans a little of that money  back?   That is what this bill does. It cuts rates for every working  American. Let me repeat that: it cuts rates for every working American.   No matter what your tax rate is today, under this bill, it is going  to be lower if you are an individual. If you are a corporation, it is  going to be lower. If you are one of these passthroughs, it is going to  be lower.   Every American who is paying taxes today is going to pay less taxes  starting January 1, 2018. That is a good deal. That is a good deal. We  are cutting taxes across the board for every working American.   We repeal the individual mandate under ObamaCare.                                time  1115    Unfortunately, it doesn't kick in until 2019, but we still repeal  that.   This is a good bill. It is a historic bill. It is a bill that  everybody in this Chamber will benefit from, regardless of whether you  vote for it or vote against it. So when the time comes this afternoon  to vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' I am voting ``yes'' for America. I am voting  ``yes'' for America's future. I am voting ``yes'' for every working  American who is paying taxes today. Let's put more money back in their  pocket. Let's double the rate of growth for the economy. Let's put more  Americans at work. Let's show some faith in the American people, vote  ``yes.''
