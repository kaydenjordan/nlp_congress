 Mr. Speaker, Helsinki will be remembered as the place  where GOP became shorthand for ``Government of Putin.''   Just as Trump surrenders to Vladimir Putin, these Helsinki  congressional Republicans surrender to Trump.   Trump's own intelligence chief, former Senator, lifelong Republican  Dan Coats, says ``the warning lights are blinking red again'' on  Russian attacks. Yet Helsinki Republicans refuse to act, providing zero  funding to the States to protect election integrity today. Their  refusal to appropriate a dime for state defense against Russian  interference really represents nothing less than unilateral  disarmament.   Enough excuses. Enough weakness. Instead of a President with no  scruples and a congressional Republican majority with no spine, we need  strong leadership, unafraid to protect our borders and unafraid to  protect American families from the ongoing Russian aggression against  our democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, here, the height of hypocrisy, the depth of  duplicity. While this administration relentlessly, baselessly, and  desperately attacks Federal law enforcement officials--the FBI, the  Justice Department, our intelligence agencies--again and again, these  same Republicans, so proud of law enforcement in one narrow area today,  are silent. They stand by tweet-addicted Trump,  [[Page H6491]]  our President who, even this very day, has again denied that Russia  poses any threat.   Where is your resolution to defend the Federal Bureau of  Investigation?   Where is your resolution to defend NATO, which has been disparaged by  this shameful President?   No. What we have today is a shameless, spineless group of Republican  congressional enablers who are enabling Trump, who totally ignore those  dedicated to defending our borders from Russian aggression.   These Republicans claim that we have so much more to fear from little  infants and toddlers who come across our southern border and seek to  escape gang and domestic violence and, yet, are torn by ICE from their  mothers' embrace, than from a murderous Vladimir Putin.   Of course we need immigration law enforcement and secure borders, but  this resolution ignores many wrongs of ICE: hundreds of claims of  harassment, sexual harassment, child separation, and an unresponsive  bureaucracy. At the same time that they ignore those wrongs, they  ignore the wrongs of Trump in impairing other Federal law enforcement.   Trump's own intelligence chief, a lifelong Republican whom he  appointed, warns that our democracy is under sustained Russian assault,  yet they are silent.   Trump is impotent in the face of Putin. We need to reject this  complicity, the Trump child abuse, and the abuse of Federal law  enforcement.
