 Mr. Speaker, a few days ago on June 4, we recognized  National Cancer Survivors Day to honor all of the incredible men and  women who have battled cancer and have emerged triumphant.   This year, an estimated 1.6 million new cases of cancer will be  diagnosed, and nearly 700,000 people will die of cancer in the United  States.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists cancer now as  the second leading cause of death. Fortunately, we are taking steps to  lower those numbers. Last year's 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan  initiative, authorized $1.8 billion in funding for the Cancer Moonshot  Foundation, aids in cancer research, and strives to increase the  availability of a wide variety of treatment options while also helping  to help prevent cancer and detect it at early stages.   Mr. Speaker, on National Cancer Survivors Day, we are grateful for  those who have won their fight against cancer, and now we commit to  honoring more survivors through research for new and improved cures.                            ____________________
