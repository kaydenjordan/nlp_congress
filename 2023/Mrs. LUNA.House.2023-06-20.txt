 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I seek  recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 521, censuring Adam Schiff, Representative of the 30th  Congressional District of California.   Whereas, the allegation that President Donald Trump colluded with  Russia to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election has been revealed  as false by numerous in-depth investigations, including the recent  report by Special Counsel John Durham, which documents how the  conspiracy theory was invented, funded, and spread by President's  Trump's political rivals;   Whereas, Representative Adam Schiff, who served as ranking minority  member and then Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence of the House of Representatives (the ``Intelligence  Committee''), occupied positions of extreme trust, affording him access  to sensitive intelligence unavailable to most Members of Congress;   Whereas, for years, Representative Schiff abused this trust by  alleging that he had evidence of collusion that, as is clear from  reports by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Department of Justice  Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and Special Counsel Durham, never  existed;   Whereas, for years, Representative Schiff has spread false  accusations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia;   Whereas, on March 20, 2017, Representative Schiff perpetuated false  allegations from the Steele Dossier accusing numerous Trump associates  of colluding with Russia into the Congressional Record;   Whereas, once again abusing his privileged access to classified  information, Representative Schiff released a memo justifying the  accuracy of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant  application on Trump associate Carter Page, of which was later found by  Inspector General Horowitz to have 17 major mistakes and omissions,  providing FISA Court Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer to state  unequivocally that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ``misled the  FISC'';   Whereas, as ranking minority member and Chairman of the Intelligence  Committee, Representative Schiff behaved dishonestly and dishonorably  on many other occasions, including by publicly, falsely denying that  his staff communicated with a whistleblower to launch the first  impeachment of President Trump;   Whereas, as part of his impeachment efforts, during a hearing on  September 26, 2019, Representative Schiff misled the public by reading  a false retelling of a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky;   Whereas, on March 28, 2019, every Republican member of the  Intelligence Committee signed a letter calling for Representative  Schiff's immediate resignation as Chairman;   Whereas, Representative Schiff hindered the ability of the  Intelligence Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities over  the Intelligence Community, an indispensable pillar of our national  security; and   Whereas, these actions of Representative Schiff misled the American  people and brought disrepute upon the House of Representatives: Now,  therefore, be it   Resolved, That--   (1) the House of Representatives censures Adam Schiff, Representative  of the 30th Congressional District of California, for misleading the  American people and for conduct unbecoming of an elected Member of the  House of Representatives;   (2) Representative Schiff shall forthwith present himself to the well  of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure;   (3) Representative Adam Schiff will be censured with the public  reading of this resolution by the Speaker; and   (4) the Committee on Ethics shall conduct an investigation into  Representative Adam Schiff's falsehoods, misrepresentations, and abuse  of sensitive information.
