 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  Valley Grove School District of Venango County, Pennsylvania, for truly  going above and beyond to connect with their students during the COVID- 19 pandemic.   Due to coronavirus, we saw school doors close across the country.  Many parents found themselves in unexpected homeschooling situations,  and the teachers of Valley Grove School District rose to the occasion.   In an effort to connect with students during the quarantine, teachers  and administrators created VGTV, a YouTube channel to share video  lessons and updates with children and families.   Videos can range from a music class piano lesson to a banana bread  tutorial from home economics or the early childhood education teachers  reading storybooks.   Teachers from all grades have gotten involved to contribute something  to VGTV. J.G. Resig, a high school teacher, said the project ``started  out just as a morale boost to stay in contact with our students and let  them know that we still care about them, even though we are stuck at  home.''   Third grade teacher Julie Plumer has used her everyday surroundings  to create informative videos for her students. For example, Ms. Plumer  has created a variety of videos about baby chickens she had been  raising to teach students about what it takes to raise and to care for  animals.   Content varies, but the thing that each of these videos has in common  are the dedicated educators behind the camera.   None of this work would be possible, however, without reliable  broadband connectivity. As coronavirus has transitioned most classrooms  to distance learning, the importance of broadband infrastructure has  never been more apparent.   Connectivity is something that many of us take for granted. While  there is broadband available in many areas of the United States, more  than 21 million Americans, including more than 800,000 Pennsylvanians,  lack access. It is imperative that we do what we can to address this  critical digital divide.   The CARES Act provided $100 million for the ReConnect Pilot Program,  which provides grants for the costs of broadband infrastructure  development and improvement in rural areas. The CARES Act also provided  $25 million for the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband  program.    These funds will certainly have an impact on distance learning in the  age of coronavirus, but broadband connectivity is crucial regardless.  We need to continue to make rural broadband and reliable broadband  infrastructure a priority long after coronavirus is a thing of the  past.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the dedicated educators of Valley Grove School  District for going the extra mile to support their students during  these extraordinary times.   They are hometown heroes.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my  support for H.R. 7175, the Paycheck Protection for Producers Act. I was  pleased to cosponsor this legislation with Representatives Joyce, Kind,  and Brindisi.   The bill is simple. It would expand access to the Paycheck Protection  Program for farmers and ranchers, folks who are no strangers to  economic hardship.   Many farmers and ranchers, particularly our dairy farmers, have been  deemed ineligible to receive PPP loans due to negative net incomes.  With this legislation, producers filing a schedule F will be allowed to  use their gross income rather than their net income when calculating  their PPP loans.   We owe these folks a great deal of gratitude for working around the  clock through the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the continuity of the  food supply chain. The Paycheck Protection for Producers Act will allow  these producers to be on an even footing with every other American  small business, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting our  farmers and our ranchers.                            ____________________
