 Madam Speaker, I am proud of the growing Iranian American  community in my district, California's 36th. I have spoken with members  of the community, and I have watched the protests in Iran.   I am increasingly concerned and outraged at what we are witnessing  from the Iranian regime. The violence, the oppression, the internet  blackouts, the large-scale incarcerations--these are egregious human  rights violations.   Over 7,000 Iranians have been arrested and, tragically, over 1,000  killed by Iranian security forces since November of last year.   This shameful use of violence by the state security forces, sweeping  internet shutoffs, jailing of journalists and protestors, these are  just the most recent examples of merciless attempts of censorship by a  regime with a long, abhorrent history of oppression and violence  against its own people.   We must support the protestors seeking nothing but their fundamental  human rights and civil liberties such as the freedom to assemble  openly, speak freely, and have an open and free press. That is why I  stand with my Iranian American constituents in support of bipartisan H.  Res. 752: to support the rights of the people of Iran to free  expression and to say, forcefully, that we condemn the Iranian regime  for its violent tactics to oppress its legitimate protestors.   To the Iranian people seeking freedom, democracy, and human rights: I  stand with you. The United States Congress stands with you. The  American people stand with you. We will continue supporting you as you  fight for your basic rights, freedom, and democracy.   That is why I urge my colleagues to pass H. Res. 752 here today.
