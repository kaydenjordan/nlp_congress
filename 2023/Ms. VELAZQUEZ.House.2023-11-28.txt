 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of the six bills we are considering today.  America's 33 million small businesses are the foundation of our  Nation's economy and account for two-thirds of new jobs. The Small  Business Committee has a long tradition of working together on behalf  of our Nation's small businesses. I am pleased we are coming together  yet again.   Let me start off by thanking Representatives Bean and Mfume for their  bipartisan work on H.R. 4666, which will help the committee fulfill its  oversight responsibilities.   SBA was a lifeline to millions of small businesses throughout the  pandemic. More than $1.2 trillion in economic aid was distributed to  help businesses keep their doors open.   During these unprecedented times, the SBA, under the Trump  administration, weakened and removed these internal controls in an  effort to disburse funds swiftly.   This resulted in roughly 87 percent of likely fraud originating in  the first 9 months of the pandemic, largely due to organized criminal  syndicates and transnational gangs exploiting the weakened controls and  stealing billions of dollars from the American people.   Upon taking office, Administrator Guzman strengthened internal  controls, and they remain in place to this day, but the damage was  done.   In order to improve our understanding and prevent future fraud, H.R.  4666 requires the OIG to send periodic reports over the next 2 years to  provide the Committee with detailed information that it needs to  conduct robust oversight.   Let me take a minute to commend our IG and their commitment to  rooting out fraud and abuse. I also highlight the need to fully meet  their budget request rather than make any cuts. Doing so harms their  ability to hold fraudsters accountable.   As of this October, their work has resulted in nearly 1,200  indictments, almost 950 arrests, and over 600 convictions. Almost $400  million in seized or forfeited assets and more than $500 million in  restitution orders have been returned to the American taxpayers.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4666, as amended, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations.    Mr. Speaker, while much of the focus today has been  about pandemic fraud, we must also be mindful of the stellar work that  the SBA did to help small businesses stay afloat throughout the  pandemic. Distributing more than a trillion dollars in economic aid was  a tall order for a small agency.   Today, we are seeing the fruits of their labor. Small businesses have  been recovering with unprecedented speed and success, and more  Americans are launching small businesses than ever before, with more  than 14 million new starts since January 2021.   Once again, I thank Representative Bean and Representative Mfume, and  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4667, as amended, which will  ensure any unused PPP funds are properly returned to the American  taxpayers.   The legislation requires SBA to issue guidance for financial  institutions on how to return PPP funds.   In May, the IG released a management advisory that said SBA's lack of  guidance, regulations, and ability to account for returned PPP funds is  an obstacle for anyone who opts to return unused PPP funds.   Unfortunately, this has led to confusion for borrowers and lenders,  leading some lenders to even inform borrowers that the SBA could not  accept funds. This bill will resolve the problem by requiring SBA to  establish clear and detailed guidance for returning PPP funds to the  SBA.   The legislation will also require the SBA to establish a process on  how to deposit unused PPP funds in the Treasury Department's general  fund.   I thank Ms. Salazar and Mr. McGarvey for introducing this bill to  enhance the PPP recovery process. The Federal Government needs to be a  good steward of taxpayers' dollars, and this bill goes a long way to  improve the Nation's fiscal health by ensuring the SBA has processes in  place to account for returned PPP funds.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey), the ranking member of the  Innovation Entrepreneurship and Workforce Development Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, the RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act requires  SBA to establish clear guidance for borrowers, lenders, and financial  institutions on how to return PPP funds. It will ensure best practices  are in place in the event of another global catastrophe.   I thank Representative Salazar and Mr. McGarvey for their effort, and  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I lend my support to H.R. 4668, as amended, which  requires the Office of the National Ombudsman to publish links to  guidance documents for rules that have been certified to have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.   Guidance documents help inform small businesses of regulations, but  they can be difficult to find. Having a centralized website with  hyperlinks to these documents will save entrepreneurs time and  resources.   This legislation builds off the One Stop Shop Act, which was enacted  into law last Congress. The new law requires the Office of the National  Ombudsman to create and maintain a centralized website with hyperlinks  to small business compliance guides.   I am pleased the SBA has their website up and running. H.R. 4668 will  add more useful links for small firms and give them tools to make it  easier for them to comply with Federal rules and regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Molinaro and Ms. Scholten for working  together on the POST IT Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Scholten), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Contracting and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   I understand that complying with Federal, State, and local  regulations can be onerous for small business owners. Small businesses  do not always have the resources that larger companies do to monitor  regulatory actions. That is why having a centralized website for them  to access Federal guidance and learn more about their responsibilities  under a rule is vitally important.   We shouldn't be fooled by antiregulation rhetoric. Federal  regulations can and do benefit small businesses and boost our economy.   Our jobs reports over the past 2 years attest to that. The Biden  administration is building an economy that is delivering for Americans,  adding more than 14 million new jobs since taking office. The U.S.  economy is experiencing a record small business boom, with more  Americans launching a business than ever before.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Molinaro and Ms. Scholten for their  bipartisan work in crafting a bill that we can all support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Houlahan, Ms. Scholten, Mr. Stauber, and Ms.  Tenney for their work on H.R. 4670 and getting it to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, well over a decade ago, I helped enact and implement the  SBA's Women-Owned Small Business program to better serve female  entrepreneurs and small businesses contracting with the Federal  Government. Unfortunately, setting up this program proved to be a  challenge, and it was delayed longer than anticipated. As of now, it is  up and running, and women-owned firms are certified by the SBA or a  national certifying entity to participate in contracting programs.   This has led to improvements in the program's execution and enhanced  its integrity. Most importantly, it has helped thousands of women-owned  firms compete in the Federal marketplace.   However, there are some aspects of the program with less visibility,  including and especially the operations of the four national certifying  entities working with the SBA. That is why additional oversight is  warranted, and this bill provides it.   This Small Business Contracting Transparency Act requires annual  reports on the WOSB certification process to ensure it is serving  female entrepreneurs as we intended.   Having this information is critical to further strengthening and  improving the program to meet the needs of both the Federal Government  and women-owned small firms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4670, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government routinely fails to  meet the goals of awarding 5 percent of contract dollars to women-owned  small businesses. While this administration has prioritized meeting  these goals and last year awarded over $28 billion to women-owned  firms, more can be done.   H.R. 4670, as amended, is an important step in that direction. It  ensures that we have the necessary information to conduct proper  oversight of the SBA's programs designed to assist women who start and  grow government contracting firms.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of this bill and appreciate the  bipartisan work of the committee to build in the HUBZone and SDVOSB  programs. They face issues as well and could benefit from the  additional reporting.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5427, which puts into statute  current rules  [[Page H5918]]  which prohibit anyone convicted of defrauding the government from  receiving an SBA loan.   Over the course of the pandemic, the SBA disbursed approximately $1.2  trillion in economic aid. The vast majority of this aid was a lifeline  to keep small businesses afloat during troubling and uncertain economic  times. Unfortunately, bad actors took advantage of the program early in  the pandemic when SBA removed or weakened internal controls. To that  end, the Biden administration reinstituted longstanding antifraud  controls and put new safeguards into place to curb the flow of pandemic  dollars to fraudsters, and they remain in place today.   Before issuing a loan, SBA screens applicants on the government's Do  Not Pay list and then checks its internal database for any fraudulent  flags or holds. While borrowers have an opportunity to clear their  names, the SBA will not move forward until the holds are cleared.   The bill we are considering today is closely aligned with the actions  taken by the Biden administration, and it will send a strong message  that SBA will not do business with anyone who defrauded the government.  With that said, the single most important action Congress can take to  recover fraudulent pandemic funds is to fully fund the SBA Inspector  General and give the office the resources it needs to go after bad  actors. In the last Congress, Representative Luetkemeyer and I  sponsored two laws to extend the statute of limitations for fraud in  the PPP and EIDL program to 10 years. Without additional resources, the  OIG will not be able to capitalize on these new laws.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan work of Chairman  Williams and Representatives Mfume and Bean, I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume), who is the ranking member of  the Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this bill prohibits anyone convicted of  defrauding the government with respect to the SBA's pandemic programs  from receiving loan disaster financial assistance from the SBA.   While there may be disagreement on the actual estimates of fraud in  the pandemic programs, it is clear we need to work together to protect  their integrity.   Administrator Guzman has taken steps to put strong controls into  place that would prohibit anyone convicted of fraud from receiving  financial assistance, and this bill will ensure those controls remain  in place with future administrations.   I thank Chairman Williams, Mr. Mfume, and Mr. Bean for their efforts,  and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5427, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4480, the Successful  Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans Act, also known as the  SERV Act, as amended.   Veteran entrepreneurs are powerful economic engines and job creators.  More than 2.4 million veteran businessowners employ more than 5.7  million Americans and contribute approximately $1.2 trillion annually  to our GDP.   With that said, one of the biggest challenges facing veteran-owned  small businesses is access to capital. Servicemembers report that it  can be difficult to build credit while serving in the military, and  studies have shown that a higher percentage of veterans are turned down  for loans.   The SERV Act requires GAO to conduct a study on the availability of  credit to veteran-owned, service-disabled-, and reservist-owned small  businesses. The study would provide a report on the obstacles facing  veterans, including the extent to which deployment and other military  responsibilities affect their credit histories.   Most importantly, it requires the SBA Interagency Task Force on  Veterans Small Business Development to create an outreach plan to  promote the many valuable programs available to help veteran small  business owners.   Representative Davids has been a staunch supporter of efforts to aid  veteran entrepreneurs. She first introduced this legislation in the  116th Congress, and it passed the House with broad bipartisan support.   As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and  Capital Access in the 117th Congress, she led efforts to make capital  more affordable for all small firms.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill to ensure Congress is  working to address the challenges veteran small employers face, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids).    Mr. Speaker, our country is experiencing a small  business boom and veteran entrepreneurship is helping to lead the way.   SBA offers a number of counseling and training programs that can help  them either launch or grow a small business. It is vitally important  that we increase the awareness of SBA programs and services,  particularly among veterans.   I applaud Ms. Davids and Mr. Alford for their commitment to our  Nation's veterans, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4480, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairman Williams for bringing these  six bills to the floor and for working in a bipartisan manner. I yield  back the balance of my time.
