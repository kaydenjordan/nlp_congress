 Mr. Speaker, the great poet and pioneer of righteous  rage, Audre Lorde, once said: ``I am not free while any woman is  unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.''   The year is now 2020, and here we women are, still in so many ways  not fully free, still shackled.   Today, I rise to affirm the humanity and the dignity of all women. I  rise in strong, unapologetic, righteous support of H.J. Res. 79, which  will strike the arbitrary deadline for ratification of the equal rights  amendment, an amendment that should already be the law of the land.   Women are strong, hardworking, bright, and resilient. We are the  backbones of our families, our communities, and our democracy. We do  not live in checked boxes; we live in an intersectionality of lived  experiences and identities. Our issues are everyone's issues, because  our destinies are all tied.   Tomorrow's vote on H.J. Res. 79 is a vote for the preservation of our  collective humanity.   Despite our commitment to hard work, both within our households and  on the job, we are still paid less than our male counterparts. In the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts, women are paid 83 cents for every dollar  paid to a man; but nationally, women are paid only 80 cents for every  dollar a man is paid.   Even worse, the modern-day wage gap disproportionately impacts women  of color, with Black women earning 61 cents, Native women earning 58  cents, Latinx women earning only 53 cents, and AAPI women making as  little as 50 cents per dollar paid to a White man.   In addition to pay discrimination, we face pregnancy discrimination,  discrimination in the criminal legal system, sexual and domestic  violence, and inadequate healthcare access.   But this isn't an accident. The American Constitution is sexist by  its very design. This country's laws have historically treated us like  second-class citizens, depriving us of the right to vote, to enter most  jobs, and to own property.   While some of these injustices may cease to exist, we still face  tremendous barriers to our full participation in society. With  tomorrow's vote, we have an opportunity to right this country's wrong  and to take a stand in the name of equality.   I am honored to be serving and representing the Massachusetts Seventh  Congressional District during these unprecedented times, where we have  a record 127 women serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. These  women are some of the fiercest table-shakers, justice-seekers, and  truth-tellers that have ever served in this august body, and it is my  privilege and joy to call them my sisters in service:   My sister in service Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has  faithfully served the people of Washington, D.C., for 29 years and  continues to lead in the fight for D.C. statehood;   My sister in service Congresswoman Katie Porter, who is fighting for  economic justice for domestic violence survivors who are financially  dependent on their partners;   My sister in service Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of the  Pueblo of Laguna Tribe, who continues to shine daylight on the silent  crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women;   My sister in service Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, whose unique  experiences as a Palestinian American have given a voice to unheard  Palestinians around the world fighting for their humanity;   My sister in service Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, who remains  clear-eyed in her fight for healthcare justice as both a nurse and  someone living with a preexisting condition; and   My sister in service Congresswoman Jackie Speier, for her leadership  on this issue and for introducing this critical joint resolution.   Tomorrow's vote is a vote for equality. It is a vote for fairness. It  is a vote to actualize the movements built on the backs of women.
