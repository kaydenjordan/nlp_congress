 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S.  11.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S. 11, a bill to       provide for an exception to a limitation against appointment       of persons as Secretary of Defense within seven years of       relief from active duty as a regular commissioned officer of       the Armed Forces.     Mr. President, I begin this morning with a very exciting  announcement about critical leadership roles in the Senate Chamber.  Three outstanding individuals are set to resume new responsibilities.  LTG Karen Gibson will serve as the next Senate Sergeant at Arms, while  Kelly Fado will serve as Deputy Sergeant at Arms, and Jennifer  Hemingway will serve as Chief of Staff.   The Senate Sergeant at Arms was established 223 years ago as an  outgrowth of the Office of the Senate Doorkeeper, back when one of the  biggest problems was making sure the Senate had a quorum. Today, the  Sergeant at Arms is the Senate's chief administrative officer and chief  law enforcement officer, so very important at this time. These offices  have the enormous responsibility of keeping the trains running on time,  while at the same time keeping everyone in the Capitol safe. As we have  seen in recent weeks, the security component of the role is immensely  important.   LTG Karen Gibson is the perfect person for this job, the job of  Sergeant at Arms. She has spent 33 years in Active Duty in the  military, much of it in the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence as a senior intelligence officer, where she supported U.S.  national security objectives in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Africa, Korea,  the Pacific, and across the Middle East.   She is ready to hit the ground running because since January 6, she  has been part of a weekslong review to identify actions that can be  taken immediately--immediately--to improve the security of the Capitol  and its Members. She is 100 percent committed to ensuring a safe and  secure working environment for Senators, visitors, Capitol employees,  Senate staff, press, and paying particular attention to staffers of  color.   Lieutenant General Gibson has a big job ahead of her, but I have  every confidence she will perform her duties at the same exemplary  standard she set over the course of her heralded three-decade military  career.   Kelly Fado and Jennifer Hemingway, meanwhile, are two of the most  recognizable faces in the Capitol, Jennifer having recently filled in  as the Acting Sergeant at Arms. Kelly has been part  [[Page S1000]]  of my team for many years, on the Rules Committee and in my leadership  office. She has helped plan, coordinate, safeguard, and execute  multiple Presidential inaugurations--and what a great job she has done  in every one of them--and Capitol-wide ceremonies in general. She has  been an indispensable resource to me and to my entire staff. I am very  glad that Kelly is taking on this challenge.   One other note that I am very proud of--I think we all as Senators  can be proud of--this will be the first time in the Senate's history  that the Sergeant at Arms' leadership will be comprised entirely of  women. I cannot think of a team better prepared than LTG Karen Gibson,  Kelly Fado, and Jennifer Hemingway.   To all three of them: Congratulations on your new roles, and thank  you for your many years of service to the Senate and to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the American Rescue Plan, as early  as tonight, the Senate will move to take up the American Rescue Plan, a  bill designed to immediately deliver help to American families,  workers, and businesses struggling under the weight of the pandemic and  to lay the foundation for our Nation's recovery, so needed.   Every day, we see signs of hope and signs of caution in our fight  against the COVID pandemic. As of today, in good part because the Biden  administration is really doing a good job, over 78 million doses of the  COVID vaccine have been administered in the country and over 100  million have been shipped--well ahead of the rosiest expectations at  the start of the year. Just yesterday, President Biden announced that  there will be enough vaccines for every adult in the United States by  the end of May--by the end of May--far sooner than most had thought.  Again, President Biden and his team are doing a great job in moving the  vaccine out quickly but fairly.   Still, the United States averages 66,000 cases of COVID per week.  That exceeds anything we saw last summer during the worst months of the  spread. So we cannot relax, and the need for the legislation that is  before us is stronger than ever before.   It is a similar story with the economy. There are green shoots, but  unemployment is still over 6 percent and 9 percent for African  Americans. The economy has lost 10 million jobs compared to a year ago.  Tens of millions of Americans report being thousands of dollars behind  in rent and utilities. As Treasury Secretary Yellen and Federal Reserve  Chair Powell have repeatedly warned us, our economy and its recovery  remain deeply uncertain.   There are bumps but mainly because of the stimulus bills we have  done. We did a bill in March, and the May and June numbers looked  pretty good but then sunk again over the summer and fall. We did a bill  in December, and the January numbers looked pretty good. But that is  not evidence that the economy is able to sustain things on its own;  that is evidence that the Federal Government needs to continue its role  to get us back on track.   We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go. The American  Rescue Plan is designed to build on our early progress and finish the  job, to help our country get through the final months of the crisis and  then, equally important, bring our economy roaring back.   We cannot go through the situation we did back in 2009, where the  stimulus wasn't strong enough and we stayed in recession for years. So  just because the numbers are not as bad as they were doesn't mean we  don't need a continued strong push to get us out of this ditch and go  upward and forward.   Now, we had always hoped that this very important work would be  bipartisan. Regrettably, it seems that too many of our Republican  colleagues are resorting to the same predictable objections they raise  about nearly every proposal supported by a Democrat. It doesn't matter  what is in the bill; everything my colleagues oppose is ``a liberal  wish list''. That is what many of them call it.   Let me tell you, this bill is not a liberal wish list; this is an  American wish list. When people want checks to help them get out of the  morass, that is not a liberal wish list; that is what the American  people want. It is an American wish list. When people want resources to  open schools quickly and safely, that is not a liberal wish list; that  is an American wish list. When people want assistance for the hardest- hit small businesses, that is not a liberal wish list; that is an  American wish list. Funding to keep teachers, firefighters, transit  workers, first responders in Red States and Blue on the job, it is not  a liberal wish list; it is an American wish list.   So many of the people affected by this bill are not liberals or  Democrats. They may be Republicans, they may be Independents, they may  be conservatives, but they are Americans who want some help to get out  of this morass.   Money to expand the testing and speed of the distribution of  vaccines, the cornerstone of ending this crisis once and for all--that  is not a liberal wish list; that is an American wish list. Everyone  wants the vaccine out there. Direct checks, as I mentioned, as promised  to Americans struggling to keep up with expenses, to buy their  groceries, medicine, to pay the rent and utilities--that is not a  liberal wish list; that is an American wish list.   I would ask my Republican colleagues to go ask their constituents  which of these things their constituents oppose. None. That is what the  data shows.   The American Rescue Plan will be the single largest anti-poverty bill  in recent history, with crucial assistance for American families,  particularly those struggling with the cost of childcare. It will give  tax breaks for low-income workers, so when they work hard, they can  afford the necessities of life.   So these things are ``the liberal wish list'' that Republicans are  talking about--support for schools and jobs and families and workers  and the vaccine? No way.   Ironically, the ``liberal wish list'' includes a whole bunch of  bipartisan amendments that were accepted, including provisions to help  restaurants, sponsored by Senators Sinema and Wicker; a vaccine public  awareness program, sponsored by Senators Cardin and Portman; and a  provision to better target direct payments, sponsored by Senators  Manchin and Collins.   Make no mistake, the American Rescue Plan is a very, very strong bill  that will move our country forward in amazing ways. It should come as  no surprise that support of the American Rescue Plan is coming from all  over the country.   Hundreds of business leaders--not the most liberal bunch--have urged  Congress to pass this bill. More than 435 mayors and State leaders,  Democrats and Republicans, have said the same: They want the bill. As  one Republican mayor from Michigan put it, ``The need is real, and not  just in Democratic communities.'' He went on to tell his fellow  Republicans in Washington who oppose the bill to ``talk to some of the  Republican mayors.''   But if my Republican colleagues here in the Senate don't want to  listen to the words of their fellow Republican mayors and Governors,  they can look at the polls, which show the vast majority of Americans,  including a majority of Republicans, support this bill.   It seems like the only people who are dead set against this bill are  Republican Senators--not Republicans out in the country, not Republican  mayors, not Republican businesspeople, not Republican small businesses.   I guess all of this should be expected. COVID-19 is not a Red State  or a Blue State crisis. Our Republican friends should know that. It is  not a Democratic or Republican concern. They should know that too.  COVID-19 is a menace to all of us, and we should be banding together to  fight.   The economic crisis has affected all of us, and the plan that we are  going to vote on this week is going to provide real, robust relief for  all of us.   Whatever our Republican colleagues decide to do, the Senate majority  is intent on going forward and helping the American people with bold  action quickly.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
