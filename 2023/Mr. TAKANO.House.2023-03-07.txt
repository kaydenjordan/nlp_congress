 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 502, as amended,  legislation to ensure veterans can recoup the money they paid into the  Montgomery GI Bill.   Under current law, veterans who do not fully access their Montgomery  GI Bill can lose out on the payments they made into the program, in  some cases totaling up to $1,200.   The Montgomery GI Bill is in the process of being phased out for the  more generous Forever GI Bill. Many veterans may not remember the  $1,200 they paid into the program in their early days of service or  even be aware that they are entitled to a refund of the unused funds.  The process to reclaim that $1,200 can be difficult, and there are  times when the veteran can simply lose out on the money because they  waited too long.   This legislation eliminates that cumbersome process by making it so  that the veteran is repaid, no questions asked.   The bill is fully offset, and it is supported by the veterans service  organizations community, including by Student Veterans of America.   I thank Representative Banks for his work on this legislation and the  VSO community for bringing this issue to our committee. We were able to  pass this legislation under the House last fall, but unfortunately, the  Senate was unable to consider it. That is why I am thankful we can  consider this bill early in 2023, giving our colleagues in the Senate  plenty of time to complete it. No disrespect to the Senate, Mr.  Speaker.   I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this legislation to  ensure no veteran loses out on what is owed to them, and I certainly  hope that Members of the House who aspire to be Senators will remember  what it is like to be a House Member and make sure this never happens  again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me to pass H.R. 502,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 753, as amended, the VA COST  SAVINGS Enhancements Act. This bill will require the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to develop an analytical model to compare the costs of  off-site versus on-site regulated medical waste treatment.   The VA will further be required to install on-site regulated medical  waste treatment systems at VA facilities that would realize cost  savings within a 5-year period.   Regulated medical waste is any type of waste generated by healthcare  facilities that may be contaminated by blood, bodily fluids, or other  potentially infectious materials. There are Federal and State  requirements governing how it must be handled and how it may be  transported given the infection transmission risks it poses.   On-site regulated medical waste sterilization systems would enable VA  medical facilities to treat and compact this waste before it is  transported off-site for disposal. There are potential cost savings  associated with being able to sterilize and compact medical waste  before it is taken off-site.   Trucking costs are higher for untreated medical waste because of all  the precautions that must be taken to comply with applicable State and  Federal regulations when transporting it, and because it takes more  trucks to move the waste if it is not compacted first.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 753, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H1126]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 815, the RELIEVE Act, as  amended, which is sponsored by Representative McMorris Rodgers and  cosponsored by our committee members, Representatives Pappas and  Bergman.   It will address a gap for a small population of veterans who first  enrolled in VA healthcare within the last 60 days to be covered for  emergency care in the community, even if they have not received any  services from a VA provider.   Existing VA authorities for coverage of emergency care in the  community are extremely complex. They are also not well understood by  veterans, who often end up blindsided by massive medical bills that  they can't afford.   Under current law, VA can only cover emergency care in the community  for a nonservice-connected condition if the veteran was enrolled in VA  healthcare and had used VA care within the 24 months before the  emergency care episode.   This bill would make an exception for veterans who first enrolled in  VA healthcare within 60 days before their emergency care episode. Such  veterans may not have had a reason to use VA care yet or they may have  experienced a wait time for a routine appointment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 815,  as amended, which will help ensure veterans who are new to VA  healthcare will be covered for unexpected medical emergencies.   I also highlight a new meaningful benefit for veterans who are  experiencing acute suicidal crises. It is important for veterans and  their families and caregivers to know that VA has now implemented  legislation I championed to remove cost from the equation when veterans  are in imminent risk of self-harm.   VA will now fully cover up to 30 days of inpatient or residential  care or up to 90 days of outpatient care for veterans who are  experiencing an acute suicidal crisis, regardless of whether the  veteran has ever enrolled in or used VA healthcare benefits. Any  veteran experiencing a mental health crisis should call 988 and press 1  to speak with a trained professional from the Veterans Crisis Line.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), the ranking  [[Page H1127]]  member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing, let  me just say, it was a delight to join my colleague from Michigan at the  Joni Mitchell concert and stand up and participate in ``Big Yellow  Taxi,'' which is his favorite song.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1226, as amended, the Wounded  Warrior Access Act introduced by my good friend, neighbor, and chair of  the House Democratic Caucus, Representative Pete Aguilar.   This bill would require VA to establish and maintain a secure  internet-based portal to establish a claimant or their representative  to make records requests related to VA claims and benefits.   Additionally, this bill contains a provision requiring VA to warn  claimants about benefit scammers, provide a way to report potentially  fraudulent activity, and provide a tool for claimants to search for  accredited representation.   Currently, to make records requests related to VA claims and  benefits, veterans or designated representatives must submit a Freedom  of Information Act, otherwise known as a FOIA, or Privacy Act request.   Submitting this form, followed by waiting for it to upload into an  individual's electronic claims file, and then awaiting action on the  request can be time consuming and can negatively impact a claimant's  ability to understand what records VA is evaluating and what  information could better assist in a claim's positive adjudication.   Establishing and maintaining a secure, internet-based portal to  enable a claimant or their representative to make records requests  related to VA claims and benefits would modernize this essential  process and assist in more timely, positive claim outcomes.   This bill would also add another tool in the toolbox for veterans  when navigating the complexities of the claims process and will help  veterans gain a little more autonomy over their claim.   It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar), my good friend who serves on the House  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I again ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 1226, as amended, the Wounded Warrior Access Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
