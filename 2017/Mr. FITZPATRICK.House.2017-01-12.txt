 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the very first time in  this Chamber as a servant of Pennsylvania's Eighth District--the good  people of Bucks and Montgomery Counties--serving as their independent  voice. The weight of this responsibility should not be lost on any of  us. It is my sincere hope that each one of us here--regardless of where  we come from or what our past experiences have been or how long we have  been here--will do what the American people are demanding of us at this  time: to work together as problem-solvers, not work against each other  as ideologues.   Our Founders envisioned citizen legislators chosen from their peers  to work on their behalf and to serve honorably with a focus on  solutions, and then return home and live under the laws they helped  pass, making way for a new generation of leadership with new ideas and  a fresh perspective. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we as a nation have  strayed from that vision.   Today too many Americans feel left out. They see a system that does  more to preserve the status quo than it does to solve our most pressing  challenges. They see a class of career politicians and elite insiders.  I wish I could tell my constituents--my bosses--that this problem is  exaggerated and that this mess in Washington doesn't affect them or  their families or their businesses.   But as a former anticorruption FBI special agent, I have seen the  brokenness in our system, and I know the real-life impact that it has,  which is both soft and hard corruption that tilts the legislative  agenda towards special interests, electoral complacency that allows  lawmakers to focus on accumulating power rather than serving their  constituents, and an entrenched partisanship that grinds the gears of  government to a halt.   Mr. Speaker, this does not have to be the fate of this Congress. It  does not. The 115th Congress can be remembered as the one that buried  party labels for good and focused on fixing the system. To that end, I  have introduced legislative proposals to begin that process: a  constitutional amendment enacting term limits for all Members of  Congress and a constitutional amendment preventing Members of Congress  from being paid unless a budget is passed.  [[Page H398]]  This is not just withholding payment for a period of time; this is a  complete forfeiture.   I propose a balanced budget amendment so we are forced to stop  kicking the can down the road and will create a fiscal path that will  allow the next generation to thrive.   I also have a bill I call the Citizen Legislature Anti-Corruption  Reform Act, or CLEAN Act, a bill that ends congressional pensions for  life and requires this body to debate and act on single-issue  legislation, codify that all laws passed by Congress apply to all of  its Members, reform the broken gerrymandering process by moving all  redistricting to independent, nonpartisan, citizen commissions, and to  expand access to political party primaries to include both independents  and nonaffiliated voters.   Is there anyone in this Chamber who does not believe that these  measures will make our country a better place? Is there anyone in this  Chamber who does not believe these measures will result in a healthier  democracy and a system of government where our people have more faith  and trust in? Is there anyone here who believes that more citizens  serving in this body and more citizens participating in their  government would not be a breath of fresh air for our Nation?   If you agree with our ideas, I urge you to join me and cosponsor  these measures, join the Congressional Citizen Legislature Caucus, and  advocate for these reforms. Share your vision with your constituents  because they need to know that our Nation is not resigned to the status  quo.   Mr. Speaker, Washington needs fewer politicians and more independent  voices focused on serving the American people. That is the reason we  are here. Let's not let them down. The time is now to answer their call  to fix this system so we can start addressing the challenges that we  face as a nation.                            ____________________
