 Mr. Speaker, I first thank my chairs, Mr.  DeFazio and Ms. Norton, for their leadership.   I rise today in support of the Moving Forward Act, an investment in  America's infrastructure now that will secure America's future today,  an infrastructure that supports America's growing communities and  invests in America's local economies. This is an investment that will  create millions of jobs, an investment in a smart system of  infrastructure equal to the needs of the 21st century.   Today, we make a $6.2 billion investment in Maryland's roads and  transits. We increase investments in safety and reliability on  Washington's Metro transit system. We reauthorize the Disadvantaged  Business Enterprise program to ensure greater opportunities for women-  and minority-owned small businesses that want to compete for Federal  transportation contract dollars.   Mr. Speaker, rebuilding America shouldn't be a partisan issue. The  Moving Forward Act is an equal opportunity investment in America.
