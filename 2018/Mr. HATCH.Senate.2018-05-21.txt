 Mr. President, I am here today to discuss new legislation  to help Puerto Rico gain a stronger fiscal footing, but before turning  to that, I would like to make a few comments regarding the current  NAFTA trade talks.   Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot of discussion in the  press about potential deadlines for concluding negotiations on NAFTA.  While speculation about timelines is natural, let me be clear. As I  have said from the beginning of these talks, the most important thing  for determining when and how Congress will vote on an eventual North  American Free Trade Agreement outcome is the quality of the agreement.   I understand that the current negotiations are about an existing  agreement that American businesses and workers rely on in dealing with  two of our largest trading partners. I understand that continuing  negotiations means a level of uncertainty about these important  relationships will continue to persist. Nevertheless, it is critical  that the administration take the time necessary to get these  negotiations right. I believe the administration understands that.   A modernized NAFTA will help American businesses and workers only if  it includes strong and enforceable protections for America's creators  and innovators, supports cross-border data flows, and maintains and  expands market access for American goods and services exporters to the  Canadian and Mexican markets.   The bottom line: Substance is what matters, and we should not allow  other considerations to impede achieving our goals.   I am confident that with continued discussions between the United  States, Canada, and Mexico, we can create a strong agreement that will  meet the high standards set by Congress in trade promotion authority. I  will continue to support the administration in achieving that outcome.
