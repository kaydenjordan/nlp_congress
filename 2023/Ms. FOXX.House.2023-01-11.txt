 Mr. Speaker, our postsecondary education system is in dire  straits. Reforms are more necessary now than ever.   To start with, income-driven repayment plans have left millions of  borrowers trapped under a mountain of interest. Many of these borrowers  have done everything right.   They have been faithful to make their monthly payments, yet years  later find they have made little to no progress on their principal.  This can be extremely frustrating, especially for those who realize  they have already paid back the original cost of the loan. This is the  kind of problem that needs to be fixed.   It is critical that we address the structural problems that plague  our postsecondary education financing system for the students of  tomorrow, but it is also crucial that we address the problems it has  caused for the students who have already been harmed today.   That is why House Republicans put in the work and offered a solution  that fixes this broken system. That solution begins with the REAL  Reforms Act.   This legislation protects the interests of students and taxpayers by  providing targeted relief for borrowers currently struggling while  implementing lasting reforms to ensure it doesn't happen to future  borrowers.   This legislation also implements reforms to simplify the number of  repayment options and caps unlimited graduate lending while ensuring  college remains accessible and affordable to all Americans, regardless  of their financial circumstances.   It also saves taxpayers billions by eliminating runaway forgiveness  programs that disproportionately benefit wealthier households.   Together, these reforms will lower the cost of college for students,  families, and taxpayers.   In contrast, President Biden's radical student loan bailout will  exacerbate tuition inflation while encouraging students to go deeper  into debt.   Blanket loan cancellation to the tune of $400 billion and enacting  retroactive free college by expanding what were intended to be limited  safety nets is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible.   Republicans and Democrats agree on the problems, and we must come  together to work toward a solution.   For example, everyone agrees that postsecondary education should  provide students and taxpayers a positive return on investment.   There is bipartisan consensus that the cost of nonrepayment can no  longer fall squarely on taxpayers.   For far too long, colleges have been more focused on getting students  in the door and have paid little mind to what happens once they are  there or once they leave.   Again, there is bipartisan consensus that this too needs to change.  It is time for Congress to come together and fix the mess created by  these failed policies.   My Republican colleagues and I stand ready to work with the President  and congressional Democrats to do so.                          Republicans Stand for Life     Mr. Speaker, House Republicans remain undeterred in our  mission to protect the sanctity of human life and the rights of the  unborn.   Today, we will pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  and H. Con. Res. 3, which condemns violence against pro-life  institutions and groups. By passing these two pieces of legislation, we  are fulfilling the commitment we made to the American people to  preserve a future that is built on freedom.   Over the last 2 years, the American people witnessed unprecedented  attacks both on the unborn and those who stand for life. Today, we are  turning that tide. House Republicans are sending a unified message to  the entire country and the world: Our new House majority stands for  life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for  yielding. Just a couple of minutes ago we heard a speaker on the other  side of the aisle criticize Republicans saying we don't support wearing  masks, and wearing masks affects others; however, having an abortion  affects only a woman.   So what is an abortion? What is an abortion?   It is the intentional taking of the life of an unborn child.   How in the world can you say that an abortion does not affect anyone  except the woman?   That is the core of the difference between those of us who support  unborn children and born children.   Those who support abortions ignore the fact that another life is  involved. That is the core of the issue. There are two lives involved  here, the mother and the unborn baby. We must recognize that.
