 Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I have to  ask myself, why now? Why does the junior Senator from Missouri bring  this bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate today?   When you think back, this matter has been considered. Originally, the  guidelines were considered in 1984. The question of child pornography  came back to us in 2003.   In 2005, there was a Supreme Court case about applying the guidelines  on sentencing to these types of cases--a case known as Booker. We know  that in 2005, that decision was handed down.   We know that in 2012, the Sentencing Commission said to Congress and  to the world that you need to do something here. These guidelines that  you promulgated don't reflect the reality of today.   We know, as well, that the guidelines were written--some were written  in an era when the materials we are talking about were physical  materials. And we now live in the world of internet and access to not  just tens and hundreds but thousands of images, if that is your  decision.   And all these things have happened, and we come here today--today. I  don't know exactly how many years the Senator from Missouri has been in  the Senate, but to my knowledge, this is his first bill on this subject  that he has presented in the last few weeks. And I wonder why--why now?   Are there valid questions about sentencing guidelines? Certainly,  there is no question about it. I said as much, and he quoted me.   The Sentencing Commission told us over a decade ago, in 2012: You  have got a problem here. The world has changed, and the law doesn't  reflect it.   But this is the first time, to my knowledge, that the Senator from  Missouri or any Republican Senator has tried to enact legislation on  the subject. Why now? Well, I know why. He said as much. It is because  we are now considering the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to  the Supreme Court.   This Senator has suggested over the course of the last 2 weeks in  hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee that somehow this  judge--this judge who is aspiring to the Supreme Court--is out of the  mainstream when it comes to sentencing in child pornography cases.   It is no coincidence that the Senator from Missouri comes to the  floor today while Judge Jackson's nomination is pending on the Senate  calendar. It was discharged from our committee by a bipartisan vote in  the Senate last night. It is no coincidence that he is raising this  issue within hours or days before her confirmation vote. It is one  more, very transparent attempt to link Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's  confirmation with this highly emotional issue of Federal sentencing  when it comes to child pornography or child exploitation.   There are some political groups--at least one well-known political  group--that manufacture theories about child pornography, pedophilia,  and the like and that even inspire deadly reactions to them, and they  are cheering this on. I have seen their reactions already, this  morning, in the newspaper. They are watching this and hoping that  someone can keep this issue alive on the floor of the U.S. Senate--for  them.   The Senator from Missouri has even gone so far as to make the  outrageous claim that this woman, Judge Jackson--the mother of two  wonderful girls, whom I had a chance to meet, a mother who comes to  this issue not only as a judge but as the sister and niece of law  enforcement officials who have been part of her family--in the words of  the Senator from Missouri, that this woman ``endangers children''-- ``endangers children.''    I will yield when I am finished.   One conservative former prosecutor called Senator Hawley's charges  ``meritless to the point of demagoguery.''   I have read so many reviews of the Senator's charges against this  judicial nominee, and not one of them gives him any credence. They  basically say: What you are dealing with here is a complicated area of  the law, a controversial area of the law, and to try to ascribe to this  one nominee these motives, these outcomes, is baseless and meritless.   Consider this: How can this judicial nominee possibly have the  endorsement of the largest law enforcement organization in America--the  Fraternal Order of Police--the endorsement of the International  Association of Chiefs of Police, and many other law  [[Page S1956]]  enforcement groups--how could she possibly have all of that and be as  wrong on a critical issue as the Senator from Missouri has asserted?   How is it possible that the American Bar Association took a look at  all of her contacts as a judge, as a lawyer, as a law student and came  up with 250 individuals who knew her personally, appeared in court with  and against her, judged her in her individual capacity as a lawyer--how  can the American Bar Association interview those 250 and find no  evidence of the charges that have been made by the Senator from  Missouri? How is it possible that they would review all of this and  miss such a glaring fact? They didn't.   They told us, under oath, that they were asked point blank: Is her  sentencing standard soft on crime? different than other judges?   The answer was no, no.   The net result of it was that the American Bar Association found this  nominee, whom the Senator from Missouri charges with these outrage  claims--they found her to be unanimously ``well qualified''-- unanimously ``well qualified.'' Yet the Senator from Missouri believes  that he has discovered something that the whole world has missed.  Unfortunately, he is wrong, and he doesn't admit it.   When Judge Jackson is confirmed to the Supreme Court--and I pray that  she will be later this week--it will be in part because she is a  thoughtful, dedicated person who has worked as a judge for over 10  years. She has published almost 600 written opinions. She has had 100  cases wherein she has imposed criminal sentences and a dozen-plus cases  involving children.   What the Senator from Missouri has done is to cherry-pick arguments  from one small part of her service on the bench that has been debunked  across the board. But let me say it again: Judge Jackson's sentences  were appropriate exercises of discretion as a judge in applying the law  to the facts in difficult cases.   It is interesting to me how the Senator from Missouri has carefully  drawn lines to exclude Trump appointees to the bench who have done  exactly what this judge has done as well--so-called deviate from the  guidelines when it has come to sentencing. In fact, one judge from his  State, from the Eastern District of Missouri, whom he has personally  endorsed as a good judge--and he may well be--has followed the same  practice as this judge. Did he raise that at all in the Senate  Judiciary Committee about the Missouri judge who was doing the same  thing as Judge Jackson? No, nothing.   There is nothing about these judges that is deviating from other- than-accepted practices. When 70 to 80 percent of sentences handed out  by judges across America are using the same standard, Judge Jackson is  in that mainstream, along with judges whom this Senator from Missouri  has endorsed.   If this issue needs to be addressed--and I believe it does--we can do  so if we do it carefully, and we should do it carefully. Make no  mistake, I don't back off from my words. As a father, as a grandfather,  as a caring parent, I sincerely consider this to be one of the most  serious crimes--the exploitation of children. I can't think of anything  worse.   The pornography issue certainly is out of control because of the  internet and because of those who are making a dollar on it. We should  take it very seriously--very seriously. It changes and destroys lives.  But let's make sure we do this in the right way.   What have we done in the Senate Judiciary Committee?   It is great for the chairman to stand on the Senate floor and talk  about the issue.   Well, what have you done, Senator?   Let me tell you what I have done, and I think the Senator from  Missouri knows it.   We have done what we can to address this issue from many different  angles. The committee held a hearing on the FBI's failure to properly  investigate allegations against Larry Nassar for assaulting young  athletes, Olympic gymnasts included, which enabled the abuse of dozens  of additional victims. We called them on the carpet. We put them under  oath. We brought the testimony forward. We didn't back away from the  issue of child abuse.   Following that hearing, I introduced the Eliminating Limits to  Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act, with Senator Marsha Blackburn,  a Republican from Tennessee. The Senate has now passed this bipartisan  legislation, which would enable those survivors of child sex abuse to  seek civil damages in Federal court no matter how long it takes the  survivor to disclose the facts of the case.   The committee has also unanimously reported a bill which the Senator  from Missouri knows well, the EARN IT Act, which is legislation he has  cosponsored with Democratic Senator Blumenthal that will remove blanket  immunity for the tech industry for violations of laws related to online  child sexual abuse material.   I make no apologies for our approach on this, and there is more work  to be done.   I want to tell you that I am tempted to leave it just at that but for  one part, one thing I am concerned about.   Our Federal sentencing guidelines have been advisory, not mandatory,  since the Supreme Court's 2005 ruling in the Booker case. This bill now  being offered on the floor in a very quick fashion by the Senator from  Missouri attempts to create mandatory sentencing guidelines for a  single category of offense. It is not clear whether it passes the  constitutional test of Booker. It could be a waste of time. We don't  need to waste time in a critical area of the law that has been so  controversial and has been considered and reviewed over decades.   Even so, it is a dangerous slope to go down. Imagine a world wherein  every time it was politically advantageous--whether it was a Supreme  Court nominee or a headline in the paper--that some Senator could come  forward, disagree with a Federal judge in a particular case, and say:  Let's pass a mandatory minimum sentencing guideline to take care of the  matter.   That is no way to approach the law in a fashion that is used for  deterrence and punishment. We need to be thoughtful about it. A subject  of this seriousness, of this gravity, deserves more than a driveby on  the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I invite my colleague to do his work on this issue as we all should-- the work that is required, the work that is required by the seriousness  of this matter.   I object.    Mr. President, after 27 minutes of debate on the floor of  the Senate, the Senator now believes we are prepared to change the law  that has been debated for decades. He has put in a bill introduced 7  days ago. It has been 7 days he has had passion for this issue--enough  to introduce legislation.   If you want to take on a serious issue, take it on seriously, and  that means doing the homework on it. Yes, have a hearing. Of course,  have a hearing. We want to make sure the people from the Sentencing  Commission and others are part of this conversation. It isn't just a  matter of throwing charges out against a nominee.   If you want to be serious about it, then admit the obvious: In 70 to  80 percent of cases involving child sexual abuse material, Federal  judges struggle with the same sentencing that we have set down. In  light of Supreme Court decisions, we understand--I ask for order, Mr.  President.    Mr. President, I will say, as far as I am concerned, this  is a serious matter that should be taken seriously. You don't become an  expert by, 7 days ago, introducing a bill and saying: I have got it.  Don't change a word of it. Make it the law of the land. Make it apply  to every court in the land.   No. We are going to do this seriously. We are going to do it the  right way, and we are going to tackle an issue that has been avoided  for more than two decades, when you look at the history of it.   I find this reprehensible--the pornography, this exploitation of  children--and there are no excuses whatsoever, but I am not going to do  this in a slipshod, make-a-headline manner. We are going to do it in a  manner that is serious, one in which we work with prosecutors,  defenders, judges, and the Sentencing Commission, and get it right. It  is time to get it right.   We wrote this law some 19 years ago, before the internet was as  prevalent in society as it is today. Let us be mindful of that as we  attack this problem and address it in a fashion that is befitting the  Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 129 Leg.]                                  YEAS--47       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse                                  NAYS--52       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schumer      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Wyden      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Menendez            Mr. President, Europe has seen its share of horrors over  the last century: the atrocities of World War I, World War II, as well  as the Bosnian war. Ukrainians, in particular, suffered under the rule  of Joseph Stalin. During the tragedy known as Holodomor, millions of  Ukrainians died of starvation--forced starvation.   In the wake of some--but not all--of these atrocities, the world  responded by bringing the perpetrators to justice. After World War II,  of course, there were the Nuremberg trials; and after the Bosnian war,  President Milosevic was charged with crimes against humanity by an  international criminal tribunal.   Sadly, now, in 2022, we are faced with the question: How will the  world react to the crimes that are now being committed in Ukraine?   Over the past week, we have witnessed the reality of Vladimir Putin's  genocidal rampage on the innocent people of Ukraine, and the scenes of  brutality in Bucha are seared in our collective memory.   Today, in Bucha, Ukraine, there are mass graves surrounded by bodies  hastily shoved into garbage bags, civilian cars crushed like tin cans,  and front yards and gardens lined with the dead bodies of innocent  Ukrainian people.   One survivor, Antonina Pomazanko, aged 76, watched helplessly as  Russian soldiers murdered her daughter, Tetiana. Without provocation,  the Russian soldiers opened fire on her home, and the bullets ripped  through the gates and fence as Tetiana was standing in the yard. She  was killed in an instant.   On Sunday, the New York Times ran a photo of Mrs. Pomazanko looking  over her daughter's dead body. Mrs. Pomazanko had covered it with  plastic sheets and wooden boards. It was lying in the same spot where  she was killed last month.   In the words of Mrs. Pomazanko:         There was so much shelling, I did not know what to do.    There is nothing that will fill the void of loss and despair that  Mrs. Pomazanko and millions of Ukrainians feel at this very moment, but  there is more--much, much more--that we, as Americans, must do.   The actions of Vladimir Putin harken back to some of Europe's darkest  days--the atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II, the  massacres of the former Yugoslavia--days that we must endure and days  which we hope we never have to relive. And as I mentioned, after the  Allied Forces liberated Europe in 1945, the world responded. It came  together at the historic Nuremberg trials.   When the trials first convened at the Palace of Justice on November  21, 1945, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson delivered the opening  statement.   He said:         The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so       calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that       civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it       cannot survive their being repeated.    ``Civilization cannot tolerate'' and ``cannot survive'' the war  crimes we have witnessed in Ukraine going unpunished.   President Biden recognized that fact on Monday in his calling for a  war crime trial for the horrors in Ukraine.   President Lincoln once said to Congress when he proposed an end to  slavery:         We--even we here--hold the power, and bear the       responsibility.    It is within the power and the responsibility of this body to deny  safe haven in America or anywhere to perpetrators of these heinous  crimes.   Under existing law, foreign war criminals who come to the United  States, incredibly, cannot be prosecuted. They cannot be held liable in  a civil action or even be deported for their heinous crimes. Currently,  the War Crimes Act only applies if the perpetrator or victim is a  U.S. servicemember or a U.S. national. In other words, it would not  cover the Russian officials who are responsible for the commission of  war crimes in Ukraine nor cover the Russian soldiers who committed  those crimes.    We also don't have a statute or a law in America making crimes  against humanity a violation of U.S. law. This was the primary offense  prosecuted in Nuremberg, and it was a critical tool for holding  violators accountable.  [[Page S1969]]    Other grave human rights violations, including genocide and torture,  are already crimes under U.S. law that cover any offender found in the  United States. This should also be true for war crimes and crimes  against humanity, and that is why I will introduce the War Crimes  Accountability Act.   The War Crimes Accountability Act will ensure the United States has  the tools to hold accountable the perpetrators of war crimes and other  atrocities. The bill expands the War Crimes Act to cover all war  criminals who are in the United States, regardless of where they are  from. It fills the gap in our criminal code for prosecuting crimes  against humanity so that we can hold perpetrators who come to this  country accountable.   This is not just a hypothetical idea. Consider one example: After the  massacre of thousands of innocent men and boys in the Srebrenica  massacre, a war criminal named Marko Boskic made his way to the United  States. When law enforcement tracked him down, they could only charge  him with visa fraud, not a war crime or crimes against humanity. We  must bring war criminals to justice for their horrific crimes, not slap  them on the wrist with a visa technicality.   The United States must never again provide safe haven for  perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Our Nation led  the first prosecutions for crimes in the Nuremberg trials. It is time  for the United States to lead again.   Ultimately, the day will come when Vladimir Putin faces justice, and  his name and his regime will be remembered in history alongside the  worst of the worst. Until Putin and his sycophants are brought to  justice, we cannot waver--we cannot equivocate--in providing Ukraine  with all the resources, weapons, and aid they need to triumph over  Russia.   Quite simply, the United States of America should never be a safe  haven for a war criminal. The United States of America should be  holding war criminals responsible for their horrible conduct and what  they have done to the poor and innocent people in other places, and  they should be held liable on criminal and civil bases. That is what  this bill would do. It is an effort to move forward with the cause of  justice, but I hope it is only the beginning.   When nations around the world adopt similar laws to the ones which I  am proposing, we will make it clear that there are no safe havens left  for war criminals. They will pay a price wherever they end up, and that  is the way it should be if there is going to be justice.   ``Slava Ukraini.''   I yield the floor.
