 Mr. Speaker, we all know that we do not have economic  policies that set women up for success.   The pandemic has put a cruel spotlight on these challenges. In fact,  one out of four women has been pushed out of the workforce because the  care economy collapsed.   We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change this paradigm,  while supporting a tenuous economic recovery, by making transformative  investments in America's working women.   The Build Back Better agenda invests in childcare, paid family leave,  home-based care, universal pre-K, and the child tax credit.   There is no doubt that the Build Back Better agenda sets up women and  their families for short-term and long-term success.   And we all know that when women and their families succeed, America  succeeds.                            ____________________
