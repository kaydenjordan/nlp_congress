 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m.  for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning-hour and noon for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider several reform bills straight  from our Better Way agenda:   First, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Further Asbestos  Claim Transparency Act, sponsored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, which  ensures that only similarly injured parties can be in the same class  for purposes of a class action suit, as well as requires public  disclosure of reports on the receipt and disposition of claims for  injuries based on exposure to asbestos.   Next, H.R. 725, the Innocent Party Protection Act, sponsored by  Representative Ken Buck, which establishes a uniform standard for  determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a  lawsuit.   And third, H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, sponsored by  Chairman Lamar Smith, which restores accountability to our legal system  by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits.   Our Federal litigation system is plagued with broken rules that  unnecessarily harm American businesses and consumers. With these  measures, we will follow through on our pledge to take on trial lawyers  and crack down on lawsuit abuse through meaningful litigation reform.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider the Fiscal Year 2017  Department of Defense Appropriations bill, sponsored by Chairman Rodney  Frelinghuysen.    Yes.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We passed this bill last year, working together with others. You will  see the bill reposted, and we will vote on it next week.    It will come straight to the floor.    This bill reflects the 2017 NDAA, which passed with 375  votes in the House and 92 votes in the Senate.    It is not the exact same, but it reflects the work of  the NDAA. It is a bipartisan agreement. It is also--you will find as  soon as it is posted to read all the way through it--a reflection of  the 2017 NDAA bill.    That is very accurate. This is a bipartisan, bicameral  agreement based upon the 2017 NDAA bill, which, if you watched, had 375  votes in the House, 92 in the Senate.   As you know as well as I do, and we have talked many times together  about this, we cannot continue to have our military continue further  with just the CR. If you have a continuing resolution, you now are  saying that you have to fund what was last year. You can't go through  with what the future needs without putting together the appropriations  process. And this is what we are going through right now.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The gentleman knows we are working, in part, under the continuing  resolution short-term; but it is my intention, once we pass the FY 2017  defense bill, I will keep Members updated on the further floor schedule  of appropriations bills. It would be my goal to continue to pass the  rest of the appropriations bills.     I thank the gentleman for yielding. I always look  forward to your quotes.    Now you have gone beyond. You now bring in rumors. I  give you credit there. You have been here quite some time, much longer  than I. I agree with you, this is a very big issue. That is why, for  the last 6 years, we have had hearings because all those hearings you  reported, I would have wished you would have listened during those  hearings. I would have wished you would have been able to do a  healthcare bill that actually works. The essence of what the ACA did,  it was about exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid.   So my dear friend here tells me that was a big success. What do you  tell all those people across this country? In fact, one-third of every  county in this country now only has one health insurer. Humana just  announced they are pulling out. Because you love quotes so much, let me  read what the CEO of Aetna says: ObamaCare is failing. It has entered a  ``death spiral.''   With Humana pulling out, that gives 16 counties in Tennessee that  have no one to care for them. The expansion of Medicaid--I know you are  concerned about the budget, as am I--says within this 10-year window,  in the tenth year, it will cost us $1 trillion. You know as well as I  do that that is about the exact amount of money we spend for all  discretionary spending in government today. We watched the ACA create  23 CO-OPs. They were provided more than $2 billion. Eighteen of those  23 have collapsed.   So, yes, for the last 6 years, we have been holding hearings, we have  been listening to the public, and we have been working on this bill.  Yes, we will go regular order. We will have a markup in committee. When  the bill comes out of committee, we will take that markup, we will go  to the Committee on the Budget because it is reconciliation, and we  will bring that bill to the floor, just as the rules state we will do  that. We have waited 6 years to do this, just as we moved one last year  to the President as well, and he vetoed it.   We cannot sit and wait for this failure to continue any longer. The  health of this country deserves something much better. That is why we  have been spending our time, that is why we have been working on it,  and that is why we have been listening. We have had the wisdom to  listen, but now I promise you we will have the courage to lead.    Well, I would only like to end with this: I was here at  the same time. I know you have your history, and I have the history  that I remember. I remember seeing the Speaker at that time, now your  leader, say we need to pass the bill to find out what is in it. I  remember being here late that night. I remember a lot of people,  citizens around this building complaining. You know what? The saddest  part of all that, their fears became true. They didn't get to keep the  doctor or the health plan that they were promised. The premiums they  were told would go down $2,500, that didn't happen. They now find that  they don't have the care that they were promised. We have spent our  time.   You did make a statement that there are a lot of new people in this  building. I would argue that is a reason why there are a lot of new  people in this building, the ACA and the way you carried it out. That  is why we did not do that. You stipulated a little earlier, trying to  state about a 3-day rule. That wasn't your rule. That is a rule we  instituted and changed when we became the majority, Mr. Speaker.   So we will have regular order. We will have regular order. We will  take it through committee, we will have it open for debate, and we will  bring it to the floor because we promised the American people, and we  will keep our promise, just as the President, as you heard just this  week, talked about the reform. We will protect preexisting conditions.  We will make sure those who are 26 or younger can stay on their  parents' plan. The bans or lifetime limits, we will protect those like  we have always said we would. We will create a healthcare bill that  actually empowers the individual, not more government. We will actually  lower the premiums. That is the difference between us. We can have  those debates, and I welcome them, because I think history will show  your hearings and our hearings. But, at the end of the day, I want the  history to show who actually did a better job of providing health care  to the American people at a lower cost.    You are not on that committee, so you can look at it  when we mark it up.    No.    If the gentleman yields, I will answer his question.    It is similar to every other bill we move. They will  post it before they mark it up so everybody can see it and debate it.    Have you seen a scheduled markup? I didn't have it in  my list. I don't announce markups, but apparently this is another rumor  you may have heard.    I thank the gentleman for asking. That is a question to  the chairman. I simply provide you the schedule for next week.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   That is an action of the committees, and they will list as soon as  they are prepared to do their markups.    Will the gentleman yield for one moment?   The gentleman understands that this is coming through reconciliation,  and reconciliation is created through committee, not by submitting a  bill. So this is regular order.   I thank the gentleman for his concern, and I thank the gentleman for  the last 6 years that we have had concerns about this. I will provide  the gentleman with a number of hearings. In Energy and Commerce this  year alone, they have had hearings and they have had votes on markups  on improvements and changes to our healthcare system. If the gentleman  would like, I will provide those to him at a later date.   But when it comes to reconciliation, committees will move that. When  it goes through the committees, it will then go to the Budget  Committee, and then it will come to the floor. That is regular order,  and that is what we are following.    I expect to follow regular order. When a bill goes  through Energy and Commerce and a bill comes through Ways and Means, it  will then go for markup inside the Budget Committee, and then come to  the floor.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I just didn't know that 4 months later we were still going to  litigate who won the election. It has always been the electoral  college.   I know the gentleman likes to make a lot of quotes, but I think if  you take my quote and you look at the date and you want to go back in  time and you look at the polling, I think my quote is right. I think  the American people were at that exact same position.   You talk about consequences. The ACA has a tremendous amount of  consequences on the American public, and, unfortunately, they haven't  been positive. Some have, but the majority have not. That is why a  number of people today, one-third of this Nation of the counties,  1,022, only have one healthcare provider.   I listened to our President just this week right down this well. I  know you haven't commented about that or quoted anything he said there,  but I listened to other people who commented about that, people who are  on different sides of the aisle who I know did not vote for him.   Mr. Speaker, Van Jones, I know the man well. He and I philosophically  disagree. But he said that night, listening to President Trump, that he  became America's President.    So I just say to my friend across the aisle, Mr. Speaker, that I  think 4 months is long enough to decide who won the race, and we don't  have to come back to this. If we really want this country to come  together, I don't think that type of questioning on this floor is  productive. I think it is time to come together as one Nation and start  solving these problems, but not try to bring back up and litigate who  really won the election.    Mr. Speaker, if I could just tell my friend, when I  refer to a poll, I mean the main poll of election day. If I look at  what happened on 2010 and I look at what took place in this last  election, you are correct, one side campaigned on repealing and  replacing ObamaCare. This is only the third time since World War II  that the American public entrusted that to a Republican Party who have  a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, and the Presidency.   So, yes, that is the poll I was looking at; the same as what  transpired in 2010. That was the cornerstone and the foundation of what  people said in that last election.   We are moving forward on that our promise. We have been working on  this for more than 6 years with hearings, townhalls, and listening. We  are going through reconciliation, the regular order. So the committees  will mark up, send it in to the Committee on Budget, where they will do  a markup, and then it will come to the floor.   I thank the gentleman for his concern.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Yes, Mr. Speaker, we did meet with a bipartisan group of Governors,  and that was one of the discussions as well. It is not scheduled at  this time, but we will continue to work on that in committee. Our hope  is to be able to find a solution in committee and be able to move that  forward.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This is a matter for investigation by the House Intelligence  Committee. For years, we have investigated Putin's hostile  international actions.   Just so the gentleman does know, Mr. Speaker, this week, Chairman  Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff approved the scope of their committee's  inquiry into Russia's measures of targeting in the 2016 election. I  support this bipartisan investigation. I have great faith that the  committee will fully investigate all of the evidence and follow the  facts wherever they lead.   I know the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, made comments in regards to the  attorney general. Attorney General Sessions stated this morning that  whenever it is appropriate, he will recuse himself. I agree with those  remarks.   As far as the ongoing investigation into Russia, I would, again,  direct my friend to the bipartisan effort that is underway in the House  Intelligence Committee.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 4 p.m. on Monday, March 6,  2017.
