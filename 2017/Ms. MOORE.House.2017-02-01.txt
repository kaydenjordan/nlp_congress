 I thank the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong, strong opposition to this legislation  that seeks to overturn carefully crafted SEC anticorruption rules for  extractive industries.   Section 1504 requires that gas and oil companies that are listed on  U.S. exchanges to disclose payments made to foreign governments.  Congress mandated these rules in Dodd-Frank, and it was a bicameral  decision. It was thoughtful and bipartisan. There were multiple  hearings in both Chambers and a conference report.   These Dodd-Frank rules were the first of their kind, and they have  become the model for 30 other industrialized countries' own rules.  These rules have been so necessary because of the so-called resource  curse, in which we have seen countries--particularly Africa--that have  lots of resources, but there is widespread poverty because of the  corruption of these extractive industries. Surprisingly, these  companies have implemented them, and they are currently complying with  them globally.   Now, we have heard a whole lot of whining and, quite frankly, lying  about how these regulations have cost us jobs; but, certainly, the  Obama economy has created a lot of prosperity. In fact, Mr. Speaker,  investor advocates at asset management companies and civil society  groups that are fighting corruption and instability support these  rules. We should be supporting them. In fact, companies that have $10  trillion under management say that these disclosures help them manage  risk.                                time  1545    Now, I am not going to go into a long-winded explanation of the ills  and issues related to illicit payments related to extractive industries  to foreign governments. We know about them. I guess that we are  appalled by this vote, but I guess it's the beginning that we are going  to be appalled for the next 1,500 days.   It shouldn't be surprising, Mr. Speaker, that the friend and ally of  Russian leader Vladimir Putin--and now President Trump's nominee for  Secretary of State--Rex Tillerson lobbied against this very rule when  he was at Exxon. Specifically, he said it would hurt their Russian  operations. Transparency will hurt ExxonMobil's Russian operations.  [[Page H853]]    So the question has just got to be asked, Mr. Speaker: What does that  mean?    Mr. Speaker, just the implication that transparency is  going to hurt Putin's Russia is prima facie proof that we need these  rules.   What payments to Putin does Rex Tillerson not want shareholders and  the American people to see?   Today, we should be demanding more transparency and not less from the  most conflicted President and administration in history. We are now  trying to make transactions less apparent.   All my colleagues should reject this joint resolution, not only on  substance, but it is an abuse of the Congressional Review Act.
