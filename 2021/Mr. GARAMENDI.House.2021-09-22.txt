 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, the United States, Russia, and China are  aggressively engaged in a new nuclear arms race. The rapid development  by all three nations of new bombs, new stealth delivery systems, and  near total reliance on space for observation and communications makes  this new nuclear arms race far more dangerous than the previous arms  race.   Therefore, in an effort to slow the pace and to create time for arms  control negotiations to move forward, I rise to offer an amendment to  the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that pauses the  development and prohibits the funding for the Ground Based Strategic  Deterrent, the GBSD, program and the associated W87-1 nuclear warhead  for the fiscal year 2022.   This amendment also extends the service life of the Minuteman III  Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, which is in place today, the  current missile system that the GBSD is slated to replace, until at  least 2040.   My amendment also requires the use of nondestructive testing methods  and technologies similar to those used by the Navy for the Trident II  D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles.   There has been much debate over the ground-based leg of the nuclear  triad recently. I have frequently argued for a longer pause for the  GBSD program to help defer the cost of over $240 billion that will  occur in the next 20 years for not only this, but the remaining nuclear  enterprise monitorization initiatives and to slow the pace of the  ongoing arms race with Russia and China.   However, this amendment does not seek to permanently resolve the  question of the future of the land-based ballistic missile systems.  While that debate is of utmost importance, my amendment only seeks a 1- year pause in the funding.   Why a 1-year pause? The answer is because a short pause is practical  and prudent, given the Biden administration is currently undertaking a  new nuclear posture review, which is expected to be completed in the  early calendar year of 2022.                                time  1630    The NPR will establish the future role of the nuclear arsenal.  Further development of the GBSD, therefore, can occur after that time  period.   Now, before we spend billions of dollars in fiscal year 2022 on the  GBSD and the W87-1 warhead, and over $276 billion when accounting for  the total lifecycle cost on a nuclear missile system that is not yet  needed, we should wait until the President completes the NPR so that we  have a complete picture of the overall requirements.   This pause will have absolutely no impact on our deterrence  capability, now or in the near future. We know that the Minuteman III  ICBMs can be safely life-extended until at least 2040. We know that  because that is exactly what the Air Force intends to do with more than  half of that arsenal. The U.S., Russia, and China, as they rush to  modernize their nuclear arsenals, the tripwire is becoming more taut  each and every day.   Observation and communication satellites and systems are increasingly  vulnerable to attacks. All three countries are fielding stealth and  hypersonic nuclear delivery systems designed to evade detection. The  risks of a false alarm or a political miscalculation has always-- always--haunted the nuclear landscape, and they do even more today.   While we must recognize the need to preserve a safe, secure, and  effective deterrent as long as nuclear weapon systems exist, some  aspects of the current modernization programs are simply not required.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Oh, my good friend from Ohio, how often have I heard  you say that President Biden has been wrong so many times over the last  6 months. And, indeed, he is wrong in this respect, also. So let's  agree on that.   The fact of the matter is the extension of the Minuteman III for the  next 15 to 20 years is not more expensive than the GBSD. In fact, the  GBSD cost estimates compared to the Minuteman III are based on a 50- year period of time until 2075.   Oh my goodness. When did we last take up that period of time in any  of our cost calculations here? We don't. It is simply a false way of  addressing the cost differential.   It is, in fact, cheaper in the next 15 to 20 years to do a life cycle  extension when necessary on the Minuteman III missiles, and it is  entirely feasible to do so, as said by the military themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
