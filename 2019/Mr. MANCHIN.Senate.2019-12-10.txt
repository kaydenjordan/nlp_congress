 Madam President, Gayle and I would like to extend  our warmest congratulations and very best wishes to our very dear  friend Andy Pradella on his 70th birthday. What I have always admired  about Andy is his unparalleled work ethic and determination to learn  and serve, and to inspire those around him. I can't tell him how much  his and Joanie's friendship has meant to me and Gayle throughout the  years. They are like family to us. Together, they are both a match made  in ``Almost Heaven.''   While Andy wasn't born in West Virginia, he certainly is a West  Virginian in his heart and soul. In West Virginia, if you are hungry,  you will be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only give you  directions but will offer to drive you to your destination. I am so  deeply proud of the people of my home State and the values that make us  stand out from the rest of the Nation.   It is in that same spirit that I proudly recognize Andy Pradella as  an honorary West Virginian. No one fits this title better. He is one of  the most generous, kindest, selfless people I have had the privilege of  calling my very dear friend. He has provided so much happiness and  wisdom to the lives of those around him throughout the years, and it is  my wish that the memory of this special day remains with him just as  his guidance and influence will remain in all the lives he has touched.  Again, it is with the greatest admiration that I send to him my best  wishes on his special day.   Andy, please always remember that no matter where you are, you have a  home here in ``Almost Heaven.''                            ____________________
