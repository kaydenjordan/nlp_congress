 Mr. President, today I wish to propose a new day in U.S.  relations with the country of Cuba. With his recent imposition of new  restrictions, the President presented one vision of that relationship-- one that looks backwards and reverts to a failed policy of isolation  that has done nothing to improve the lives of the Cuban people and has  harmed the American economy. I would like to present an alternative  vision--one that looks to the future and at fostering the exchange of  ideas and commerce between the two countries.   It is often noted that Cuba is less than 100 miles away, but decades  behind the United States, in no small part because of the U.S. embargo.  Decades of the same, tired, failing economic policies left the Cuban  Government in place and only hurt the Cuban people and American farmers  and manufacturers.   As Cuban-American relations thawed under Presidents Bush and Obama,  the Cuban Government decided to try something different. Private  entrepreneurs are operating an increasing number of restaurants, taxis,  and other tourist-related businesses. Cubans are opening up their homes  for visitors to stay in and selling products directly to visiting  Americans. In addition, the government's grip on information and  communication is necessarily weakening as technology and the Internet  inevitably permeate the country.   The U.S. has come a long way since the 1990s and hardly resembles the  world of the 1960s. Our policies toward Cuba should reflect that  change. The U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2017 would completely remove the  architecture of sanctions against Cuba and establish normal trade  relations with that country.   I want to be clear that this is not a free pass for the Cuban  Government. I continue to have grave concerns about its suppression of  pro-democracy movements, but I reject the view that continuing to try  and ostracize Cuba will bring positive change. The past five decades  provide empirical evidence that it will not. I also reject the cynical  argument that the U.S. must choose between engagement with Cuba and  support for basic human rights and dignity. Indeed, if the past half  century has shown us anything, it is that smart, principled engagement  is the way to bring about greater economic and political freedom for  the Cuban people.   Just as important as what the embargo means for the Cuban people is  what it means for U.S. farmers and businesses. Even with the changes  made by the Obama administration, it remains almost impossible to do  business in Cuba. Cuba is a natural customer of the United States, but  restrictions on credit and travel, among others, have severely hampered  the ability of U.S. exporters to do business in the Cuban market. The  question is: What are we getting by surrendering a market that should  be ours to the EU, China, Brazil, and others? I am afraid that the  answer is nothing.   That is why I introduced the U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2017, to finally  put an end to the ineffective embargo against Cuba.

That morning, the eclipse will first pass  over my home State of Oregon, then sweep across the U.S., ending in  South Carolina. Millions of people across Oregon and the country are  planning on watching those few moments when the moon will cover the sun  and everything will go dark.   It has been 99 years since a total solar eclipse has occurred across  the entire country, and whether someone is 5 or 95, this may be the  only time they will ever see a total eclipse. It is truly a once-in-a- lifetime event.   This solar eclipse is a rare occurrence where the wonders of science  will come right to the front doors of millions of people. That fact  hasn't been lost on schools and science organizations throughout  Oregon. Educators from the coastal areas of the State to the mountains  of eastern Oregon have been working hard to use this eclipse as an  opportunity to engage students in the areas of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics, commonly called STEM.   One of the best science museums in the country, the Oregon Museum of  Science Industry, OMSI, has planned an amazing viewing party, with the  hope of engaging folks of all ages in the science behind the eclipse.  Oregon native Don Pettit, who is a NASA astronaut, will even be there  to share his experience of viewing eclipses from the International  Space Station. Over the years, OMSI has been a leader in getting  students excited about STEM fields. I am so glad the museum is using  this eclipse as yet another opportunity to get communities involved in  science.   Universities throughout the State are also doing their part to ensure  students and community members get the most out of the event. In  Corvallis, Oregon State University is hosting a 3-day eclipse event,  with astronomy exhibits and a series of science lectures. I also  understand that Portland State University, with the help of NASA, will  launch video cameras attached to high-altitude balloons, giving anyone  the ability to tune in and watch a live stream of the eclipse. Programs  like these are so important because they make scientific events more  accessible to the younger generations.   I also want to take a few moments today to recognize the local  leaders,  [[Page S4758]]  first responders, and the National Guard who are working tirelessly to  ensure that communities throughout the State enjoy the eclipse  festivities safely. These public servants have been a shining light in  making sure Oregonians and visitors alike have the best experience  while viewing the solar eclipse.   As the eclipse arcs across the country and folks from the West Coast  to the East Coast don their eclipse glasses to look up at the darkened  sun, it is my sincere hope that it ignites a ray of passion in students  throughout the country to explore STEM fields more deeply.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am, along with Senator Rubio,  introducing the Corporate Transparency Act of 2017. This bill will help  us end the abuse of anonymous shell companies by criminals who use  these entities to launder money, finance terrorism, promote sex  trafficking, and evade taxes.   Each year criminals use anonymous shell companies to carry out their  elicit schemes. Viktor Bout, the so-called ``merchant of death,''  utilized a vast network of shell corporations, several of which were in  the United States, including one suspected of having provided weapons  to the Taliban. Another anonymous U.S. company owned a large share of a  Manhattan skyscraper and used its anonymity to facilitate $4.5 million  in payments to an Iranian bank that was designated by OFAC as a key  financier to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missiles program. Anonymous  shell companies have been used to rip off taxpayers as well. In 2010,  Michel Huarte was sentenced to 22 years in prison after using a network  of 29 shell companies in several States to defraud Medicare, using the  entities to submit claims of more than $50 million.   Last year, the release of documents known as the Panama Papers leaked  from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca highlighted the use of  American shell companies to carry out potential crimes. Shell company  abuse is not just in occurring in offshore tax havens, but right here  in the United States, and this bill seeks to put a stop to that.   In the United States, company registrations take place at the State- level. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 directs the Treasury  Department to issue regulations requiring entities formed in the United  States to declare their beneficial owners--the real, natural persons  who control each company and benefit from it financially. The bill  would do this by setting minimum disclosure standards for States to  follow. If individual States choose to collect this information on  behalf of businesses formed there, then that's all that a new business  would need to do to comply. Participation by the States is completely  voluntary. If companies are formed in States that do not collect this  information consistent with the new minimum standards, they will need  to disclose their beneficial owners directly to the U.S. Treasury  Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.   Collecting beneficial ownership information at the time a company is  formed will offer the transparency law enforcement needs to investigate  these kinds of financial crimes. Under the bill, the new beneficial  ownership information would not be available to the public, but  available only to appropriate state and federal authorities. Finally,  the bill provides civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure.   The bill is constructed to exempt many legitimate businesses, and the  information requested is already provided by most companies in the  normal course of business. Collecting beneficial ownership information  at the time of incorporation relieves later compliance burdens for  legitimate businesses, while at the same time prevents illegitimate  businesses from operating in secrecy.   The House companion to this bill, H.R. 3089, was introduced with  bipartisan support and efforts to identify the true owners of shell  companies have the support of business groups like the Clearing House  Association and the B-Team, law enforcement groups like the Fraternal  Order of Police, and anti-corruption advocacy groups like the Financial  Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition and Global  Witness.   The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 is a much needed step in  stopping financial crimes and the abuse of anonymous shell companies. I  thank Senator Rubio for joining me in introducing this bill, and I ask  my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1717         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Corporate Transparency Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:  [[Page S4771]]         (1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability       companies are being formed under the laws of the States each       year.        (2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the       beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability       companies formed under their laws.        (3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability       company within the United States typically provides less       information to the State of incorporation than is needed to       obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does       not name a single beneficial owner.        (4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State       formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming       corporations or limited liability companies in the United       States, and have then used the newly created entities to       commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce       such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax       evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of       foreign corruption.        (5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and       limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes       have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial       ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony       by officials from the Department of Justice, the Department       of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement       Network of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal       Revenue Service, and the Government Accountability Office,       and others.        (6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money       laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on       Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the       ``FATF''), of which the United States is a member, issued a       report that criticizes the United States for failing to       comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial       ownership information and urged the United States to correct       this deficiency by July 2008. In December 2016, FATF issued       another evaluation of the U.S., which found that little       progress has been made over the last ten years to address       this problem. It identified the ``lack of timely access to       adequate, accurate and current beneficial ownership       information'' as a fundamental gap in U.S. efforts to combat       money laundering and terrorist finance.        (7) In response to the 2006 FATF report, the United States       has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their       incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership       information for the corporations and limited liability       companies formed under the laws of such States.        (8) Many States have established automated procedures that       allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability       company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online       application, without any prior review of the application by a       State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States       will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.        (9) Dozens of Internet Web sites highlight the anonymity of       beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices       of some States, point to those practices as a reason to       incorporate in those States, and list those States together       with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the       formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open       invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities       within the United States.        (10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all 28       countries in the European Union are required to have       formation agents identify the beneficial owners of the       corporations formed under the laws of the country.        (11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to       wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited       liability companies with hidden owners, to protect interstate       and international commerce from criminals misusing United       States corporations and limited liability companies, to       strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect       corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum       standards for and level the playing field among State       incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into       compliance with its international anti-money laundering       standards, Federal legislation is needed to require the       collection of beneficial ownership information for the       corporations and limited liability companies formed under the       laws of such States.

A bill to implement policies to end preventable maternal,  newborn, and child deaths globally; to the Committee on Foreign  Relations.    Mr. President, today I am, along with Senator Rubio,  introducing the Corporate Transparency Act of 2017. This bill will help  us end the abuse of anonymous shell companies by criminals who use  these entities to launder money, finance terrorism, promote sex  trafficking, and evade taxes.   Each year criminals use anonymous shell companies to carry out their  elicit schemes. Viktor Bout, the so-called ``merchant of death,''  utilized a vast network of shell corporations, several of which were in  the United States, including one suspected of having provided weapons  to the Taliban. Another anonymous U.S. company owned a large share of a  Manhattan skyscraper and used its anonymity to facilitate $4.5 million  in payments to an Iranian bank that was designated by OFAC as a key  financier to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missiles program. Anonymous  shell companies have been used to rip off taxpayers as well. In 2010,  Michel Huarte was sentenced to 22 years in prison after using a network  of 29 shell companies in several States to defraud Medicare, using the  entities to submit claims of more than $50 million.   Last year, the release of documents known as the Panama Papers leaked  from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca highlighted the use of  American shell companies to carry out potential crimes. Shell company  abuse is not just in occurring in offshore tax havens, but right here  in the United States, and this bill seeks to put a stop to that.   In the United States, company registrations take place at the State- level. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 directs the Treasury  Department to issue regulations requiring entities formed in the United  States to declare their beneficial owners--the real, natural persons  who control each company and benefit from it financially. The bill  would do this by setting minimum disclosure standards for States to  follow. If individual States choose to collect this information on  behalf of businesses formed there, then that's all that a new business  would need to do to comply. Participation by the States is completely  voluntary. If companies are formed in States that do not collect this  information consistent with the new minimum standards, they will need  to disclose their beneficial owners directly to the U.S. Treasury  Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.   Collecting beneficial ownership information at the time a company is  formed will offer the transparency law enforcement needs to investigate  these kinds of financial crimes. Under the bill, the new beneficial  ownership information would not be available to the public, but  available only to appropriate state and federal authorities. Finally,  the bill provides civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure.   The bill is constructed to exempt many legitimate businesses, and the  information requested is already provided by most companies in the  normal course of business. Collecting beneficial ownership information  at the time of incorporation relieves later compliance burdens for  legitimate businesses, while at the same time prevents illegitimate  businesses from operating in secrecy.   The House companion to this bill, H.R. 3089, was introduced with  bipartisan support and efforts to identify the true owners of shell  companies have the support of business groups like the Clearing House  Association and the B-Team, law enforcement groups like the Fraternal  Order of Police, and anti-corruption advocacy groups like the Financial  Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition and Global  Witness.   The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 is a much needed step in  stopping financial crimes and the abuse of anonymous shell companies. I  thank Senator Rubio for joining me in introducing this bill, and I ask  my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1717         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Corporate Transparency Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:  [[Page S4771]]         (1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability       companies are being formed under the laws of the States each       year.        (2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the       beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability       companies formed under their laws.        (3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability       company within the United States typically provides less       information to the State of incorporation than is needed to       obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does       not name a single beneficial owner.        (4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State       formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming       corporations or limited liability companies in the United       States, and have then used the newly created entities to       commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce       such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax       evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of       foreign corruption.        (5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and       limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes       have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial       ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony       by officials from the Department of Justice, the Department       of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement       Network of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal       Revenue Service, and the Government Accountability Office,       and others.        (6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money       laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on       Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the       ``FATF''), of which the United States is a member, issued a       report that criticizes the United States for failing to       comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial       ownership information and urged the United States to correct       this deficiency by July 2008. In December 2016, FATF issued       another evaluation of the U.S., which found that little       progress has been made over the last ten years to address       this problem. It identified the ``lack of timely access to       adequate, accurate and current beneficial ownership       information'' as a fundamental gap in U.S. efforts to combat       money laundering and terrorist finance.        (7) In response to the 2006 FATF report, the United States       has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their       incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership       information for the corporations and limited liability       companies formed under the laws of such States.        (8) Many States have established automated procedures that       allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability       company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online       application, without any prior review of the application by a       State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States       will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.        (9) Dozens of Internet Web sites highlight the anonymity of       beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices       of some States, point to those practices as a reason to       incorporate in those States, and list those States together       with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the       formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open       invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities       within the United States.        (10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all 28       countries in the European Union are required to have       formation agents identify the beneficial owners of the       corporations formed under the laws of the country.        (11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to       wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited       liability companies with hidden owners, to protect interstate       and international commerce from criminals misusing United       States corporations and limited liability companies, to       strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect       corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum       standards for and level the playing field among State       incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into       compliance with its international anti-money laundering       standards, Federal legislation is needed to require the       collection of beneficial ownership information for the       corporations and limited liability companies formed under the       laws of such States.
