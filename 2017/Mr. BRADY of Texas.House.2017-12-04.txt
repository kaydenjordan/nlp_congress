 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1 of rule XXII,  and by direction of the Committee on Ways and Means, I offer a motion.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this motion to go  to conference on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in voting to advance this progrowth, profamily tax reform  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the motion.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong opposition to the motion to instruct. Today, we are  moving to the crucial final stage in delivering once-in-a-generation  tax reform to the American people. The choice we face now is clear.   Do we want to stick with this complex, costly, unfair system that,  today, caters to special interests and drives American jobs overseas?   Do we want to stick with the slow-growth Tax Code that keeps our  economy in second gear and all but guarantees rising debt and deficits?   Or do we think it is time to go in a new direction? Do we think it is  finally time to provide our workers, our families, and our job creators  with a Tax Code that is simple, that is fair, that is built to create  jobs and leapfrog America back into the lead pack around the world?                                time  1915    Do we think it is time to get our economy growing again, I mean,  truly growing, where better jobs, bigger paychecks, and more  opportunity are available to people throughout this country?   Many in Washington say they support tax reform, yet every argument we  hear is about keeping taxes higher, keeping the growth of jobs and  paychecks lower, and keeping more of this broken Tax Code that is so  complex and so unfair to everyday Americans.   It almost seems too many in Congress are rooting against a growing  and prosperous American economy. Too many who claim to be concerned  about the deficit today joyfully added trillions of dollars to the  national deficit when it meant Washington could spend more.   When our friends on the other side took control of the House, in the  first year, they doubled the deficit. In the second year, they tripled  the deficit. They then went on a roll of $1 trillion of more debt every  year. In fact, they voted for a $1 trillion stimulus, absolutely unpaid  for, that did nothing to grow the economy. That was when Washington  could spend. But now, when it comes to letting families and our Main  Street businesses spend more of their own hard-earned money, all of a  sudden they say ``no.''   Come on.   If you ask my constituents in Texas, they will tell you, without a  doubt, it is time to go in a new direction. It is time to be progrowth.  It is time to leave this slow-growth status quo behind us for good.   Without a doubt, my constituents and so many Americans throughout our  country are rooting for a healthier, stronger economy and a simpler,  fairer Tax Code that allows them to keep more of their hard-earned  money. That is why, right now, it is time for us to come together in a  conference committee and finalize the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the  American people.   When the Ways and Means Committee started working on tax reform over  6 years ago, we knew this road would be long and difficult. We have had  our share of ups and downs along the way, but we stuck with it because  we knew the American people were counting on us. We know they are  counting on us now.   So, with this conference committee, we are going to come together to  give the American people the best of what our two bills have to offer.  At every step, we are going to ask ourselves:   How can we truly deliver the Tax Code Americans deserve?   How do we drive rates lower for families?   How do we encourage more investment in job creation on Main Street?   How do we bring jobs back to America from overseas?   How can we better support parents and students and homeowners and  retirees?   How can we make our economy stronger and healthier than ever?   How can we improve lives across our country?   We have all worked hard to get to this point in the process. I am  proud of the bill we have delivered in the House, and I want to  congratulate the Senate as well.   Right now, we are closer than ever to delivering on our tax reform  promise to the American people, but some of our most important work is  still ahead of us.   Now is the time for us to dig deep on behalf of the people we were  sent here to serve. Now is the time for us to come together in a  conference committee and unite behind one historic tax cut bill that  will help Americans in all walks of life.   This truly is the moment and the opportunity that we and so many  Americans have worked for and waited for and deserve. Now is the time  to seize it. Working truly together, I am confident we will.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to instruct  that kills tax reform, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that a family of  four in Michigan's Ninth District will save over $1,700 each and every  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Roskam), the chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee and a leader on  the tax reform effort.    Mr. Speaker, I would note that the average family  of four making $59,000 a year in the 35th District of Texas will see a  tax cut of over $1,100.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed), a key leader of the Ways and Means Committee who knows what it  is like to create jobs in New York.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the average  family of four in the Fifth District of California will see a tax cut  of over $2,370.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Rice), a key leader of tax reform who has a terrific accounting  and business background.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to remind the House that  a family of four in Connecticut's First District will see a tax cut of  $3,858 each and every year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert), a new member and a key member of the Ways and Means  Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I would note that a family of four  in Oregon's Third District will see tax savings of $2,256.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H9607]]         Mr. Speaker, that family of four in New Jersey's  Ninth District making $90,000 a year, two workers, will see a tax cut  of $2,044.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that the  median family of four in New York's 14th District making $63,000 a year  working hard will see a tax cut of $1,251.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to report that that  median family of four with two kids in the Seventh District of Illinois  making $73,000 really working hard where every dollar counts will see a  tax cut of $1,546.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to report that that  median family of four making $74,000, blue-collar workers in the 26th  District of New York, will see a tax cut of $1,562.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the median  family of four making $65,000 in Alabama's Seventh District would see a  tax cut of $1,311.   I would also point out that the Congressional Budget Office doesn't  score a tax reform bill. That is the Joint Committee on Taxation. That  score was available to Ways and Means Committee members the day we  voted on this bill and available, again, to House Members before we  approved it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I point out that a median family of  four with two kids in Washington's First District will see a tax cut of  $5,008.   I would also remind my colleagues that President Obama raised the  national debt by $9 trillion in new Washington spending.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that that  hardworking family of four in California's 38th District would see a  tax cut of $1,870.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that that  hardworking family of four in the 27th District of California will see  a tax cut of $2,249.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly), who is a key member of our Tax Policy Subcommittee and a  businessperson himself.    Mr. Speaker, I point out that a middle class  family  [[Page H9609]]  making $74,000, in the Fifth District of South Carolina, will see a tax  cut of $1,568.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to report that a median, hardworking, middle  class family in the Fifth District of Maryland, will see a tax cut of  $4,158.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind everyone here tonight that the first year  our Democrats took over the majority in the House, they doubled the  deficit. The second year, they tripled the deficit. In the third year,  it went above $1 trillion a year, and it stayed there until Republicans  took control of the House. My friends on the other side of the aisle  added $9 trillion to this deficit. But that was when Washington was  spending.   Today, we want to give people back control of their money, and, all  of a sudden: Whoa, wait a minute. Deficits suddenly matter?   I believe that claim is the hypocrisy in this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I would point out that a hardworking middle class family in the 12th  District of California will see a tax cut of $5,508.   I would point out as well that the claim that this is an attack on  the middle class and received four Pinocchios is simply untrue by The  Washington Post.   And while we are fact-checking, I will remind the American public  that President Obama did inherit a deficit. He inherited it from a  Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, and then he made it worse.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a clear choice. Opponents of tax reform make  this a clear choice. They stand for business as usual, special  interests as usual, losing our U.S. jobs overseas as usual, making it  hard for young people coming out of school to find good-paying jobs as  usual, and Washington having a greater claim over your earnings than  you do as usual. That is what the opponents of tax reform stand for  today.   Today is about no more of that. It is time to drain the swamp. It is  time to drain this Tax Code. It is time for a fairer and simpler Tax  Code that Americans deserve, to close loopholes and special interests  and lower tax rates so hardworking Americans can keep more of what they  earn.   Say ``no'' to the swamp. Say ``yes'' to a new Tax Code and a new era  of American prosperity.   I urge a ``no'' on the motion to instruct.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
