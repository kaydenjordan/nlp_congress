 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.   Madam Speaker, it wasn't part of my remarks, but from my standpoint,  when I was in Iraq, we found weapons of mass destruction, so let's just  make that part of the Record.   None of us want to be in a war with Iran, with Iraq, with anybody,  for that matter--and that includes the President. None of us want that.  And many of us on this side agree with our colleagues that this needs  to be updated to reflect current circumstances, current enemy  capabilities, and different tactics, techniques, and procedures used by  our enemy. But I wonder where my colleagues in this Congress have been.  They would have you believe that they were impotent, that they were  helpless, unable to do anything about this.   I listened to the Speaker's remarks, and she said the President  didn't inform her of the strike against Soleimani. For 8 years, Madam  Speaker, nearly 4,000 people were taken off the planet by the previous  administration. Do the math; that is over one a day. I wonder if the  Speaker got a call every single day that said: ``We are going to take  this terrorist off the battlefield.'' I highly doubt that.   The question is about how we are going to change the policy, because  like I said, many of us agree the policy needs to be updated. I would  hope that this Congress, that any Congress, has the courage to  understand that when we sent our finest into battle in Iraq, that they  are fighting two enemies, but we are only allowed to engage one.   Right now, as we speak, we have servicemembers in Iraq that are  depending on us to have their backs. But what are we going to do? We  are going to rip the rug right out from underneath their feet because  suddenly, under this administration, Congress suddenly has the courage.   I offered an AUMF 7 years ago and talked to my friends on the other  side of the aisle. They didn't want to talk about it at all, nothing.   Our servicemembers expect us to have their backs. We welcome the  debate, but there is no debate. This should be in the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, where we can discuss these very weighty issues. We are  looking forward to that; we want that. But, no, this is a coin bill  taken from the Senate and sent back over here with this put into it so  we would have no debate. They don't want debate.   Our enemies are watching, and they are waiting. They are waiting for  Iraq to become a free-fire zone, which is what it is going to become.   The last time, after the 4,500 untimely deaths of your American  citizens, the executive decision was just to walk away--no ramp down,  no policy, no strategy. Just walk away and leave the family members of  those who had lost their loved ones wondering: What was that for?   You know what we have learned from that, Madam Speaker? Apparently  nothing.   We want to do this, and we want to do this correctly, but this isn't  the correct way to do it, and we should not abandon our servicemembers  in combat.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shubhankar  Baliyan as the winner of the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for the  10th District of Pennsylvania.   Shubhankar is a student at Cumberland Valley High School in  Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and submitted the winning app called  ExciteMath. It is an application designed to help elementary-aged  students practice basic, mental math skills in a fun and engaging way.   In each level of the app, students are given a target range or sum,  that their final number must fall within and a specific number of hits  they must use during that round. The student must then maneuver around  falling numbers and select which to add or subtract from their sum for  that round.   A panel of experts selected ExciteMath as the winner for its  creativity, coding proficiency, and functionality. Through this app,  Shubhankar also demonstrated a desire to give back to our community by  helping children struggling with mathematics.   I congratulate Shubhankar on a job well done and look forward to  seeing his app displayed right here in the Capitol.                            ____________________
