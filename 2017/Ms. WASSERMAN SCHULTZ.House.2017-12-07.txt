 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution, which is yet again a complete abdication of our  responsibilities.   Instead of adopting fully funded appropriations bills or an omnibus  with an actual chance of passing this Congress, we remain mired in this  unbreakable habit of passing continuing resolutions. This not only  creates needless legislative and economic uncertainty, it costs the  government, especially our military, billions in wasted taxpayer  dollars. Moreover, this abdication reflects the Republican leadership's  complete abandonment of our values and the needs of our constituents.   For one, we have yet to pass the Dream Act. Despite widespread  support nationally and with growing fear of deportations, this Congress  has ignored the 122 DREAMers who lose their protected status every day.  These are Americans by any definition, and this is their home. I will  not stand by as this President cruelly threatens to send these brave  young people back to countries about which they have no memory.   When will this body fully address the horrific disasters that have  ravaged Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and  California? Countless communities, including my own, are anxiously  awaiting vital recovery assistance that only the Federal Government can  provide. These abdications are simply immoral. It doesn't end there.   Congress has failed to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program.  States and families across America are scrambling to find replacement  funds and healthcare alternatives for their children.                                time  1445    When did CHIP and protecting the health of our children become a  partisan issue?   My Republican colleagues want to add more than $1 trillion to the  deficit for tax cuts for big corporations and the top 1 percent, while  they are at it; but then they say we can't afford to spend a fraction  of that on healthcare for children?   These priorities are backward and morally indefensible.   Instead of protecting Americans from the scourge of gun violence,  Republicans are weakening our already feeble gun laws by passing more  legislation that ensures more deadly gun violence in our towns and  cities.   We need to pass an omnibus budget that doesn't threaten programs for  our veterans and children or make drastic cuts to the Medicare and  Medicaid programs that our seniors rely upon.   Instead of handing massive tax cuts to millionaires and powerful  corporations, we should pass a budget that supports education, expands  women's health, and provides real economic relief to the middle class.   In short, we have to break this body's obsession with promoting the  interests of the well-off and special interests, and ignoring the needs  of children, DREAMers, seniors, and the middle class.   This continuing resolution does nothing more than provide another  short-term fix for the Republican leadership's unhealthy addiction. It  is abominable, it is irresponsible, and we should set it aside and  focus on making long-term decisions for the American people.
