 Mr. President, I come to the floor to remember the life  and service of a Colorado hero and to reflect on an upcoming  anniversary of an event during World War II.   The hero's name is Felix Sparks--a name that may very well be  familiar to the people of Colorado. Felix Sparks was born in Texas,  though. We have a lot of Texans in Colorado, but this one made the  right choice and stayed in Colorado. He was born in San Antonio, TX, in  1917, and he spent his childhood around Miami, AZ, where his family and  father worked in a mining company. He was in high school during the  Great Depression and was the eldest of five siblings.   Soon after graduating from high school, Felix decided to enlist in  the U.S. Army. Upon completing his enlistment, Felix enrolled at the  University of Arizona and completed the Citizens' Military Training  program, which earned him a commission as a second lieutenant. Mr.  Sparks then went on to pursue a pre-law degree. He had just finished  his first semester of that effort when he was ordered to report for  duty to the 157th Infantry Regiment in Colorado. He was ordered to  report at the very beginning of World War II. That year was 1940--right  before the United States officially entered World War II.   Neither Felix Sparks nor the American people knew it at the time, but  World War II was about to change the history of the United States and  the world forever. Felix would be on the frontlines of one of the most  pivotal moments of World War II.   As a little bit of background on his work, along with the National  Guard units from Oklahoma, Arizona, and New Mexico, Colorado's 157th  Infantry Regiment mobilized in support of the U.S. Army's 45th Infantry  Division in Oklahoma, also known as the Thunderbird Division.   The division set sail for North Africa in June 1943 for its first  mission--the invasion of Sicily. Over the next 511 days, Felix Sparks  and his fellow soldiers in the Thunderbird Division would participate  in so many well-known combat operations in Sicily, Naples-Foggia, Rome- Arno, Southern France, the Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland, and Central  Europe. It was an incredibly well-documented, decorated campaign. Yet,  of these 511 days, Felix Sparks most often recounted one day in  particular more than any other. That day was April 29, 1945.   On April 29, 1945, LTC Felix Sparks was the commander of the 3rd  Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, and on that day, that April day,  after so many days of fighting and after what they had already seen,  the 157th Infantry Regiment, along with units of the 42nd Infantry  Division and the 20th Armored Infantry Division, led the liberation of  approximately 32,000 prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp.  Although his unit had suffered thousands of casualties over the course  of the war, what Lieutenant Colonel Sparks and his soldiers discovered  at Dachau was beyond compare.   Felix Sparks described that day as one of the darkest days of his  lifetime and, I can only imagine, one of the darkest days of lifetimes  put together. Along with many of his fellow soldiers, he would spend  the rest of his life reliving the horrors of what he witnessed at  Dachau. As they neared the camp, the American forces discovered nearly  40 railroad cars that were filled with decomposing bodies. Felix Sparks  said the ``stench of death was overpowering'' and that what he saw at  the camp made Dante's Inferno seem ``pale compared to the real hell of  Dachau.'' Inside the camp were even more bodies and more than 30,000  survivors--survivors of one of the darkest places in one of the darkest  moments in world history.   We say we must never forget the horrors of the Holocaust, but Felix  Sparks and the Americans who liberated Dachau didn't have a choice.  They could never forget and will never forget.   Felix Sparks said:         The men of the 45th Infantry Division were hardened combat       veterans. [We had seen so many fights.] We had been in combat       almost two years at that point. While we were accustomed to       death, we were not able to comprehend the type of death that       we encountered at Dachau.    There is no going back. There is no forgetting. There is no trying to  erase from memory the horrors of Nazism and seeing it up close. The  liberation of Dachau would be one of the Thunderbird Division's final  missions during World War II. The division was officially deactivated  on December 7, 1945--4 years after Pearl Harbor.   Following the end of the war, Felix Sparks attended the University of  Colorado Law School in Boulder, CO--my alma mater. He graduated in 1947  and started a law practice in Delta, CO, while he also served as a  district attorney. In 1956, Felix Sparks was appointed as the youngest  ever--in Colorado's history--associate justice of the Colorado Supreme  Court.   Then, in 1958, Felix accepted the role of director of the Colorado  Water Conservation Board, where he was instrumental in the development  of sustainable water policies for the State. For those not familiar  with Colorado, this is an incredibly important position. We are a State  whose history is written in water. Yet that wasn't enough for Felix  Sparks. It was not all.   Felix Sparks wasn't just serving in his civilian life; he continued  his military service as well. After returning home from World War II,  Felix had joined the Colorado Army National Guard. He would go on to  serve in and take command of the Colorado National Guard for nearly 30  years between the two--both service and commanding. He retired at the  rank of brigadier general.   As both a civilian and a soldier, Felix Sparks truly exemplified  servant leadership. His sense of duty to our Nation and to my home  State lives on today, and I am proud to honor his legacy and life of  service. Felix Sparks died on September 24, 2007, at the age of 90. He  is buried in Wheat Ridge, CO.   Along with a number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I  [[Page S1683]]  will soon be introducing a resolution to commemorate the 75th  anniversary of the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp during  World War II and to honor the service of Felix Sparks, as well as of  the courageous personnel he fought alongside and of the brave men and  women they saved along the way, and in memory of the tens of thousands  who were brutally and savagely murdered by the Nazi regime.   We must never forget what happened. Unfortunately, far too many  Americans and far too many people around the world may put aside these  moments of our darkest time in history and forget or can't name a  ghetto or a concentration camp today. That is something that we have to  fix, that we have to correct, that we have to continue to speak of--the  horrors that can never be repeated in the darkest times of our history.   I invite all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution. We already have the Senators from the States that  participated in the Thunderbird Division so that we may remember the  lives lost to the atrocities of the Holocaust and to World War II and  remember the tens of thousands who were spared by the brave acts of our  Nation's military. We must never forget. I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution in one more showing to never forget.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
