 Mr. Speaker, this is National Small Business Week, and  I rise to celebrate the more than 27 million small businesses in the  United States of America and the 31,000 that are in my congressional  district. The men and women who own these firms are truly the backbone  of our economy.   Small businesses create most of the new jobs in the economy,  supporting their families, employees, and communities. Small businesses  want to grow and create jobs, but have difficulty accessing capital.   Furthermore, too many people remain out of work through no fault of  their own. We must do more to fight high unemployment rates by helping  to ensure that small businesses have the tools they need to succeed and  thrive.   That is why I introduced H.R. 2313, the Small Business Relief and Job  Creation Act. My bill provides tax credits for small businesses to hire  people who were previously unemployed, and includes additional tax  credits for small businesses located in high unemployment areas.   I welcome my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 2313 to support small  businesses across the country.                            ____________________
