 Mr. Speaker, I want to follow my colleague  and my neighbor in Texas to regret the loss of our two National  Guardsmen from the 36th Division. The 36th Division is a historic  division, Texas division, T-Patchers, and to lose two of our soldiers  is tragic.   But I am on the floor today to talk about health care. The Republican  majority has taken the first legislative step to make America sick  again. The first step was to take away health care from tens of  millions of Americans, including premium increases for millions more in  America. The second action lights the fuse on the dangerous legislative  process that threatens to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and health tax  credits that Americans are now benefiting from.   There should be no reform without a replacement because we may never  have a replacement, but we have millions of Americans who will lose  their healthcare coverage because of the actions of this House. Let's  don't make America sick again.                            ____________________
