 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw  attention to an invasive species attacking Pennsylvania agriculture.   The spotted lanternfly was first discovered in the Commonwealth in  2014 and has since traveled to 51 out of our 67 counties. This spotted  lanternfly can impact the grape, fruit tree, plant nursery, and timber  industries, which contribute billions of dollars each year to  Pennsylvania's economy.   In efforts to prevent the spread of the spotted lanternfly,  Pennsylvania has established quarantine zones, but it takes collective  and intentional efforts to slow the spread of this insect.   Across the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture  along with Penn State Extension provide education-based programs to the  public. These programs are key resources for community members looking  for information on how to combat and slow the spread of the spotted  lanternfly.   Mr. Speaker, with warmer weather comes spotted lanternfly hatching  season, and residents are encouraged to squash the bug and their egg  masses.   It will take us all doing our part to prevent any further spread of  this invasive insect, and I encourage all to utilize their local  resources when combating invasive species.                            ____________________
