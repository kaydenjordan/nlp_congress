 Mr. Speaker, every parent deserves to have confidence  that the air they and their children breathe is safe. That is why we  have environmental standards and why we have an Environmental  Protection Agency to monitor, update, and enforce the rules.   So, when communities face a known public risk, new or recently  reclassified, we rightly expect the EPA to act--quickly,  comprehensively, and transparently.   In the Chicago area, this, sadly, has not been the case. Ethylene  oxide, or EtO, was reclassified as a known carcinogen more than 2 years  ago, yet we just recently learned facilities around Chicago could be  emitting it at elevated levels.   The EPA has been unacceptably slow to respond and has failed to keep  affected communities informed.   This month, I partnered with Senators Durbin and Duckworth and other  colleagues in my delegation to introduce legislation that would require  the EPA to immediately revise and update its EtO standards and to keep  the public fully informed.   We are also demanding that EPA evaluate ambient levels of EtO in  these communities immediately, something it should be doing already.   Our communities deserve more from the EPA. This is about our families  and their public health.                            ____________________
