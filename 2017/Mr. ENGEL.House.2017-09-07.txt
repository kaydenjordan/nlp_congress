 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment, unfortunately, would harm  American leadership on the global stage, cutting our investment in the  international organizations account by $10 million.   Mr. Chairman, this bill already underfunds diplomacy and development  when we should be investing more in these critical components of our  national security. Cutting resources for our work in international  organizations would take us further in the wrong direction.   Just so we are clear about which international organizations we are  talking about, they are NATO, the World Health Organization, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency.   Do we really want to damage the effectiveness of these organizations  and our ability to lead from within them?   Congress just passed critical sanctions on Russia. NATO is the main  organization defending Europe against Vladimir Putin's aggression. But  instead of bolstering the NATO alliance, this amendment would only  reinforce the reluctance to support the North Atlantic Alliance by some  in the administration. This should worry lawmakers on both sides of the  aisle as well as Americans at home following the debate.   How about the World Health Organization? The last time I looked, the  World Health Organization was fighting the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. Do  [[Page H7124]]  we now want to slash its funding and undermine its role of responding  to the next major pandemic? I can assure you that the diseases we don't  combat abroad today eventually will reach our shores.   North Korea is threatening the globe with nuclear weapons. Iran  remains not far behind. So I cannot fathom why we would want to cut  funding for the IAEA, given its crucial role in monitoring nuclear  safety around the world.   Of course, this amendment would also reduce our support for the U.N.  regular budget. Withholding this funding could cause the United States  to fall behind at the U.N., further diminishing our standing in the  world, calling into question our commitment as a global leader, and  ceding ground to Vladimir Putin and others who are happy to expand  their reach but who do not share our values.    In fact, even a senior administration official, our own Ambassador to  the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said on many occasions that while  she supports efforts to reform the U.N., she does not support a ``slash  and burn'' approach.   This amendment, unfortunately, is a ``slash and burn'' approach, Mr.  Chairman, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey), my esteemed colleague who is the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee and a fellow New Yorker.    Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman is trying to put money  in place for something with which I agree. It is not that I disagree  with it, but I disagree with where he is taking the money from. I think  that is the problem with it.   Hopefully, we can, when it comes time for a final budget, include  both of these. But to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, I think is not a  good idea.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding to me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. To  completely eliminate funding for the United States Institute of Peace  would be a serious mistake.   Let me thank Mrs. Lowey for the wonderful work she is doing here and  John Lewis for his leadership. John is an American hero. I think we  should listen to what John has to say.   For anyone who doesn't know what the USIP does, it saves lives, lives  of U.S. servicemembers, military personnel, and civilians around the  world.   The United States Institute of Peace stops conflicts before they  start and works to defuse crises. The Institute provides conflict  resolution teams and skills that are vital to our diplomats and our  military forces serving in conflict zones abroad. They are often quiet  successes, rarely grabbing headlines. After all, a war that doesn't  happen won't draw near the attention of a raging conflict.   Military leaders agree. On September 1, a distinguished group of  retired three- and four-star flag officers who have served our country  valiantly during some of its most challenging conflicts wrote to  Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi expressing deep concerns about efforts  here in the House to eliminate funding for USIP.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the letter.                                                  September 1, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As retired       three and four star flag officers who have served our country       during some of its most challenging conflicts, from Vietnam       to Iraq and Afghanistan, we are writing to express our deep       concern over proposed amendments to the current FY 2018       appropriations bill now before the House of Representatives       that would eliminate funding for the U.S. Institute of Peace.        We serve on the Institute's Senior Military Advisory Group       which, in addition to advising USIP's leadership on current       and future conflicts, also guides Institute efforts to       partner effectively with our military in conflict zones. USIP       has a long and robust record of working closely with its       federal partners--including the Department of Defense--to       focus on national security priority areas where it brings       distinctive capabilities to bear.        USIP works on the ground with local partners on the root       causes of conflict that all too frequently result in       America's military gains or diplomatic and development       investments going to waste. For example, in Iraq,       Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tunisia, Nigeria, and across the Sahel       in Africa, USIP engages at a local level to thwart ISIS'       ability to recruit and destabilize America's most important       allies in the struggle against extremism USIP's high impact       approach gives people the tools to help solve their own       problems so America is not drawn into these conflicts.        No other agency provides these services, and USIP's       approach is highly cost effective. In Mahmoudiya, Iraq, for       example--a region so violent it was known as the ``Triangle       of Death''--USIP partnered with the Army's 10th Mountain       Division in 2007 to forge a tribal accord that halted attacks       on U.S. and Iraqi forces and drastically reduced casualties.       The Army was able to withdraw more than 2,800 troops--80       percent of its deployment in the region--thus saving more       than $150 million per month. That initiative cost USIP       approximately $1 million. A decade later, despite pressure       from ISIS, Mahmoudiya remains relatively calm, largely on the       basis of that peace accord.        As citizens and former soldiers, we believe deeply in the       mission of the U.S. Institute of Peace as an essential       element of our national  [[Page H7128]]       security architecture. Please ensure that it remains fully       funded and capable of continuing its critical work to further       U.S. interests and save lives in the world's most challenging       conflict zones.            Sincerely,      General George W. Casey, Jr., USA (Ret.),        Chief of Staff of the United States Army ('07-'11).      Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry, LT General, USA (Ret.),        U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan ('09-'11), Deputy Chairman,       NATO Military Committee ('07-'09), Commander, Combined Forces       Command-Afghanistan ('05-'07).

Martin, USAF (Ret.),        Commander, Air Material Command ('03-'05), Commander, U.S.       Air Forces in Europe ('00-'03).      General Raymond T. Odierno, USA (Ret.),        Chief of Staff of the United States Army ('11-'15),       Commander, United States Joint Forces Command ('10-'11),       Commander, United States Forces-Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom       ('10).      General Charles F. Wald, USAF (Ret.),        Deputy Commander, U.S. European Command ('02-'06).     Mr. Chairman, USIP is neither a Republican nor a  Democratic institution. The Institution was created in 1984 by  bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Reagan. Since then,  USIP has saved the United States billions of dollars by investing in  peace. Let me share just one short example of the incredible work that  USIP has done.   After 52 years of war and more than a quarter million lives lost,  Colombia's armed conflict ended with the signing of a peace agreement  last year in Cartagena. The peace agreement was reached, in no small  part, thanks to the incredible work of the United States Institute of  Peace and its chief of operations in Colombia, Ginny Bouvier. Under her  leadership, USIP trained female mediators, religious organizations,  Afro-Colombian leaders, and many others in methods to support peaceful  resolution of conflict.   Ginny recently passed away, far too young, at the age of 58, but I  would like to believe that her legacy of peacebuilding in Colombia can  live on through continued congressional support for USIP.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this  harmful amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking my colleagues and  fellow co-chairs of the House Tuberculosis Elimination Caucus, Mr.  Young of Alaska and Mr. Gene Green of Texas. I am grateful for their  support of this measure and for their work to combat tuberculosis  around the world. This bipartisan amendment would help move that work  forward.   Mr. Chairman, America's investments in global health are not  handouts. Combating disease around the world isn't just some pet  project to make us feel good about ourselves. When we invest in global  health, we are investing in our own security and leadership on the  global stage. After all, infectious diseases don't respect borders, and  when we fail to fight a dangerous illness or respond to a pandemic  overseas, we risk having to respond once it reaches our shores.   At the same time, healthier communities are more protective, more  stable communities. Healthier countries are stronger partners on the  world stage. And when the United States helps to advance those  conditions, we are showing the world what kind of country we are, what  American values demand of us.   The reality is we should be investing more in these efforts. One area  where we need a lot more support is in the fight against tuberculosis.   TB kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease.  This is especially heartbreaking, Mr. Chairman, because we know how to  prevent TB, and we know how to cure it. We know how to cure it, and  people are still dying. That is just unfathomable.   Yet, in 2015, 1.8 million people died from this disease, 10.5 million  more became infected. One in ten TB patients is also HIV positive,  making tuberculosis the top killer of people living with HIV. Countries  with a high prevalence of TB can see their GDP shrink by 4 to 7  percent.   The World Health Organization tells us we need an additional $2  billion every year to control tuberculosis. My amendment would help to  make up part of that shortfall, ramping up USAID's global health  programs by $209 million. That would bring our investment in TB  assistance to $450 million.                                time  1615    These efforts have a proven track record, Mr. Chairman. In the  countries where we are working on the problem, incidence of TB has  dropped by nearly one-fifth since 2000, more than twice as fast as  countries where we haven't been involved. That is tens of thousands of  precious lives saved, and we played a major role in that.   My amendment won't wipe out this disease, Mr. Chairman, but it will  save lives, it will build on past successes and move us in the  direction of putting a stop to this killer once and for all.   I ask all Members to support this bipartisan amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me just say that I hear what the chairman  is saying. I certainly am a strong supporter of international narcotics  funding, but the question is: Where do you put the money?   The International Narcotics funding account is well funded and even  has money in the pipeline from previous years. Meanwhile, TB control is  hugely underfunded and continues to kill more people worldwide than any  other disease. That is why the funding is necessary. So by passing my  amendment, we can save thousands of lives from this preventable,  curable disease.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
