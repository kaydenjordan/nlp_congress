 Mr. President, I rise to bring attention to the need  to support the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia's invasion. Over  the weekend, I took part in a Senate delegation to Poland alongside my  colleagues Senator Rob Portman, Senator Richard Blumenthal, and Senator  Roger Wicker. We met with Ukrainian refugees--women, children,  grandparents--some who were carrying their whole lives on their backs.   Three weeks ago, Ukrainians were thinking about their jobs, their  plans, and their dreams. Now, so much of that is in shambles. Women  have been figuring out how to get their older parents and young  children to safety across the border while their brothers and husbands  take up arms. The most heartbreaking conversations I had were with  children who didn't know if they had a future.   Seeing the cost of this invasion up close has only strengthened my  resolve to stand with Ukraine, both with humanitarian aid for refugees  and military support. With advanced weapons from the United States and  allies, Ukraine's Territorial Defense has been more effective in  stifling Russia's invasion than most imagined. Vladimir Putin thought  he would be greeted with rose petals--instead it was Molotov cocktails.  And 21 days later, Kyiv still stands.   I was proud to join the bipartisan Senate majority in allocating  $13.6 billion for aid to Ukraine, but more support is needed. Over the  past few weeks, Russian aircraft have been behind brutal assaults on  residential neighborhoods, religious institutions, and hospitals in  Ukraine. Ukraine needs more air defense support. Drones, Stingers, and  Javelins have proven to be highly effective in taking down Russian  aircraft and tanks, so we must continue to provide that critical  weaponry and more.   In the face of this devastation, Poland has shown that it is a  country with a big heart, taking in more than 1.7 million Ukrainian  refugees. For perspective, Poland is a country of 38 million. Since  they have opened their doors, the country's population has grown by  over 4 percent. In Warsaw alone, the population has increased by 11  percent. Poles are meeting refugees at the border and welcoming them  into their communities--even into their own homes.   The Polish people don't have to imagine what it is like to live  through a full-scale invasion. Their history is marked by invasions by  Prussia, the Habsburgs, the Nazis, and yes, Russia. Poland is also well  aware of its 332-mile border with Ukraine. Last week, Russian missiles  struck 15 miles from Poland's border. The Polish border guards I spoke  with said they could literally feel the earth shake. As Putin's war  inches westward, we must affirm our commitment to our NATO ally from a  military and humanitarian standpoint.   During our trip, Senator Portman, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Wicker,  and I had the honor of meeting with the 82nd Airborne. They briefed us  on everything that is being done to help Ukrainian refugees, as well as  fighters on the front lines. I also met with Minnesota troops, and I  was inspired by their character and determination. It was clear that  they understood the patriotic value of their service. I pray for their  safety as they continue their mission in the region.   Across the Atlantic in Ukraine, we are all seeing how precious  democracy truly is. Putin has shown his true colors. But you know what  else? The people of Ukraine have shown their true colors--in bright  blue and yellow--they are showing the world what true courage is all  about. We must continue to stand with them in their fight.                            ____________________
