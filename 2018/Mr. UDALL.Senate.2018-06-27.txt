 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the immigration  crisis that this President has generated.   The Nation has seen images of children trapped behind wire fencing  and children sleeping on concrete floors. We have seen the tents  hurriedly set up to house children separated from their parents. We  have seen the video of Jessica, who doesn't know where her mother is  and wants to talk to her. We have heard the audio of young children  crying out for their mothers and fathers. We have heard the audio of a  detention facility staff person telling the kids not to talk to the  press, claiming it will hurt their immigration case.   As of June 12, on American soil, over 100 babies under the age of 1  year are being held in detention by the American Government. We think  this can't be happening in the United States of America, but it is.   Last Friday, Senators Heinrich, Blumenthal, and I visited President  Trump's tent city in Tornillo, TX, and we toured a Border Patrol  station in Clint and El Paso and a port of entry in El Paso. We were  turned away from Tornillo on Friday, so I went back Saturday and got  inside to see the children. We all went to these government facilities  to get answers, but we came up short.   Most pressing, we still don't know when or how all the thousands of  children taken from their parents will be reunited. We don't know how  children whose parents have already been deported will be reunited. We  have parents scared that they will never see their children again.   The confusion, chaos, and incompetence with which the President's  zero tolerance policy was executed is only outmatched by the confusion,  chaos, and incompetence with which reunification is being handled.   The immediate priority must be to get these children back to their  parents as soon as possible. We know we are doing damage to these  children every day that they are not with their families. We know this.  Pediatric and mental health professionals all agree. The American  Academy of Pediatrics condemned the administration because those  doctors know that separating families can result in ``irreparable  harm.'' That is a quote from the American Academy of Pediatrics-- ``irreparable harm'' to separated children.   Last weekend, I saw children detained in the tents in Tornillo who  were able to talk to their parents only twice a week for 10 minutes. I  saw astounding young children--children 3 to 10 years old--who had  crossed the border without their parents. I saw families from  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, fleeing violence and persecution,  locked in detention at Border Patrol. I met Jade Gabriela, who is not  even 2, and her father, detained in El Paso, both of them trying to  escape the brutality and gangs in Honduras.    President Trump claims there is a border crisis, but communities on  the border dispute this. I am a Senator from a border State, and I  dispute this. I represent border communities, and I have been to the  border many, many times recently and over the years. President Trump  has not. He should come see for himself and see the humanitarian crisis  he has created.   Detention facilities for children are overwhelmed. We have heard from  a whistleblower in New York that there is not enough staffing at her  facility because of all the young children coming in. These internment  camp-like facilities--as former First Lady Laura Bush has compared them  to--are costing Americans and American taxpayers millions of dollars.  The Tornillo tent city costs $400,000 every day. The President's poorly  conceived Executive order directs the Department of Homeland Security  Secretary to set up even more family detention facilities on military  bases.   Zero tolerance has overwhelmed the U.S. attorney's offices on the  border. Now, instead of prosecuting violent criminals for serious  crimes, Federal prosecutors are wasting resources, focusing instead on  criminally prosecuting mothers and fathers for misdemeanor improper- entry violations. There is a call to take military JAG lawyers away  from their more important duties to handle the flood of immigration  cases and recall prosecutors from their posts in Indian Country, where  they are so sorely needed. All systems are bursting at the seams thanks  to the President's made-up crisis, cruelty, and bureaucratic  incompetence.   As of today, there is no clear path forward to reunite families.  There is no timeline. Tuesday, Secretary Azar of Health and Human  Services admitted in his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee  that there is no timeline. The Department of Health and Human Services  is prohibited under the Flores case from reuniting children with  parents who are in detention.   The President wants to keep zero tolerance in place and continue to  prosecute and keep parents in detention with their children. Not only  is this cruel and un-American, but I think the Federal judge in Flores  is going to reject the President's request to allow children to be  jailed with their parents longer than 20 days.   The President has doubled down on zero tolerance. Like many of his  policies that are hastily implemented and borne of his divisive agenda,  there is no plan B if the court refuses, as it should, to allow  children to be jailed with their parents.   There is an obvious solution. Successful alternatives to detention  have demonstrated compliance rates of 99 percent with court appearances  and ICE appointments. These programs are both effective and cost a  fraction of what it takes to detain families. Why doesn't the President  use these programs and save taxpayers millions of dollars? Because he  thinks it doesn't appear tough and takes away his bargaining chip of  detained children that he thinks he can use to get his wall.   In the President's rush to gain political traction, he has created a  humanitarian and moral crisis within our own borders, the likes of  which we have not seen since we interned families of Japanese heritage  during World War II.   I can tell you that I will not back down from this fight. More  importantly, I can tell you that the American people and New Mexicans  are with me. It is the voices of the American people that forced the  President to retreat from his brutal family separation policy, and it  is those voices that will prevail in the end.   The administration is trying its hardest to hide what is going on  from the American people, but the American people are demanding  answers. We all must continue to speak out until we have policies in  place that make sure families stay together, lawfully and humanely. We  need alternatives to detention, and we need to stand up for due  process.   As Americans see images of separated children and family detention  camps, they turn to Congress, and they turn to the judicial system as  well. A Federal judge recently issued a ruling barring family detention  and ordering reunification within 30 days, but the Trump administration  may fight this ruling--just like they are fighting to overturn Flores,  which came out of a Supreme Court case.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, Justice Kennedy has announced he is  retiring. I had some very strong disagreements with his rulings,  especially on campaign finance reform, but I thank him for his service.  He was a thoughtful Justice. I am very concerned with the process to  replace him.  [[Page S4497]]  The majority leader is trying to eliminate advice and consent from the  process. We should wait until after the upcoming election. That will be  a shorter time than Leader McConnell waited in 2016, the last election  year.   I am very concerned with the President's process. He is picking from  an ideological list, with a history of personally attacking judges he  disagrees with, while demanding loyalty from his appointees. At the  same time, this administration is undermining due process across the  board--along the border, for minority races or religions, for a woman's  right to choose.   The Constitution requires a real advice-and-consent process. The  majority leader needs to ensure one. If the McConnell rule was in place  in the 2016 election year, it should be in place for 2018.   Given the President's attacks on due process and rule of law, we  should let the people speak before we consider his next Supreme Court  nominee.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
