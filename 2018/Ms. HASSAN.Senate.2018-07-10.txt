 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  extend my sincerest congratulations and happy birthday wishes to  Juliette C. Hamill, who celebrates her 100th birthday on July 10.   Juliette was born and raised in Manchester, NH, the same city where  she resides today. She worked as a legal secretary, as well as a  Federal housing authority, before retiring.   Juliette and her husband, Warren, were married for 45 years before he  passed away in 2001. During the course of their marriage, they visited  all the continental U.S. State capitals on road trips. While the couple  spent most of their years in New Hampshire, they also briefly lived in  New York, California, Ohio, and Nebraska.   Together, Juliette and Warren raised four children: Theresa McKenney,  Warren G. Hamill, Catherine Mary Burge, and Gary C. Hamill. Juliette  also has 9 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, whom she loves  deeply.   Today Juliette is an active member of her churches: St. Marie's  Catholic Church and St. Catherine's Catholic Church.   Mr. President, I hope you join me, Juliette's friends and family, and  many people in the city of Manchester and across the Granite State in  wishing Juliette C. Hamill a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
