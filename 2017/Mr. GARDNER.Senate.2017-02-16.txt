 Mr. President, there are few things that I enjoy more  than bragging about my hometown. I live in a little town called Yuma,  CO, out in the Eastern Plains. It is a town of about 3,500 people. If  maybe you overexaggerate a little bit, it reaches 4,000. It is out in  the middle of the High Plains of Colorado, 4,000 feet in elevation, 40  miles or so from the Kansas-Nebraska border. It is a farming community,  100 percent farming. Everything related to the town is farming. Even  the clothing stores are related to farming because if you don't have a  strong agriculture economy, nobody is buying blue jeans, nobody is  going up to the car dealership to buy a pickup if the bushel of corn  isn't priced right. So everything we do in that town is related to  agriculture and farming.   My family comes from a background of farm equipment business and  started a business--101 years old this year--by my great-grandfather.  My time working in the dealership started roughly when I was in  seventh, eighth grade. They let me do some very complicated tasks,  high-skill tasks they let me perform: cleaning the bathroom, sweeping  the floors. I did that throughout my time in eighth grade, high school,  and college. If I go back today, I am sure they would let me do the  same job, clean the bathrooms and sweep the floors. Part of that is  because I was selling the wrong parts to a lot of farmers who would  come into the dealership. Maybe they were just keeping me off the parts  counter for the time being. In fact, maybe that is why people voted for  me, to get me off the parts counter and quit selling the wrong parts.   Over my time working at the dealership, we witnessed a lot of good  times in agriculture. I can remember one time going into my dad's and  granddad's office and saying: You know what, the economy is really  good. The price of corn is really high right now. We ought to order a  whole bunch of farm equipment--a whole bunch of pieces of implements,  tillage equipment, tractors, combines--and have them on the lot so we  can take advantage of the good times in agriculture.   My granddad paused and looked at my dad and said: No, I don't think  we should do that because I don't think times are going to be good next  year.   They were right. This was back in probably the mid-1990s. They had  seen it coming because of their experience in the business, the ebbs  and flows of agriculture, the good times and the bad times. They were  able to recognize, through their own experience, what different  economic indicators meant to them and how they could forecast, using  their experience, what was going to happen in the farm world the next  year. So they decided not to order all that brandnew equipment. They  decided not to order the tractors, the combines, and the tillage  equipment. It was a good thing because the next year wasn't that great.  If this 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid would have had his way, we would  have had a whole lot of iron  [[Page S1255]]  we were paying interest on that year without being able to sell it.   Colorado is pretty blessed, with 4,000 companies involved in  agriculture, 173,000 jobs in Colorado directly involved in agriculture.  The State has more than 35,000 farms and 31 million acres used for  farming and ranching. If we look at the Colorado business economic  outlook, the net farm income of ranchers and farmers in 2016 is  estimated this year to be the lowest it has been since 1986, and the  projections for 2017 are even lower.   I grew up as a kid in the 1980s, watching perhaps the hardest times  agriculture in the United States had faced in decades, watching a lot  of people I knew my whole life going out of business, people having to  sell the farm because of what was happening in the 1980s, leading to a  banking crisis in agriculture in the 1980s, watching banks I had grown  up with close.   I am concerned in this country that we are going to see the same  thing again, beginning in 2016, into 2017, and then into 2018 next  year. I am very worried that those tough times we saw in the 1980s, and  some of the tough with the good times we saw in the 1990s, and some  really good years a few years ago are going to seem like distant  memories come later this summer and into next year if we don't do  something.   I had the opportunity to visit with the Colorado commissioner of  agriculture in my office last week, a gentleman by the name of Don  Brown. Don Brown is from my hometown of Yuma, CO. It has done pretty  well for itself, 3,000 people. The State commissioner of agriculture is  from my hometown. The previous commissioner of agriculture, a gentleman  by the name of John Stoltz, was from my hometown of Yuma. Both of them  grew up in agriculture in that area, understanding what it is like on  the High Plains, understanding what it is like to live through good  times and bad times. Both of them today I think would tell you, they  are very concerned as well about what happens over the next year, the  next 2 years.   It wasn't that long ago when we saw some of the highest priced  commodities this country has ever seen, at least in a very long time-- the golden years of agriculture, some people said--where corn and wheat  were priced high. People were able to pay their bills and buy new  equipment. Commodity prices don't always stay that high though. The one  thing a farmer will tell you is, the price of a piece of farm equipment  stays high, the price of fertilizer seems to stay high. When prices  come down on their commodities, the other prices--the inputs--stay  high, and they find themselves in significant trouble.   The price of corn today is estimated to be about $3.15 per bushel.  That is what it was in 2016, less than half of the 10-year high price  of corn of $6.86 in 2012, just a few years ago. To put that in  historical context, the price of corn in 2016 at $3.15 is lower than  the price of corn in 1974, the year I was born, when it was $3.20. The  price of corn in 2016 was 5 cents lower than it was the year I was  born, 1974. It is the same story across the board for Colorado. Wheat  prices are down more than $1 from 2015 to 2016 alone and down more than  50 percent since 2012. I can guarantee, even though I may have sold a  lot of wrong parts at the implement dealership, those wrong parts  didn't come down in price 50 percent.   The livestock industry has seen similar trends, with cattle prices at  their lowest level since 2010. In farming and agriculture, a lot of  times we might see a year where the price of corn is high, but the  price of cattle is low or the price of other commodities are high where  the price of cattle is low, but when cattle are high, maybe other  commodities are low. Farmers who have a diverse operation are able to  offset the lows and the highs with a diverse operation--but not this  year, and it looks like that may be the case next year.   Declines in States' agriculture economy are not unique to Colorado.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research  Service, revenues have decreased for agriculture nationwide by more  than 10 percent since 2014.   Recently, the Wall Street Journal wrote this, and I will show the  headline of the Wall Street Journal piece just a couple of weeks ago.  The Wall Street has an article entitled ``The Next American Farm Bust  Is Upon Us.''   We have had a lot of debates on this floor. We have had debates about  Cabinet members. We have had debates about resolutions of disapprovals.  We are talking about a lot of things, but there is a lot of suffering  beginning in the heartland of America right now. A lot of farmers and  ranchers are suffering. They are worried about how they are going to  survive, not just into the next year but how they are going to survive  into the next couple of months. The telltale signs of difficult times  are all around us in agriculture. This article, ``The Next American  Farm Bust Is Upon Us,'' begins to tell the story. Here is what the Wall  Street Journal said:         The Farm Belt is hurtling toward a milestone: Soon there       will be fewer than two million farms in America for the first       time since pioneers moved westward after the Louisiana       Purchase.        Across the heartland, a multiyear slump in prices for corn,       wheat and other farm commodities brought on by a glut of       grain world-wide is pushing many farmers further into debt.       Some are shutting down, raising concerns that the next few       years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the       1980s.    The article highlights the story of a fifth-generation farmer from  Western Kansas. I mentioned my hometown is 40 miles away from Kansas.  It looks very similar to the Eastern Plains of Colorado where I live.  Here is his story:         From his father's porch, the 56-year-old can see the       windswept spot where his great-grandparents' sod house stood       in 1902 when they planted the first of the 1,200 acres on       which his family farms alfalfa, sorghum and wheat today. Even       after harvesting one of their best wheat crops ever last       year, thanks to plentiful rain and a mild winter, Mr. Scott       isn't sure how long they can afford to keep farming that       ground.    There is a lot of work we need to do to make sure Mr. Scott and  farmers who live in my community around the Eastern and Western Slope  of Colorado will be able to survive over the next year--steps so we can  help to make sure we are addressing this crisis head-on, before it  begins and develops into a full-blown farm crisis like we saw in the  1980s. We must have serious regulatory reform.   In a letter I received from the Colorado Farm Bureau, the letter  read:         Colorado Farm Bureau recognizes that a major impediment to       the success of American agricultural industries and the       national economy is rampant federal regulation and the       associated cost of compliance.    We have to allow U.S. agriculture to flow to markets around the  world, so in addition to that regulatory reform--some of which we are  undertaking now through resolutions of disapproval by peeling back the  overreach of government, we have to allow farmers access to more  markets. That is a concern we all should share: What is going to happen  with our trade policy in this country? Because if we decide to shut off  trade in this country, if we decide to close access and avenues to new  markets, the first people who are going to be hurt are those farmers  and ranchers in Colorado and Kansas and throughout the Midwest of the  United States. We have to have the opportunity to be able to send that  bushel of wheat to Asia, that bushel of corn around the globe to make  sure we are providing value-added opportunities for the world's best  farmers and ranchers. Opening up new markets for Colorado and American  agriculture is a clear way we can support rural economies.    Let's be clear. What I said at the beginning of these comments--there  are farm communities that have diversity in their economic  opportunities. A farm economy may not be 100 percent dependent on farms  or ranches. Maybe they have tourism. Maybe they have some recreational  opportunities. Maybe they are close to a big city where people can live  there and commute. But there are a lot of towns across the United  States that are solely, 100 percent committed to agriculture. They  don't have access to anything but farming and ranching. When the price  is down, the town is down. When the town is down, Main Street erodes.  When Main Street erodes, it affects our schools and our hospitals and  our relationships and our families. And somebody has to be looking out  for our farmers and ranchers because the next American farm bust is  upon us.   We have to take the necessary steps to pass a farm bill that gets our  policies right when the new one expires. The current one expires in  2016, and these discussions are just now underway. If we have  regulatory reform, if  [[Page S1256]]  we open up new trade opportunities for agriculture and we give farmers  certainty--those are three things we can do to help address this crisis  before it becomes a full-blown crisis.   We have to make sure that we support our farmers and ranchers, that  we have their backs in good times and in bad times. Giving farmers  certainty through a farm bill, through a regulatory landscape that  provides certainty and relief, is important.   I talked to a family member of mine the other day who talks about his  fear that he sees conditions similar to what we saw in the 1980s. The  final relief we can provide is relief from financial regulations that  are stifling the ability of banks to provide workout opportunities for  farmers and ranchers when they need it.   Four things we ought to be doing for our farmers and ranchers:  provide them certainty, regulatory relief, new trade opportunities, and  targeted financial relief on regulations that are preventing workouts  through our banks and our communities.   We have the opportunity now to prevent this country from seeing what  it saw in the 1980s, but let's not be reactionary. Let's do what we can  to get ahead of this before we start seeing what Secretary-designee  Perdue told me the other day. One of the customers of his agricultural  business took his life because he didn't know what was going to happen  to his farm, and his three kids are now left wondering what they are  going to do.   I hope this country understands how supportive we are of American  agriculture and the actions we need to take to stand with them when  times get tough.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on the  nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency, whom I intend to support.   Over the past several weeks, we heard a number of Senators come to  the floor hour after hour, 24-hour sessions through the night--1  o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock--in the morning and beyond, to  complain about this nominee or that nominee, to express their concern  about this nominee or that nominee. In fact, many times I think the  only reason there is opposition to a nominee is that they disagree with  a nominee because it wasn't Hillary Clinton who made the nomination.   We have heard countless people come to the floor today to talk about  their opposition to the Trump administration EPA. I have a picture on  the floor that shows the Obama EPA. This is a river in Colorado,  enjoyed by thousands of people each and every summer. This is a picture  of that same river under the Obama EPA. This was caused by 800,000  pounds of mineral and other waste going into the river because of a  mishandled EPA project. This wasn't Scott Pruitt. This wasn't Donald  Trump. This was the Obama EPA that did this. I only wish that my  colleagues who have come to the floor for the past several hours had  shown similar outrage when the Obama EPA did this to Colorado-- inflicted this kind of damage on people in Southwestern Colorado in the  Gold King  [[Page S1357]]  Mine spill. You want to talk about protecting States? Why didn't we  stand up and protect this river?    On August 5, 2015, the EPA caused this spill. They admit they caused  this spill, dumping 3 million gallons of toxic waste into Cement Creek  and into the Animas River. Most Americans remember seeing this river.  Most Americans remember seeing pictures of what this river looked like  across newspapers, across television stations in August of 2015. When I  visited South Korea, the President of South Korea asked me: How is the  river in Colorado that the EPA dumped toxic sludge into?   In fact, I saw this picture on the news just a couple of days ago.  Somebody was using it to complain about the Trump EPA administration.  Somebody was using it to attack Scott Pruitt. This picture had nothing  to do with Scott Pruitt. This was the EPA led by Gina McCarthy. My  response to the spill was that the EPA should be held accountable to  the same level at which the EPA holds private businesses accountable. I  think that is a pretty good standard. But if the EPA is going to make  sure that somebody lives up to a standard, then the EPA should live up  to the same standard--that basic standard for the EPA, because the  Agency caused this spill, and it simply must apply the same  requirements to itself that it does to a private company.   So it was with great disappointment, but very little surprise, that,  when the EPA decided to not subject itself to those same standards,  they walked away from the promises they made. Sure, the EPA had  standards under Barack Obama. They were double standards. The Obama  administration EPA's refusal to not receive and process the personal  injury or economic loss claims arising out of this spill of the Gold  King Mine in Southwest Colorado is appalling. I simply wish the outrage  was there when the EPA walked away from the people that it had injured  in Colorado. We haven't heard talk about it here.   We have heard a lot of complaints here, but nobody is saying they  should be paying for the damage in Colorado they created. After all, we  are discussing the EPA, which with the strike of a pen, and oftentimes  with very little input from those people who would be affected, uses  overly burdensome regulations and a heavyhanded enforcement to punish  private businesses.   Despite the assurances and promises of the then-EPA Administrator  Gina McCarthy that the Agency takes full responsibility of the Gold  King Mine spill, the Agency in 2017--weeks ago--turned its back on the  promises it made and denied paying claims for the harm they caused  Coloradans. Promises were broken to our neighbors downstream in New  Mexico and Utah, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Ute  Mountain Ute Tribe, and the Navajo Nation.   Administrator McCarthy called me last month, just before the news  broke that the EPA would not be processing the claims of dozens of  individuals and businesses in Southwest Colorado under the Federal Tort  Claims Act against the Federal Government. The spill occurred in August  2015. Over a year later, and in the waning days of the Obama  administration, they turned their backs on their promises they made to  Colorado and notified us in the waning hours of an administration  saying: I am sorry. We are not going to help the individuals who are  harmed. This refusal to compensate for the spill is unacceptable and  wholly inconsistent with the EPA's commitment to take full  responsibility with the States, local and tribal governments and  communities.   This past election, voters said they wanted something different from  the last 8 years in Washington because what they experienced was not  working for the people--broken promise after broken promise. A year and  a half ago, the EPA caused the Gold King Mine spill, and the past  administration refused to make it right for Colorado. The status quo at  the EPA is not acceptable because broken promises are the status quo.   I have had earnest conversations with Mr. Pruitt over the past  several weeks about my sincere disappointment about those broken  promises, what we had to go through in Colorado, and what businesses  had to go through in Colorado as a result of the EPA spill.   You can imagine that in an area that is reliant on tourism, what  photographs of this in headlines across the country and in nightly news  stories can do to a tourism-based economy. Those kayakers we saw in  this chart had to shut the river down. Outfitters weren't allowed to be  on the river. Dollars were lost because guides couldn't get out there.  Booked trips that had already been paid for had been canceled. People  didn't go because of the EPA's spill. The EPA's refusal to pay for lost  property, lost economic opportunity, and lost business opportunity is  simply unacceptable.   In the earnest conversations I have had with Scott Pruitt, he has  promised to make it right. He has promised to stand up for the people  in Colorado. He has promised that he will make amends and pay for the  damages that the Obama administration refused to pay for. He assured me  that he is going to make it right, that he is going to work with the  people the EPA injured and those who experienced economic losses and  make sure that they are fully compensated. He agreed to come to  Colorado shortly after his confirmation to make sure that the people of  Colorado know that he will fulfill the promises that were failed under  the Obama administration.   I would also like to talk about another top legislative priority of  mine--passing Good Samaritan legislation. Good Samaritan legislation  would allow Good Samaritans, like the mining industry, State agencies,  local governments, nonprofits, and other groups the ability to clean up  the environment and improve water quality conditions around abandoned  mines. According to the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO,  it is estimated that there are more than 160,000 abandoned hard-rock  mines that exist across the United States, and at least 33,000 of these  mines pose environmental or safety concerns.   One of the immediate actions we can do in Congress to address this  toxic waste and improve our environment is to pass Good Samaritan  legislation. It has been decades that this Congress has tried. It has  been decades that this Congress has failed. It is time to start  succeeding and time to start cleaning up the environment.   The last time the Environment and Public Works Committee was able to  advance legislation on Good Samaritan was in 2006, from my  predecessors, Senators Wayne Allard and Ken Salazar. Unfortunately,  since 2006, this concept has been unsuccessful and caught in partisan  politics.   It is time to take steps forward for facilitating cleanup of the  Nation's abandoned mines to prevent more spills like the Gold King  Mine.   I have secured the commitment from Scott Pruitt to work with me on  this legislation at the EPA to get this done, to work with both sides  of the aisle to accomplish something, so that we can prevent this from  happening. I am not going to stop working until our constituents are  made whole from the EPA-caused spill at the Gold King Mine. I am not  going to stop working until we pass--and we have to continue working to  pass--the Good Samaritan legislation.   The 33,000 mines that pose a risk to the West is unacceptable. Our  citizens, our pristine environment, our waterways, our children--this  wasn't Scott Pruitt. This wasn't Donald Trump. This was an EPA under  the previous administration, led by Gina McCarthy and President Obama,  that walked away from the people of Colorado and the promises made. And  it heartens me greatly to know, at least, that we have an  administration that will move away from every promise abandoned to  fulfilling the promises of protecting our environment.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield?    To the Senator from Illinois, the EPA admits they caused  this spill. Does the Senator from Illinois realize that the EPA then  failed to live up to that promise?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    To the Senator from Illinois, the EPA stated that they  caused this spill. Dozens upon dozens of individuals and businesses  filed a claim against the EPA for damages caused by a spill that the  EPA admits. Scott Pruitt has said that he will fulfill the promise of  paying for those claims the Obama administration denied.   Will the Senator agree that the EPA, under the last administration,  failed to deliver on the promises made of paying these claims?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    I thank my colleague from the great State of Montana.   During the debate on the floor just a while ago, we heard more debate  on something that is very near and dear to my heart; that is, the  matter of the Gold King Mine and the EPA's self-admitted responsibility  on spilling 3 million gallons of toxic sludge into the Animas River in  Colorado.   The debate around the floor and my comments this morning have  centered on the EPA's admitted liability and fault in spilling millions  of gallons of sludge into a river, promising they would make the  claims, pay for the injury that occurred, and then denying those claims  and walking away.   Had the private sector been involved, my question to the Senator is  this: If the private sector admitted guilt in spilling 3 million  gallons of toxic waste into a river, would they be held accountable?    If the Senator would yield, what the EPA has stated is  admitting fault, admitting and promising that they would pay for those  who were injured, and then just weeks ago, as the previous  administration was ending, they denied every single one of the private  claimants. The Senator has talked about Scott Pruitt at EPA.   When I spoke with the Administrator-designate of EPA, Scott Pruitt  said they would make the private claimants whole; that they would pay  the Navajo Nation; that they would pay the claims made by outfitters  who were shut down.   Will the Senator help me make sure that the EPA stands up to its  obligations and recognize that Scott Pruitt--at both the EPW  confirmation hearing and to me--has committed that the EPA will do what  they did not do; that is, to make our citizens whole?
