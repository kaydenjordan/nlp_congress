 Madam President, it has been a little bit over 3 weeks  since my constituent, George Floyd, was murdered by the Minneapolis  police, and for a little over 3 weeks, millions of people have marched  on the streets, raising their voices in grief and anguish to protest  the police brutality and systemic racism that killed George Floyd,  Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Philando Castile, Jamar Clark, and so  many others. But the killing hasn't stopped.   Just last Friday, police in Atlanta killed Rayshard Brooks, shooting  him twice in the back. Just moments ago, it was announced that this  officer will be charged.   The killing will not stop until we take action. The Senate needs to  act now to take up and pass the Justice in Policing Act.   I joined my colleagues, Senators Booker and Harris, in introducing  this bill last week. I am grateful for their strong leadership toward  creating a more fair and equitable justice system.   The scale of the injustice can feel overwhelming, and the path can  seem very long, but passing the Justice in Policing Act would provide  concrete steps on that path. It is a necessary step toward stopping the  killing and advancing our work to make transformative changes that we  need to fulfill the promise of freedom and equality in America.   The Justice in Policing Act would make some of the changes that we  urgently need to stop the scourge of police violence against  communities of color. This legislation would prohibit some of the most  dangerous police practices. It would strictly limit the use of force,  and it would begin holding law enforcement accountable in a system that  was designed to shield them from accountability.   First, the bill prohibits the most dangerous police practices. It  would ban the use of choke holds like the ones the police used to kill  George Floyd and  [[Page S3050]]  Eric Garner. It would also ban no-knock warrants like the one the  police used when they killed Breonna Taylor in her own bed.   Choke holds pose an unacceptable risk, and that risk is not borne  equally. Black men are nearly three times more likely to be killed by  police use of force than White men.   The use of no-knock warrants also disproportionately harms  communities of color. The practice was popularized in the 1990s as a  tool in the war on drugs so that officers pursuing drug charges could  enter a person's home unannounced, with guns drawn, inherently and  unnecessarily endangering their lives.   Communities and activists have been warning us about the inherent  danger and injustice of choke holds and no-knock warrants for decades.  It is long past time to end the debate and to ban these practices  nationally, but experience has shown us that it is not enough to ban  egregious practices. When Los Angeles banned choke holds in 1982,  officers took up batons to beat and subdue civilians.   In 1991, the officers who beat Rodney King actually argued that their  actions were necessary because they weren't permitted to use a choke  hold, and those officers were never held fully accountable.   American policing resists reform and accountability, so it is not  enough for us to ban the most dangerous practices; we need to set a  national standard for police use of force. That is what the Justice in  Policing Act does.   Today, the current standard in law asks only if an officer's use of  force was reasonable, and this makes it nearly impossible to hold  officers accountable because the system--a system designed to protect  officers, not Black and Brown bodies--has built up decades of precedent  excusing officers from the harm that they cause. So if we are serious  when we say that Black lives matter, if we are serious about our  commitment to equal justice, we need to hold police officers to a  higher standard of care in their use of force. That is why the Justice  in Policing Act would set a national use of force standard that asks  whether the force was necessary and hold officers accountable for  exhausting other options before resorting to violence.   The Justice in Policing Act would eliminate qualified immunity for  law enforcement officers and reset the impossibly high standard for  convicting law enforcement officers of a crime. Today, our system  effectively puts cops above the law by insulating them from civil and  criminal liability when they violate the rights of those who they are  sworn to serve. No one should be shielded from accountability for their  actions in a free society.   When we change these rules, we will finally be able to provide long  denied justice for victims of police brutality, their families, and  their communities. But we will also be able to prevent such brutality  in the first place.   When law enforcement officers believe that they will never face  consequences for crossing the line, they will continue to ignore that  line. The Justice in Policing Act will begin to make this change   The House is poised to pass the Justice in Policing Act next week,  and I urge this Senate to take it up. Let's debate it, and let's pass  it.   We are at a crossroad, and we cannot fail to act. Four hundred years  of structural racism cannot be erased by a single piece of legislation  or with a single generation of legislators, but passing this bill is a  crucial step toward ending the killing and the violence against  communities of color. It is a necessary step on the path toward racial  justice.   The path toward justice leads us toward transformative changes to  redefining the role of policing in America. Reimagining policing means  recognizing that not every social ill and every emergency is answered  by calling in the armed officers. We have other better and more  effective tools when dealing with the hurt of mental illness, of  substance abuse, of homelessness, of economic insecurity. Reimagining  policing means asking whether outfitting officers with military-grade  weapons and equipment makes it safer--or does it escalate conflict and  violence and encourage officers to see the communities they serve as  hostile enemies?   Reimagining policing means addressing the overpolicing of communities  of color. It means that we ask questions about whether anyone is really  safer when we surveil neighborhoods, searching for possible violations.  This only feeds the system of mass incarceration.   Reimagining policing means that we reassess our criminal code, our  justice system, and our sentencing laws that irrevocably disrupt lives  and communities for minor offenses with minimal impacts on public  safety.   Above all, reimagining policing means recognizing that our current  system is not inevitable; it is the result of thousands and thousands  of policy choices made over, literally, hundreds of years, designed to  control and punish Black and Brown and indigenous communities--choices  that compound injustice and unequal opportunity.   As we imagine a new way forward, we need to face some uncomfortable  truths about the history of policing in our country. We can, and we  must, make different choices this time. We know better, and we have to  do better.   I want to close by thanking the community leaders and young activists  who are showing us the path forward. This path requires us to be  courageous. It requires us to be humble. It requires us to be  uncomfortable. It requires us to listen. But it is a path rooted in  love and in trust and in hope.   I am committed to walking this path with my constituents, and I am  hopeful that my colleagues and my fellow American citizens will join  me.   Thank you.    Mr. President, today I would like to acknowledge  the life and legacy of Marny Xiong, who had a profound impact on her  community and on Minnesota.   Marny Xiong was a fierce advocate for her community and for students.  During her career, she worked at Hmong International Academy in  Minneapolis prior to serving as an elected leader on the St. Paul  Public Schools Board of Education, including as its elected chairwoman.  As a proud graduate of St. Paul Public Schools, she was a passionate  leader who was dedicated to giving back to her community.   Marny Xiong was also a community organizer. Her vision of equity and  racial justice was an inspiration to many, and she dedicated her life  to that mission. Marny's fighting spirit showed through her tireless  efforts to address the impacts of structural racism. Despite the  magnitude of this challenge, she approached her work and her advocacy  with joy, an infectious smile, and an enduring sense of hope for making  change.   Marny Xiong's lasting impact will continue to be felt by many across  the St. Paul community and the State of Minnesota, and I am proud to  recognize and celebrate her legacy today.                            ____________________
