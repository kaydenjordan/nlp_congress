 Mr. President, on behalf of millions of people with  disabilities, today I wish to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the  establishment of the National Institute on Disability, Independent  Living, and Rehabilitation Research, NIDILRR, and its 40 years of  accomplishments and contributions to the lives of people with  disabilities.   NIDILRR is the Federal agency supporting applied research,  demonstration, training, and technical assistance to enhance the  quality of life of people with disabilities. NIDILRR's mission is to  generate new knowledge and to promote its effective use to improve the  abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their  choice in the community and to expand society's capacity to provide  full opportunities and accommodations for our citizens with  disabilities. NIDILRR carries out its mission by building the capacity  of institutions and individuals to conduct high-quality research in the  major life domains, including employment, participation in the  community, community integration, and health.   NIDILRR plays a unique and critical role in Federal research.  NIDILRR-sponsored projects and programs target populations that include  all disability types and all age groups. While other Federal research  entities fund prevention, cure, and acute rehabilitation research,  which are vital for people with disabilities, NIDILRR invests in  applied research meant to quickly translate to greater independence,  community participation, and employment for people with disabilities.   The many contributions of NIDILRR's grantees cannot be overstated.  Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the researchers and  practitioners whose efforts empower people with disabilities to lead  proud, productive lives in pursuit of independence, community living,  and employment. During October, which is National Disability Employment  Awareness Month, it is important to highlight the major role that  NIDILRR has played in promoting and enabling the employment of people  with disabilities. Over the past 40 years, NIDILRR-funded researchers  have been extraordinarily productive, including in my home State of  Washington. Across the United States, grantees have created more than  1,200 new products, including peer-reviewed publications, intervention  protocols, measurement tools, and software and technologies that impact  the field of rehabilitation and enhance the lives of people with  disabilities.   NIDILRR-funded fellowship programs have trained and supported a  substantial number of emerging scholars, researchers, and policy  implementation experts, including a significant focus on scholars with  disabilities and those from minority communities. NIDILRR-funded  fellows have contributed to substantive policy development in Congress,  including by serving as content experts on my staff at the Senate  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. NIDILRR supports  the ADA National Network, which provides information, guidance, and  training on the Americans with Disabilities Act to businesses,  employers, State and local governments, architects, disability  organizations, and individuals with disabilities. In addition, NIDILRR  also supports AbleData, an information center hosting an extensive  database of assistive technology products and resources to increase  awareness of and access to assistive devices. Finally, NIDILRR supports  the National Rehabilitation Information Center, NARIC, a research  library and information center that promotes access to disability,  independent living, and rehabilitation research information.   The need for NIDILRR's important work will only increase in the  coming decades. Demographic trends indicate a substantial increase in  the number of people with disabilities as a result of the effects of  injuries, illnesses, chronic conditions, developmental disabilities,  and an aging population. NIDILRR will continue to play a critical role  in empowering this growing population of individuals with disabilities  to live the American dream. The next 40 years of NIDILRR hold much  promise for the future of addressing the emerging needs of people with  disabilities and the need for disability, independent living, and  rehabilitation research.   I congratulate the National Institute on Disability, Independent  Living, and Rehabilitation Research on its 40th anniversary and the  significant accomplishments and contributions it has made to enhance  the quality of life for people with disabilities in the United States.  I am proud of the work NIDILRR has funded and the dedicated researchers  and practitioners that have improved employment, participation and  community integration, and health and function for people with  disabilities. I look forward to 40 more years of NIDILRR's continued  contributions to our society.                            ____________________
