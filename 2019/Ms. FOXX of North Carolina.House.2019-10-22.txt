 Madam Speaker, an impeachment inquiry is  one of the most serious actions the House can take. But the gravity of  such proceedings seem to be lost on the Democratic Caucus.   As a reminder, I would like to quote Federalist 65:   [[Page H8373]]     The prosecution of impeachment will seldom fail to agitate the  passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or  less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect  itself with the preexisting factions and will enlist all their  animosities, partialities, influence and interest on one side or the  other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that  the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of  parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.    Speaker Pelosi's impeachment inquiry by fiat has realized this  greatest danger. I call on her to allow for an open debate on this  process immediately.                            ____________________
