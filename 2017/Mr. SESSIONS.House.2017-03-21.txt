 Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee will be issuing  announcements outlining the amendment processes for two measures that  will likely be before the Rules Committee next week.   An amendment deadline has been set for Monday, March 27, at 10 a.m.,  for H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017; and H.R.  1304, the Self-Insurance Protection Act.   The text of these measures will be available on the Rules Committee  website upon this announcement.   Please feel free to contact me or my staff if you have any questions.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    I appreciate the gentleman asking this question.   As the gentleman has previously asked at the Rules Committee, I  advised the gentleman that tomorrow, at 10 a.m., the Rules Committee  will be convening for the purpose of amendment and discussion of the  text that will come, and it would be my belief that that would be  available in the evening hour, as I assume we will still be in.    It is my belief that I will have one.   The gentleman does understand that the CBO, in order to get it  correctly processed, we have not pushed them. They have advised us they  would anticipate having a score, they believe, tomorrow evening.
