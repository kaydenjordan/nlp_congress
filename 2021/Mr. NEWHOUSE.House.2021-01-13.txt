 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for  yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, this is a sad day in our Republic, but not as sad or  disheartening as the violence we witnessed in the Capitol last  Wednesday.   We are all responsible. My colleagues are responsible for not  condemning rioters this past year, like those who barricaded the doors  of the Seattle Police Department and attempted to murder the officers  inside. Others, including myself, are responsible for not speaking out  sooner, before the President misinformed and inflamed a violent mob who  tore down the American flag and brutally beat Capitol Police officers.   Madam Speaker, we must all do better. These Articles of Impeachment  are flawed, but I will not use process as an excuse. There is no excuse  for President Trump's actions.   The President took an oath to defend the Constitution against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. Last week, there was a domestic threat  at the door of the Capitol, and he did nothing to stop it.   That is why, with a heavy heart and clear resolve, I will vote  ``yes'' on these Articles of Impeachment.
