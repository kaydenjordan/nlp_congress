 Mr. President, I rise today to  commemorate the life and legacy of David Mermelstein.   David was born in Kevjazd, Czechoslovakia, on December 21, 1928. In  1944, at just 16 years old, David was sent to the Nazi concentration  camp at Auschwitz until the American liberation of the camp in 1945. He  was the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust. David lost  everything, including documentation of his family's insurance policy.  After 2 years in a displaced persons camp, David came to the United  States in 1948. He met his wife, Irene, who is also a Holocaust  survivor, in New York. Together, they decided to move to Miami, FL,  where they made a lifelong home.   David devoted his life to serving the south Florida Jewish community,  assuming leadership roles in many organizations. He was passionate  about educating our children about the Holocaust. He founded the  Holocaust Survivors of Miami-Dade County, becoming a national advocate  for survivors and testifying before Congress on their behalf on the  need for restitution to obtain the most equitable compensation possible  for the survivors.   David lived through unspeakable horror and dedicated his life to  educating and inspiring those around him. Our memory of all those who  suffered must never weaken, and we must always fight against hate.   David was beloved by all who knew him. He was a fierce advocate and  an inspiration to all who heard his story. David exemplified what it  means to  [[Page S5068]]  love and to make a difference. He will be greatly missed and remembered  forever for his remarkable and inspiring life.   Ann and I are praying for Irene, Helene, Joe Davis, Michael and Lisa  Mermelstein, Debbi Mermelstein, Jenna and Mike Fox, Lindsay Davis,  Brian Davis, and Eli Fox, and all of David's family and friends. We  mourn this very heavy loss, but we are blessed to have known David  Mermelstein and for the work he did to educate and improve the world.  May his memory be a blessing to all.                            ____________________
