 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the HALT Fentanyl  Act. The flow of fentanyl across our unsecure borders is not only a  public health crisis but a national security crisis, as well.   With as much as 90 percent of illicit fentanyl coming from China, the  Chinese Communist Party has a hand in the poisoning of American  citizens.   Our communities are becoming all too familiar with the danger that  this toxic substance poses. Fentanyl poisoning is now the number one  cause of death among adults between 18 and 49, resulting in the deaths  of tens of thousands of Americans.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor the HALT Fentanyl Act, which will  permanently reschedule fentanyl and ensure the Federal Government  recognizes this substance for the deadly threat it is.   It will give our law enforcement the tools they need to combat this  danger, and it will empower researchers to better understand the full  scope of the drug's impact on Americans' health.   We owe a solution to the families who have lost a loved one to  fentanyl. This bill is that solution, and I urge all my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on the HALT Fentanyl Act.                         Recognizing Dr. Clayton Chau     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions  of Dr. Clayton Chau to the people of Orange County and to congratulate  him on his dedicated service to our community.   When I chaired the Orange County Board of Supervisors, I was pleased  to work with Dr. Chau in his capacity as the director of the Orange  County Health Care Agency.   During the pandemic, he stepped up to serve as the county's health  officer. Together, we worked to keep Orange County citizens safe and  informed during a time of unprecedented anxiety.   Dr. Chau understood the importance of protecting the vulnerable while  also preserving livelihoods, supporting workers and businesses, and  maintaining an evenhanded approach.   Thanks to his work, we ensured a successful pandemic response in  Orange County. Dr. Chau has so much to be proud of.   On behalf of Orange County, I thank him for his service and wish him  all the best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
