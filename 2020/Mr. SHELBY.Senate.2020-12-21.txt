 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend  and former colleague, Senator Paul Sarbanes, who passed away December  6, 2020. I join the entire Nation in mourning his passing.   Paul was born in Salisbury, MD, on February 3, 1933. His first job  was busing tables and washing dishes at his parents' restaurant on  Maryland's Eastern Shore. He attended Princeton University, where he  received the Moses Taylor Pryne Honor Prize, Princeton's highest  undergraduate honor. He was a Rhodes Scholar, which earned him  admission to Balliol College of the University of Oxford in Oxford,  England. Upon his return to the United States, Paul attended Harvard  Law School.   In the early 1960s, Paul Sarbanes clerked for Fourth Circuit Judge  Morris A. Soper before entering private practice with two Baltimore law  firms. In 1966, Paul ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in  Baltimore City, where he served on both the Judiciary and the Ways and  Means Committees.   Four years later in 1970, Sarbanes was elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives, representing Maryland's Fourth and later Maryland's  Third Congressional Districts from 1971 to 1977. Paul continued his  public service when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976. Senator  Sarbanes served Maryland well. He sat on many committees but was  chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  prior to my years as chairman.   After serving five terms in the U.S. Senate, Paul retired to Maryland  in 2007. The same year, he earned the Foreign Language Advocacy Award  from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in  recognition of his lifelong commitment to the ancient world's values  and languages.   Paul was admired by many and will be missed by his sons, John and  Michael, his daughter, Janet, and his seven grandchildren. He was known  for his intellect and tenacity and will be remembered for his devotion  to Maryland and the Nation. I ask the entire Senate to join me in  recognizing and honoring the life of Paul Sarbanes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking my good  friend Senator Lamar Alexander for his nearly two decades in the Senate  and his longstanding devotion to improving our country. His dedication  to the people of Tennessee and Americans throughout our Nation has been  unwavering. We have served together in the Senate for 18 years, but he  has been in public service for much longer than that.   I remember when Senator Alexander was first elected to the Senate in  2002. He was no stranger to his new colleagues. Lamar had already  served as the Governor of Tennessee, the president of the University of  Tennessee, and the Secretary of Education under George H.W. Bush. He  also ran for President in 1996 and again in 2000.   We should have seen the writing on the wall then--that Senator  Alexander would be one of the smartest and most ambitious Members we  would serve with throughout our careers.   Born in Maryville, TN, Lamar graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt  University and went on to receive his juris doctor from the New York  University, NYU, School of Law. He then clerked on the Fifth Circuit  for Judge John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans.   Following his time in Louisiana, he moved to Washington to work as a  legislative assistant for then-Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. This  is when he met his beloved wife Honey. They married and had four  children, and his remarkable career took off.   During Lamar's time as a U.S. Senator, he served as the chairman of  the  [[Page S7936]]  Senate Republican conference, an important leadership position in which  he influenced his fellow Members to accomplish conservative  achievements by working in unison.   Currently, Lamar is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions, HELP, Committee-- a``Class A'' committee in the Senate. In  2016, he was instrumental in passing the overwhelmingly bipartisan 21st  Century Cures Act--landmark legislation that has brought new  innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more  efficiently.   I have been blessed to serve with Lamar on the Senate Rules Committee  and the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he is the current  chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.   In this role on Appropriations, he has supported and advanced a host  of important national priorities, such as nuclear security, critical  infrastructure projects across the country, and the science and  research taking place at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I, along  with my colleagues on the committee, am grateful for his hard work to  craft many years of significant and influential funding measures.   Lamar came to the Senate as a staffer and is leaving as chairman of  one of the largest and most significant committees in the Senate. His  impact and leadership during his time here has been both substantial  and constructive.   Lamar and I have travelled the world together. Annette and I have  enjoyed the many hours spent with Honey and him. He will be missed in  the Senate. I thank Senator Alexander for his dedication to the  betterment of our country and wish him all the best in his next chapter  of life.                            ____________________
