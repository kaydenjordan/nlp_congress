 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be  removed as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 50 in order to emphasize my support  of term limits under H.J. Res. 6.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Ohio?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
