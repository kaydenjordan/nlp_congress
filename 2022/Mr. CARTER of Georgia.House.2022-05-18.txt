 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of a beloved member of the Charlton County community, Raymond Wade, Jr.   Tragedy struck our First District community this past week when we  lost Raymond, a football star at Charlton County High School. A rising  senior, Raymond played cornerback and wide receiver and was a respected  leader on his team.   No parent should ever have to bury their child, and when we lose a  young man or woman our entire community suffers. Young people bring  life, energy, and new ideas to the table, and Raymond was no exception.  Among his peers and classmates, Raymond was respected and loved.   Charlton County High School had just begun spring practice and  Raymond's football coach, Russ Murray, was excited for what Raymond  could do in the fall.   There were nearly 100 people involved in the search for Raymond,  exhibiting the impact that he had made. His loss is a tremendous one  that has impacted many.   I will be praying for the Wade family and for the Charlton County  community, as well as Raymond's friends.                            ____________________
