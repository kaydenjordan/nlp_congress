 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, many Kansans have followed the path from  military to political service, names like Pompeo, Roberts, Dole, and  Eisenhower.   I stand on the shoulders of giants. I do so with humility and with  gratitude that the people of Kansas have bestowed upon me such an  honor.   To my fellow Kansans: I won't let you down.   To my colleagues: We will have our disagreements and our debates. We  should. But we should also maintain civility and integrity, and we  should work to make the government more efficient, more accountable,  and more effective.   God bless the 116th Congress and the great people of Kansas, and may  God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
