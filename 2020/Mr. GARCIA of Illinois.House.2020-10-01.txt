 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative  Lowey for this minute.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the revised Heroes Act  because my community cannot wait.   Schoolteachers, flight attendants, and working families are facing  layoffs, and they need our help now.   Tenants and homeowners facing evictions and homelessness need our  support now.   Immigrants with U.S.-born children and U.S. citizens who never  received the stimulus check need our support now.   We passed the Heroes Act 4\1/2\ months ago. Republicans in the Senate  wouldn't even consider it. But this is a bill that we are offering as a  compromise, and it is common ground because, just like my colleagues  across the aisle, I am headed home to my constituents, and I don't want  them to think that we failed them.   House Democrats have done our jobs. We passed relief, and we are  doing it again. It is the President and Senate Republicans who refuse  to pass relief that have failed.   Give the American people the relief that they need so urgently. I  urge adoption.
