 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's proposed waters of the  United States rule is a blatant example of Federal overreach. The rule  will lead to further regulatory burdens on our farmers, and it gives  unelected bureaucrats more power to dictate how landowners manage their  own property.   Under this new guidance, the EPA would have broad authority to  determine what is considered a navigable  [[Page H1234]]  water, which could potentially include anything from a pond to a  puddle.   I would remind the President that American farmers are the original  conservationists. They know how to take care of the land because that  land is their livelihood.   The administration has already made life harder for our agricultural  community through skyrocketing input costs, oppressive environmental  regulation, and a war on fossil fuel. We should be supporting farmers'  efforts instead of hamstringing them.   Do you know the water that I am most concerned about? It is not  ponds. It is not puddles. It is the swamp here in D.C. that wants to  take away our hard-earned property and take over every aspect of  American life.   I was proud to just vote for the passage of H.J. Res. 27 today to  nullify this terrible Biden waters of the U.S. rule.                            ____________________
