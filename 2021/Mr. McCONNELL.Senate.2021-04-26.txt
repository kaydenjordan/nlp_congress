 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the weekend, the University of  Kentucky's women's volleyball team made history. The Wildcats hoisted  the program's first NCAA volleyball national championship trophy after  defeating Texas on Saturday night. The falling confetti in Omaha closed  out an incredible 24-win season. The Wildcats' unmatched athleticism  and resilience fueled their paths to the title.   Yesterday afternoon at UK's Memorial Coliseum, enthusiastic fans  welcomed home their champions, including Madison Lilley, who was named  the tournament's ``Most Outstanding Player.''   So I would like to extend the Senate's congratulations to the  players, Head Coach Craig Skinner, and the entire program. Kentucky and  all of Big Blue Nation couldn't be prouder.
