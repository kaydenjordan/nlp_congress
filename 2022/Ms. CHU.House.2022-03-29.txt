 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2954, the  Securing a Strong Retirement Act. This bill continues the work the Ways  and Means Committee began 2 years ago with the SECURE Act to expand  access to retirement savings and enhance retirement readiness  for millions of Americans across the country.    I am especially proud of provisions drawn from my bill, the  Encouraging Americans to Save Act, that strengthens the Saver's Credit.  This credit provides millions of low- and middle-income taxpayers with  an incentive to save for retirement each year. But currently it is  split into three tiers of 10, 20, or 50 percent.   This legislation not only directs the IRS to promote the credit to  more communities, including those with limited English proficiency, but  also makes it both simpler and more generous by setting it at 50  percent for all eligible taxpayers.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
