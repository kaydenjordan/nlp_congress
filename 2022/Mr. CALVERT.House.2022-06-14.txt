 Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to welcome  now-Representative Connie Conway as the newest Member of the U.S. House  of Representatives.   Congresswoman Conway is a proud, lifelong resident of California's  San Joaquin Valley. She has dedicated the better part of her life to  public service as a county supervisor, a legislator in the California  State Assembly, and as the California Executive Director of the USDA's  Farm Service Agency. The constituents in California's 22nd District  stand to benefit from Congresswoman Conway's vast experience and  dedication.   I congratulate the entire Conway family on this exciting occasion,  including Connie's husband, Craig; her children; and, of course, we  can't leave out her black lab, Jake.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the dean of the California delegation, Ms.  Lofgren, to introduce our new colleague.
