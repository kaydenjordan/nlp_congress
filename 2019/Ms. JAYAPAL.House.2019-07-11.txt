 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this package.   My amendment in this package would help curb the corrupt influence of  foreign money in our politics.   The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution already requires retired  military officers who want to work for a foreign government to first  receive permission from their service in the State Department and to  disclose the nature of their work. My amendment would make the approved  activities available to Congress and to the public.   We still have a long way to go to constrain foreign influence  peddling and corruption in Washington. We saw this with General Flynn,  who concealed his work lobbying for the Turkish Government in a dispute  with the United States in the 2016 Presidential election.   We trust our retired military officials to speak in the best interest  of the United States, and when they are being paid to further another  country's agenda, we deserve to know.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment package.
