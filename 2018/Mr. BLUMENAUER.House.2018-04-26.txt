 Mr. Speaker, last week, the House Agriculture  Committee passed a bill out that would reauthorize the farm bill. This  is the most important bill that most Americans don't pay that much  attention to. Sadly, I don't think it gets the attention that it needs  here in Congress.   This is just the beginning of a long process to deal with the bill  that is going to be the most important health bill that this Congress  will consider, because it would have us continue to subsidize a diet  that literally makes Americans sick. It is the most important  environmental bill, in terms of carbon emissions and water quality, and  it makes a big difference for the men and women who are in the  agriculture sector.   There are long-term challenges that we face, such as beginning  farmers and ranchers and what happens in terms of transition. The  average farmer is 58.2 years of age. What are we going to do to provide  the workforce for the future, to transition lands, to be able to get  the most out of the investment in the lands?   The bill that is awaiting House action--and I hope it awaits House  action a long time, because there are many things we can do to make it  better--would cut environmental funding, even though only one out of  four applications for environmental programs ever get funded. The  environmental programs are not performance-based to make sure that we  get the most benefit for those dollars.   The bill does not rein in unnecessary subsidies. Indeed, it broadens  loopholes and coverage to have subsidies go to more people who are only  tangentially related to operating the farm and people who don't  necessarily need it.   But the thing that I find most troubling is the provision known as  the King amendment. This provision in the farm bill would prohibit  State and local governments from being able to set their own  protections for agriculture, food, and the environment.   Every State has agriculture and fishing industries that have their  own special needs: pests, disease, and protections for consumers. The  interest of various industries are widely different across the country.  The needs of the fisheries of the Great Lakes are different from those  of the Gulf Coast, New England, and the Pacific Northwest.   The King amendment would prevent States from being able to tailor  protections to their own industry and their own consumers. I strongly  urge my colleagues to investigate what this provision would mean.   There is a great study from the Harvard Law School about an analysis  of H.R. 4879 and the King amendment preempting State laws, for  instance, on sell-by or best-used dates for shellfish, meat, dairy, and  eggs. It would prevent States from stopping the import of pests that  kill fruit, nut, and lumber trees. It would allow fishing vessels to  fish waters of the various States without complying with the rules of  those States, if their States have different provisions. It would even  prohibit pet distributor licenses from being denied animal abusers.   These are the sorts of things that, when the public looks at it, they  are shaking their heads in wonder. Why would Congress have a race to  the bottom for protections for the environment, consumers, and animal  protections?   It is interesting. There was a provision voted on by people in  Oklahoma in the fall of 2016. The so-called ``freedom to farm'' has  many of these same provisions. When the voters in Oklahoma did a deep  dive, they rejected the Farm Bureau's initiative by a 60-40 margin.  That is the State that gave Donald Trump his largest margin of victory  for any State, other than West Virginia.   I hope Congress does what the people of Oklahoma did: look at the  details, understand what it would do, and reject unnecessary  restrictions on the ability of your State and local government to  tailor protections for the people who fish, farm, and shop.   We can do better. I hope that we are going to be able to enlist the  support of the vast majority of Congress to take a moment, pause, and  look at a farm bill that is worthy of this body.
