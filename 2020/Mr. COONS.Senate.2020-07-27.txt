 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague, my  friend, to our American hero who lies in state just now in the Rotunda  of this Capitol, Congressman John Lewis of Atlanta, GA.   Born in Troy, AL, the arc of his life is known to us all. He gave  himself completely to the fight for the dignity of every American and  every human being. I wanted to take a few minutes today, if I could,  and just reflect a little bit on what made John so special and so  different.   There are many in this Chamber in the Senate and in the House of  Representatives who have fought for equality and justice. There are  many who have marched or who have sacrificed, who have fought or who  have led in many causes over many years, but John was both fierce in  his passion for equality and humble in his spirit, gentle and kind.   One of the great blessings of my decade here has been to get to  travel with a group called the Faith & Politics Institute on an annual  congressional civil rights pilgrimage. Many Members of the House and  Senate have done so. Through five different trips I got to travel with  John--to Selma and Birmingham, to Memphis and Montgomery, to Charleston  and Cape Town, to South Carolina and South Africa, to Alabama and to  Delaware--I most treasure the memory of hosting John in Delaware in  2015 when he came and spoke to a whole school full of eager elementary  school kids. He spoke to a whole auditorium full of young community  leaders and then held a townhall for a discussion about equality and  equity and civil rights.   John dedicated his life to fighting for others and principally  fighting for voting rights. When John, in his childhood, was confronted  with the ugly reality of Jim Crow and the legal segregation of  apartheid in the United States, he couldn't follow the advice he was  given by family and friends to ``stay out of trouble. Don't get in the  way.'' He lived his life by the credo: If you see something wrong, act  like it. He was dedicated to getting ``into good trouble,'' into  ``necessary trouble,'' and into doing the hard work of redeeming the  soul of America.   Long before America came to believe in John Lewis, he believed in the  promise of America. That he today lies in state on the catafalque that  also held the remains of the slain President Abraham Lincoln; that he,  this week, will lie in state in the State capital of Alabama; and that  he will be honored by millions nationwide and worldwide is just a  reminder that he was on the right side of history all along. He was  arrested more than 40 times in the course of his activism for civil  rights, and he proved that courage, as has been often said, is not the  absence of fear but the triumph over it.   With many others, I had the blessing of being at the Edmund Pettus  Bridge with John on several reenactments of that memorable Bloody  Sunday march and was with him at Brown Chapel AME Church for a service  of inspiration, gathering before that reenactment of the march. He  stopped halfway across the bridge and asked each of us to just take a  moment and pause at the bridge, which has a crest to it. He recounted  how, as they cleared that crest, this line--two by two--of peaceful  protesters, marchers seeking to go from Selma to the State capital to  make their plea for access to that most fundamental of rights in our  democracy--the ballot box--he could see that line of State troopers, of  deputies, and a ragtag crowd of those who had gathered to do violence  to those protesters and marchers. He was not gripped with fear. He was  determined to go ahead even though he said he was certain that might be  his last day.   You see, John is someone who understood the redemptive power of  suffering, someone whom I described as a living saint, someone who was  willing  [[Page S4502]]  to take onto himself the violence visited upon millions of others in  sustaining the brutality and the repression of racial segregation in  our country. And by taking on and believing in and living a philosophy,  a theology, an activist stance of nonviolence, John brought alive the  conscience of a nation.   I will just say that in my own life, John was someone who made me  believe in the possibility of forgiveness, of redemption, and of  healing. If a man who had suffered as he did at the hands of so many  bigots, so many acts of violence and disrespect, from the lunch counter  sit-ins, to the freedom riots, to that march on Bloody Sunday; if that  man could be as hopeful, as kind, as generous in spirit, and as  forgiving as he was to all who met him, holding on with fierceness to  his commitment to justice and equality, yet openhearted and openhanded  to all he met; if that man could have walked among us, then I am one  step closer to believing in the possibility of forgiveness for us all.   I want to express my deepest condolences to his son, John Miles  Lewis, and his family and to all who knew and loved and served with  him. It is my hope that his legacy will be a blessing, a challenge, and  an inspiration for every American.   There is now on the floor of this Senate the Voting Rights  Advancement Act, renamed for John Lewis. On the 50th anniversary of the  march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I carried a copy of that exact  bill of that Congress, named the ``John Lewis Voting Rights Restoration  Act,'' and asked a number of my colleagues if they would join in  cosponsoring it. One Republican did--a Senator from Alaska--and many  Democrats. What matters is not the party but the purpose.   I will close by saying that we should never give up on John's pursuit  of a more fair and equal America   Mr. President, I was going to proceed to make remarks on another  individual, but I will gladly yield to the majority leader.    Mr. President, on the day that we are remembering our dear  friend and colleague John Lewis, ``someone who got in good trouble,  someone who got in the way,'' I rise to join with my colleague from the  State of Rhode Island to offer tribute to a dear friend who also knew  how to get in good trouble and get in the way.   Our friend Steve Susman of Houston, TX, at age 79, passed away on  July 14 after sustaining serious injuries from a cycling accident and  suffering from COVID-19. Steve will be remembered by all he inspired as  one of the greatest trial attorneys ever in the United States. Steve is  someone who, with incredible skill, prepared painstakingly, mastering  the facts, so that he could back up every single thing he said in front  of a jury.   When it came to courtrooms, it is said that Steve was the smartest  guy in the room, but he also believed deeply in teaching young lawyers  trial skills. And unlike many famous and leading trial attorneys, he  was happy to share the spotlight with younger lawyers--in fact,  insisted on it. Two of those younger lawyers happen to be friends of  mine from law school, Jonathan Ross and Andrew Golub, who first  introduced me to Steve and gave me the joy of getting to know him and  all who practiced with him.   Steve was passionate about law and justice. He spent his entire life  thinking and talking about and working for ways to improve the system  of civil justice in America. Motivated by a deep passion for the law,  he fought to improve our system and was a crusader. Respected broadly  for his leadership and his ability to achieve justice for his clients,  Steve is someone who left a lasting impact on his community and our  country.   His incredible generosity to Yale University, to the University of  Texas Law School, to the NYU Law School Civil Jury Project, and to the  Anti-Defamation League, among many others, will be remembered for years  and years to come. Steve had boundless energy, deep affection for his  family, and a passionate commitment to the law.   This is a difficult time for his family, his friends, his colleagues,  and his loved ones. I want to give my special condolences to his wife,  Ellen; his children, Harry, Stacy, Whitney, and Amanda; his brother,  Tommy; and his eight grandchildren. I share with them my deepest and  sincere condolences in the passing of this lion of the law. We will not  see his like again.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Rhode Island.    So our respect to Steve Susman, a man of rare courage.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
