 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I  will continue to work with the Senator from Washington State, as we  always do, and on a comprehensive response to the this issue, the  coronavirus. She and I have had four briefings, and we will have  another one tomorrow. We have a history of being able to come to  agreement on these matters.   The idea of there being paid sick leave is a good idea, but if  Washington, DC, thinks it is a good idea, Washington, DC, should pay  for it. When I  [[Page S1682]]  was the Governor of Tennessee, nothing used to make me more unhappy  than when some well-meaning individual in the U.S. Senate or U.S. House  would come up with a big idea, pass it, take credit for it, and send me  the bill.   Employees are struggling, and so are employers struggling, but it is  not a cure for the coronavirus to, in the middle of this matter, put a  big, new, expensive Federal mandate on employers who are struggling.  Paid sick leave is a good idea, and we do it in my office. The Federal  Government now does it, and many businesses do it. Yet, if the Federal  Government wants to require it, the Federal Government should pay for  it.   I object.
