 Madam Speaker, in just the last few weeks,  Congress has sent a number of critical bills to President Biden's desk.   This includes legislation to finally make lynching a Federal hate  crime, after more than 200 attempts across a century.   It includes sweeping legislation to reform and repair the Postal  Service, ensuring every American gets their mail on time.   And it includes the government funding bill signed into law by the  President today. The law reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act,  sends critical aid to Ukraine, cuts childcare and education costs for  families, supports our veterans, launches President Biden's Cancer  Moonshot initiative, and so much more.   What is more, this flurry of activity comes on top of the historic  bipartisan infrastructure law.   Together with President Biden, we are delivering results for the  people--results not rhetoric, solutions not sound bites, headway not  headlines.                            ____________________
