 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of every American child  who is going to bed tonight hungry. I rise on behalf of the food  insecure child and the meal insecure child. Pandemic-era lunch programs  have expired, and that number is now 10 million. That is more than the  entire populations of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Detroit  combined.   I was meeting with the school administrators of Farmington Hills, and  they were telling me 40 percent of our children are food insecure. This  is impacting Oakland County, Michigan.   We have a bill to address this, as we did last term in the Congress,  the Healthy Meals, Healthy Kids Act. Let's get this passed. Let's work  together.   My colleagues are talking about school choice. Let's make sure that  when students go to school, they have lunch guaranteed.                            ____________________
