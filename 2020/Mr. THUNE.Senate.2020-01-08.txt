 Mr. President, let me say that I, along with I think most  Americans, am grateful that in the rocket attacks launched last night  by Iran, there were no American casualties. I think I, like most of our  colleagues here in the Senate, I hope, will have an opportunity later  today to hear from the administration about the state of events there  and what the plans are going forward.   We all know it is a dangerous part of the world. It has been that way  for decades. The Iranian influence there is a  [[Page S68]]  malign influence that has put at risk and in jeopardy not only American  lives but lives of countless people throughout that region.   Mr. Soleimani, who was removed in the last few days, of course, was  responsible for hundreds of American deaths. His loss is something that  I think people not only in this country but certainly people in that  region of the world benefit from because he will no longer be able to  conduct and operate and commit terrorist attacks and bring about death  to people all over that region of the world.
