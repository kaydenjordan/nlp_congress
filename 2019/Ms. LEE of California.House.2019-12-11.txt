 Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank the  chairman for his leadership and for ensuring paid parental leave for  Federal employees.   I strongly support this and many other provisions in this bill.  Unfortunately, this bill does not include very important provisions,  such as the provision to end support for the Saudi-led coalition in  Yemen, and two provisions I fought to include that would help end our  forever wars.   The first is the repeal of the 2001 authorization to use military  force, which is a blank check for endless war.   The second is the repeal of the 2002 AUMF. The House passed my  amendment to repeal the 2002 AUMF. It makes absolutely no sense that  this outdated AUMF still exists. We must restore some congressional  authority on matters of war and peace and finally repeal these AUMFs.   Also, I encourage my colleagues to read The Washington Post's  recently published ``Afghanistan Papers,'' if they need any more  justification for why Congress must reassert itself in matters of war  and peace. I can tell you, it is an appalling and shocking read.   Finally, the bill before us authorizes a Pentagon budget of about  $733 billion, which is the largest ever authorized. Given the waste,  fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon, the failure of the Pentagon to pass  an even basic audit, and the unnecessary spending, I am simply unable  to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work, and I thank him for  yielding.
