 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1163,  the Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the words ``unprecedented''  many, many times. Today we stand at an unprecedented crime scene.   During the course of the pandemic, the American taxpayers were  subjected to one of the greatest heists ever committed, to the tune of  about $191 billion in improper unemployment payments.   My colleague across the aisle said: Yeah, they received the money  accidentally. Well, if I walk up across the street and find a $20 bill  accidentally dropped by someone else, do I not owe that money back to  them? Is it mine to keep? No, it is not. It is to be given back. This  is what was done from payments to the American taxpayers who did not  deserve the money.   Of course, the spending spree by the Biden administration wants to  continue by adding ballooning debt to our national deficit.   Today, House Republicans are presenting a solution to this  unprecedented problem. We are not raising taxes or spending our  grandchildren's money. We are merely asking for money back that was not  owed to those people.   It is simple. Why not reclaim the billions of dollars in improper  payments before spending another cent of taxpayer money? Even  schoolchildren would understand what is at issue.   It is past time to rectify this disaster and hold those accountable  who got money that they did not deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
