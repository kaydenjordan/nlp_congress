 Madam Speaker, we are here today to fundamentally do our  jobs. That is something that we ask of our troops every single day  across the world on the front lines in places like Iraq, Syria,  Afghanistan, and throughout Africa.   There is bipartisan concern, bipartisan recognition that Iran has ill  will towards the United States, that Iran is an enemy of the United  States, that Iran wants nothing more than to see our country and our  democracy die.   The most solemn responsibility that we have in ensuring that that  doesn't happen is upholding the fundamental principles of our country  and of our democracy, of showing that we have the courage here in  Congress to uphold that oath, that same oath that we ask our troops to  uphold in far more difficult circumstances every single day.   Iran is threatened by us because of the values that we represent and  the power that those values carry in the world. It is when we abandon  those values, when we undermine those principles, when we forget that  oath to our Constitution that our enemies start to win.   I have fought Iranians on the ground in Iraq. I have seen Iranians  kill Americans. I remember how much more accurate the Iranian mortars  were than the Iraqi ones we were used to facing. I get this, but I also  never forget that oath that we took, and this resolution, passing this  resolution is about upholding that oath to our Constitution.
