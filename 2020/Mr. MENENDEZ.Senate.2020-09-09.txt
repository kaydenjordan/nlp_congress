 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  support for the resolution introduced by my colleagues, Senators  Duckworth and Reed. I thank both of them, not only for acting swiftly  to defend the honor of our servicemen and servicewomen but for their  distinguished service to our country, both of them veterans themselves.   By now, we are used to Donald Trump saying a lot of dishonorable,  distasteful, and downright disgusting things, but there truly is no  bottom when it come to this President, as is evident in the despicable  comments he made about our fallen soldiers as reported last week by The  Atlantic, comments that have since been confirmed by additional  reporting from FOX News, which is normally very supportive of the  President, and the Associated Press. He called these heroes, these  fallen soldiers, ``suckers'' and ``losers''--``suckers'' and  ``losers.''   The Atlantic reports that, while traveling in Europe to commemorate  the end of World War I back in November of 2018, President Trump  canceled a scheduled visit to honor those buried at Aisne-Marne  American Cemetery. He didn't understand why he should bother visiting  such a cemetery in the first place. ``It's filled with losers,'' he  said. Can you imagine? Can you imagine?   It was on that same trip that President Trump referred to our marines  who died in battle at Belleau Wood as ``suckers'' for getting killed-- ``suckers'' for getting killed--``losers'' and ``suckers.''   Those words are hurtful words. They are damaging words. They are  words that should never be spoken by a Commander in Chief. It is  unthinkable, it is unforgivable, and I think it is un-American.   The same story also recounts the President's visit to Arlington  Cemetery with then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, himself a  Gold Star father, who lost his son Robert in 2010 in Afghanistan.  Standing over 1st Lt. Robert Kelly's grave, the President of the United  States turned to his father and said, ``I don't get it. What was in it  for them?''   ``What was in it for them?'' This question captures the very essence  of what is so deeply wrong with this President. In other words, why  would any American give their life in service to our country? Why would  anyone do anything if not for fame or fortune?   You see, Donald Trump cannot fathom the idea of serving a cause  greater than yourself because Donald Trump only serves himself. He  cannot understand why anyone would choose to live a life of service;  why anyone would risk it all to carry our flag on the battlefield; why  anyone would put their own life on the line to defend our country, our  people, and all that we as Americans stand for.   Since these despicable comments came to light, the White House has  bent over backwards to deny them. Once again, too many of our  Republican colleagues have stood silent, instead of forcefully and  unequivocally condemning the President's words. They would rather cower  to the cruelty of Donald Trump than stand up to those who have worn the  uniform of the United States.   The sad truth is that none of us have to stretch our imaginations to  picture President Trump calling our fallen soldiers ``suckers'' and  ``losers'' because he has repeatedly denigrated our men and women in  uniform and the entire concept of military service.   This is a man who, according to a New York Times investigation, had  his wealthy father reportedly pay off a doctor in order to get a  medical deferment from serving in Vietnam; a man who spoke out against  disabled veterans selling goods on ritzy Fifth Avenue in New York City;  a man who said that our late colleague, Senator John McCain, whom I was  privileged to work with on so many national security issues, was no war  hero--he is not someone who should be praised because he was caught, a  prisoner of war--and resisted lowering U.S. flags in his honor; a man  who has publicly attacked Gold Star families and failed to grasp the  weight of their sacrifice; a man who, when asked about America's  soldiers injured in the Iranian missile attack last January on Al Asad  Airbase in Iraq, shrugged off traumatic brain injuries as nothing more  than a mere headache; and, most recently, a man who, as Commander in  Chief, has done nothing--absolutely nothing--in response to revelations  that the Kremlin was awarding bounties to Taliban terrorists for  killing U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan--the Kremlin, Russia, giving  Taliban soldiers a bounty--a premium, a prize, a bonus--for killing  U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.   What message does it send to the children of fallen soldiers when  they read that the President called their parents ``losers'' and  ``suckers''? What message does it send to the young people I will speak  with this weekend,  [[Page S5498]]  whom I host an academy weekend with, who are considering applying to  some of our Nation's most prestigious military academies?   What message does it send to adversaries like Vladimir Putin to learn  that the President of the United States thinks that our service men and  women on the ground in Afghanistan are suckers for being assassinated  by Taliban terrorists?   Article II of the Constitution does not give much instruction when it  says that the President shall serve as Commander in Chief; yet somehow,  every President, until now, has carried out their responsibilities with  a reverence for the men and women who serve our country and a sense of  gratitude for those who give their lives in defense of our freedoms.   Let me close with the words of a Gold Star mother from southern New  Jersey. Camden County Freeholder Melinda Kane's son, Marine LCpl Jeremy  Kane, died in Afghanistan more than a decade ago. She wrote:         I am nauseated to think that the commander in chief of our       military would even think to disparage individuals, like my       son, who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to every       American. . . . For the parents raising children whose       fathers and mothers have given everything to this country,       how do they explain President Trump's words? These brave       Americans served with honor, integrity and heroism doing the       things that civilians could not and would not do. That said,       here we are today, in a place we never thought we would be--      ensuring the world knows that those that serve our country       are heroes.    Today, I want to say to our service men and women--from the young  recruit who just enlisted, to the soldier patrolling distant lands, to  those who wore the uniform, to the loved ones of those who lost a loved  one at war--you deserve an apology from our Commander in Chief. Because  you are not likely to get one, I think it is important to say it here  on the floor of the U.S. Senate: You are not suckers. You are not  losers. You are heroes. Your families deserve our admiration and  support for their sacrifices. The American people will always value you  for bravely bearing our country's cause, even when the President of the  United States will not.   I yield the floor
