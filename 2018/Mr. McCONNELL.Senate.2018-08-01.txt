 Mr. President, for more than a week, the Senate has  carefully considered a set of four appropriations bills.   Together, they will account for about one-eighth of the discretionary  spending for the next fiscal year. They allocate funds for a variety of  pressing needs in communities around the country, and they represent  four more steps toward the goal this Senate has set to fund the  government through regular appropriations and to steer clear of another  omnibus.   A lot of attention has rightly been paid to huge priorities where  this legislation will bring major progress: our mission to renew  America's infrastructure and the ongoing fight against opioid addiction  and abuse.   Both are urgent challenges. In one survey last year, 81 percent of  Americans said the opioid epidemic is either a major problem or a full- blown emergency, and more than half said infrastructure investment was  a ``very important'' or ``extremely important'' priority. These are two  priorities we share throughout this Congress--both parties, both  Houses, and with the President.   Here are just a few of the provisions in this legislation: billions  of dollars of investment in rural communities for everything from  electric and telephone infrastructure to water infrastructure, to  broadband internet, to small business loans; a $10 billion overall  increase from 2017 for infrastructure needs; and tens of millions for  opioid prevention, including grants for distance learning and  telemedicine so rural America is better equipped to strike back against  the scourge of addiction.   Of course, infrastructure and fighting opioids are only part of what  these bills encompass.   They will fully fund the Federal Government's efforts in agriculture,  transportation, housing and urban development, the interior,  environment, financial services, and general government. That includes  essential routine services, from the Forest Service to food safety  inspections. It includes many targeted programs that have an outsized  impact on local communities.   My fellow Kentuckians and I are glad this legislation will help us  expand rural internet access, invest in new highways and bridges,  reclaim abandoned mines, and contain the invasive  [[Page S5528]]  Asian carp that threaten our waterways. The list goes on and on. I know  every community and every State could write its own list. This  legislation matters to every Senator. It matters to all Americans.   I am grateful to Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and subcommittee  Chairmen Murkowski, Collins, Hoeven, and Lankford for all of their hard  work. We have considered these bills carefully. We have voted on a  number of amendments. This morning, we will consider more amendments  and then pass this bill.   Now, this appropriations package is not the only important business  the Senate has been working on this week.   Yesterday, we passed an important extension of the National Flood  Insurance Program and sent it to the White House for the President's  signature. We confirmed the 24th circuit court nominee already in this  Congress, and we voted to proceed to conference with the House on the  farm bill.   I understand this year marks the earliest, since at least 1965, that  both the House and the Senate have passed a farm bill. Here in the  Senate, it passed with the widest margin of any recorded vote in the  history of this legislation. So Chairman Roberts and Senator Stabenow  deserve our congratulations and appreciation. I look forward to serving  as a conferee myself and to finishing up the farm bill prior to its  expiration.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before we adjourn this week, the Senate  will also finalize the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Once we pass the conference report this week,  this important legislation will head to the President's desk to become  law, and we will have fulfilled one of this body's most solemn  responsibilities.   The NDAA builds on the progress we made earlier this year in the  bipartisan budget agreement, which provided for the largest year-on- year increase in funding for American Armed Forces in 15 years. This  legislation authorizes programs that will contribute to the combat  readiness of America's military to meet emerging and persistent global  threats. It helps to ensure that our servicemembers and their families  will receive the full support of a grateful Nation. When we pass the  fiscal year 2019 National Defense Appropriations Act, which funds these  programs, we will have gone yet further in meeting our commitments to  an all-volunteer force.   The NDAA has global and nationwide significance, but it also has  tremendous local importance. In representing the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, I know just how significant an impact this legislation will  have on some of our Nation's finest.   At Fort Campbell, members of the 101st Airborne Division and a number  of Special Operations units will benefit from the authorization of new  investments in their training facilities.   At Fort Knox, the Army's Human Resources Command and Recruiting  Command will receive the support they need to modernize officer  personnel management, and the post will receive much needed certainty  and authority for its energy savings program.   At the Blue Grass Army Depot, critical work to support chemical  weapons demilitarization will continue because this bill authorizes the  resources necessary to conduct safe operations.   Servicemembers will benefit from a well-deserved raise in military  pay and expanded authority for military family housing and education.   So none of my colleagues need to look far to find examples of how the  needs of our servicemembers will be met by the legislation before us.   Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee carefully developed  it. It reflects more than 300 amendments, and it rightly bears the name  of our colleague and friend John McCain. I know he is proud of all this  legislation accomplishes for our men and women in uniform.   I also thank the senior Senator from Oklahoma and the ranking member  from Rhode Island for steering this bill through conference. I look  forward to sending it to the President's desk this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, the U.S. economy  continues to receive a lot of attention.   In June, from the New York Times: ``New milestones in jobs report  signal a bustling economy.''   In July: ``Sales of small businesses are going through the roof.''   Just yesterday, in the Wall Street Journal: ``U.S. workers get  biggest pay increase in nearly a decade.''   Let's explore the last headline.   According to data from the Department of Labor, employee compensation  grew by 2.8 percent over the past 12 months. That is the fastest  employers have increased what they spend on employee pay and benefits  in any 12-month period since the one that ended in September of 2008.  Given what we know about the labor market, this is hardly surprising.  From Main Street businesses to manufacturers, job creators are faced  with heightened demand. That means more Americans can come off the  sidelines and find a quality job, and that means that businesses  compete to hire and retain workers.   Every week--practically every day--yields more impressive headlines,  more testimony from middle-class families and small businesses about  how this economy has improved their lives.   It has been little more than 7 months since a united Republican  government passed historic tax reform, and it has been about as long  since the House Democratic leader predicted our policies would bring  about ``Armageddon,'' and about 7 months since my friend the Democratic  leader, here in the Senate, predicted that no part of tax reform would  turn out to suit the needs of the American worker--none of it.   But Republicans saw past the scare tactics and did what we knew to be  right for the country. We pursued a pro-growth agenda to get  Washington's foot off the brakes that were restraining job creators, to  take Washington's hand out of the pockets of working families, and to  help create the conditions for communities across the country to  succeed. Any one of these goals could have been a bipartisan priority,  just like all of the other good work I have discussed this morning.   Tax reform, historically, had been bipartisan, but this time, our  colleagues listened to the far left and decided to stand in complete  partisan opposition to letting Americans keep more of their own money.  Now the American people are reaping the benefits of a pro-growth, pro- opportunity agenda. Now they see whose policies benefit them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of H.R. 6147, the  Senate proceed to the consideration of the conference report to  accompany H.R. 5515; that the cloture motion on the conference report  be withdrawn; that there be up to 1 hour of debate on the conference  report, with 30 minutes under the control of Senator Rubio and 30  minutes under the control of the managers; and that following the use  or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the adoption of the  conference report without intervening action or debate.    Madam President, very briefly, on another point, I  want to take a moment, as we wrap up this appropriations package, to  recognize the distinguished tenure and leadership of our chairman,  Richard Shelby.   Earlier this year, Senator Shelby cast vote No. 10,000 right here on  the Senate floor. Like so many of his accomplishments, that landmark  seemed to slip by without a whole lot of fuss, but what a remarkable  milepost in a very distinguished career.   I imagine this year's appropriations process holds special  significance for our chairman. As he took the reins of the committee,  he made clear that in working with Senator Leahy, regular order would  be the name of the game. He set his sights on restoring the kind of  collaborative process that has historically made our institutions so  unique. As we all know, that is a little bit easier said than actually  done. Yet, the committee completed a markup process that reported out  all 12 spending bills faster than it had in any year since 1988. That  was three decades ago. When we close out this package, the Senate will  have passed a majority of its annual appropriations measures by the  beginning of August for the first time since 2000--18 years ago.   I am sure my fellow members of the Appropriations Committee would  agree with me that this productivity is due, in large part, to the  leadership of our chairman, Richard Shelby.   So on behalf of the whole Senate, I want to thank him for the work he  has done so far and for the accomplishments on behalf of the American  people that are yet to come. I want to thank Senator Leahy, as well,  and all of our other colleagues on the committee for their  contributions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before we wrap up, I would be remiss if  I let the day pass without calling our attention to two veteran Senate  staff members who are concluding their distinguished service this week.   Patrick Renzi has served the U.S. Senate for 27 years, rising to  chief reporter in the Office of Official Reporters of Debates.   Patrick is a native of Silver Spring, MD. His mother Eileen also  worked in transcription, including here in the very same office, but,  as my colleagues know well, no route to the Senate is a straight line.  After completing his studies at the University of Maryland and Strayer  College, Patrick moved furniture, tried freelance court reporting, and  recorded a brief, forgivable stint working over in the House of  Representatives. But by 1991, he had returned to where it all began.   Over the next 27 years, Patrick became a key staff member, updating  the technology and team that keep the Office of Official Reporters  running smoothly. His staff describe him as a stalwart chief with great  respect for the Senate and those with whom he has served.   Mr. President, Scott Sanborn currently serves as the Senate Journal  clerk. He arrived in this body back in 1979 as a page for Lowell  Weicker, our former colleague from Connecticut.   Scott wound up serving the Secretary's legislative staff as an  assistant bill clerk. I am told he impressed so many colleagues so  quickly that in short order he was asked to serve as assistant editor,  deputy chief reporter, and coordinator of the Congressional Record.   By 2001, Scott had become the 20th Journal clerk of the U.S. Senate.  Along the way, he has helped revolutionize the way the Senate records  and reviews its transcripts. He found ways to increase efficiency and  cost-savings, and he served as a go-to technical liaison, connecting  the official reporters with the Members' offices.   These two gentlemen have combined to contribute, literally, decades  of service to this body. To see them both embark on well-earned  retirements in the same week serves as a useful reminder of just how  many incredibly talented men and women there are who may seldom find  themselves in the spotlight but who are absolutely essential to the  smooth functioning of the Senate in a thousand ways that we all get to  take for granted every single day.   We don't say thank you nearly enough around here. I am honored to be  able to say it today.   Thank you, Patrick.   Thank you, Scott.   We are sorry to see them go, but I know that Patrick's wife Germaine  and their nine children--nine children--and Scott's wife Kim and their  two kids must be happy to see what this next chapter has in store.   So we bid them farewell with gratitude for their time here and best  wishes for the times ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1008.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1009.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls with respect to the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 604, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2345, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 369, S. 1668.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6414, which was received  from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2101 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Donnelly amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed;  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the House message to accompany S. 770.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 770) entitled       ``An Act to require the Director of the National Institute of       Standards and Technology to disseminate resources to help       reduce small business cybersecurity risks, and for other       purposes.'', do pass with amendments.     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House  amendments, and I ask unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, in the marble halls of the Kentucky  State Capitol building in Frankfort, visitors will discover numerous  portraits of those who have served our Commonwealth in our highest  offices. Depictions of Kentucky's Governors, legislators, and supreme  court justices line the halls as memorials to those public servants. On  August 7, another portrait will be added, paying tribute to an  individual who has served our State and our Nation with distinction.   William Thompson Scott, known by his friends as ``Will T.,'' is a  native of Pike County in eastern Kentucky and served as an associate  justice on the Kentucky Supreme Court from 2005 to 2015. Known for his  humor and congenial nature, Justice Scott clearly earned his  colleagues' respect when they elected him to serve a 4-year term as the  deputy chief justice. With the esteem of his peers and those he served,  Justice Scott's tenure on the supreme court can be remembered for his  positive impact on the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Even before his first election to the high court, Justice Scott  actively engaged in the service of our Commonwealth and our Nation for  much of his life. Interrupting his undergraduate studies at Eastern  Kentucky University in 1966 to voluntarily enlist in the U.S. Army, he  proudly served our Nation in Vietnam as a first lieutenant  [[Page S5573]]  and earned the Bronze Star Medal. When he was discharged, he returned  to Kentucky and received his bachelor's degree from Pikeville College  before studying law at the University of Miami in Florida.   After spending a few years as a trial attorney, Will T. found a way  to employ his skills for the good of his neighbors and became an  assistant Commonwealth's attorney for Pike County in 1981. A few years  later, he was elected as a circuit court judge in Kentucky, beginning  what would be his long and distinguished career serving on the bench.   When his portrait joins those of other jurists from Kentucky's past,  Justice Scott's legacy will be enshrined for future generations to  study, interpret, and appreciate. So as Justice Scott's friends,  family, and colleagues gather to honor his career, I would like to ask  my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking him for his service to our  Nation and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my privilege to recognize a  prominent member of Kentucky's agricultural community, David Beck.  During his four decades with the Kentucky Farm Bureau, KFB, David has  been an effective advocate for our farm families and rural communities.  Now, after great success with KFB, he has decided to leave the bureau  for a new challenge. David has accepted the role of president and CEO  of Kentucky Venues, an organization responsible for many of the  Commonwealth's most beloved traditions like the annual State fair.   Graduating from Murray State University in Calloway County with a  degree in agriculture, David set out to dedicate his career to  promoting farm communities in Kentucky. Since joining KFB in 1977 as a  field service director in Central Kentucky, David has worn a lot of  hats within the organization. Advocating in Frankfort and in Washington  and working to implement KFB programs at all levels, he has also done a  lot of good.   In my work on the Senate Agriculture Committee, David has provided me  with many valuable insights helping me better represent Kentucky farm  families. Through multiple fly-ins and Farm Bills, we worked closely to  develop policy to help support our agriculture communities. I would  like to note one important project in particular we collaborated on:  the 2004 Tobacco buyout. This landmark legislation not only reoriented  our Depression-era Federal tobacco program toward the free market, but  it also provided much-needed relief to some of the hardest hit farming  communities in our State. With David's assistance, I championed this  major legislation and worked with my colleagues in Congress to bring it  to the President's desk.   In his role as KFB executive vice president, David has time and again  proven his leadership to benefit the organization's members and farmers  throughout the country. Through seminars, conferences, and workshops he  led with the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, David helped build  the farm economy nationwide. One clear measure of his success is the  growth in our Nation's farm communities during David's time advocating  for American agriculture. The AFBF cites a growth of more than 3  million member families across the Nation in the last four decades. He  has led a remarkable career and has so much to be proud of.   David's dedication to the Commonwealth has extended beyond the farm,  helping families throughout Kentucky thrive. His work with our State's  council on postsecondary education has helped students gain the skills  they need to succeed in the workforce. By serving in leadership roles  for the Kentuckians for Better Transportation, David helped encourage  economic development with a safe and reliable infrastructure network.  His passion for service runs deep, and David's experience continues to  be an asset to the Commonwealth.   On behalf of the many men and women from our home State who have  benefited from his leadership, I would like to express our gratitude to  David for his career at the KFB. As he leaves the bureau to take the  next steps in his career, I wish him the best and look forward to his  great accomplishments to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution on documentary production by the Select Committee on  Intelligence, and ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence  has received requests from the Department of Justice and from the  defendant in a pending criminal case for copies of a transcript of an  interview that the Committee staff conducted of the defendant in April  2018 for use in preparation for trial.   This resolution would authorize the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the  Select Committee on Intelligence, acting jointly, to provide copies of  the interview transcript, under appropriate security procedures, to  both parties in response to this request.                            ____________________
