 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Huntington High School girls basketball team. The team  won the championship title, and they finished their season with a 24-1  record. They are the only team to win in the newly developed AAAA  division.   While there is no ``I'' in team, they were led by Dionna Gray and  coached by the legendary Lonnie Lucas, who has devoted 54 years of his  life to coaching.   Congratulations for this outstanding accomplishment.                            ____________________
