 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my relief that the  House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan compromise that keeps  our government open, secures our border, and upholds our values.   Now, this is not an agreement that either party would have written on  its own, but rather than funding for an ineffective border wall, this  bill, instead, prioritizes border security funding for methods and  technologies that have proven effective.   This bill also rejects irresponsible budget cuts and, instead,  invests additional dollars in important priorities like funding for  economic development assistance programs, environmental protection, and  transportation infrastructure.   I want to thank all of the conferees for working together to forge a  bipartisan consensus to fund government, invest in our priorities, and  keep our country safe.   It is about time that Congress gets to work on more legislative  priorities that will strengthen our families, strengthen our  communities, and strengthen our economy. That is what the American  people elected us to do, and I hope my colleagues will join me in these  efforts going forward.                            ____________________
