 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a recent event  in my district, which I think is good for the local economy but also  good for our Nation.   I have the privilege of representing Electric Boat shipyard, which  for 120 years has been the primary general contractor for submarine  construction for the U.S. Navy.   On October 6, the Metal Trades Council, which is the confederation of  metal trades workers that have individual unions--the boilermakers,  electricians, plumbers, and pipefitters, all the folks that bend steel  and do the amazing work every day in terms of protecting our Nation-- reached a 5-year labor contract with General Dynamics, which I think is  a real testament in terms of showing the value that our country and  Congress actually place on their work, because ultimately they have one  customer, and that is the U.S. Navy, which is funded by the United  States Congress under Article I, Section 8, Clause 13 of the  Constitution which states very clearly that Congress shall provide and  maintain a Navy.   This contract, which was ratified by a 2-1 margin, starting next year  basically takes the starting wage for a semiskilled worker, someone who  has done preapprenticeship training but is kind of entry level, from  roughly $21 an hour, and over the course of the 5-year term, that is  going to grow to $43 an hour. There is a package of health benefits and  retirement that are included in this.   It couldn't happen at a better time right now, because the demand  signal, in terms of submarine construction, has grown by leaps and  bounds, given the challenges that are happening all  [[Page H5184]]  across the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific with China's  increase in its navy.   I have a picture next to me which shows the next submarine that is in  the queue. That is the USS Iowa SSN 797, which went through a  christening recently and is going to be commissioned and deployed in  the near future. There are about 13 more Virginia-class submarines that  are in the production queue, again, to meet this demand signal.   That has actually been even more amplified with the AUKUS agreement,  the new security agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom,  which is going to allow us to help Australia recapitalize its own  submarine fleet, which is diesel-electric today, into nuclear-powered  submarines.   Australian shipyard workers and policymakers are going to be coming  to my district in terms of what I think is going to be one of the  smartest strategic moves our country has made in recent years, bringing  in a great ally that has been with us in every conflict going back to  World War I, is part of Five Eyes, and can definitely be trusted in  terms of critical information like nuclear propulsion technology. This  is something which we have not shared with another country since 1958  when we did it with the British Navy.   I congratulate Peter Baker, who is the head of the Metal Trades  Council, who led the way in terms of negotiating this agreement, as  well as Shawn Coyne from the H.R. department at Electric Boat. This is  going to create an attractive signal to young people, who are being  hiring by leaps and bounds. Just this year alone they have hired 4,400.  In terms of coming into the yard, they are not entering just a job but  actually a career with a very strong, secure economic future for  themselves and their families.   That is good news not only for them and for the region, but also for  our Nation because of the incredibly important work that they do every  day for which we are so grateful.                            ____________________
