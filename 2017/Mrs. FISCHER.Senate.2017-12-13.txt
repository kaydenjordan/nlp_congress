 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to continue my tribute to  Nebraska's heroes, the current generation of men and women who lost  their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of  these Nebraskans has a special story to tell.
