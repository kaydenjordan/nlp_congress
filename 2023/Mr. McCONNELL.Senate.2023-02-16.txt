 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a growing share of American citizens  across the political spectrum say tackling rampant crime must be a top  priority. And it is certainly no mystery why they feel that way. Just  take my own hometown. One neighborhood in East Louisville just endured  more than 30 burglaries in 30 days.   Last year, Washington, DC, saw 203 homicides. Those victims included  18 children, a huge increase over the prior year.   And 2023 is already off to an even worse start. Homicides and  carjackings are already ahead of last year's pace. Last week, the  city's crime wave touched Congress directly. A Congresswoman from  Minnesota, Representative Angie Craig, was attacked in the elevator of  her own apartment building right here in the District.   It turns out the Congresswoman's attacker had been arrested and  convicted no fewer than 12 times before, most recently for assaulting a  Metropolitan police officer. But there he was, this career criminal,  just out roaming the streets.   As the Congresswoman herself put it afterwards:         We have to get these repeat offenders off the street.    You are darn right we do. Unfortunately, the radical local government  here is doing precisely the opposite.   The DC Council has responded to the crime wave--listen to this--with  a new bill to make the city even softer on crime. It lowers maximum  penalties for violent crimes and creates new ways to shorten the  sentences of incarcerated felons.   Well, the good news is the Constitution actually gives the U.S.  Congress final say over issues in our Nation's Capital. And when the  soft-on-crime local government has become completely incompetent; when  Members of Congress can't go about their daily lives without being  attacked; when families cannot come to visit our capital in safety,  then it is about time the Federal Government provides some adult  supervision.   Senate Republicans, led by our colleague from Tennessee Bill Hagerty,  are leading an effort to use the rightful authority of Congress to  address this emergency.   Last week, the Republican House passed their companion bill as well.  And things have gotten so undeniably bad that more than 30 House  Democrats crossed the aisle to support it.   So I hope the Senate Democratic leader will put partisanship aside  and turn to Senator Hagerty's measure quickly when we reconvene. The  safety and security of our citizens simply cannot wait.
