 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to be frank. A bill like this should have  been passed years ago. We know that chokeholds are dangerous, the same  with no-knock warrants in nonviolent Federal cases. This legislation  would have prevented George Floyd's death and the death of so many  other Black and Brown people in America.   We should have acted when Laquan McDonald was killed in Chicago--you  remember, ``16 shots and a cover-up.'' Or Rekia Boyd in Chicago. Or we  should have acted when Tamir Rice was killed for playing with a toy gun  that anyone could buy at their local Dollar General. Yet, still today,  after watching the life and oxygen drain from the face of George Floyd,  my colleagues on the other side still defend the status quo. Some parts  of this bill are not new, but we could never get them passed.   I was part of Speaker Ryan's task force on police accountability: 18  months of meeting with the public and nothing came of it. Well, not  this time, because George Floyd deserves better. Sandra Bland deserves  better. Breonna Taylor, Laquan McDonald, and Oscar Grant deserve  justice. And this is from the niece of three cops, the cousin of one  cop, the auntie of two cops, but also the mother of a Black son and a  Black daughter.   Mr. Speaker, I just have to say one more thing. I get so sick of  hearing Chicago being bantered about. I was here for 5 years and could  not get one gun violence prevention bill passed or signed on to by my  colleagues on the other side. It wasn't until the Democrats took over  that we could at least  [[Page H2478]]  get background checks passed and the Charleston loophole. But, again,  we can't get anything called in the Senate.
