 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, the Gateway program will create the new infrastructure  essential to greater resiliency against future potential storms and  disasters, while enabling repairs to damage and achieve capacity and  reliability-related investments for the needs of the Northeast  Corridor's operators for the next 30 to 50 years.   Without extensive repairs and rebuilding of the existing tunnel,  service reliability is likely to continue to deteriorate due to ongoing  damage from saltwater incursion during Superstorm Sandy, from which we  are still suffering 5 years later, eventually forcing a shutdown of one  or both tubes of the Hudson River Tunnel.   Mr. Lance pointed out and Mr. Nadler pointed out the Northeast  Corridor is not just the Northeast. It services the entire Nation. It  serves a massive economic purpose.   It is essential we stand behind this. This is absolutely essential  infrastructure spending. I support Chairman Frelinghuysen, and I  support the ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee for  their work. Again, it is truly a bipartisan effort and something that  is absolutely essential.   Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of the amendment.                                time  2015
