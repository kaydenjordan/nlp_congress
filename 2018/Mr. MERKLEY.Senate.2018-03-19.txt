 Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss  America's role in the crisis in Yemen.   I have here a picture of the fractured remains of buildings, people  fleeing from those buildings, and a small child, probably in her  father's arms. This represents the challenge of the bombing that is  going on in that nation. I am here tonight to discuss America's role in  that bombing and the fact that here in the Chamber we need to debate  how it is we have come to the point of supporting this bombing when the  War Powers Act clearly says we should not be.   When our Founding Fathers wrote our Constitution, they designated the  President as the Commander in Chief, but they gave Congress, the House,  and the Senate the sole power to declare war. Article I, section 8  states unequivocally: ``The Congress shall have the power . . . to  declare war.''   It is only Congress that can take our Nation from peace to war. If  one has any doubt about that, consider the words of James Madison  himself, the father of our Constitution. He said: ``In no part of the  constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which  confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to  the executive department.''   Now, the clearly stated responsibility in our Constitution was  reinforced by the 1973 War Powers Resolution, often referred to as the  War Powers Act. That particular piece of legislation stated as its  purpose the following: ``It is the purpose of this joint resolution to  fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United  States and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and  the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed  Forces into hostilities.'' It goes on to say: ``The constitutional  powers of the President as Commander-in-chief to introduce United  States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent  involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances,  are exercised only''--and that is a critical word--``pursuant to (1) a  declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a  national emergency created by attack upon the United States.''   The picture I showed you showing the fractured remains of buildings  and people fleeing that bombing in Yemen, that activity is not taking  place subject to a declaration of war by this body--we have done no  such thing--nor is there any specific statutory authorization for our  assistance in that, nor is there a national emergency created by an  attack upon the United States where that is justified.   Tomorrow this Chamber will take up this issue. We will be voting on a  resolution put forward by our colleagues Senator Sanders, Senator Lee,  and Senator Murphy calling for the removal of our Armed Forces in this  role of supporting Saudi Arabia in this war against the Houthis.   There are two basic components of our presence in Yemen, and those  are very distinct and not to be confused. The first is counterterrorism  efforts in which we are directly engaged against associated forces of  al-Qaida. This is a role that stems from the authorization for the use  of military force that we passed in this Chamber in 2001. Members may  come to the floor and argue about whether that initial authorization  for use of military force involving al-Qaida in Afghanistan has been  stretched beyond recognition. I would argue it has been stretched  substantially and perhaps beyond recognition, but that is not the issue  we are debating this week.   This week we are addressing the central issue of whether our  involvement in supporting Saudi Arabia in its role in war against the  Houthis in Yemen has violated our Constitution and the War Powers Act,  and we have to confront and face how our assistance is contributing to  a vast humanitarian crisis in that country. We may not have boots on  the ground in support of the Saudi war against the Houthis, but we are  very involved.   As we judge whether this involvement is violating the Constitution  and the War Powers Act, we should turn to section 8, the interpretation  of the joint resolution. It says:         Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into       hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in       hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall       not be inferred--        (1) from any provision of law . . . including any provision       contained in any appropriation Act, unless--    This is the key--       such provision specifically authorizes the introduction of       the United States Armed Forces into hostilities.    It is very clear. The interpretation of this joint resolution says  there is no room here to be participating in hostilities--that is a  war--even in a supporting role, unless it has been specifically  authorized by Congress. This interpretation of the joint resolution  section of the War Powers Act goes on to say:         (c) For purposes of this joint resolution, the term       ``introduction of United States Armed Forces'' includes--    You see the language here--       the assignment of member of such armed forces to command,       coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the       regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country       or government when such military forces are engaged.    There is the key fact that was laid out when we passed the War Powers  Act. This War Powers Act doesn't just address us directly engaging in  hostilities or directly confronting an enemy on the battlefield, it  includes these provisions of commanding, coordinating, participating in  the movement of, or accompanying military forces of a foreign country.   There is no question that we are coordinating and participating in  the movement of the Saudi forces, so let's take a look at exactly how  we are involved. The administration comes back and says: Yes, but we  are not directly bombing the Houthis. We are not directly putting boots  on the ground and shooting them.   It is clear the War Powers Act includes coordinating with,  participating with, supporting, and partnering, if you will, with a  foreign country involved in such a war. We are very involved.   First, we are involved by refueling Saudi planes en route to bombing  the forces of the Houthis in Yemen. That is pretty direct involvement,  and it goes to that language which says ``participate in the movement  of'' those foreign forces. If we are refueling their planes en route to  bombing the Houthis, we are participating in the movement of their  military forces. A plane, a bomber, is a part of a military force.   Second, we are providing intelligence and thus very directly  supporting this war of the Saudis.   Third, we are selling the weapons to them that they are using in this  war on the Houthis.   Fourth, we are providing targeting assistance. We have even  established a  [[Page S1784]]  joint combined planning cell, an operation center, to conduct military  intelligence activities in partnership with Saudi Arabia.   Here is why this matters so much: It has a huge impact on the lives  of the people in Yemen. It is very possible the planes we refueled are  responsible for conducting a series of three airstrikes in Saada last  month, killing 5 civilians and wounding 14 more, including 4 children,  as well as paramedics trying to pull survivors out of the rubble after  that first strike, or that the planes we refueled played a role in  striking a hotel last August that turned the building's ceiling black  with the charred blood of 50 farmers who were staying in that  building. We know that the bombs we have sold to the Saudis are killing  many civilians. It is time for us here to reckon with that fact.    A lot of Americans may not even know we are involved in this war. It  has not been widely discussed. There are so many things going on across  the planet at this time--so much going on in Syria, for example, that  perhaps Americans in general are not paying attention. But we should be  paying attention because of the carnage that is occurring: 10,000  civilians have been killed since this conflict began. The great, vast  bulk of those civilians are dying from air strikes conducted by Saudi  Arabia that we are supporting through intelligence and target  assistance and refueling. Then there are the consequences of that  bombardment. The result is just a tremendous humanitarian crisis.   The Saudis have been involved in blockading the ability to get  humanitarian supplies into Yemen--food and medicine and fuel. This has  resulted in what the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for  Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock,  has warned could become ``the largest famine the world has seen for  many decades.'' Seven million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation  because of this war that we are involved in and the related Saudi  blockade of food and medicine.   About every day, 130 Yemeni children die from extreme hunger and  disease--130 a day. One of the factors that is killing people is  cholera. Since October of 2016--so roughly a little less than a year  and a half ago--1 million Yemenis have contracted cholera. More than  2,000 have died from it. It is the largest cholera outbreak in recorded  history. Let me say that again: 1 million Yemenis have contracted  cholera, and it is the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history. So  7 million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation, 1 million have  contracted cholera, and so many are dying because of this war we are  involved in.   The death and destruction in Yemen is unimaginable, and the United  States needs to take a hard look at the role we are playing--a role we  are playing in violation of our Constitution and in violation of the  War Powers Act of 1973. That is the issue we are going to be discussing  here on the floor.   I know there is some popularity in saying: Let's not look at that  humanitarian crisis and our role in it; let's just look at the  relationship we have with Saudi Arabia and know that they have helped  us in other cases--for example, the war on ISIS. Let's know that they  are a good customer for many of our products and for many of our  military products. But I say to my colleagues: This issue is bigger  than simply a good marketplace or a good relationship with Saudi  Arabia. This goes to our involvement, our culpability in the deaths of  thousands of Yemenis and 130 children a day through bombs falling on  them, through hunger, starvation, through cholera.   It is hard for me to think about this young child in this picture,  this young Yemeni, who clearly is the victim either of cholera or  starvation or some other consequence of this conflict. But imagine 130  of these children dying every day.   It is our responsibility to honor the Constitution, and it is our  responsibility as humans on this planet to wrestle with the fact that  our involvement is contributing to this vast humanitarian disaster. Let  us not abdicate our responsibility on the basis of friendship with  another nation based on the fact that they are a good market for our  products or that we think they may be future partners in some other  agenda. We have a direct responsibility in war and peace that we have  not fulfilled, and this week, with this coming resolution tomorrow, is  a point that we must wrestle with this. Let us wrestle with it and  honor the Constitution and give some integrity to the 1973 War Powers  Resolution.   Thank you.
