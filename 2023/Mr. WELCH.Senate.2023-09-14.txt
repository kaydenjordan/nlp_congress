 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Grace Potter, a  talented singer-songwriter who was born and raised in Fayston, VT. She  is a Grammy-nominated artist and has been described by Spin Magazine as  ``one of the greatest living voices in rock today.'' As her career as a  musician has reached remarkable heights, she has continued to be a  beacon of hope for her community back home in Vermont.   Music and the arts bring people together and foster healing through  difficult times. Ms. Potter has always used her musical talent to build  community, which is what Vermonters do best. She has consistently  uplifted young musicians and worked to create opportunities for the  arts to flourish in Vermont. These efforts are critical to  strengthening both local economies and the social fabric of our great  State.   Ms. Potter has also spent her career bringing attention to causes  that she is passionate about, including promoting fair trade labeling  and supporting local farmers. At the height of the pandemic, Ms. Potter  hosted a virtual benefit concert with proceeds going to Shift Meals, an  organization which delivers locally grown food to food-insecure  households throughout the State.   After Hurricane Irene devastated Vermont communities in 2011, Ms.  Potter performed benefit concerts to support flood relief efforts.  Catastrophic flooding again hit Vermont this past July and August,  destroying downtowns, damaging businesses, and forcing Vermonters to  evacuate their homes. Thanks to Vermont's indomitable spirit,  communities have come together to rebuild from the flooding. Ms. Potter  has been a critical part of this rebuilding, again hosting multiple  benefit concerts to bring aid to those most impacted by the floods.   Ms. Potter is a source of inspiration for so many, and she stands in  solidarity with those in need of assistance during an incredibly  challenging time. As Vermonters continue to recover from this summer's  floods, we are grateful for Ms. Potter's dedication to the place we  call home.   Thank you, Grace Potter, for your contribution to flood relief  efforts in Vermont and for your embodiment of Vermont values.                            ____________________
