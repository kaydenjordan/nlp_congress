 Madam Speaker, what do you call a country that  institutionalizes child abuse? Tragically, today you call that country  the United States of America.   We have heard the children screaming. We have seen the images of  children being told to go to sleep in cages. We know that children have  been ripped from the breasts of nursing mothers and taken away, maybe  never to be found to be reunited again.   As a mother, as a grandmother, I can't stand it. Madam Speaker, can  you stand it? Can this country stand it? What happens to the soul of  America when we do this to children?   These parents have come with their children, fleeing violence;  thinking they are coming to the land of the free, the home of the  brave; thinking that they are going to be able to get asylum here in  the United States of America or at least a chance to get asylum here  and to be safe, finally, with their children. Instead, they are put in  jail. They are put in prison.   I am here today with Bruce and Felix, children whose parents are in  the gallery. They will go home tonight and sleep in a comfortable bed  while thousands of children are put to sleep in cages.   I say to you, Mr. President: You can end this. This is your decision.  Please, for the sake of our country, for the sake of the children, for  the sake of families, end this now.
