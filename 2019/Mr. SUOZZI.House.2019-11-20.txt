 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huffman for allowing me this  time.   I rise today in support of this bill that I have sponsored, a  bipartisan bill, H.R. 263, which, as has been mentioned, would rename  the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as the Congressman Lester Wolff  Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Grijalva. I want to thank,  again, Congressman Huffman and my colleagues on the Natural Resources  Committee for their work on this bill, as well as the members of the  New York delegation, all of whom are cosponsors of and support this  legislation.   Congressman Lester Wolff, who represented my district for 16 years,  is our Nation's oldest living former Congressman, and, in January, he  will turn 101 years old.   The renaming of the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge in his honor  is in recognition of his monumental contributions to the preservation  and protection of our environment.   These precious wetlands, at Congressman Lester Wolff's urging, were  protected in 1968. It was in 1967 that the New York State Legislature,  at the insistence of then-Governor Nelson Rockefeller and the master  planner, Robert Moses, authorized a bridge across the Long Island  Sound.   Lester immediately saw the bridge would despoil this pristine and  precious resource of the Long Island Sound and soon found himself at  the center of an enormous political fight. Lester eventually won this  fight, and the Oyster Bay Wildlife Refuge was born. Today, it covers  over 3,200 acres of one of the most important areas for natural refuge  anywhere on the north shore of Long Island and is home to many  endangered species.   Not only was Lester a champion for our environment, he also served  our Nation honorably in our military. Lester served in the Civil Air  Patrol during World War II and commanded the Congressional Squadron of  the Civil Air Patrol, rising to the rank of colonel.   In 2014, Wolff received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest  civilian award.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to also support this legislation so  we may honor this great Congressman whose efforts were an important  part of our Nation's environmental history.                                time  1400
