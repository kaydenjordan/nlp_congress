 Madam Speaker, last week, we all learned the  tragic news that a military transport plane crashed into the  Mississippi Delta. Sixteen marines, who courageously fought to defend  our country, died from this unfortunate event.   One of those marines was Sergeant Joe Murray of Jacksonville,  Florida. I would like to take this moment to express our deepest  condolences to Sergeant Murray's family and friends. Our thoughts and  prayers are with you.   Sergeant Murray was a husband to Gayle Murray, and a father of four  beautiful children--Isaac; Annabelle; and twins, Judah and Micah. He  was known for being a family man who cared deeply for those around him.   Murray was a member of a special operations team and was promoted  three times in the first 3 years he was in the Marine Corps and was  deployed to Afghanistan twice.   The son of a Navy man, Sergeant Murray will always be remembered as a  true American hero. I will continue to pray for him and his family and  for every soldier out there protecting our great country.   May he rest in peace, and semper fi.
