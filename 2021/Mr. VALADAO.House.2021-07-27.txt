 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of my  amendment No. 64 to division B.   This amendment highlights the need to replenish the agriculture  disaster assistance account of USDA's Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity  Program Plus. This funding would cover agricultural producers' losses  in 2020 and 2021 due to natural disasters.   Some of the other types of natural disasters this program funding  helps includes droughts, derechos, floods, extreme freezes, high winds,  hurricanes, snowstorms, tornados, typhoons, volcanic activity, and  wildfires. One of the most pertinent disasters this program addresses  is extreme drought.   It is no secret that the American West, including my district in the  Central Valley in California, is currently suffering from a  devastating, historic drought. One of the main purposes of the Central  Valley Project system is to provide water to users during years of  extreme drought.   We are in year one of an extreme drought, and wells are going  extremely dry and farmland is being fallowed at an alarming rate. This  is completely unacceptable. While we continue to work to prevent this  from happening again in the future, we also need to figure out a way to  help those who are unnecessarily suffering from the drought  immediately.   My constituents and the constituents of many of my colleagues here  today are in an emergency and need this funding to be included in the  fiscal year 2022 package.
