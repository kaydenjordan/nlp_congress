 Mr. Chair, the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA,  was created to balance environmental protection with our need to build  infrastructure. The NEPA process was once timely and concise, but over  time NEPA has become a four-letter word associated with frivolous  litigation, mountains of paperwork, project delays, and cost overruns.  Congress has taken meaningful bipartisan steps toward reform, but the  work is far from over.   My amendment would require the Council on Environmental Quality to  report on current NEPA bottlenecks. It mirrors the legislation I  introduced yesterday with my friend   Jimmy Panetta, the Studying  NEPA's Impact on Projects Act, which would require annual reporting on  NEPA litigation, average page length, and timeliness. The American  people deserve a government that does not give radicals a heckler's  veto over roads, bridges, and energy projects.   I thank the chair and ranking member for including the Yakym-Panetta  amendment in this en bloc. I urge my colleagues to support it.
