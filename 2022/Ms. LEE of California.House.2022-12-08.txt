 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank this body  for full support of, of course, H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage  Act. I was so proud to support this bill.   I thank my good friend and colleague Chairman Nadler for his  leadership and   David Cicilline and Speaker Pelosi for bringing this  important bill to the floor.   Today, I voted to protect marriage equality across the country.  Following the Supreme Court's shameful decision to overturn Roe v.  Wade, rightwing extremists, who have been visibly organizing for  decades to curtail hard-won rights, have set their sights on other  freedoms.   We cannot let Justice Clarence Thomas even consider overturning the  constitutional right to marriage equality. What is coming next?   Today, the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act will enshrine marriage  equality into Federal law.   As one of the founding members of the Equality Caucus, along with my  good friend Congressman Barney Frank, today, I am reminded of Martin  Luther King's profound insight when he said that ``the arc of the moral  universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''   I thank all those who voted for this. This is a historic day, and we  did the right thing. Thank God we are moving forward in this country.                            ____________________
