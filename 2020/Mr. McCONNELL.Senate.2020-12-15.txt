 Madam President, over the last 4 years, our country  has benefited from a Presidential term filled with major  accomplishments. President Donald Trump has repeatedly surprised the  skeptics, confounded his critics, and delivered significant policy  victories that have strengthened our country.   Case in point, back in May, when the President set the goal of  finding a pandemic-ending vaccine by the end of this year, his timeline  was literally dismissed by people who assumed they knew better.   Here is one quote: ``Trump promises coronavirus vaccine by the end of  year,'' scoffed one headline, ``but his own experts temper  expectations.''   ``Fact check'' complained another headline, ``Coronavirus vaccine  could come this year, Trump says. Experts say he needs a `miracle' to  be right.''   Well, with the genius of science, support from Congress, and the bold  leadership of the Trump administration, that medical miracle arrived  right on schedule. Americans on the frontlines are receiving  vaccinations as we speak.   This episode offers a kind of microcosm of the last 4 years. On so  many subjects--from economic prosperity to foreign policy, to  protecting American families--the skeptics doubted him. The critics  derided him. But President Trump has delivered.   When President Trump ran for office, he promised to help open a new  chapter for working families. After 8 years of failed policies that  concentrated wealth and optimism among the lucky few, prosperity was  going to flow to all kinds of workers in all kinds of communities, he  said. And that is exactly what happened.   Before this pandemic spread from China and the world had to slam on  the brakes, the American people had the best job market in living  memory. With help from the policies of President Trump and Republicans  in Congress, American workers dynamited the stagnation that experts had  said was ``the new normal.'' Unemployment hit a 50-year low. Capital  markets hit record highs.   And this time, all kinds of Americans got to share in the gains. We  saw earnings grow faster for workers than for managers, faster for the  bottom 25 than for the top 25. This success was fueled in part by the  policy leadership of President Trump.   This administration pursued bold regulatory changes. Once-in-a- generation tax reform had eluded prior leaders. This President signed  it into law in his first year.   And together we repealed the worst part of ObamaCare. The unfair  individual mandate was zeroed out.   President Trump also took historic steps to strengthen the future of  our  [[Page S7474]]  trade with the world. He secured the historic United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement and the bilateral tax treaties with partners in Europe  and in Asia.   A nation this productive needs plenty of energy to keep it going.  Fortunately, President Trump and his administration ended the  ideological war on fossil fuels and hit the accelerator on ``all of the  above'' American energy dominance. In the last 4 years, we surpassed  Saudi Arabia in oil production. We saw energy exports exceed energy  imports for the first year in almost 70 years. Meanwhile, we saw  CO2 emissions fall, along with other harmful pollutants.  That energy independence has dramatically strengthened our hand with  respect to the rest of the world, particularly the Middle East.   So speaking of the Middle East, President Trump wasted little time  pulling back from the prior administration's disastrous ``Iran deal.''  His team eliminated daylight between us and Israel and repaired our  relationships with Arab partners. And he aligned these relationships  around our common shared interests--countering threats like radical  Islamic terrorists and Iranian aggression.   Under President Trump's command, our forces took terrorist leaders  like al-Baghdadi and Soleimani off the battlefield. The physical  caliphate that ISIS established on the previous President's watch was  destroyed.   All of this paved the way for the Abraham accords, the historic  normalization of relationships between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain,  Sudan, and, most recently, Morocco. And the potential is there for more  on the horizon.   Now, the Middle East isn't the only place where the Trump  administration has shored up our footing on the world stage. Our 45th  Commander in Chief sought out to rebuild and modernize our military and  to move our foreign policy from a chapter of weakness and apology into  a renewed posture of strength.   Four years later, we have a new national defense strategy to compete  with and deter adversaries like Russia and China. We have rebuilt the  military and invested in new technologies to ensure America keeps our  edge in everything from cyber to space, to advanced weapons system.   The President's leadership does not stop with those who are currently  serving. He also signed into law the historic VA MISSION Act to ensure  our dedication to the men and women in uniform does not end when their  tours conclude.   So, clearly, the list of American accomplishments since 2016 is  nearly endless. There are the many miles of new protections on our  southern border. At one point, apprehensions at the border hit their  lowest level since the 1970s.   Essential causes, like religious liberty and the most vulnerable, the  unborn, have had a champion in this administration instead of an  adversary.   There have been historic new steps to conserve our national  treasures, like the Great American Outdoors Act.   And perhaps most important of all, President Trump nominated--and  this Senate confirmed--three outstanding Supreme Court Justices, along  with more than 220 more article III Federal judges. These are  brilliant, young, constitutionalist men and women in lifetime  appointments who will renew the judiciary for a new generation--all  because President Trump knows we need judges who respect the essential  but limited job description the Framers wrote for our third branch of  government.   So as you can see, it would take far more than one speech to  catalogue all the major wins the Trump administration has helped  deliver for the American people. The outsider who swore he would shake  up Washington and lead our country to new accomplishments both at home  and abroad proceeded to do exactly that.   President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence deserve our thanks and  our gratitude for their tireless work and their essential roles in all  of these victories and in many more.                            ____________________     Madam President, 6 weeks ago, Americans voted in this  year's general election. The legal and constitutional processes have  continued to play out since then.   Yesterday, electors met in all 50 States. So, as of this morning, our  country has officially a President-elect and a Vice President-elect.   Many millions of us had hoped the Presidential election would yield a  different result. But our system of government has processes to  determine who will be sworn in on January 20.   The electoral college has spoken.   So, today, I want to congratulate President-Elect Joe Biden. The  President-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He has devoted himself to  public service for many years.   I also want to congratulate the Vice President-elect, our colleague  from California, Senator Harris. Beyond our differences, all Americans  can take pride that our nation has a female Vice President-elect for  the very first time.   I look toward to finishing out the next 36 days strong with President  Trump. Our Nation needs us to add another bipartisan chapter to this  record of achievement.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
