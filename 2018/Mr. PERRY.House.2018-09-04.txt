Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6438, the DHS  Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act.   In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that there  were 1.9 million consumer unmanned aircraft systems vehicles, commonly  known as drones, in the U.S. This number is expected to grow to a  staggering 4.3 million by the end of 2020.   The increased availability and expanded use of drones has led to  concerns over the potential risks to national security. Drones provide  malicious actors both a robust aerial delivery mechanism for  potentially hazardous payloads and anonymity in carrying out an attack.  [[Page H7811]]    This threat is not just imaginary. Known incidents involving drones  have included weaponized use by ISIS and cartels, smuggling operations,  intrusions at NFL and Olympic stadiums, and damage to electrical grid  infrastructure in Canada.   Several DHS offices and components assess drone threats and are  members of interagency and industry drone working groups which promote  information sharing, research, and joint problem-solving initiatives.  However, DHS currently does not have a centralized, departmentwide  official responsible for the coordination of counter-drone policies and  activities.   H.R. 6438 authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security to designate a countering unmanned aircraft systems  coordinator at the Department to serve as the lead DHS official for  coordinating counter-drone threat planning policies and plans. H.R.  6438 enables DHS to centralize the coordination of counter-drone threat  planning efforts under one official.   Under H.R. 6438, the countering UAS coordinator is responsible for  coordinating with relevant DHS components on the development of  policies and plans to counter threats from drones. The countering UAS  coordinator promotes the research and development of counter-drone  technologies within the Department and ensures that information and  guidance regarding drone threats is disseminated across the Department  as appropriate.   The coordinator will also serve as the principal Department official  responsible for disseminating information to the private sector  regarding DHS counter-drone measures and will ensure that DHS counter- drone activities are carried out in accordance with Federal laws.   H.R. 6438 is an important and timely piece of legislation that seeks  to further prepare the Department in carrying out its duties in  countering this emerging threat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6438,  and I reserve the balance of my time.          Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, September 4, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,                                                    Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 6438, the DHS       Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act. This       legislation includes matters that I believe fall within the       Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6438, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo       action on this bill, including seeking a sequential referral.       However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that       forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the       Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to       any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within       the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Finally, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I ask that you support       my request to have the Committee represented on the       conference committee.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the       bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on       Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, September 4, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6438, the ``DHS Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems       Coordinator Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this       legislation expeditiously before the House of       Representatives. I understand that the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure, to the extent it may have       a jurisdictional claim, will not seek a sequential referral       on the bill; and therefore, there has been no formal       determination as to its jurisdiction by the Parliamentarian.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that the absence of a decision on this bill at       this time does not prejudice any claim the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure may have held or may have       on similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a       conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a       request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       for conferees on those provisions determined to be within its       jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey. She has  been a leader on this issue, and it is something that is important to  both of us and to our country. I applaud her efforts and thank her for  her support of these efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6438, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
