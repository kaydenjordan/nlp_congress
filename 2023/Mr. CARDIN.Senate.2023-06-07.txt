 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today in strong support for the  confirmation of Dilawar Syed to fill the long vacant role of Deputy  Administrator for the Small Business Administration.   After more than 2 years since President Biden first nominated Mr.  Syed, the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  finally reported Mr. Syed's nomination out of the committee earlier  this year.   Mr. Syed was nominated to fill a position that has been vacant for  nearly 5 years. The vacancy has caused harm to small business owners  throughout our Nation who depend on the SBA to be fully staffed in  order to access capital, contracting opportunities, and entrepreneurial  development training.   In an entrepreneurial career spanning over two decades, Mr. Syed has  experience starting businesses and advocating for inclusion  entrepreneurship at the international, Federal, and State level.   He currently serves as the Special Representative for Commercial and  Business Affairs at the United States Department of State, where he  advances trade, commercial, and economic policies through commercial  advocacy.   Prior to his position at the State Department, Mr. Syed was CEO at  Lumiata, a healthcare technology company, and president at Freshworks,  where he helped scale the software company's products to reach  thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses.   Mr. Syed has also held a number of civic positions. In the Obama  administration, he served as chair of the White House Initiative on  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Economic Growth. And in  California, he chaired the California Entrepreneurship Task Force under  Governor Gavin Newsom's Office of Business and Economic Development.   With experience at the State Department as Special Representative and  leadership roles in business, entrepreneurship, and public service, he  is very well-positioned to help the SBA meet this critical moment small  businesses face across the Nation.   As our small businesses continue to recover from the pandemic while  facing new challenges, it is essential that the SBA is fully equipped  to meet their needs.   During the pandemic, the Agency provided relief to millions of  existing small businesses. Now, record levels of new businesses are  being created under the Biden-Harris administration. SBA has the unique  opportunity to foster the continuation of this small business boom,  making sure that entrepreneurs have the resources, assistance, and  capital that will create economic prosperity for communities across the  country.   While the SBA has worked tirelessly to provide this assistance, the  pandemic exposed a clear need for modernization, technical upgrades,  new resources, and reforms at the SBA. That is why we need a Deputy  Administrator today more than ever. The skills and qualifications Mr.  Syed possesses are a perfect fit for the SBA's needs. He has broad  support from dozens of small business organizations that understand the  needs of entrepreneurs.   They know that Mr. Syed is an individual who will endlessly continue  to advocate for and support our small businesses. Allowing the position  of Deputy Administrator to remain empty for so long is a great  disservice to our Nation's small business owners.   His confirmation process has been fraught with unacceptable delaying  tactics, unfounded accusations, and unrelated controversies.   Throughout it all, however, Mr. Syed has shown only patience and  perseverance. I am honored to stand here today, finally, to support his  nomination for the position of SBA Deputy Administrator. I am confident  that America's small businesses and the communities they support will  benefit from him in this role.  [[Page S1993]]    I urge all my colleagues to support his confirmation. This is what  our small business community needs. I would urge my colleagues to  ratify his nomination.   With that, I would yield the floor.   Madam President, I would ask consent that we proceed with the vote  immediately.    Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Kenneth Paul  Reichard on his retirement and to thank him for his 17 years of  outstanding service as my Montgomery County district director and his  career of selfless service to the residents of the county and all  Marylanders. This Monday, the city of Rockville will officially  recognize Ken--a lifelong resident--for his service. On April 14,  Representative Jamie Raskin interviewed Ken for one of his weekly  ``Local Hero'' podcasts. The accolades Ken is receiving are well- deserved. As Montgomery County Council President Evan Glass stated,  ``Ken has been a terrific advocate for Montgomery County! We are all  beneficiaries of his grace, good humor and leadership.'' Ken is a local  hero to Maryland and a personal hero to me. For the better part of two  decades, Ken has been a lifeline to Montgomery County, helping to make  sure that no citizen is left behind.   Ken was born at the original Montgomery General Hospital in Olney,  MD, on August 17, 1943. His parents were Kenneth Henderson Reichard of  Guilford Township, Franklin County, PA, and Gladys Lydia Martin  Reichard of Reid, Washington County, MD. He is a descendent of a  Revolutionary War soldier, George Barnard Reichard, from Pennsylvania,  who fought from 1777 to 1780. He grew up in a union household on  Horners Lane in Rockville with an older brother, Lee. Ken graduated  from Richard Montgomery High School, Rockville, in 1961. While he  attended high school, he started working part-time at the Safeway  grocery store on Bradley Boulevard in Bethesda. He quickly joined the  United Food and Commercial Workers International Union--UFCW--and  became the local's youngest business agent ever when he was just 21,  winning his first election by 87 votes. He traveled to other stores  around the State, and it wasn't long before Ken was handling labor  grievances and negotiating contracts. By the time he finished his  career with UFCW, he was executive assistant to  [[Page S2001]]  the president of the national union, director of government affairs,  and senior vice president. Then-Governor Parris Glendening tapped Ken  to serve as assistant secretary and commissioner of labor and industry  at the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. After  that, he cochaired Senator John Kerry's 2004 Presidential campaign in  Maryland with Heather Mizeur, who went on to serve as a member of the  Maryland House of Delegates from 2007 to 2015, representing the 20th  District in Montgomery County.   Given Ken's extensive knowledge of the issues, politics, and people  of Montgomery County and beyond, my campaign contacted him and  convinced him to serve as my metropolitan Washington-area  representative when I first ran for the Senate in 2006. Ken has been  with me ever since, and I am so grateful. He has met with countless  constituents, businessowners, and elected officials; joined or  represented me at field events; served as my liaison to organized  labor; and handled special assignments. He has done it all with grace  and insight and a quiet competence.   Ken married Sandra Lee Wiley on February 23, 1964, in Rockville, MD.  Ken, now widowed, has three children: Cassie, Eric, and Paula; seven  grandchildren: Lindsay, Caitlyn, Sampson, Tyler, Amanda, Sydney, and  Drew; and two great-granddaughters: Maya and Stella. Ken was a member  of Crusader Lutheran Church for a number of years and held several  positions on the church counsel. Over the years, Ken has enjoyed  volunteering for political campaigns and serving on several boards  within Montgomery County, traveling in his motorhome, camping, building  and fixing anything for the home, tending to an orchard of fruit trees,  and appreciating classic cars.   There are few Marylanders--and even fewer Montgomery County  residents--who have not benefited in one way or another from Ken's  lifelong service to others. Ken has lived up to Douglas Adams's--author  of ``The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''--maxim, ``To give real  service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with  money, and that is sincerity and integrity.'' I want to thank Ken's  family for ``sharing'' him with the people of Montgomery County and all  Marylanders. Above all, I want to thank Ken himself for his wise  counsel and friendship over the years. While he no longer works for me  in an official capacity, I will continue to rely on him unofficially in  the weeks and months ahead while hoping that he spends more time with  his family and friends and recreational pursuits.                            ____________________
