 Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I have been a committed  defender of the Second Amendment since being elected to Congress back  in 1994. For me, that means that I will do everything that I possibly  can to ensure that the rights of Americans, as they relate to the  Second Amendment, are protected, while at the same time  [[Page H1298]]  working to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and mentally  unstable individuals.   H.R. 8, unfortunately, doesn't accomplish either of those goals. It  is overburdensome, unreasonable, and, if passed, would instead keep  firearms out of the hands of some hardworking and law-abiding citizens.   Yesterday, at the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment which would  allow for the transfer of a firearm to museums or historical displays  without going through the burdensome requirements of this measure, but  that eminently reasonable amendment and others offered by my colleagues  were flatly rejected by the majority.    During this afternoon's debate, we have again expressed several  concerns which will not be addressed or considered by the majority.  Instead of focusing on improving the National Instant Criminal  Background Checks System, or NICS, providing resources to assist those  with mental illnesses or hardening soft targets like schools and places  of worship, the majority will pass this legislation and attempt to  further infringe on the Second Amendment rights of our constituents.  That is very, very unfortunate.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I stand in opposition to this deeply  flawed legislation.
