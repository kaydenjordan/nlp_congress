 Madam Speaker, increasingly across this Nation and here in  Washington, the voices of victims are being drowned out by radicals on  the left seeking to eliminate cash bail. These people would rather see  criminals walk free on our streets than see the rule of law upheld and  our communities protected.   Without appropriate incentives to appear before the court, we run the  risk of defendants fleeing justice while victims and their families are  left with nothing but fear and anguish.   We cannot allow our system to fail them as it did in Waukesha,  Wisconsin. Prior to plowing into a Christmas parade, convicted felon  and career criminal, Darrell Brooks, was released on an inappropriately  low $1,000 bond after being arrested on a slew of charges. That is  astonishing to me. With his record, Mr. Brooks' bail should have never  been so low, if awarded at all.   So the next time my colleagues across the aisle suggest eliminating  the cash bail system, I ask them to think of this tragedy and of the  victims. Our bail system keeps criminals off the streets and our  communities safe.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman for  organizing this evening.   I am proud to join so many of my colleagues here tonight to stand up  for the unborn. Since the tragic 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, more than 60  million preborn children in America have had their lives cut short.  This is absolutely heartbreaking, and we must continue our efforts to  end the devastating practice of abortion in America.   Fortunately, the pro-life movement grows stronger by the day, and  there is an army of folks across this country who serve as voices for  the voiceless and defenders of the defenseless.   One saying that gets repeated around this Chamber a lot is ``follow  the  [[Page H6844]]  science.'' Well, science tells us that the preborn are, in fact, human  beings. This is an undeniable fact. At 6 weeks, an unborn baby has a  heartbeat. At 7 weeks, they develop pain receptors. By 10 weeks, an  unborn child has arms, legs, fingers, and toes, and can begin to kick.  At 15 weeks, a preborn human being has a fully developed heart.   Yet, through all of this time and well beyond, the pro-abortion  movement believes this child has no right to life. But God willing, the  ability to protect preborn life will soon be even greater in the United  States.   The Supreme Court today heard arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson that will  address the question of the constitutionality of previability bans on  abortion. We must protect our unborn citizens, and I am hopeful that  the Supreme Court will soon recognize that right to life.   Since the first day I was elected, I have worked to advance the truth  that the pro-life movement supports. On this day, I am more committed  than ever to ensuring that truth always prevails.
