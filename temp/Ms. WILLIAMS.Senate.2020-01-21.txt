 That is correct.        Colonel VINDMAN. Correct.         That is right.        Colonel VINDMAN. Correct.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Why do we need documents generated after the  calls and meetings? They would shed light on how these events were  perceived in the White House and what actions were taken moving  forward. For example, National Security Advisor John Bolton wasn't on  the 25th call, but he was apparently informed about the contents of the  call afterward. His reaction, once he was informed, would be helpful to  understanding the extent to which President Trump's action deviated  from American policy and American security interest.   There is another set of documents that the Senate should get, and  they relate to the political investigations that President Trump and  his agents repeatedly asked Ukrainian officials to announce. These  documents were about efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce  investigations and the decision to place a hold on military aid to  Ukraine. They would be very important for you to evaluate the  President's conduct.   For example, Ambassador Bolton is a firsthand witness to President  Trump's abuse of power. He reported directly to the President. He  supervised the entire staff of the National Security Council. Public  reports indicate that John Bolton is a voracious note-taker at every  meeting.   From witness testimony, we know that Ambassador Bolton hosted the  July 10, 2019, meeting where Ambassador Sondland told Ukrainian  officials that the promised White House meeting would be scheduled if  they announce the investigations. We know Bolton was briefed about this  meeting immediately following it when Ambassador Sondland said he had a  deal with Mick Mulvaney to schedule the promised White House meeting if  Ukraine announced investigations into the Bidens in the 2016 election.   We also know Ambassador Bolton was involved in briefing the President  on a Presidential decision memorandum in August reflecting the  consensus interagency opinion that the Ukrainian security assessment  was vital to America's national security--something the Congress had  approved appropriately and something the President had signed.   Press reports indicate that he, too, was involved in the late August  Oval Office meeting where he, Secretary Pompeo, and Secretary Esper all  tried to convince the President to release the aid.   Now, Ambassador Bolton has come forward and publicly confirmed that  he was a witness to important events but also that he has new evidence  that no one has seen yet. If we know there is evidence that has not yet  come out, all of us should want to hear it. We should want to hear it  now before Ambassador Bolton testifies. We should get documents and  records relating to his testimony, including his notes, which would  provide contemporaneous evidence about what was discussed in meetings  related to Ukraine, which would help to evaluate his testimony.   The evidence is not restricted to just Ambassador Bolton. During his  public testimony, Ambassador Gordon Sondland stated: I have not had  access to all my phone records. He also said that he and his lawyers  had asked repeatedly for these materials. He said the materials would  help refresh his memory. We should go get that material.   Ambassador Sondland also testified that he exchanged a number of  emails with top officials, like Mick Mulvaney, about his efforts to  pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations President Trump  demanded. Here is his testimony.   [Text of Videotape presentation:]         Ambassador SONDLAND. First, let me say precisely, because       we did not think that we were engaging in improper behavior,       we made every effort to ensure that the relevant decision       makers at the National Security Council and The State       Department knew the important details of our efforts. The       suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue       diplomacy is absolutely false. I have now identified certain       State Department emails and messages that provide       contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that       the leadership of the State Department, the National Security       Council, and the White House were all informed about the       Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until the security aid was       released on September 11, 2019.   [[Page S390]]         Ms. Manager LOFGREN. These emails referenced in this testimony are in  the possession of the White House, the State Department, and even the  Department of Energy since officials from all three entities  communicated together.   Now, during his testimony, Ambassador Sondland described it this way:  Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.   These emails are therefore important to understanding the full scope  of the scheme.   A request for relevant evidence is not confined to Trump  administration officials. The Senate should also get White House  records relating to the President's private agents who acted on his  behalf in Ukraine, including Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova.  Witness testimony and documents have made clear that Mr. Giuliani, a  frequent visitor to the White House who also received and made frequent  calls to the White House, was acting on behalf of the President to  press Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would  personally and politically benefit the President.   For example, the May 10, 2019, letter from Mr. Giuliani to President- elect Zelensky that is shown on this slide states he was acting ``as  personal counsel to President Trump with his knowledge and consent.''  He requested a meeting with the President-elect, to be joined by Ms.  Toensing, who is ``very familiar with this matter.'' The evidence  indicates he was collaborating with Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova in  this effort.   The Senate should get the White House records of the meeting and of  the calls involving Mr. Giuliani, Ms. Toensing, or Mr. diGenova. These  records are important to help you understand the extent to which the  White House was involved in Mr. Giuliani's efforts to coerce Ukraine to  announce the investigation the President wanted. The records would also  show how the President's personal political agenda became more  important than policies to help America's national security interests.   The President's counsel may--consistent with his prior attempts to  hide evidence--assert that attorney/client privilege would cover these  documents, but the President's personal attorney/client privilege  cannot shield evidence of misconduct in office or that of his aides or  his lawyers' participation in corrupt schemes. We aren't asking for  documents reflecting legitimate legal advice; we need documents about  their actions to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into  President Trump's political opponent.   There is a set of White House documents that relate directly to the  President's unlawful decision to withhold $391 million appropriated-- bipartisan--to help Ukraine. Witnesses have testified that President  Trump directly ordered a hold on the security assistance despite the  unanimous opinion of these agencies that the aid should be released.   Importantly, according to the Government Accountability Office, his  action violated the law. On January 16, 2020, the GAO--an independent  watchdog--issued a legal opinion finding that President Trump violated  the law when he held up security assistance to Ukraine. The GAO said:         Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President       to substitute his own policy priorities for those that       Congress enacted into law. OMB withheld funds for a policy       reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control       Act. The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore,       we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.    The fact that the President's action to freeze the aid, which he used  to pressure Ukraine to announce the political investigations he wanted,  was against not only the official consensus of his own administration  but also against the law, and it was to help himself. That helps  demonstrate these actions were taken for President Trump's personal and  political benefit.   Witness testimony and public reporting made clear the White House has  a significant body of documents that relate to these key aspects of the  President's scheme. Some of these documents outline the planning of the  President's freeze.   For example, the New York Times reported in June that Mr. Mulvaney  emailed his senior adviser, Mr. Blair: Did we ever find out about the  money for Ukraine and whether we can hold it back? This shows that Mr.  Mulvaney was in email contact with his aides about the very issues  under investigation as part of this impeachment. It tells us that the  White House is in possession of communications that go to the heart of  the charges before you.   The Senate should also get materials prepared for summary notes from  the late August meeting with President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark  Esper, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when they try to convince the  President that ``freeing up the money for Ukraine was the right thing  to do.'' According to the New York Times, Ambassador Bolton told the  President this is in America's interest.   The Senate should review that highly relevant document, which  reflects real-time assertions by President Trump's own senior aides  that Ukrainian aid was in the national security interest of the United  States and that there was no legitimate reason to hold up the aid.  There are documents that include after-the-fact justifications to try  to overcome legal problems and the unanimous objections to freezing the  assistance to Ukraine, and we know these documents exist.   On January 3, 2020, OMB stated in a letter to the New York Times that  it had discovered 20 responsive documents consisting of 40 pages  reflecting emails between White House official Robert Blair and OMB  official Michael Duffey that relate directly to the freezing of the  Ukraine security assistance. But OMB wouldn't release them in a Freedom  of Information lawsuit, and they have refused to produce these  documents at the direction of the President in response to the House's  lawful subpoena.   The Washington Post reported that a ``confidential White House  review'' of President Trump's decision to hold up ``hundreds of  documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact  justification for the . . . debate over whether the delay was legal''-- that is known as a coverup, actually.   The White House lawyers had, apparently, uncovered ``early August  email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White  House budget officials seeking to provide some explanation for  withholding the funds the president had already ordered a hold'' on.   The documents also reportedly include communications between White  House officials and outside agencies. Not only does Congress have a  right to see them, but the public does, too, under freedom of  information laws.   As a matter of constitutional authority, the Senate has the greatest  interest in and the right to compel those documents. Indeed, as the  news article explains, White House lawyers are reportedly worried about  ``unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass  the president.'' Perhaps they should be worried about that, but the  risk of embarrassment cannot outweigh the constitutional interests in  this impeachment proceeding.   Any evidence of guilt, including further proof of the real reason the  President ordered the funds withheld, or after-the-fact attempts to  paper over knowingly unlawful conduct, must be provided to ensure a  full and fair trial. No privilege or national security rationale can be  used as a shield from disclosing misconduct.   There are key White House documents relating to multiple instances  when White House officials reported their concerns to White House  lawyers about the President's scheme to press Ukraine to do the  President a domestic political favor. For example, Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman and Dr. Hill both informed NSC lawyers about the July 10  meeting in which Ambassador Sondland revealed he had a deal with Mr.  Mulvaney.   I am going to go directly to the clip by Dr. Hill because, at  Bolton's direction, Dr. Hill also reported that meeting to John  Eisenberg, as she explained in her testimony.
