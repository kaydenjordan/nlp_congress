 Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the Committee on Ethics,  I rise in support of H. Res. 878, which seeks to expel George Santos  from the House of Representatives.   One of our most basic obligations as Members of Congress is to adhere  to the principle that public office is a public trust. As the Ethics  Committee's report lays out in thorough detail, Mr. Santos has  repeatedly, egregiously, and brazenly violated the public's trust. Mr.  Santos is not a victim; he is a perpetrator of a massive fraud on his  constituents and the American people.   In fewer than 9 months, and despite Mr. Santos' noncooperation and  numerous attempts to mislead the committee, the Ethics Committee  compiled a staggering factual record against him. My colleague,  Chairman Guest, has already outlined all of the subpoenas and pages of  documents and witnesses, and I am not going to go through that again.    Mr. Speaker, this achievement owes to the superb work of  the committee's nonpartisan attorneys and investigative staff who I  would like to sincerely thank for their efforts and dedicated service  to the House. I just want to remind everyone that the Ethics Committee  is the only committee in Congress that is completely bipartisan, an  equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and this was a unanimous  decision.
