 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as well in support of H.R. 299, the Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, an important bipartisan bill  that will finally guarantee equality for the blue water Navy Vietnam  veterans exposed to Agent Orange.   Agent Orange was used by the U.S. military to strategically clear  terrain and deforest areas during the Vietnam war. This tactical  chemical has been linked, however, to prostate cancer, Parkinson's  disease, and many other diseases.   For far too long, only veterans who served on Vietnam's landmass or  inland waterways were entitled to the service-connected presumption of  exposure to Agent Orange. This legislation ensures that the same  automatic presumption is provided to those who served in the  territorial seas of Vietnam. H.R. 299 addresses and permanently fixes  this by properly defining those who will be eligible for VA benefits  related to Agent Orange.    With this bill, we ensure that blue water Navy veterans will be  treated fairly and will receive the benefits and care they deserve. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of this important bill, and I will continue  to work for our Nation's veterans, providing them the care and benefits  they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
