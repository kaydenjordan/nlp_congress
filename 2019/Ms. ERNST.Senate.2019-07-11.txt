 Mr. President, I would like to recognize Iowa Safe  Schools as they get set to begin their annual Pride Camp on July 15 in  Des Moines. This summer program is designed to serve as an opportunity  for LGBTQ students from around the state of Iowa to learn, to network,  and to have lots of fun.   Thank you to Iowa Safe Schools for pursuing your mission of providing  a safe environment and community for Iowa's LGBTQ youth to learn and  grow. I am sending my best wishes to all of this year's attendees!  Please, have a wonderful and productive time.                            ____________________
