 Mr. President, I am honored to join these two  eloquent colleagues who have each been champions for this cause as  women speaking about the problem of sexual assault in our country--the  epidemic of sexual assault that continues to be a scourge across our  country. Most of my career in law enforcement, like my distinguished  colleague from California, has been involved in making laws work for  people and deterring exactly this kind of heinous lawbreaking. It is  criminal. It is a crime, but it is one of the least reported crimes  because of the public shaming and character assassination and mocking  and ridiculing we have seen from men in power over just the last few  days and weeks.   I want to say, as a man speaking on the Senate floor--and greatly  honored to do so--to other men in this country, those men in power who  have mocked and ridiculed Dr. Blasey Ford cannot be our role model.  Those men in power--they may be colleagues and they may be the  President of the United States who have belittled and demeaned and  dismissed Dr. Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez and survivors across the  country--do not speak for us. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. I believe Dr.  Blasey Ford because she was credible and powerful as a witness before  us in what she remembered and what she so candidly said she couldn't  remember. I believe Deborah Ramirez. I believe all of you who have  written my office or called us, as many of you have done in other  States to my colleagues, who have recounted the horrors of your  personal experience with sexual assault, who have come to me as I have  been in airports or rallies or other public meetings and shared with me  your horrific story. I believe you. America believes you.   Let me say to Dr. Blasey Ford's sons, you should be proud of your  mom. You should be proud of your mom because she is a profile in  courage.   To Mr. Ford, you should be proud of your wife.   To all the men in America, we need to believe survivors of sexual  assault. We need to protect and respect them, not just in word but in  deed so they will come forward and tell us their stories so we can  conquer scourge.   We should be proud of the brave women who have brought us truth that  cannot be denied no matter how much character assassination and public  shaming they have endured. We know their truth. This issue of how  America moves forward on sexual assault is bigger than this nomination.  It will last beyond the vote tomorrow. It will be a defining question  for each of us as men, as human beings.   Judge Kavanaugh, in facing these allegations, has also revealed  something profoundly significant about himself. When he came to the  committee after Dr. Blasey Ford, he revealed his true character. He  pulled back the mask on the judge and revealed the man. What we saw was  someone filled with rage and spite, self-pitying and arrogant, deeply  partisan, and threatening. We can disagree on Judge Kavanaugh's views  on jurisprudential issues and policy and law. We can disagree on issues  relating to his out-of-the-mainstream, far-right ideological  position, but what cannot be denied is that picture of Judge Kavanaugh  before our committee that indicated profoundly a lack of temperament  and trustworthiness. That picture led former Justice John Paul Stevens  to revoke his endorsement and to say his performance was disqualifying.    What we saw--as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words--was a  man who refused to answer questions; he snapped at my colleagues; he  spouted partisan conspiracy theories. That is the real Brett  Kavanaugh--the Brett Kavanaugh who characterized Dr. Ford's serious and  credible allegations as nothing more than ``a calculated and  orchestrated political hit.'' He, in effect, depicted her as a puppet  or a pawn of Senators or political figures, not people who came forward  voluntarily in their own right and on their own initiative, as truly  they did.   He was the Brett Kavanaugh who alleged that it was all ``revenge on  behalf of the Clintons.'' He is the Brett Kavanaugh who, as the  Portland Press Herald characterized it, ``ripped off the nonpartisan  mask'' and never looked back.   He is the Brett Kavanaugh who threatened us, saying, ``What goes  around, comes around.''   In Brett Kavanaugh's own words, a judge must be someone who is  ``even-handed, unbiased, impartial, courteous yet firm, and dedicated  to a process, not a result.'' Those are his own words. That is not  Brett Kavanaugh the man. It will not be Brett Kavanaugh the Justice if  he is confirmed.   Brett Kavanaugh revealed himself to be a partisan--an angry and  bitter partisan--not an impartial jurist, and he did so in prepared  remarks, planned and premeditated, well calculated, written word for  word, and delivered word for word as he angrily turned the pages, and  that is the message that, for me, resonates because I have argued cases  in the Supreme Court. I have spent a career standing before judges.  Some of their rulings I liked; some of them I disliked. Some of their  conclusions I thought were maybe incorrect. But I knew that those men  and women wanted to be impartial. When they put those robes on, as  Brett Kavanaugh has done, they left party and partisan interests at the  door.   Now, when I go to the U.S. Supreme Court, if Brett Kavanaugh is  confirmed, there can be no trust or confidence that he will be that  impartial jurist. It is and will be a stain, a cloud, on the U.S.  Supreme Court. All the Supreme Court has in the way of power is the  trust and credibility and confidence of the American people, which will  be diminished forever.   So let me pose a question to my colleague from California because she  has so well described the voir dire process. It is jury selection,  where we make an effort to pick jurors who are impartial and  nonpartisan.   I say to Senator Harris, if Brett Kavanaugh came to a courtroom where  the Senator was trying a case as an attorney general, and he were in  the jury pool to be picked for a jury, would the Senator pick him as a  juror? After that appearance before our committee, would the Senator  allow him to sit on a case where the Senator was litigating?    I think this issue of temperament--and I am going to  pose a question to my colleague from Washington--is fundamental to our  system of justice in this country. Courtrooms are sometimes really  emotional places, and sometimes they are angry places. The function of  the judge is to remove the emotion and the anger, to be impartial and  balanced and even keeled.   So for a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to engage in the  kind of angry outburst--it was not spontaneous; it was not the result  of some accusation in the moment. It was calculated. It was  premeditated. It was written the day before. It was inexcusable and  unacceptable.   I will ask my colleague from the State of Washington, since she is  not a lawyer, perhaps to her credit: If the Senator were appearing in a  courtroom with Judge Kavanaugh, wouldn't the Senator ask that he step  away from the case, that he recuse himself in light of what he has said  about all Democrats, about vast classes of people--this anger that he  has expressed?    I will yield back to my colleague from California,  but let me just close my part of this colloquy by saying that we saw  the real Brett Kavanaugh before us on that day at that moment, and I  think my colleagues, if they review that picture, a picture is worth a  thousand words. If they apply common sense--we should not leave common  sense at the door. If they put themselves in the shoes of someone  appearing, seeking justice, they will vote against Brett Kavanaugh and  the disrespect that he showed that brave survivor, Dr. Blasey Ford.   I yield back to my colleague from California.    Thank you, Mr. President.   At some point during the confirmation hearing--now seemingly years  ago but probably only just a month or so ago--I saw young women going  through the halls of the Capitol with T-shirts that said ``I am what's  at stake.'' I want to thank those young women and all of the countless  women and men of all ages who have come to our Nation's Capital to show  us what democracy looks like.   I know that some of my colleagues have been displeased--in fact, have  called it mob rule--but the power and force of democracy within those  voices and faces--a lot of them were from Connecticut, and I am proud  of your coming here to tell us what you think both for and against this  nomination. That is what democracy looks like. When we reject the  voices and faces of democracy coming to tell us their truth, we lose  something very precious. It is of equal importance to the townhalls and  the meetings and parades and all we do at home. I do a lot of it at  home, but I was proud of the folks from Connecticut who came here and  the folks who came from all over the country from as far away as Alaska  and Hawaii to give us the benefit of their insight and perspective. ``I  am what's at stake'' is the message those women were conveying to us in  real time.   We talk here in words. Sometimes we hold up posters. We talk in  abstract; that is, the legal parlance of the courts and our  legislature. But our decisions have real-life consequences, and the  appointment of Brett Kavanaugh and the confirmation that likely will  take place tomorrow will affect real people in real time for  generations to come because it is for a lifetime.   The courts are among the most anti-democratic institutions in our  country, the greatest democracy in the world and the most enduring of  any democracy. They are lifetime appointments. They are insulated  generally from attack or even criticism because folks who criticize a  judge in his or her presence can be held in contempt. They have powers  to punish contempt by immediately jailing someone. They are anti- democratic so long as they fail to reflect the will of the people if  there are excesses, if the nomination and confirmation process goes off  the rails. And that is what is happening here--a broken promise and  process that has caused a rush to judgment simply for the sake of  arbitrary deadlines and irrational timelines placed on a nomination  that is fundamentally flawed.   A lot of my colleagues have relied on personal assurances from Brett  Kavanaugh in their chambers. He talked to me an hour, and he assured  me, I heard my colleagues say. He assured me that he will not overturn  Roe v. Wade, but his answers to us under oath on those topics were  evasive and misleading.   When I asked him, for example, in our hearings about Roe v. Wade, he  repeated the vague commitment to settled precedent, but he couldn't  explain why he referred to that precedent in his Garza dissent as  ``existing precedent.'' It would be like introducing your wife as ``my  current wife.'' How long do you think that wife is going to be around?   He referred to abortion-on-demand. These kinds of code words sent a  signal to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, and they  were the direct cause--or at least one of them--for his being on the  President's short list after he hadn't been on it before he issued that  dissent.   Looking to what he has actually written and said is a much keener,  more reliable insight into what he will do, more than personal  assurances.   His writings indicate that he believes, in effect, in a President who  can refuse to enforce the Affordable Care Act simply because he deems  it unconstitutional. He concludes, in his vision of the Constitution  and his interpretation of the statute, that they are in conflict, even  after the Supreme Court of the United States upholds it and a prior  President signs the law and a Congress passes it.   That kind of monarchial power is an anathema to our constitutional  sense of checks and balances, and the result could well be--in fact,  likely will be--that millions of Americans will be deprived of  protections when they suffer from diabetes and heart disease,  Parkinson's, high blood pressure, pregnancy--the preexisting conditions  for which the Affordable Care Act was designed to afford people  protections in insurance.   Healthcare, women's reproductive rights, the right of a woman to  decide when she wants to have children, the  [[Page S6622]]  right of people across America to decide when they want to marry the  person they love, consumer rights, workers' rights, environmental  protection--all are at stake to real people in their real lives for  generations to come. ``I am what is at stake'' applies to every  American.   I have never been angrier or sadder since coming to the Senate. This  nomination was essentially the result of a rush to judgment and of a  coverup, starting with the concealment of millions of pages of  documents. Those documents are in the National Archives. They belong to  the people of the United States, but the White House chose to hide  them.   Then, there was a straitjacketed sham of an investigation into sexual  assault--yes, a sham; really, a whitewash--that refused to interview  dozens of witnesses, some of them eyewitnesses who could corroborate  the credible and powerful allegations made by sexual assault survivors.   My office spoke directly to Kerry Berchem. There is a more recent  report out tonight--an excellent report by NBC--about how she and  others tried to be interviewed. They sought and beseeched the FBI to  talk to them, but the FBI was given a list because the purpose of that  investigation was not to find the facts. It was to offer cover. It was  to permit our colleagues to say there has been a seventh investigation.   Have my colleagues read those six investigations? Do they understand  that the general practice--we can't talk about the details on the  floor, of course--of the FBI is to begin at age 18, not before? Do they  understand that the general practice of an FBI background investigation  is to interview professional colleagues, coworkers, supervisors, and  references that are suggested by the nominee to any particular  position?   The seventh investigation was really the crucial one regarding those  allegations of an individual 17 years old or even 18, in college, where  there was no reason in those earlier six investigations to go back. The  FBI was straitjacketed, and that is a disservice to the U.S. Supreme  Court, to the Senate in our constitutional responsibility, to the  people of the United States, and, ultimately, to Brett Kavanaugh,  himself, because these allegations will not be going away any time  soon. They will hang over him and the Court as a cloud and a stain for  years and years to come. Facts and evidence have a really powerful way  of coming out. Eventually, facts and evidence have a way of finding a  way to the public realm.   From the beginning, this nomination has been a crucial test for the  Senate and for the Nation, but this fight is about more than just this  Supreme Court seat. It is about a courageous and credible sexual  assault survivor who came forward. Actually, she expressed concerns to  friends before the nomination was made about Brett Kavanaugh's possible  nomination. She recounted her story years before even the seat opened,  as documented by her therapist's notes and her husband, who, by the  way, was never interviewed. Her husband was never interviewed. Talk  about corroborating witnesses. Her therapist's notes were never  reviewed, and she herself was never interviewed by the FBI. That is an  absence of factfinding. And, of course, Judge Kavanaugh was never  interviewed, as well.    She came forward to say she was sexually assaulted by Brett  Kavanaugh, and the details of her claim were lacking in some part. She  was frank to admit that she couldn't remember everything, which is not  atypical of sexual assault survivors, as the experts would have told  the FBI if they had interviewed some experts. But she could remember  some parts of that story, and they are details that I will never  forget: the laughter from Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, the third  person she knew to be in that room--the laughter at her expense. The  mocking and ridiculing laughter are so vivid in her memory. It is the  same mocking and ridiculing laughter that we heard at some of the  rallies where the President mocked and ridiculed her--the same mocking  and ridiculing that, for decades, have been applied to survivors of  sexual assault who come forward. She has endured the same nightmare of  public shaming and character assassination and threats--potential  retaliation that all too often has silenced sexual assault survivors.  She braved that nightmare, knowing full well what was coming, but maybe  she thought it would not come from Members of the Senate. Maybe she had  that naive hope, and if she had it, she was wrong.   Our colleagues here said she was mixed up. They said they believe  her, they find her credible, but she must be wrong about the identity  of the person who attacked her. Well, that echos to the second point  that rung true and vividly in her testimony when she was asked: Could  it be mistaken identity? Absolutely not. Was she sure it was Brett  Kavanaugh? 100 percent sure.   I have a message for my Republican colleagues: You can't believe the  survivors only when they say what you want to hear. You can't believe  the survivors for only those parts of the story that are comfortable  and convenient. You can't believe them only when they tell you how they  have been hurt, horrifically harmed, but not the person who harmed them  and hurt them. And you can't believe them if you reject the possibility  of a thorough, complete, fair, and impartial investigation into all of  the facts and the evidence.   My Republican colleagues say they would like to believe Dr. Blasey  Ford and they would like to believe Deborah Ramirez, but there is no  corroborating evidence. You cannot believe survivors without seeking  the corroborating evidence. You cannot believe them if you turn a blind  eye to witnesses who come forward and not only are willing but,  actually, in effect, pound at the FBI's door.   I reviewed those interviews with the people who were on the list that  the FBI permitted to be interviewed, but I have also reviewed the  mounds of tip line records. I don't know how many of my colleagues have  done so. They are fascinating and illuminating and profoundly revealing  because there are actually tips from people who came forward and had a  personal connection to the events of interest. Of course, I am barred  from providing details, but none of them were contacted or interviewed.  That is not an investigation. That is not an investigation by the FBI  worthy of the FBI's name.   I offer no criticism of the FBI because they were, in effect,  narrowly circumscribed, limited, straitjacketed, handcuffed by someone  in the administration. We need to find out who it was and how it was  done. Both women offered evidence of the kind that is routinely offered  in sexual assault cases. They can prove that they told others about  their experiences long before the current nomination fight. Christine  Ford had a polygraph test and therapist notes. And both women can point  to a history of Brett Kavanaugh acting inappropriately when drunk. What  my Republican colleagues apparently mean when they say there are no  corroborating witnesses is that none were permitted to tell their story  to the FBI, not that they weren't available.   I would like to say that this approach to sexual assault survivors is  a thing of the past, a throwback to some other time, but the fact is  that it remains real in the lives of survivors around this country  today. They should know that we are going to stand with them, that this  example of, in effect, failing a proper and complete impartial  investigation is far from acceptable to us.   I want to make a commitment to my colleagues and the public that I  will continue fighting to find the facts. The American people deserve  to know why the FBI failed to complete a full investigation of these  powerful and credible allegations. They deserve a full understanding of  what the investigation would have found. They deserve full access to  Judge Kavanaugh's record--those millions of pages of documents that  were concealed and that raise the question: What are they hiding? What  are they afraid of the American people seeing from the time that Brett  Kavanaugh served in the White House as Staff Secretary?   I filed an FOIA suit to force disclosure of millions of pages of  Judge Kavanaugh's documents that have been hidden from the country. The  majority leader chose to vote without seeing those documents, but I  have no intention of stopping in this effort until they have been  disclosed--and they will be. They will come out, adding to the cloud  and the stain.  [[Page S6623]]    The allegations here are desperately serious. They are credible and  powerful, and our job was to make sure that the facts and the evidence  either supported them or not.   Debates over the Supreme Court often focus on civil rights and civil  liberties, those protections enshrined in the first 10 Amendments to  the Constitution. Make no mistake. Those rights and liberties are at  stake here. But this Supreme Court debate is also about the fight  between powerful corporate interests and ordinary Americans.  Corporations have become adept at using the courts when their arguments  fail to persuade policymakers and the American people.   When the EPA bans polluters from spewing poison into the environment,  polluters go to court to stop that Agency. When the FCC prevents cable  giants from censoring the internet, those companies go to court to stop  that enforcement.   When the Labor Department or the NLRB take action to protect workers  or when the CFPB or FTC take action to protect consumers, big employers  and financial services firms go to court to stop them. If you want to  breathe clean air and drink clean water, if you want a free and open  internet, if you want to work or purchase products free of corporate  abuse and fraud, this fight is about your life. It is about you.   This nomination poses a clear and present danger to those enforcement  efforts. He poses a danger to the rights of women to decide when they  want to have children and to millions of Americans with preexisting  conditions who want to keep their affordable health insurance. He poses  a danger--clear and present--to workers and consumers who want to live  free of corporate domination. He poses, most dangerously, a threat to  the checks and balances that prevent a President from running this  country like his own personal fiefdom.   In his opinions, his speeches, his writings, and his testimony, we  can see where this nominee will take the country if he is a swing vote,  as he is likely to be on so many of these issues. He has used those dog  whistles or bumper stickers in his campaign for his nomination, those  terms and buzz words, ``abortion on demand.'' Sometimes he uses a  bullhorn, as when he promises conservative organizations that he will  overturn longstanding, near-unanimous precedents that have fallen out  of favor with the rightwing or when he goes out of his way to publish  long dissents, articulating a radical understanding of the law and its  value.   He has been not so much a nominee as a candidate for office. He has  been campaigning for this job since law school. Like many candidates  for office, he has spent that time demonstrating to potential political  patrons that if they pick him, he will diligently represent their  interests. He is their guy. That is how he became a member of that  elite group on the President's short list.   I will conclude by saying that most chilling--indeed, frightening for  me--was his appearance before this committee when he gave a rant and a  screed that was written the day before, so he said. It was delivered  word for word from that text. It was hardly the result of some  spontaneous insult or outburst. It was calculated and planned. It took  back the mask of the judge and revealed the man--bitter self-pity,  rageful, and a deep partisan, which he had demonstrated before  throughout his career as a party operative but perhaps not on the  bench. The man revealed there said to us: ``What goes around comes  around.''   He said that the powerful allegations of the sexual assault survivors  were the result of a leftwing conspiracy fueled by revenge on behalf of  the Clintons. Those remarks demean the brave and courageous survivors  who came forward on their own initiative, without any encouragement by  any Senator, and they were degrading to Christine Blasey Ford and  Deborah Ramirez and to the survivor community. They were directly  contrary to Judge Kavanaugh's own test of what a judge should do:         The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan       institution. The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on       opposite sides of the aisle.    He was sitting on one side of the aisle. In fact, he was sitting on  one distinct side of that side of the aisle. That is the reason former  Justice John Paul Stevens found his appearance before that committee-- not only his prepared remarks but what he said after--as disqualifying.  That is the reason the 2,400 lawyers and professors and former judges  have written urging that his nomination be rejected. That is the reason  I find most frightening.   I have appeared four times before the U.S. Supreme Court. Every time  has been an extraordinary honor, and I have spent a good part of my  career standing in front of judges, sometimes with juries and sometimes  not. What I prized in judges most importantly was that they were  nonpartisan, that they were objective and neutral. I don't know how  lawyers or ordinary parties to any case could stand before Judge  Kavanaugh now and feel they will be judged fairly and impartially.   My colleagues have come to accept these vague assurances from  nominees that they will simply call balls and strikes, that they will  follow settled precedent, but we have seen those vague promises  betrayed when judges or Justices actually reach the Court.   I look to what he said in that hearing before the Judiciary Committee  as a warning about what will happen if Justice Kavanaugh is confirmed.  What he wrote in the op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal provides no  assurance because the real Brett Kavanaugh came before our committee,  and the real Brett Kavanaugh wrote down in advance what he felt. The  real Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Even at this late hour, I hope my colleagues will heed that warning.   We may lose this battle, but we cannot lose the broader struggle for  justice in this country. I will stay angry. I hope my colleagues and  others around the country will as well.   To the young people who came to these halls wearing that T-shirt, ``I  am what's at stake,'' you are right. You are what is at stake. Stay  angry.   I yield the floor.
