 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, well, we all know what has happened  since October 7. Hamas has launched more than 6,000 rockets into  Israel. They have sent more than 1,000 terrorists across the border to  murder civilians. This is the most devastating slaughter of Jews since  the Holocaust. They have killed more than 1,400 Israelis; 291 of them  have been soldiers. They have taken 199 hostages, including an unknown  number of Americans. This was also one of the deadliest terrorist  attacks in our history. They killed 30 U.S. citizens, and 13 are still  missing or are unaccounted for.   Israel is the victim. Even the Biden White House has acknowledged  that. This hasn't stopped several of my Democratic colleagues from  calling for a cease-fire. All of this, also, has not stopped Black  Lives Matter and other pro-Palestinian groups from glorifying the mass  slaughter of Jews.   Students for Justice, in Palestine, called it a ``historic win.''   Jews in New York, Atlanta, Washington, DC, London, Berlin, and so  many other cities around the globe are once again living in fear.   Just this weekend, protesters in Nashville, TN, refused to condemn  the horrific violence against the Israelis. Instead, they insisted that  these innocent people had it coming because their government's politics  don't line up with the radical left's talking points.   This is, indeed, insanity. If we allow these positions to define our  foreign policy, we put the lives of Israelis and Americans and our  allies in danger.   The United States designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist  organization in  [[Page S4970]]  1997. Their stated goal is to destroy the State of Israel through  jihad. Over the years, we have seen them commit acts of violence so  depraved that allies to the so-called Palestinian cause deny them  entirely rather than attempt to rationalize them. We know, right now,  that 600,000 Gazans have been evacuated but that they have trapped more  than enough women and children to use as human shields. Absolutely  despicable.   We also know that they use international aid money not for  humanitarian aid but to fund their efforts, their war efforts--their  jihad. Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism and sends  $100 million annually to Hamas. That is in addition to supplying them  with technology, logistical support, and weapons.   When the Biden administration announced their plan to give the  Iranians access to $6 billion in frozen assets, we knew exactly what  that meant for Israel. The constant refrain from the Biden  administration is that there is ``no direct link to Iran regarding this  attack.'' It is time for whomever wrote that talking point to turn on  the news, to look at the pictures that are on the screen, to listen to  what you are hearing from the Ayatollah and some of the Iranian  officials who are, by the way, meeting with Hamas leadership in Qatar.   In the first hours of the attack, the Biden administration projected  nothing but weakness. They deleted multiple tweets calling for a cease- fire. It took the President almost 12 hours to make a statement. This  sent a very clear message to our enemies. It also sends a message to  our allies.   We can start by giving Israel what they need to eradicate these  terrorists. Last week, I sent a letter urging President Biden to  support Israel in all possible ways. Under President Trump, we cut aid  to the Palestinians because the Palestinian Authority used that money  to reward terrorism. In 2021, President Biden reversed that policy, and  since then, he has sent more than $730 million to the Palestinians,  even though he knows there is a high risk. We know money is fungible,  and we know what Iran does with their money--they fund terrorism; they  fund their proxies.   And, while we are at it, let's start treating Iran like the dangerous  state sponsor of terror it is. Last week, I led 19 Senate Republicans,  in a letter, calling on President Biden to permanently freeze Iran's  access to that $6 billion. We should send those dollars to Israel to  pay for the damage that Hamas has done. There should be no more  backdoor deals with Qatar, no more silent agreements, no more quiet  agreements. Let's have a formal agreement that will stop the  backpedaling and will stop the intentions to release that money, which  is what they will do when the media attention on this issue dissipates.   None of this will matter if we don't root out the incompetence and  malicious influence in our own government. Last week, I sent a letter  to President Biden demanding the immediate removal of Jake Sullivan as  his National Security Advisor. He was wrong about Afghanistan, the  Middle East, and that nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. He has got to go,  as do the Iranian assets that President Biden has given top secret  security clearances to.   Last month, I stood right here and described how President Biden sent  Robert Malley, Ariane Tabatabai, and other operatives to negotiate the  failed Iran nuclear deal. Now, Mr. Malley and Ms. Tabatabai have been  involved with the Iran Experts Initiative, and then the President gave  them top secret security clearances and sent them to negotiate on the  Iran deal. This has to stop.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, October 8, 2023.      President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: We write today to express our       unwavering support for Israel, our greatest ally in the       Middle East, and our outrage at your administration's failed       leadership on the international stage.        Israel is at war. Yesterday, Hamas, the Iran-backed       Palestinian terrorist group, launched an unprecedented and       coordinated land, air, and sea attack against Israel. This       occurred during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, the day       after the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, and on       Shabbat--a day of rest and peace for Jews around the world.       Terrorists have infiltrated Israel, taking innocent Israeli       civilians and servicemembers hostage. Hundreds of Israelis       have died, and the fighting has not ceased.        This violent attack deserves a strong, unequivocal       condemnation by the United States. Instead, while the attacks       persisted and Israel was threatened, your administration       initially issued a statement calling on Israel to ``refrain       from violence.'' So far, the administration's response has       been far weaker than Israel--a shining beacon of democracy       and our most important ally in the Middle East--deserves.        While this is not the first act of aggression by the Hamas       terrorists against one of our greatest allies, it is       certainly the boldest. The failures of this administration on       the world stage have no doubt emboldened those who would wish       America and our allies harm. Reports indicate that U.S. arms       abandoned during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal ended       up in Hamas' hands. This terrorist organization is also       funded by the Iranian regime, the world's largest state       sponsor of terrorism, whose coffers this administration has       filled with over $6 billion in sanctions relief. Indeed,       recent reports have revealed the existence of the Iran       Experts Initiative (IEI), an Iranian regime-backed foreign       influence network. Included among the network's membership is       Ariane Tabatabai, now chief of staff to the Assistant       Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity       Conflict, along with other close contacts of your Special       Envoy for Iran, Robert Malley--whose security clearance the       State Department suspended earlier this year and who is now       subject to an FBI investigation for his alleged mishandling       of classified information. The world needs American       leadership, and this administration has left a void that the       New Axis of Evil and terrorist groups like Hamas have already       begun exploiting.        Over 75 years ago, the United States was the first nation       to recognize the Jewish state of Israel and affirm its right       to exist. Now, in the face of senseless attacks by Iran-      backed Hamas terrorists, we must again stand with Israel and       reaffirm its right to defend itself. The United States of       America does not abandon its friends. We urge this       administration to support Israel however possible, including       by providing any and all weapons and munitions necessary, and       to punish the terrorists who did this, along with those who       aid them. We must act swiftly and strongly.            Sincerely,      Marsha Blackburn.      Bill Hagerty.        United States Senators.      Tim Burchett.      Chuck Fleischmann.      Diana Harshbarger.      John Rose.      Scott DesJarlais, M.D.      Mark E. Green, M.D.      Andy Ogles,        Members of Congress.                                   ____                                             United States Senate,                                    Washington, DC, October 9, 2023.      President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: We write today to affirm our unwavering       support for Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, and       call on the U.S. Department of State to freeze the accounts       in Qatar containing $6 billion in Iranian funds that were       released from South Korean accounts in September.        Since Hamas began its attack on Israel on Saturday, more       than 4,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza, countless       Israelis have been injured, and more than 130 individuals       have been kidnapped by Hamas terrorists. Hundreds of       civilians have been brutally murdered in Israel, and recent       reports confirm that several Americans were killed in the       attacks.        Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, and       Wall Street Journal reported that the Islamic Revolutionary       Guard Corps worked with Hamas to plan the ongoing attacks on       Israel. These horrific attacks come on the heels of the State       Department issuing sanctions waivers for Iranian funds held       in South Korean accounts to be converted from won to euros       and then transferred to bank accounts in Qatar.        To stand by and allow Iran access to these funds as Hamas       infiltrates Israel and murders, rapes, and mutilates       countless Israelis is unconscionable. Your administration       claims these funds are only available for humanitarian use,       but money is fungible, and there is a significant risk they       could be used to further efforts by Iran or Hamas against       Israel. Moreover, allowing $6 billion to flow into Iran's       economy, even if the purpose is for humanitarian aid, allows       the Iranian regime to reallocate even more funds to       supporting terrorism. Oversight over the use of this $6       billion is not enough, and the oversight mechanism is       crippled by your reported decision to pull the longstanding       Treasury attache from Qatar. The State Department should       immediately rescind the waivers that allowed Iranian funds to       be converted and moved to more accessible bank accounts, as       well as work with U.S. ally Qatar to immediately freeze the       accounts containing these funds.  [[Page S4971]]         We must stand with Israel and restrict access to these       Iranian funds. Iran should be placed under the most stringent       sanctions admissible. Anything short of this is unacceptable       and only aids in the ability of Iran and Hamas to fund these       heinous acts.            Sincerely,        Marsha Blackburn, United States Senator; Steve Daines,       United States Senator; Kevin Cramer, United States Senator;       James Lankford, United States Senator; John Cornyn, United       States Senator; Lindsey Graham, United States Senator; Tom       Cotton, United States Senator; Mike Braun, United States       Senator; Thom Tillis, United States Senator; Rick Scott,       United States Senator.

President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: I write to you today to demand the       immediate removal of Jake Sullivan as your National Security       Advisor. Mr. Sullivan has routinely misled the entire       government about the status of security threats around the       world. Just eight days before Hamas launched their barbaric       surprise attack against Israel, he stated, ``the Middle East       is quieter today than it has been in two decades.'' Yet, to       date, over 1,200 Israelis have been killed, over 150 hostages       have been taken from the safety of their homes, and at least       27 Americans lives have been lost, with at least 14 Americans       still missing. This is Jake Sullivan's perception of a quiet       Middle East. This is unacceptable.        Sullivan has been dead wrong on how to engage with Iran       since his first day as National Security Advisor. His       policies of appeasement toward Iran have only emboldened the       world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. Sullivan had       direct influence in establishing the remarkably flawed 2015       Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly referred       to as the Iran nuclear deal. Thankfully, this decision was       later reversed, sparing the world from an expanded Iranian       influence under this misguided policy that allowed Iran to       continue to fund its terrorist proxies and build up its       ballistic missile program. As your National Security Advisor,       we have since seen Mr. Sullivan reinstitute many of the       mistakes from the failed JCPOA. Easing sanctions against Iran       and refusing to enforce others is not an effective solution,       and this attack is clear evidence of that fact.        You simply cannot negotiate with the savages of the Iranian       regime. The Iranian regime has no qualms with funding       extremist terrorists, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and       Hezbollah, all of which seek to destroy Israel. We have seen       Iran-backed Hamas murder innocent civilians, we have evidence       that Hamas has beheaded babies and burned Israelis alive, and       we are all aware that they are taking hostages for rape,       mutilation, and murder. Their actions directly mock every       freedom-loving American. To stop their spread of influence       throughout the region, we must immediately reverse course and       reinforce our commitment on the sanctions levied against       Iran. Anyone who thinks the appeasement of Tehran is an       effective national security strategy must be removed for the       sake of all Americans.        Sullivan's deleterious mistakes with respect to Iran and       Iran-backed Hamas only build on his earlier involvement in       the administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.       There, we stood by and watched the Taliban take over the       country in less than two weeks. We cannot have someone with       his notable history of poor decision-making, and lack of       critical insights, as the most senior advisor to the       President on our nation's security matters. Continuing to do       so is misguided. You said it yourself, Mr. President--the       United States must stand with Israel. Leaving Jake Sullivan       in his current position hinders both Israel's, as well as the       United States', national security posture.            Sincerely,                                                  Marsha Blackburn,                                             United States Senator.     Madam President, we all have a choice here: Will the  United States act with courage or are we going to sit quiet and allow  this barbarism to continue?   Israeli forces report that Hamas bound boys and girls before shooting  them in the head--children who were bound and then shot in the head.  They found families who had been burned alive. There are reports that  young women had been raped and then mutilated. Hamas turned a music  festival into a killing field. The beheadings of babies--we have heard  those reports. These will live in infamy.   The historians have a phrase to describe massacres like this. It is  ``Holocaust by bullets.'' It is inconceivable that any of my colleagues  could tolerate the demands that Israel surrender to terrorists.   It is time for this President, his advisers, and all of our  colleagues--all of our colleagues--who told the Israelis to stand down  to take a good, hard look at where complacency and appeasement gets us.  Look at Gaza. Look at Iran. Look at Afghanistan. Look at China. Look at  our own southern border. Since October 1, Border Patrol has apprehended  30 Iranians. That is since the 1st of this month, this year. This is  who the Border Patrol has apprehended: 30 Iranians, 60 Syrians, 35  Pakistanis, more than 100 Russians, 285 Afghans, and 2,000 Chinese-- trying to cross our southern border undetected.   Now, do they all mean us harm? Probably not, but we cannot know that  for sure because this administration refuses to acknowledge the  possibility that terrorists are coming across this southern border--246  apprehended since Joe Biden became President. What are we doing? What  are we doing? How do we know the intentions of those 30 Iranians? 2,000  Chinese? 100 Russians? Is there a guarantee they are not here to kill  us?   The job of Hamas: kill people. You have watched them do it with glee.  Terrorists, what do they do? They set up terror cells. They wait to  strike to kill you--to kill you.   I have got to tell you: This administration needs to grow a spine.  They need to grow a spine, and they need to be solid and resolute that  they are going to protect this country and our citizens and our allies.  And our enemies are going to know that they are an enemy, because we  will treat them like that. We have got a choice: We can show courage;  we can surrender; we can practice appeasement. But that is the choice.   This country needs to show courage and leadership. I hope that this  body and this administration will choose courage and leadership.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Tennessee is home to the  world's most talented singers, songwriters, musicians, and composers.  The music that these gifted artists create connects with us on such a  personal level that sometimes it is easy to forget about the dedicated  industry professionals working behind the scenes to make sure we hear  it.   Doug Howard has been at the center of Nashville's music industry  since the 1970s, first as a student, and then in the worlds of  publishing and recording before heading back to academia. Last year, he  retired from his role as the dean of Belmont University's Mike Curb  College of Entertainment and Music, and earlier this month, he received  the Mulloy Award of Excellence for his important impact on the  entertainment industry and his notable service to the Belmont  University music community.  [[Page S4975]]    Over the years, Doug has not only nurtured this community's creative  spirit but empowered them to take ownership of their craft. The fusion  of artistry and business acumen that he helped foster at Belmont and in  the careers of up-and-coming music professionals has, slowly but  surely, changed the way artists and fans alike think about the presence  of music in their lives.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I want to thank my friend Doug Howard  for his dedication to Nashville's music community and congratulate him  on receiving this latest, tremendous honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my honor to  congratulate the women of the General James Robertson Chapter of  National Society Daughters of the American Revolution on their  organization's 100th anniversary.   The General James Robertson Chapter was founded on October 16, 1923,  by Maria Kirkman ``Queenie'' Woods Washington, a Nashville social icon  who could trace her family's roots back to President George Washington.  Queenie served as the chapter's first regent and immediately set high  standards for her fellow members. Their early emphasis on historic  preservation, education, and patriotism laid the foundation for what  has become one of the Volunteer State's most active service  organizations.   I am honored to count myself among the approximately 100 women of the  General James Robertson Chapter who today honor that singular  commitment to service. And it is my hope that the love of country that  drives our membership will inspire future generations of Tennessee  women to put their talents to bear on behalf of students, Active-Duty  servicemembers, and their neighbors in the greater Nashville  community.                            ____________________
