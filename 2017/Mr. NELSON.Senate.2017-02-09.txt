 Mr. President, just like the distinguished Senator from  Virginia, I, too, have had so many Floridians reach out to me. And  sometime in the next 12 hours--literally in the next 12 hours--we are  going to vote on the confirmation of the President's nominee for the  Health and Human Services Secretary. The reason so many people are  reaching out to us, giving us these personal stories, is that HHS is  the primary agency for protecting the health of all Americans as an  agency. You could certainly say we ourselves are primarily responsible  for our health, or in the case of children, their parents, but when you  get to an agency of the U.S. Government, it is HHS. It provides health  coverage through Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal marketplace, and  the Children's Health Insurance Program.   I don't want it to be lost on the Senators--you know a little bit  about Florida and that the percentage of our population that is elderly  is very high, which translates into 4 million people in my State on  Medicare for access to health services, and another 3.5 million  Floridians rely on Medicaid and CHIP for care. So that alone is reason  to be concerned about this appointment.   Another nearly 2 million Americans signed up for coverage under  healthcare.gov--specifically 1.8 million in the State of Florida. That  is more signing up under the ACA under healthcare.gov than any other  State. Nine million other Floridians get their health coverage from  their employers and benefit from some of the ACA protections, such as  prohibiting insurers from imposing lifetime limits or discriminating  against people with preexisting conditions. That is another 9 million  Floridians.   I am concerned that, if confirmed, Congressman Price would be the  President's top adviser on these important issues and that he would be  responsible for upholding President Trump's promise to protect Medicare  and Medicaid. He would be responsible for upholding President Trump's  promise that any ACA replacement plan will ``have insurance for  everyone.'' That is what Candidate Trump said.   This nominee would be responsible for upholding President Trump's  promise to keep in place the protections that prevent insurance  companies from discriminating against individuals with preexisting  conditions. How many times before the ACA did we have some of our  constituents tell us they were denied coverage because they had a  preexisting condition--a rash. Because of the law, no one can be denied  health insurance now.   Yet Congressman Price's record and the policies he has supported  throughout his seven terms in Congress are in direct conflict with  President Trump's stated goals. In fact, Congressman Price's proposed  budget in the House cuts nearly $500 billion from Medicare and turns it  into a voucher program. His plan would give seniors a fixed dollar  amount--that is the voucher--to buy insurance. Most every economist  would tell us that means higher monthly premiums. According to the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, turning Medicare into a  voucher program would cause seniors to pay 11 percent more out of their  pockets. Is that what we want to do to our senior citizens? I don't  think so. We better think about it.   I can state that the seniors in my State are petrified when folks  start messing with their Medicare. One of my constituents said in a  letter that he wrote to me:         I hear that Congress is proposing changes to Medicare,       which would provide a fixed-dollar amount to purchase medical       insurance in the private sector. This monumental shift would       put an undue financial burden on fixed income retirees.    Linda, another constituent from Tampa, wrote to me back in January  and said:         I am 68 years old. I am a woman who depends on Social       Security and Medicare. My years in the workforce were meant       to help cushion my retirement with money I invested from       dollars earned, and now my living and my access to health       care are threatened. Please, please, do all you can to       prevent the loss of these important hard-earned necessities.    That is what she wrote to me.   These are just two examples of seniors for whom we need to stand up  and fight.   Half of all Medicare beneficiaries have incomes of less than $24,000,  and they have savings of less than $63,000. I want to say that again  because that is the condition of many senior citizens. Half of all  Medicare beneficiaries have incomes of less than $24,000, and half of  those beneficiaries have savings of less than $63,000. Based on these  numbers, seniors simply can't afford to pay 11 percent more out of  their pocketbooks for benefits. Seniors can't take a chance on  Congressman Price as their HHS Secretary by virtue of what he has  already said and what his record is in the Congress.   The Congressman also supports raising the Medicare eligibility age to  67, forcing seniors to wait for benefits they earned during their  working years. They have been waiting patiently until they reach age  65, and now it is being pushed up another 2 years. By increasing the  age from 65 to 67, Congressman Price is forcing Americans to work  longer to maintain the health coverage they were promised or forcing  them to go without insurance.   Approximately 92 percent of older adults have at least one chronic  disease, and 77 percent of older adults have at least two chronic  diseases. Forgoing critical health coverage is not an option for these  folks, and who is going to stand up and fight for them? I know Senator  Kaine and I will.   The Congressman refused to answer my question in the Finance  Committee on whether he supports the ACA that saved seniors money on  the cost of their prescription drugs by closing the Medicare D gap that  we call the doughnut hole. Under the ACA, more prescription drugs were  paid for by Medicare than had been the case before. What that  translates into in Florida is seniors saved $1,000 a year, thanks to  the reduction of the gap in the prescription drug coverage. So why in  the world would we want to get rid of something that is saving our  seniors money and is doing exactly what it was intended to do--save  them money on their prescriptions? We should be looking for ways to  lower, not raise, the cost of prescription drugs for our senior  citizens.   In November of last year, Congressman Price said that he wants to  overhaul Medicare in the first 6 to 8 months of the Trump  administration using a fast-track procedure known as reconciliation-- getting around the 60-vote threshold requirement that forces us to have  bipartisan compromise on the floor of the Senate in legislation. That  [[Page S1001]]  is what he said he wanted to do to force it through on a reconciliation  bill. Well, I don't think that sounds too good.   So when you look at all of this, what is the conclusion? The  Congressman's record and statements made as recently as 3 months ago do  not match President Trump's promises. Our country deserves an HHS  Secretary who will uphold those promises, not inflict deep, harmful  cuts that fundamentally alter the health and financial security  Medicare provides Americans in their later years.   For these reasons and others, sometime in this next 11\1/2\ hours  when we vote, I am going to vote no on this nominee. There is too much  at stake for our seniors to give this nominee control over these  programs.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.
