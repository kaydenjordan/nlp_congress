 Mr. Speaker, in Rhode Island and across the country,  the manufacturing industry employs Americans in high-paying, high- skilled jobs while driving innovation and bolstering our national  defense.   Unfortunately, manufacturers in my home State have informed me that  they can't find enough qualified candidates to fill job openings, and  their current workforce is aging. This is something that is facing  manufacturers, I know, across the country.   To address this challenge, I have been a strong advocate for career  and technical education, and yesterday, I introduced the Retain  Innovation and Manufacturing Excellence Act.   This bill, which is a companion to my good friend Senator Sheldon  Whitehouse's bill in the Senate, will help manufacturers train new  workers by providing funds to retain retiring employees long enough to  train their replacements.   Our Nation's manufacturers are a cornerstone of our economy, and I am  proud to introduce this bill during Manufacturing Month to build the  next generation of skilled workers.                            ____________________
