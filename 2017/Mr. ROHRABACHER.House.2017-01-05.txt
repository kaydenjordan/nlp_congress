 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 11.  Contrary to the U.N. resolution that we are condemning today, which  condemns the settlements that are taking place in Israel, the new  settlements that the Israelis find themselves permitting are not  undermining the cause of peace. Let's get this straight. This is what  we just hear over and over again that the settlements are undermining  peace.   What undermines peace is when the Palestinian people continue with  their policies of terrorism, both attacking with missiles and rockets,  as well as stabbings, as well as the Palestinian people and their  leaders unwilling to stand up and recognize that Israel exists. They  don't have a right to flood into that country with a right of return.  That is what undermines the peace.   The settlements wouldn't be taking place, except the Israelis and the  United Nations and the supporters of the Palestinians have made a  mockery of the deal that was made.   The Israelis withdrew from control of the territory. They withdrew,  and they permitted the Palestinians to establish authority there with  two promises: number one, they wouldn't use the territory to attack  Israel; and number two, they would recognize Israel's right to exist,  and this right of return permitting them to flood into Israel and  eliminate it that way did not exist.   The Palestinians have given up nothing. The Israelis have given up  territory and made themselves vulnerable to the type of attack that  leaves Israelis dead every day from terrorist attacks.   No, the U.N. has it wrong. That resolution by the U.N. makes peace  less likely.
