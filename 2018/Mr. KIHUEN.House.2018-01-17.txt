 Mr. Chairman, I rise to briefly speak about H.R. 3326,  the World Bank Accountability Act, which the House is voting on this  afternoon.   Mr. Chairman, last summer, I joined my Democratic and Republican  colleagues in supporting H.R. 3326 in the Financial Services Committee  to authorize the United States to participate in replenishing the  International Development Association, the IDA.   However, Democrats made it clear during consideration of this bill in  committee that our support depended on changes to certain provisions.  Specifically, we believe that prohibitions in the bill put the U.S.  funding at risk and make it too easy for the administration to cut off  funding for vulnerable nations.   Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues have  chosen not to uphold our agreement and address these concerns. Given  the recent events and remarks by President Trump degrading developing  nations and the people who live in them, we should be concerned about  giving the administration this power.   It is critical that Congress provide moral leadership and demonstrate  to the world that the United States will not ignore or punish countries  that are struggling with poverty or conflict. We must send a strong  signal that the United States Congress respects people of all  backgrounds and nationalities.   Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
