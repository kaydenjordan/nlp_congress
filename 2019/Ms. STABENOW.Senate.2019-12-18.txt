 Mr. President, I rise today because I am very glad to  see the Senate moving forward in taking up the nomination of Stephanie  Davis to be the district court judge for the Eastern District of  Michigan.   Judge Davis was nominated by President Trump back in March to be a  U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Michigan. Our  bipartisan Eastern District Judicial Nominations Advisory Committee  strongly supported her. She was reported out of committee by a voice  vote on May 22, and no one has expressed any concerns about her record,  nor would they have a reason to express a concern. She is exceedingly  qualified.   Judge Davis has been working in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the  Eastern District of Michigan since 1997. During her time there, she has  served in both the civil and criminal divisions. She has prosecuted  fraud, bank robbery, embezzlement, violent crime, public corruption,  and criminal conspiracies involving drug trafficking and money  laundering. We are very lucky to have someone of her experience  stepping forward and wanting to serve in this position. She has also  overseen community and law enforcement initiatives and led the office's  diversity efforts.   I have had the opportunity to meet with Judge Davis. I came away from  my very first meeting, as well as subsequent conversations, being very  impressed with her background and her commitment to public service. She  will be an excellent addition to the Federal judiciary, and I urge my  colleagues to support her nomination.   I yield the floor.                        Nomination of anuraag singhal     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
