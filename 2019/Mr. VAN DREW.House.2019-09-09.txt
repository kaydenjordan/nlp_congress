 Madam Speaker, Cape May County's 4-H Foundation and  Fairgrounds recently celebrated their 50th anniversary. After many  years of moving from place to place, the 4-H Fair opened on July 24,  1969, at its current fairgrounds in Cape May County in South Jersey.   Many of the traditions established back then are still carried on  today, such as a chicken BBQ, pet parade, and talent show for the young  people who participate in the 4-H program.  [[Page H7551]]    Through clubs that specialize in things like fishing, small animals,  reptiles, horses, sewing, robotics, the program enriches many aspects  of learning.   Research has shown that young people in 4-H are almost four times as  likely to engage in STEM programs during the school year, thanks to  what they explore and learn during their time in the program.   The four H's stands for Head, Heart, Hands, and Health, and it is  clear that Cape May County 4-H has been deepening these young people's  skills in all of these areas.   To all the participants, workers, volunteers, and especially Linda  Horner of Cape May County's 4-H Foundation and Fairgrounds,  congratulations on 50 years, for sure.   You are helping youth become confident, mature adults ready to take  on the world. And you are making South Jersey proud.                            ____________________
