 Madam Speaker, today is a great day for public  safety. I thank my colleagues for passing my amendment in this year's  FAA reauthorization package.   Fourteen years ago, we tragically lost 49 lives when Colgan Air  Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo in Clarence, New York, due to pilot  inexperience.   This prompted Congress then to strengthen requirements for pilots to  ensure that something like this never happens again--and it has worked.   Since then, there has not been a single commercial airline crash in  the United States of America. One of those enhanced safety measures  required 1,500 hours of in-air training for pilots.   The rigorous training and practice gained during those hours ensure  that pilots are well-prepared to handle  [[Page H3875]]  emergencies, adverse weather conditions, and any unforeseen challenges  that might arise during flight.   Our amendment protected the integrity of the 1,500-hour flight  requirement to maintain the safety standards that passengers and crews  have come to expect.   I am grateful for the support of Representatives Higgins and Tenney,  and all of my colleagues who stood behind the 1500-hour rule and this  year's FAA reauthorization package.   More importantly, I am proud to honor the memory of those tragically  lost on Flight 3407 and the families that have fought for these  standards.                            ____________________
