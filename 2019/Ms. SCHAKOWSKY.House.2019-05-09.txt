 Mr. Chairman, I believe that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are standing up and saying what they would like  to see, and that is to protect people with preexisting conditions. The  problem with what they are telling the American people is that what  they are proposing does not protect people with preexisting conditions.   I know when I first came to Congress as a woman, being a woman was a  preexisting condition. There were a lot of things that weren't covered  because we are women, until we passed the Affordable Care Act.   While the Republicans are talking about protecting such people, they  are supporting a lawsuit, right now, that, once again, would undo all  of the Affordable Care Act, sweeping out with them protections for  preexisting conditions.   But the other key word to listen to is flexibility. They are talking  about allowing up to 4 years of policies that States could enact that  do not cover the whole panoply of things that the Affordable Care Act  covers and could exclude even protection for preexisting conditions.  That is not flexibility. That is taking away benefits from people.   You can sign up for one of these, what we call, junk policies and you  are perfectly well, and then all of a sudden you have some kind of an  illness that, guess what, is not covered, and won't be covered, because  then you will have a preexisting condition.   The legislation Democrats have for you today would protect  preexisting conditions, no questions, period, end of story.    Madam Speaker, the report on the investigation into  Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, more commonly  known as the Mueller report, outlines efforts by the Russian Government  to manipulate the United States election  [[Page H3662]]  system and directly attack American democracy. It outlines alleged  coordination between individuals associated with one camp and Russia to  influence our election.   It also documents multiple instances of potential obstruction of  justice.   The report has been mischaracterized and spun in inappropriate ways  in the Halls of Congress and within the media.   In reality, the report documents widespread activities undertaken by  many in positions of power that were at best unethical and at worst  illegal.   But you don't have to take my word for it. Instead, listen to the  following examples taken directly from the report and judge for  yourself.   I am going to begin with a quote from the Mueller report and then  invite my colleagues to also simply read from the document, which the  American people should know can be downloaded for free from the  Department of Justice website.   ``The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent  present difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were  making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we  had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the  President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so  state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are  unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not  conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not  exonerate him.'' Volume II, page 8.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis) to quote from the Mueller report.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Casten).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar).

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes).

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).    ``The President engaged in a second phase of conduct,  involving public attacks of the investigation, nonpublic efforts to  control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage  witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.''   Volume II, page 7.   ``The President's position as the head of the executive branch  provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official  proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.''   Volume II, page 7.   ``Substantial evidence indicates that the President's effort to have  Sessions limit the scope of the special counsel's investigation to  future election interference was intended to prevent further  investigative scrutiny of the President's and his campaign's conduct.''    Volume II, page 97.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   We have talked about how shocking it is for our country, the United  States of America, which is, despite any effort to change, a country of  immigrants. I know the gentlewoman, herself, is an immigrant to the  United States of America.   My parents, neither were born in the United States of America. But  this is a place where my family was able to find refuge from the  pogroms in Eastern Europe and make a good life here. And yet, today, we  are seeing such horror that, if it were another country, I think we  would want sanctions. We would go to the United Nations. How could a  country separate families?   And it is not just at the border, as Members know. Inside our  country, in my city of Chicago, we are finding families that are scared  all the time, mixed families where the children might be citizens and  the parents undocumented. The kids are afraid to go to school,  wondering if their parents will be there when they get home.   But that trip to the border that the Congresswoman helped organize is  something that I will never, ever forget. Seeing people in cages,  seeing that grandmother--remember?--who was inconsolable because she  came with her 7-year-old granddaughter who was taken from her because  our country did not recognize a grandmother as family. That child was  redesignated as an unaccompanied minor, and she thought she may never  see her granddaughter again, and maybe that is true.   There are thousands, we think, of children and families that are  separated. We don't know. Nobody knows. The Department of Homeland  Security doesn't know how many children have been separated from their  parents.   We saw some moms who were being reunited with their children, and one  of them was furious, and I was curious as to why. This mother said her  8-year-old daughter was told, ``Your mother abandoned you.'' Someone  representing our country said that to a child.   Who does that?   ``Your mother abandoned you, and you will be in a shelter until you  are 18 years old.'' That reunion, mother and daughter, did not go  smoothly at first, as you can imagine.   I mean, we saw a whole room full of people pleading guilty to  crossing the border because it wasn't at a designated border crossing.  It was so painful to see that. And that was the beginning of the zero- tolerance policy. And we are still seeing families separated, families  suffering 1 year later.   And, Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for calling attention to  this and for organizing that visit to the border, which is forever in  my mind.
