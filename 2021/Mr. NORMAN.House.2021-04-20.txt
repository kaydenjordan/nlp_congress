 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rozalynn  Federline for her substantial political investment in my district. She  most recently  [[Page H1961]]  served as the president of the Clover-Lake Wylie Republican Women, the  largest Republican women's organization in the Fifth District of South  Carolina.   Rozalynn held this position for 3 years, where she made great  contributions to the conservative movement in York County. She was also  a volunteer for the Clover Lake Wylie Preservation Park District and  played an active role in collecting signatures to get their referendum  on the ballot.   Prior to moving to South Carolina, Rozalynn served as a board member  and president of the Ocean Springs Republican Women in Mississippi. She  later joined the Jackson County Republican Party executive committee.  Rozalynn was the first female Republican to run for alderman in Ocean  Springs. Unfortunately, she lost to the Democratic incumbent by only 23  votes.   Rozalynn also served on the Ocean Springs Chamber of Commerce  executive committee for 4 years, where she was chosen as one of the  Outstanding Young Women of America in 1983.    She was president of both the Taconi Elementary Parent Teachers  Organization and the Duchess Club children's charity in Mississippi.   Throughout her career, Rozalynn held her own as an international  ocean sales account executive at CSX Corporation and Maersk  Incorporated, which were two of the largest shipping companies in the  world.   One of Clover's most hardworking and loyal constituents, Rozalynn has  proven herself an asset to the community. Rozalynn's continued  dedication to promoting conservative values in South Carolina and  beyond is a blessing that will never go unnoticed.   She and her husband, Chip, echoed and lived the motto: To live is to  serve.                            ____________________
