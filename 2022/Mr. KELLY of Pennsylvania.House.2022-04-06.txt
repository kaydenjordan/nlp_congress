 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address some  of the biggest problems facing the United States today and, quite  frankly, the world.   As the war between Russia and Ukraine wages on, many Americans have  been quickly reminded of just how global our economy really is.   Now, prior to the war, Russia provided the United States with 8  percent of our Nation's oil and refined products. A war involving  Russia can suddenly spike fuel prices at your local gas station. Like  many nationwide, drivers in my home district of western Pennsylvania  have seen gasoline at over $4 a gallon for well over a month.   The interruption of our Nation's oil supply and subsequent  skyrocketing prices are just the latest reminder that we need to  refocus our energy policies in Washington and produce more energy right  here at home in America.   Let's go back to May 2021, when two things happened: the United  States imported a record amount of Russian oil, and President Biden  waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2. That is the Russian natural gas  pipeline set to supply much of Europe with energy.   Now, 4 months earlier the President canceled the Keystone XL pipeline  between the United States and Canada. That pipeline would have  delivered an additional 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day. That is  830,000 barrels of crude oil per day.   That would have gone to U.S. refineries, and it would have created  thousands and thousands of jobs. That is more oil than the United  States imports from Russia each day. This is a no-brainer. Just bring  back the pipeline. It is so easy to do and so easy to institute.   Why would we not do that?   Why would we not be energy independent?   We can't depend on bad foreign actors such as Russia, Venezuela, or  Iran to help provide our Nation's energy. Above all I applaud the  collective effort right here in Washington to stop bankrolling the  Russian war machine by buying their products.   According to the Council on Foreign Relations, revenue from the  energy sector is responsible for more than 40 percent of Russia's  federal budget. Some quick, back-of-the-envelope math, the 8 percent of  Russian oil we imported equates to 672,000 barrels of oil per day.   But this moment calls for a broader push to end our reliance on  foreign energy sources.   To start, President Biden should reverse his executive order banning  the Keystone pipeline.   Next, we must return to Trump-era energy policies that made the U.S.  energy independent. To amend the former President's famous tag line,  let's change it to make North America great again.   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 61 percent  of U.S. crude oil imports come from Canada. Another 11 percent comes  from Mexico. Seventy-two percent comes from our neighbors to the north  and our neighbors to the south.   We should be expanding oil imports from our allies and neighbors  rather than paying our adversaries who can hold our energy sector  hostage. Doing so not only makes economic sense, but it improves  relations with those closest to us and further strengthens our national  security by becoming less dependent on bullies like Russia, Venezuela,  and Iran.   Now, on the other hand, President Biden has single-handedly made  Americans poorer and our Nation's security weaker during his first year  in office. His anti-fossil fuel, Green New Deal wish list has placed  unnecessary burdens on the oil and gas industry.   Even as gas prices are reaching record highs here nationwide, just  last month President Biden had announced that he is pausing decisions  about new Federal oil and gas drilling as part of his plan to tackle  climate change. And that is just the beginning.   So far, President Biden has announced the release of 80 million  barrels of oil from the Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Just last  week President Biden announced he will release up to another 180  million barrels of oil over the next 6 months in an effort to drive  down gas prices. That doesn't drive down gas prices.   That theory really sounds good, but, Mr. Speaker, I want you to think  about where that oil is coming from. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is  to be used in times of a national emergency when we don't have a  supply. It is not used to just try and rack up some cheap political  points by saying: I am doing this so you won't have to pay that much at  the pump.   It is not working. It never will work.   Now, on November 23, the administration released 50 million barrels  from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. According to the U.S. Energy  Information Administration, the average price of gas dropped by a  whopping 2 cents. In following days, by December 6, it dropped another  3 cents. So we saved a nickel, but we attacked our Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.   Now, as of March 25 the reserve supply was 568 million barrels,  meaning that President Biden is ready to take one-third of our Nation's  reserve and use them for his short-term political gain that has already  proven to not lower gas prices for America but has weakened the  reserve.   Now, keep in mind, the purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is  to counter severe supply chain disruptions and enhance national  security. It is not to make your polls look better, Mr. President.   The 80 million barrels the President previously released are worth  only about 4 days of U.S. oil consumption. Only the President can  decide to withdraw oil from or refill the reserve. What is even more  frightening so far is China has hardly tapped their oil reserves.  President Biden's shortsighted decision-making is dangerously harming  our national security.  [[Page H4389]]    Now, I am proud to represent the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  a place once deemed and called the Saudi Arabia of natural gas.  Pennsylvania produces 21 percent of the natural gas extracted in the  United States. That is second only to Texas, according to the Energy  Information Administration.    In 2020, the Energy Information Administration adds that U.S. dry  natural gas production was about 10 percent greater than U.S. total  natural gas consumption. That means we can export natural gas that we  produce creating energy security for other nations, notably our  European allies who are currently dependent on Russia for their natural  gas, and it forges a stronger foreign policy in the process.   Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the spike in fuel costs go hand in  hand with American foreign policy. If we are dependent on bad actors  for energy, then we are subjecting ourselves to their demands. But if  we can supply the world with affordable energy, then we can strengthen  our international ties and reinforce relationships instead of falling  behind. Most importantly, we give the American people a greater sense  of security that Russia so desperately seeks to have only for itself.   On the topic of foreign policy, Mr. Speaker, I want to quote a great  fellow Pennsylvanian, Benjamin Franklin, who said: ``By failing to  prepare, you are preparing to fail.''   Now, I have thought an awful lot about our Founding Father's words as  we watched current events unfold around the world. So much of what we  are seeing right now mirrors itself in history.   Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a stark reminder that  bullies like Vladimir Putin will stop at nothing to achieve their end  game to upend democracy and freedom while chilling all the opposition  in the process.   This type of takeover carries a precedent. Putin's quest to conquer  Ukraine should remind all of us of what happened in the 1930s and 1940s  when Adolph Hitler began a similar pursuit across Europe. Now, for far  too long the free world watched from the sidelines hoping that European  forces could prevent further escalation only to find that Hitler and  the Axis Powers were relentless. Thankfully, the Allied forces defeated  the global bullies of that era.   Now, over 80 years later, we can consult history for potential  answers to modern power struggles. As Russia's military assault on  Ukraine continues, the United States and NATO allies must respond  together. After all, NATO, which is a collection of over 30 nations,  was formed in 1949 after World War II to prevent what?   Soviet aggression.   NATO has a responsibility to step up. Those member countries have a  responsibility to step in. All in all, hand in hand, the United  States--which is also the first responder to anything that goes wrong  in the world--needs to have help from other people, not America alone,  but America with our allies.   NATO's purpose remains as important today as it was back then. A  powerful, unified response has served the free world well throughout  history.   Now, much like World War II, we have existing or looming conflicts in  multiple regions or theaters of the world including Asia. Today, China  is threatening Taiwan. Now, as we are deflected from watching what is  going to happen in Taiwan and watching the dangerous situation in  Taiwan by what is going on in Ukraine--and I don't say we should take  our eyes off of what is going on in Ukraine--we should just not think  that that is the only theater that we have to be concerned with.   Taiwan is one of our major allies, and in recent months multiple  reports indicate that China has been quietly conducting combat  readiness drills near Taiwan, an island territory that China still  claims to own. This matters for two reasons: First, the Chinese are  watching the world's response to Putin's attempt at a land grab in  Ukraine because China is threatening to take over their own neighbor as  well.   Secondly, this could directly impact the American consumer. Ninety- two percent of the world's supply of advanced semiconductor chips--used  in everything from automobiles to cellphones--are made in Taiwan.   If we have learned nothing from the COVID pandemic, it is that we  cannot depend on other people around the world to supply us with those  things that we need the most. It is a fool's errand to think that  somehow this ends well. It does not. It ends terribly for us, and it  ends terribly for the free world.   Any large-scale attack on Taiwan means these chips would likely  become very scarce as almost everything else in the world is right now,  and in some cases probably unavailable altogether. That is why I am  cosponsoring the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors, or the  FABS Act, with Congressman  Mike McCaul.   This piece of legislation allows for a new tax credit through 2032  for investment in any semiconductor manufacturing facility and  semiconductor-designed expenditures right here at home.    What an unusual concept: to invest in American technology with  American workers to make America safer and stronger, not somebody a  world away from us. Let's do it right here at home. Let's do it right  here at home.   Now, currently we make just 12 percent of the world's semiconductor  chip supply. That is hard for me to imagine that we knew at the time  how necessary the semiconductor chips were, but we had kind of a blind  eye and a deaf ear to what it was that manufacturers were talking  about. We said: Do you know what? For a couple of pennies we can save,  let's send them over to Taiwan and have them make it. And we walked  away from what is so critical to us.   Now, the scary thing is that these are just the crises before us  right now. History reflects how a robust American foreign policy has  significantly shaped the world, specifically the Western Hemisphere. So  when we talk about the Western Hemisphere, this is one of the things I  think that is probably going more unnoticed than anything: In the 1800s  President Monroe knew that in its infancy the United States was  developing at a very quick rate, and it really looked like something  that other places around the world would look at with envy and say: Do  you know what? They are getting stronger every day, and they are  getting better every day. Maybe we need to get over there and colonize.  Maybe we need to get involved there.   So the Monroe Doctrine came into effect, and the whole idea behind  that was, let's make sure that people around the world cannot make an  effort to come in and get into our Western Hemisphere and cause us  great danger.   So the Monroe Doctrine came out. But then as things went on and we  got more powerful and we had more and more going for us, all of a  sudden, the world looked to us, and they just didn't take a slight  glance at us, but they looked at us with covetousness. They looked at  us with who we were and what we were becoming and all the valuable  things that were right here in our hemisphere.                                time  2015    So Teddy Roosevelt says: You know what? I am going to put together  the Roosevelt Corollary that really establishes guidelines for any  intervention in the United States or our Western Hemisphere.   The content within these policies largely addressed actions by  European nations or the inactions of Latin American nations. But I  believe they are relevant, once again, and are worth further review,  and here is why.   If you were to take a look at the Western Hemisphere and just take a  real broad look at it and say: Okay, fine, let's take a close look.  South America, Central America, up into the triangle, the deepwater  ports in Cuba, and both ends of the Panama Canal all have significant  foreign countries--and they are mainly China.   People tell me: You don't need to worry about that Panama Canal;  China is not really taking it over. I say: You know what? If you don't  read history, you don't study history, you are doomed to repeat it.   Why would we not look at what is going on right now in our Western  Hemisphere and say, we have put things into place to protect us from  foreign intervention.   I want to tell you, you look at the Western Hemisphere, South  America, Central America, the triangle, the  [[Page H4390]]  deepwater ports in Cuba, that would be ideal for heavy military use,  and both ends of the Panama Canal. If you don't think that is a threat  to American security, then you need to wake up. We are in great danger  right now and not knowing it.   First of all, the Chinese are not very quiet about what they are  trying to do. They have a theory that they want to take over the world.  They don't whisper about it; they don't sneak around about it; they  just do what they want to do. Their presence in Africa should be a  great awakening for us.   We have crippled ourselves with regulations and sanctions on so many  things that we need, and I don't know for what reason, other than  somehow we think that we are smarter than everybody else and we know  that we can protect ourselves. And the question is: Really, how? And  the answer is: Well, we really can't.   I guess our answer will be what it always is: We will write a strong  letter, and Jinping will get it. We will tell them: Please, stay out of  our hemisphere and please stop trying to influence the rest of the  world for evil. And we will tell Putin: You need to stop doing what you  are doing in Ukraine.   At some point, we will actually read history and say we have been  down this road before, but we failed to take action at a time that was  absolutely critical and pushed it on and pushed it out of sight, and  the price we paid was incredible. Let's not do that again.   There is an old saying that is: To be foretold is to be forewarned.  With everything going on in the world today, we hear a lot of people  using the term ``world war III.'' I am not here tonight telling you  that that is what is going to happen. I am here telling you tonight  that America and the free world have to understand that we have seen  this action before. We know what lies ahead of us, and we know the cost  of not addressing it early. We can do it through policy, but peace  always comes through strength, not through weakness.   Diplomacy is one thing, as Teddy Roosevelt said: ``Walk softly, but  carry a big stick.''   I would just suggest to you that if you go back to the year 2016-- actually 2017, when our 45th President of the United States, Donald  Trump, came into office, please tell me why for the 4 years Mr. Trump  was in office, the rest of the world stayed at bay? The bad actors of  the world didn't attempt to do any of the things that they are doing  today.   Certainly, last summer, in our demonstration of how we would leave a  country high and dry, that we would take out our military first and  leave our military equipment and citizens to face what was going on in  Afghanistan was a warning to the rest of the world that you better be  careful with the United States, because if you are not, they will pack  up their bags in the middle of the night and leave. That is not who we  are, that is not who we have ever been, and that is not who we can be  in a free world.   If our friends and allies in the free world take a look at what our  actions have been later--because actions always speak louder than  words--but we continue to use words, thinking that somehow bad actors  will cower and walk away from us, that is not the America that we know.  That is not the America that 1.4 million of our men and women in  uniform have died to protect and to send a message to the bad actors of  the world, we will always be here, we will always be on guard, and we  will never walk away from our responsibilities.   I don't know what has happened to America in a little bit over a  year. People always say: I think it is better to be respected than  feared. I think both have a great effect on everybody. I want both  those to be in effect.   I will tell you this: When Donald Trump was our President, nobody but  nobody messed with the U.S.A.   Mr. Speaker, we have so many things going on right now. We wonder:  What is the future? What is the future not only for America but for  America's friends and allies? We look at energy as one of the key  issues that we are talking about today, and we know that in America we  have endless supplies of energy. What is holding us back now are our  own regulations.   I heard the administration say: We have thousands of permits; why  don't you just go ahead and use them? Which really shows that they have  absolutely no idea that having a permit isn't the same as extracting  energy. Somehow, I guess, if you say it long enough and loud enough and  to the right crowd, they will nod their heads and say: I know. You are  right.   You know what? Get out into the field and see the people that  actually do it. Talk to the people that know how to extract energy.  Talk to the people that can go offshore. Talk to the people that go  deep down into the Earth. Talk to all of those people and tell them:  Don't worry. You have a permit. Just go ahead and use it. And by the  way, if you don't use it, we will start taxing you on your nonuse. How  upside down is this thinking?                             Pro-Life Information     Mr. Speaker, the last thing I am going to  address tonight is probably the most important issue of all, because  everything we talk about right now, everything we have addressed  already, is about life.   There was a tradition here that on Wednesdays people would wear red,  and they would wear red to remind people of the girls that had been  kidnapped by Boko Haram. We wanted those girls back, so we would wear  red and would walk around here and say: We have got red on today  because we want those girls back; Boko Haram has got to return those  girls.   So I started wearing red on Wednesdays. Friends on the other side  would say to me: So you are in concert with us; you believe the same  things we do? I would say: I absolutely do. I absolutely do. They said:  You want those girls back? I said: Yes, I do. But I don't want just the  girls that Boko Haram took; I want the girls back that have been  aborted. I want those girls back whose lives were ended. I want you to  really face the truth of what is going on in America today.   The wordsmithing that takes place here in the people's House, on the  floor, people talk about abortion as healthcare, taking the life of a  little boy or a little girl is healthcare.   Every night, we see pictures of what Russia is doing to Ukraine. Yet,  we have a deaf ear to the cries of the unborn, and we don't look at all  to those who are being lost every day. Because if you don't see them, I  guess they don't count.   Congress has long required that taxpayer dollars are not to be used  for abortions, and President Biden has actively tried to circumvent  this requirement. In April of 2021, under President Biden's leadership,  the NIH announced it would no longer require fetal tissue research  projects funded by the agency to go through an ethics advisory board.   So the question then becomes: Why do we have an ethics advisory  board, if we are not going to go to them to find out what it is that we  are talking about?   Then in September of 2021, we began hearing the horrific allegations  of illegal abortions being performed at the University of Pittsburgh  for harvesting fetal tissue.   I can tell you, me being on the floor tonight will resonate in  Pittsburgh and, unfortunately, it won't be by those who are pro-life;  it will be by those that think that somehow this is an attack on Pitt  and not an attack on little unborn boys and girls.   For all of those who do not like what I am saying tonight, please  take off your blinders and understand what is taking place.   We began hearing all of these horrible allegations of illegal  abortions being performed at the University of Pittsburgh for  harvesting fetal tissue. These abortions were performed as part of  Pitt's participation in an NIH program for the university to operate as  a fetal tissue repository for research happening around the country.   The types of abortions Pitt is accused of performing are horrific.  Babies that survived the abortion would be born alive and then killed.  This was to preserve--this is really hard to understand--this is to  preserve the fetal cells longer, a process known as maximizing warm  ischemia time.   When you say: Well, what is that? When you talk to the scientists,  well, the idea is the warm tissue is actually more valuable for our  studies. So a baby boy or girl that survives this abortion, that is the  tissue that is the most valuable to us.   Now, I think if any of us came upon some kind of accident or saw  somebody  [[Page H4391]]  who was in grave danger, we would want to save them. Somebody who has  endured an unbelievable process and survived it, we would save them; we  would not take advantage of that.   This program was supported by taxpayer funding through the NIH  program. So congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, for all the things  that you hate, you are helping to fund it.   This isn't the only abortion project that the National Institutes of  Health is funding, though. The NIH expects to spend $88 million on  human fetal tissue research in this year alone.   When these allegations began coming out--which I thought was a real  good move by the university--they hired a law firm to conduct an  independent review of Pitt's abortion process. Somebody is questioning  the process you do, so you say: Here is what I will do. I want to  participate with you, so I will provide the funding to an independent  research group. That law firm was a Washington, D.C.-based consulting  firm that employs Pitt grads. What a surprise.   The review determined that Pitt was totally in compliance with the  law. They didn't say what Pitt was doing was right; they said they were  in compliance with the law, even though that report completely failed  to look into Planned Parenthood or UPMC, who were partners with this  NIH program.    When all of this came out, we sent a letter, along with  Representative Morgan Griffith and over 50 of our colleagues, asking  the NIH for answers on how it funds and oversees these abortions  programs. It took them months to respond to me, which is not unusual  for any letter you send to any agency here in Washington, D.C.   When they finally did reply to us, they simply pointed out to me and  to the rest of us: Please, look at Pitt's independent review.   Now, this level of accountability to Congress is completely  unacceptable, and it shouldn't take months for a government agency to  respond to letters from any of us here in the House of Representatives.  We are here representing the people who voted us in office. And when  they do respond, they should respond with a substantive answer. I don't  need to be horsed around and told something and told: Well, you just  don't understand.   Which is absolutely correct. I don't understand. In the United States  of America, why are we doing things and then covering them up and  saying, we did an independent review. We paid for it, and these guys  actually came up with an answer that we were looking for. So they  followed the money.   A few weeks ago, Congress finally passed a budget, the first since  President Biden has been in office. It was far from perfect, but it  included strong protections for the unborn, protections which have been  in place since the 1970s.   Less than 2 weeks later, President Biden released his 2023 budget  proposal, which included a full wish list of Democrat anti-life  priorities.   Here are some examples from his recent budget: Number 1, it  eliminates the Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for  abortions. It became law in 1976. The Hyde amendment has saved over 2.4  million lives.                                time  2030    It also wants to eliminate the Dornan amendment. The Dornan amendment  prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortion in the  District of Columbia. Without this protection, D.C. taxpayer dollars  could pay for an estimated 1,400 to 1,500 abortions every year. Every  year.   It increased Title X family planning funding by $113 million. Title X  is a prime funding source for Planned Parenthood, providing it with $56  million taxpayer dollars annually. Now, on January 21, 2022, the Biden  administration awarded $6.6 million in Title X funds from the American  Rescue Plan to abortion providers. $6.6 million in American taxpayer  money to provide funds for abortion providers.   Now, I am Catholic, and oftentimes I have gone to my priest and I  have said, ``Father, is there some reason you cannot go into the pulpit  and talk about the horrendous things that are going on in our country  today?'' You know what the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  said? ``The USCCB remains gravely concerned about the continued efforts  to expand taxpayer funding of abortion, which would occur if the Hyde  amendment or any other lifesaving appropriations riders were to be  removed from the annual appropriations bill.''    ``We take this stand because abortion is  not healthcare. It is the antithesis of healthcare.''   Now, I know I am out of time, but me being out of time here on the  floor does not take this country from being out of time to address the  most egregious actions that are taking place.    Now, I just tell you, I am going to use up  some time, and you can keep hammering me, but you know what? In the  time we have been talking, so far, as of April 5----
