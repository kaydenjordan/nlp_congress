 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today to speak in favor of this emergency coronavirus  supplemental package.   I am glad that we are delivering for the people of Nevada, including  bringing home billions of dollars of additional funding for Nevada's  270,000 small businesses and nonprofits. We also are positioning our  country for recovery in voting for $25 billion for COVID-19 testing.   This bipartisan agreement is one of the many steps that we must take  to provide the American people with the relief they need. However, for  Senate majority Leader McConnell to suggest that our States and local  governments should be bankrupt in order to be made whole is outrageous.  These are our heroes. They are on the front lines.   I urge this body to pass this legislation and to work with us now to  pass the Heroes Act.
