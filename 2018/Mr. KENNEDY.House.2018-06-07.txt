 Mr. Speaker, a few years ago, Massachusetts was bracing  for a brutal blizzard bringing extreme life-threatening cold. Families  were bundling up; schools canceled class; first responders prepared for  a long, long night of calls. And one woman, Sue Smith, was opening the  doors to Faith Alliance Church in Attleboro to welcome the city's  homeless population into her warm embrace.   It was an extraordinary act of compassion and community service. But  for Sue, it wasn't. It was just one more day of fiercely protecting her  neighbors, one more night of caring for the most vulnerable among us,  one more family given a roof over their heads, one more life saved from  hypothermia.   A few months after that snowy, freezing night, I was humbled to  invite Sue to be my guest to the State of the Union Address.   Sue has never asked for recognition or praise, but few are more  deserving than she is. She has never asked for a helping hand when  facing her own personal battles.   But this week, I learned that Sue has been diagnosed with pancreatic  cancer. And although I know she would never ask her neighbors to return  her immense gratitude, we do have a message for her.   Sue, we are by your side in your fight. We know this cancer won't  stop you or even slow you, but we are here with you for whatever you  need.   Thank you for being our better angel.                            ____________________
