 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the career of an  exemplary public servant in my district.   San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon will retire this month  after 36 years of service to the people of San Bernardino.   His career started in 1985, when he was assigned to the Sheriff's  station in the town of Needles. And since then, he served in 15  different stations. He has served in every rank possible to hold in the  San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and he served as the  sheriff of my county since 2014.   In that time, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department has  become known as one of the premier law enforcement agencies in the  entire Nation under his exemplary leadership.   We thank him for his service to the people of our district, and we  wish him and his wife, Shelly, the best of luck in retirement.                            ____________________
