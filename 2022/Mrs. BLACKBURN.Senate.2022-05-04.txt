 Madam President, it has been over a year since Joe  Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democrats took control of all the  government here in DC. They like the fact that they have got their  hands on the drivers, and they are enacting their policies. But what is  so interesting, as my colleague from Iowa was pointing out, is they  continue to try to blame Donald Trump and Republicans for the issues  that are in front of us.   Just a few years ago, if you would have asked me how I would evaluate  a government that spent their way into inflation--recordbreaking  inflation--surrendered our border to the drug cartels, and abandoned  two Embassies, I would tell you that that sounds like an administration  that is in disarray. I think most people would believe that to be a  fact.   But here is the problem: We have moved beyond disarray. Tennesseans  feel like it is more like a catastrophe.   This is not mere incompetence at work. Joe Biden is earning his  disapproval rating that he was joking about at the Correspondents'  Dinner last week. He knows that it is, indeed, low--some of the lowest  ever.   The fact is that President Biden and Vice President Harris have had a  terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year, and they did this to  themselves. And now their allies in Congress are ready to make things  even worse. They are doubling down.   This is what happens when you try to force an agenda filled with pet  projects that the American people are telling you they do not want and,  as taxpayers are saying, ``You can't afford this.''  [[Page S2310]]  This is what happens when you really have no vision for the future of  the country. It is all about power, all about control.   Last month, the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics released  a poll showing that this distinction between agenda and vision actually  matters to people. They found that 56 percent of young Americans, ages  18 to 29, disapprove of Joe Biden's job performance. That is correct;  56 percent disapprove. And just last spring, 59--that is right, 59-- percent of young persons were still in his corner.   Look at what is happening. Look at that flip that is taking place.   The measure of success or failure for this administration shouldn't  come down to how many boxes they can check off their wish list but how  many young Americans look at what they are doing, and they say: I can't  support this. This does not give me hope. This does not look good for  my future.   Indeed, 56 percent of young Americans, ages 18 to 29, disapprove of  the Biden agenda.   Right now, this age group, they are losing hope. That same Harvard  poll shows that their top concern isn't the environment; it isn't  abortion or Roe v. Wade; it is the economy. And why wouldn't it be? The  current inflation rate is 8.5 percent. Last year, it was 2.6 percent.   How can anyone be expected to plan for their future if they are  struggling to plan for next week's grocery run? They are paying a  premium just to live.   Meanwhile, the President is asking them to sacrifice even more so he  can check some more boxes on his to-do list that is all about this  leftist agenda. It is not about the people; it is about power; it is  about control.   Young Americans--and I would say all Americans, Tennesseans--deserve  better than this. They deserve leaders who have a vision for the future  of this country, who have the God-given common sense to see it through.   Joe Biden and the Democrats have been in power for more than a year.  The window for blame-shifting and excuses is closed. It is shut. It is  time for the President to abandon this self-destructive agenda and give  the American people a fighting chance at reclaiming their own vision  for the future.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees which is at the desk.    Madam President, if we continue to ignore the threat  posed by the digital yuan, Beijing will use this technology to increase  its surveillance capacity, avoid U.S. sanctions, and threaten the  dominance of the U.S. dollar in the global trade.   This is the reason for this motion. This motion would require the  managers to include a simple provision that will require OMB to work  with our executive Agencies to put some much needed security measures  in place.   We cannot afford to look the other way while the CCP increases its  own global power at the expense of the free world and is looking for  opportunities to use the digital yuan to increase surveillance.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion.                                Vote on Motion     Madam President, it is my honor to officially  congratulate the Country Music Hall of Fame 2021 inductees. This past  weekend I was fortunate enough to attend their Medallion Ceremony and  help welcome The Judds, Ray Charles, Eddie Bayers, and Pete Drake into  country music's closest circle of friends.   Naomi and Wynonna Judd, 2021's Modern Era Artist inductees, were one  of country music's most cherished duos. The story of how they became  The Judds reads like something out of a movie script: a mama and her  daughter change their names, move to Nashville, and land a record deal  after a chance encounter with a hit producer. I, like thousands of  their fans, was absolutely heartbroken when Naomi's life came to an end  just 1 day before she was to receive her medallion, but her story lives  on in the generations of female artists she inspired and through  Wynonna's ongoing, stunning contributions to country music.   Few artists in living memory have taken more risks and earned more  respect than Ray Charles, 2021's Veterans Era Artist inductee. Ray's  timeless  [[Page S2328]]  contributions to the past, present, and future of country music have  inspired generations of rising stars to stake their own unique claims  in the rich and diverse traditions of the genre. Ray's career should  serve as a gentle reminder to us all that while conformity may make for  an easier journey, the creative heart rarely finds solace or joy in  following in another's footsteps.   This year, the Country Music Hall of Fame honored not one but two  musicians who fundamentally transformed the sound and feel of modern  music and set country musicmaking above the rest. Eddie Bayers, one of  2021's Recording and Touring Musician inductees, is an undisputed  master of his craft. He is a first call drummer, a revered instructor,  and one of the industry's most coveted human metronomes. For more than  50 years, he has laid the groove for the world's most beloved artists,  and I am so pleased to see him finally take his place in the spotlight.  Pete Drake, Bayers' fellow 2021 Recording and Touring Musician  inductee, used his unparalleled skill on the pedal steel guitar to turn  already great musicians into chart-topping legends. He forever changed  the way artists in all genres thought about pedal steel, and his  version of Alvino Rey's ``talking'' steel guitar, dubbed the ``talk  box,'' made its way into some of rock `n roll's most iconic and  instantly recognizable records.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee delegation, I would like to express  my gratitude to Naomi, Wynonna, Ray, Eddie, and Pete for their passion  and artistry. The world is a far more vibrant and beautiful place for  having experienced the gift of their music.                            ____________________
