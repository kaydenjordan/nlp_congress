 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  Frank and Cinda Edwards from Springfield, Illinois, who tragically died  in a plane crash last week.   Frank and Cinda were my good friends. I met Frank when he was the  fire chief in Springfield, Illinois. Frank was a proud Illinois  National Guardsman, a former alderman, and a former mayor. Everyone who  knew Frank knew that he was not afraid to speak his mind, and we will  miss that.   Cinda worked as a nurse for 27 years before becoming the Sangamon  County Coroner. She truly loved her job as coroner and took pride in  making the office the best it could be.   I was blessed to see Cinda days before the tragic crash. I can't  believe they are gone.   I still owe Frank a cheeseburger from Bill's Toasty for a wager he  won with me last year. It will be a reminder when I eat that  cheeseburger that life is too short.   My thoughts and prayers are truly with their son, Alex, during this  impossibly difficult time.   Springfield won't be the same without you, Frank and Cinda.   God bless.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking  member, who has fought hard on this legislation that I want to talk to  you about today.   It is very interesting to stand here and listen to my colleagues and  me talk about refereeing and talking about regulations. Sometimes,  refereeing doesn't get it right when it comes to sporting events, and  it is disappointing today because I stand here as somebody who has  worked with, supported, and been supported by many members of organized  labor, my friends in the building trades and my friends the airline  pilots and the air traffic controllers. I would use the rest of my time  if I talked about all the men and women in organized labor whom we have  worked with to try to come up with bipartisan solutions.   Despite my strong record of supporting Davis-Bacon, PLAs, and  ensuring workers have the means to unionize, I have to oppose this  bill.   The Democrat majority has brought to the floor another bill that has  no chance of becoming law. It is a messaging bill, and it has a couple  of provisions that I really have to highlight.   Last year, the Democrat majority proposed in H.R. 1 that every single  member of the Democratic majority who voted for that had public  financing of their own congressional campaigns with corporate fines.  The corporate fine provision in this bill could create a circumstance  where a business commits an unfair labor practice and the civil  penalties get directed to Members of Congress' campaigns, not to  victims. This is irresponsible.   The joint employer standard that is codified in this law is wrong.   Mr. Chairman, reconsider this legislation. Let's work together to  actually come up with solutions.
