 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to H.R. 1862, and I  regret this opposition because it would add a new offense--well, new  offenses--to the current provision in the criminal code providing for  mandatory life imprisonment for certain repeat sex offenders.   Now, under section 3559(e) of title 18 of the U.S. Code, a defendant  who has been previously convicted of a Federal felony or State sex  offense committed against a child, and who is guilty of a predicate  Federal sex offense against a child, must be sentenced to life in  prison. H.R. 1862 amends section 3559 to add more Federal predicate  offenses on which to base imposition of a life sentence; namely, sexual  contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual contact  with minors between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual conduct  with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen. The bill would also provide the  requirement that a Federal predicate offense relating to coercion or  enticement of a minor be related to prostitution.   Instead, H.R. 1862 would allow coercion or enticement of a minor into  any criminal sexual activity to serve as a basis for imposition of a  mandatory life sentence. Repeat offenders should, of course, be subject  to increased penalties, and, for some offenses, life imprisonment is  appropriate. Yet Congress should not mandate that life imprisonment be  the only sentencing option.   For far too long, the Federal criminal justice system has relied on  an unsustainable system of mass incarceration that is largely driven by  inflexible mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimums are not  necessary to impose appropriate sentences. The judge at sentencing has  all the information he or she needs to impose a sentence commensurate  with the crime committed and the culpability of the offender. Arrived  at this way, sentences may still be quite lengthy--perhaps, in some  cases, life in prison--but these penalties must be determined on a  case-by-case basis. Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join with  me and others in opposing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), a  [[Page H4401]]  distinguished former member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would like everyone to think about this in a very general way, that  expanding the scope of offenses subject to mandatory minimums is just  as harmful as enacting new ones. It is the same thing. And so,  accordingly, I oppose this legislation.   Those who commit crimes against children deserve to be punished, and  repeat offenders most certainly deserve to face increased penalties.  There is no one that, I don't think, in this House, disagrees with  that.   But nevertheless, I oppose mandatory minimum sentencing and,  therefore, I must oppose this legislation. I believe that judges are  the best suited to determine the just and appropriate punishment in  each case.   So for the foregoing reasons, I urge each and every one of my  colleagues here to oppose H.R. 1862.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1842, a bill that is  intended to address gaps in our child protection laws.   Now, this bill makes a number of changes to the Federal criminal code  that, unfortunately, makes the same error that was previously made. It  results in the expanded imposition of mandatory minimum sentences. I  don't know where we get this notion that mandatory minimum sentences  are a solution.   H.R. 1842 amends section 2250(d) of the criminal code, which provides  for an enhanced penalty for sex offenders who commit a crime of  violence while in noncompliance of sex offender registration and  reporting requirements.   In addition to the Federal crimes of violence already included in  that statute, this bill would add State crimes of violence as predicate  offenses that, in turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory 5- year prison sentence to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed  for failing to register or comply with sex offender registration and  reporting requirements.   H.R. 1842 would also add prior military child sex offenses to several  recidivist sentencing provisions, most of which carry mandatory minimum  penalties of at least 15 years or life, itself.   Perhaps we should expand coverage of enhanced sentences for the  offenses added by this bill, but we should do so without expanding the  number of mandatory minimums. The judges, not the Congress--not us--are  in the best position to impose sentences for even the most offensive  criminal violations because they know the facts and circumstances of  each case.                                time  1700    There is an increasing bipartisan, national recognition that  mandatory minimum sentences are not only unfair, but they are also  counterproductive. Instead of expanding the coverage of mandatory  minimums, we should be eliminating them. Individuals convicted of  serious offenses will still receive appropriately lengthy sentences,  but they will not be set on a one-size-fits-all basis.   We want to examine the facts, the circumstances in each case, and the  judge is in the best position to do that. We should not be assuming  that we can sit here and pass these national laws that will not help  and will make it difficult for judges to do their work.   Unfortunately, this bill takes the opposite course, and that is why I  must oppose it. I encourage my colleagues to think about what we are  doing here and oppose H.R. 1842. I urge your support against this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, we are indebted to the gentleman  from Virginia, who, for years, was the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations in the  Judiciary Committee and still carries with him the understanding and  the experience that leads him to be on the floor with us today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) in support of his position.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations in the House Judiciary Committee.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    I commend the gentlewoman for her consistent  understanding and explaining why mass incarceration is at the base of  all of the debate that is going on.   I am hoping that more and more people who listen to these discussions  that we have here in the House of Representatives will begin to  understand that mass incarceration is not the answer to our problems.  As a matter of fact, they compound the problems.   I salute the gentlewoman for her tenacity and understanding and  explaining this situation to everyone who can listen to our discussions  here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1842 is a well-intentioned bill meant to ensure  that repeat sex offenders are punished for their crimes, whether their  prior offenses are State, Federal, or military.   While I believe that repeat sex offenders of any kind should receive  appropriately lengthy sentences, I disagree with the imposition of  mandatory minimums. We are not the court. We are not the judge. We do  not hear the facts and circumstances in each case.   I appeal to good common sense and good legal analysis that we oppose  this legislation that would amplify the difficulties that we already  know exist. I hope that we will oppose this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to H.R. 883, the  Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017.   You see, child sexual exploitation and abuse are reprehensible crimes  committed against the most vulnerable members of our society.  Unfortunately, these offenses have been increasingly facilitated by the  use of the internet in recent years. H.R. 883 would change the  administrative subpoena statute to facilitate the prosecution of  criminals who commit these terrible crimes against children.   Without question, I support the goal of pursuing these criminals,  but, nevertheless, I am concerned that this bill would eliminate  judicial oversight of nondisclosure orders currently required prior to  the issuance of the administrative subpoenas.   Section 3486 of title 18 of the United States Code authorizes  investigators to request a 90-day order of nondisclosure from a  district court judge. The order of nondisclosure forbids the recipient,  such as an internet service provider, from alerting the target of the  investigation of the law enforcement's inquiry. H.R. 883 would extend  the nondisclosure period from 90 days to 180 days to allow  investigators more time to complete their investigations before the  target is informed of the inquiry.   Although I would like to have more information about why it is  necessary to extend this time period, it is particularly problematic  combined with the other significant change to the law made by this very  legislation. H.R. 883 would allow investigators to require  nondisclosure of internet service providers without the approval of a  judge, thereby eliminating any judicial oversight prior to issuance of  the subpoena.   The administrative subpoena authority is an extraordinary power given  to certain agencies by Congress under its limited circumstances. While  the legislation would allow a recipient to challenge a nondisclosure  order in court, I am concerned about the bill's elimination of judicial  approval on the front end.   I understand the desire to do more to facilitate the investigation of  these crimes and that the online context for them has raised issues  that we should continue to examine, but I do not believe we have been  given enough information justifying this bill, at least in its current  form.   Elimination of prior judicial approval of nondisclosure orders is a  step we should undertake only based on evidence and careful  deliberation. A bill such as the one before us warrants at least a  legislative hearing to consider its potential ramifications. I don't  think that is asking too much that we have a hearing on this matter  before we decide what to do with the proposal rather than not have one  at all. Our committee has not had the benefit of any such hearing on  this legislation, and I think this is not the proper way the members of  the House Judiciary Committee, who are mostly lawyers, should proceed.   Mr. Speaker, accordingly, I oppose H.R. 883, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is one of the consistent  leaders for a good criminal justice system.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the most problematic aspect of H.R. 883 is that it would  eliminate prior judicial approval of nondisclosure orders. I am firmly  opposed to that. And while I fully support efforts to investigate  crime, particularly those perpetrated against children, I cannot  support this bill without knowing more about how it will affect an  already extraordinary investigative power.   Let's have a hearing. That is what our committee is for. The  Judiciary Committee should inquire into this very carefully, and, in  the absence of such evidence, I must urge, at this time, our colleagues  join me in opposing H.R. 883.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 695, the Child  Protection Improvements Act, and tip my hat to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), the author of the bill, who we  will hear from shortly.   We have a special responsibility to protect our young people and  vulnerable adults. For that reason, I am pleased that we are  considering this measure which would provide a robust, easily  accessible, cost-effective background check system for organizations  that work with youth and vulnerable adults. I support it for a number  of reasons.   To begin with, it will facilitate more comprehensive criminal  background checks which provide a critical layer of protection. These  checks help identify individuals who could potentially harm  participants in programs for children, young people, and vulnerable  adults as well.   Background checks also serve to ensure the integrity and  accountability of the organizations that sponsor these programs by  reducing potential threats. Results from background checks that search  criminal histories nationwide are more reliable than background checks  that only search criminal histories in a few States. I think that is  obvious.   Secondly, the State background checks are no substitute whatsoever  for the FBI's fingerprint-based system, which is the only nationwide  database that allows a search of criminal histories in every single  State.   Currently, this database can only be accessed through the State law  enforcement agencies, and many States limit the ability of  organizations to access the system, with some States completely even  forbidding access--no access whatsoever. As a result, organizations  must navigate a labyrinth of State laws or rely on private companies to  perform background checks of employees and volunteers.   H.R. 695, on the other hand, would provide organizations with the  ability to access the FBI's superior system without impacting the  autonomy of States or the organizations. States would be able to  continue or establish their own background check systems, and  organizations would not be required to perform FBI background checks of  potential applicants or volunteers.   Finally, the need for this legislation is clearly justified by the  Child Safety Pilot Program, which we implemented over a decade ago.  This program documented the effectiveness of nationwide background  checks for youth-serving organizations. Based on a comprehensive review  of thousands of criminal history records spanning an 8-year period, the  program demonstrated that people who might pose a risk to the safety of  children, nevertheless, attempted to work with children.    For example, the program identified applicants who, to avoid  detection, used aliases, incorrect dates of birth, or wrong Social  Security numbers. Some of these applicants had serious criminal  histories, including even homicides, sexual assaults, child  endangerment, and even rape.   More than a third of criminal history hits were from out-of-state,  and more than half of the people with criminal history hits failed to  disclose them on their application.   H.R. 695 would give organizations access to the FBI's comprehensive  background check system and thereby help ensure the safety of our youth  and others.   Accordingly, I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in  supporting this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Michigan  (Mr. Bishop) for his contribution.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member of the Intelligence  Committee and the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  am pleased to make my closing remarks.   Mr. Speaker, the Child Protection Improvements Act is a reasonable,  bipartisan piece of legislation intended to protect our children and  vulnerable adults from harm and give those who love them peace of mind.   Although we still have work to do to address the accuracy and  reliability of some criminal history records and give individuals an  opportunity to challenge incomplete or inaccurate records, this is a  good bill. For those reasons, I urge everyone in this Chamber to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
