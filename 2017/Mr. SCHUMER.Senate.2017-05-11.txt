 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the dismissal of Director Comey has  raised a bevy of troubling questions over the  [[Page S2893]]  last few days. The President of the United States fired the man in  charge of an active investigation about the President and his campaign  ties to Russia. The truth is, the dismissal of Director Comey is part  of a much longer pattern of this administration's interfering with or  removing the people who are in a position to conduct an independent  investigation of the President and his administration.   The administration requested that the chairmen of the House and  Senate Intelligence Committees help them beat back reports in the press  about the Russia probe. The administration picked this Attorney  General--a very close political ally, then-Senator Jeff Sessions--to  lead a Justice Department that was supposed to independently conduct  this investigation.   Attorney General Sessions, of course, has since had to recuse himself  from the Russia investigation after he misled Congress about his  meetings with the Russian Ambassador.   The administration is not shy about removing independent prosecutors  and law enforcement officers from their posts if they are simply doing  something the President doesn't like, even if it is required by law.  They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. They fired more than  40 U.S. attorneys across the country. Now they have fired Director  Comey.   This is about more than just Mr. Comey. This is about a pattern of  events that casts tremendous doubt on whether this administration has  any interest in allowing the Russia investigation or any other  investigation that could be politically damaging to them to proceed  unimpeded. This is about one of the most sacred things we believe in as  Americans, the rule of law--the rule of law being threatened here.   We in Congress, in both parties, should have one overarching goal: to  get the full unvarnished truth. That means getting to the bottom of the  events that led to Mr. Comey's dismissal and making sure the Russia  investigation is conducted impartially. Here in Congress, the Senate  Intelligence Committee is doing its investigation in a bipartisan way,  but the executive branch investigation has been compromised.   Attorney General Sessions, who had to recuse himself from the Russia  investigation, played a significant role in firing the man who was  leading it. Not only that, but the Attorney General is now reportedly  leading a search to replace Mr. Comey. He is helping select the next  FBI Director, who will be in charge of an investigation he cannot  oversee--what an irony.   This Attorney General shouldn't be anywhere near the hiring process  of the next FBI Director. His role will jaundice the entire process, if  it hasn't already.   In order to ensure the American people can have faith in the  impartiality of the investigation, it must be conducted far from the  reach of the White House. It is the overwhelming view of my caucus that  a special prosecutor should now be appointed to conduct the  investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.   This special prosecutor should be appointed by the highest ranking  civil servant at the Justice Department. Mr. Rosenstein and other  political appointees should not be the ones who decide on a special  prosecutor, lest that decision be seen as influenced, or worse, made at  the direction of the administration. I thank my colleague from  California, Senator Feinstein, for speaking so eloquently on this  proposal.   In addition, there are several things that should happen here on  Capitol Hill that will help get us to the bottom of the events this  week.   First, Mr. Comey should testify before Congress. There are so many  questions that only Mr. Comey can answer. So I applaud Senators Burr  and Warner for inviting him to appear before the Intelligence Committee  next week. It was the right thing to do. We ought to hear from Mr.  Comey, and I urge Mr. Comey to come and tell the whole story.   Second, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein should make themselves available to Congress. I am renewing  my request of the majority leader to call an all-Senators briefing  where they can answer the questions swirling about from Tuesday night's  firing. Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein should appear separately and partially in a classified  setting if necessary, but they must come.   Mr. Rosenstein has played a central role in all of these events. He  could help clear up questions about where the decision to fire Mr.  Comey originated. So later today, separate and apart from my request  that he come before the Senate, I will be sending Mr. Rosenstein a  letter with a list of questions for him to answer publicly. America  needs to hear them. Many Democrats voted for Mr. Rosenstein a few weeks  ago because he had a reputation for integrity. He assured us he would  be an independent force inside the Department of Justice, and 94  Senators voted for him, but the events of last week have made many of  us question that belief. He owes it to the Senate. He owes it to the  people he supervises in the Justice Department and in the FBI, and he  owes it to the American people to provide some answers.   In sum, we demand the appointment of a special prosecutor by a  nonpolitical appointee at the Department of Justice. We want to hear  from Mr. Comey. We are asking the majority leader to hold separate all- Senators briefings with the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney  General. This would help us get a hold on what happened, would explain  why, and would help guide us in what to do next because this  investigation will not die no matter who wants it to. I sincerely hope  we will get an answer from the majority leader by the end of the day.  This is a very serious matter.   Right now, there are two different stories coming out of the White  House. Some are saying the decision to fire Mr. Comey came directly  from the White House; others, including the Vice President, have said  it came from the Department of Justice--specifically, Mr. Rosenstein  and Mr. Sessions. We need to resolve these two story lines on something  as important as this. We need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing  but the truth. So I hope my Republican colleagues see the wisdom and  value in our request and respond appropriately by the end of the day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, just a word on the majority's use of the  Congressional Review Act. The window for using the CRA is closing this  week. I heard the majority leader touting the 13 CRAs the majority  passed this year. I want to make two points.   First, despite what the majority leader and the President claim,  these CRAs are not a huge accomplishment. They simply overturned rules  passed at the very end of the Obama administration. They hardly  constitute a legislative agenda. In fact, the use of the CRA shows just  how little this majority and this President have been able to  accomplish in the first 100-plus days. The fact that they are bragging  about these highlights how little else they have accomplished  legislatively.   Second, the CRAs are designed to help special interests against the  interests of working Americans, belying all the promises President  Trump made when he campaigned. Let me give some examples. One of them  is on foreign oil bribery. One of them is on a retirement rule. One of  them is on stream protections. One is on mentally-ill access to guns.  In each of these, it is a narrow special interest who pushed it, not a  demand from the American people. Which Americans say ``Make it OK for  our companies to bribe foreign oil companies or pollute our streams''  or ``Give the mentally ill access to guns''? These are narrow interests  in each case.   Let's be very clear about this. The CRAs Republicans passed are not  rolling back burdensome regulations. Oh, no. They are giveaways to Big  Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal, Big Mining, and wealthy special interests.   The most indefensible one of many is the one on a retirement rule. If  localities or States want to set up systems whereby working people want  to put money away for their retirement, why not? It doesn't hurt  anybody. It doesn't require anybody to do anything. And these days  where fewer and fewer Americans have pensions from their companies, it  is what is needed. But  [[Page S2894]]  some banks didn't want competition. They didn't want it shown that  maybe the cities or the States could run these retirement systems more  cheaply and take less money out of the average American's pocket. So we  undid this rule. I don't think a single average constituent in any part  of America wanted this rule undone, just the big banks--some of them,  not all of them. That is the kind of thing my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle and President Trump are bragging about. It is nothing  to brag about.   Let's be very clear about this. These are not the priorities the  American people voted for in November, where a substantial majority of  Americans said in exit polls that the economy was rigged against them.  These CRAs rig the game even further for the wealthy special interests  and are nothing to brag about or write home about.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            All-Senators Briefings     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            All-Senators Briefings     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            All-Senators Briefings     Mr. President, before the Senate adjourns for the  weekend, I wish to address a few things related to the dismissal of FBI  Director James Comey.   The story coming out of the White House about why Mr. Comey was fired  continues to change and there are no good explanations for the change.   For 2 days, the White House implied that the decision to fire Mr.  Comey either originated or was largely influenced by the  recommendations from the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney  General. The Vice President of the United States spoke to reporters  here on Capitol Hill and said that it was the President's ``decision to  accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the  Attorney General to remove Director Comey.''   Those accounts, by the spokespeople of the President and the Vice  President himself, were just blatantly and completely contradicted by  the President himself on national television.   President Trump told NBC News that it was his decision to fire Mr.  Comey, and he had made up his mind to do so before hearing from either  the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, in direct  contradiction to what his own Vice President and his own press people  were saying.   Well, which one was it? Did the Vice President mislead the public or  did the President? When was the decision made to fire Mr. Comey, and  what was the reason? And why did it take so long for the White House to  get its story straight?   These are all critical questions, and the American people deserve  answers. We need to understand the true nature of the events that led  to Director Comey's dismissal, why it happened, and what it means for  the investigation into the potential collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia as we move forward.   This morning, I made a request of the majority leader to call an all- Senators briefing with Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein. Given the events of this week, and particularly  after what the President said this afternoon, a briefing from these two  officials before the whole Senate, where Senators from both parties can  ask and get answers to the serious questions hanging over us, is  imperative for this body and for the American people. The all-Senators  briefing with the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General  should be separate and partially classified, if necessary.   The need for these briefings is even greater now than it was this  morning, given what the President said this afternoon. The rule of law,  the separation of powers, and their strength--hallmarks of American  democracy--are at stake.   Now, I have just heard from the majority leader that he will invite  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to an all-Senators briefing next  week. I asked the majority leader to do the briefing early in the week.  It is a good first step, and I thank the majority leader for consenting  to this request.   Mr. Rosenstein was here on the Hill today meeting with Members. He  requested to meet with me, and I said I wanted to meet with him along  with my 99 colleagues so Members of both parties were given the  opportunity to question him. I am glad he has a willingness to come  talk to Congress, and I hope he will accept our bipartisan invitation  from Leader McConnell and from me to brief the entire Senate next week.   My caucus still believes that Attorney General Sessions must be made  available to the Senate in a similar capacity, given his reported role  in firing Director Comey and helping select his replacement.  Considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close  involvement in these events warrants the Senate's questioning as well,  but I thank the majority leader for trying to set up the briefing with  Mr. Rosenstein. It is very likely, I believe, that it will happen, just  pending Mr. Rosenstein's consent, and I hope the majority leader soon  comes to the right decision and grants our request to question Mr.  Sessions as well.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
