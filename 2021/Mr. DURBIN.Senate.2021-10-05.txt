Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for  his encouraging and kind words and especially thank my friend and  former chair of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont,  for inviting other colleagues to come to the floor to speak in support  of the right to vote.   Time and again in history, we have asked men and women to stand and  risk their lives and, in fact, give their lives for the most  fundamental premise of our democracy: the right to vote. They have  fought. They have bled. They have died for that right.   Now it is under attack again--not from any foreign source. Over the  past few years, our Nation has witnessed the most heavily coordinated  assault on the right to vote in modern memory. Since the start of 2021,  Republican legislators throughout the country have introduced over 425  pieces of legislation with provisions to make it more difficult for  Americans to vote. Thirty-three of these laws were actually enacted in  19 States. Some of these laws have set new limits on voting by mail;  others cut hours for polling locations. Each of these proposals is  designed to achieve the same outcome: create barriers for Americans  when it comes to the ballot box.   One of the strongest champions of democracy in American history was  my old friend and colleague John Lewis of Georgia. Days before his  passing, John wrote: ``Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each  generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved  Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.''   It is now this generation's turn to act, John, because nothing less  than the survival of America's democracy is at stake.   At a moment when lawmakers across the country are railing around the  Big Lie to strip away our constitutional rights, we in this Senate must  have the courage to step up and protect those rights. If the supporters  of the former President of the United States are going to defame our  democracy, we have to fight to defend it. We can begin by  reinvigorating one of the most important pieces of legislation in  modern American history: the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   I am sure there are folks who are watching this at home, saying: Wait  a minute. How can a piece of legislation signed into law more than 50  years ago be the solution to today's challenge to democracy?   That is because over the past several years, there has been a  sustained effort to chip away at the protections guaranteed to every  American under that Voting Rights Act.   For instance, in 2013, the Supreme Court issued the decision in  Shelby County v. Holder, essentially nullifying a key provision in the  Voting Rights Act, section 5. Prior to the Court's ruling in Shelby,  section 5 required that localities with a track record of  disenfranchising voters of color through tactics as brutal as poll  taxes and literacy tests would have to seek Federal approval for  changes they make in their voting rules. This requirement is known as  preclearance, and it could have prevented many of the restrictive  voting provisions being enacted in States like Georgia and Texas today.   Just this past summer, the Supreme Court weakened another section of  the Voting Rights Act with its decision in Brnovich v. Democratic  National Committee.   With these wrongful rulings, the Supreme Court has fueled State-led  efforts to suppress voters, particularly voters of color. In fact,  Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent to Brnovich that ``in the last  decade, this Court has treated no statute worse'' than the Voting  Rights Act of 1965.   It is time for Congress to uphold our constitutional obligation and  restore the Voting Rights Act to its full potential. That is why we  join together today to introduce a bill that would not only restore the  protections of the Voting Rights Act but strengthen them.   Tomorrow, we will hold a hearing on this critical legislation in the  Senate Judiciary Committee. It is called the John R. Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act. By all means, passing this law should be a  bipartisan endeavor. Historically, it always was. It wasn't until very  recently that the Republicans--the party of Abraham Lincoln--decided  that they would no longer join in our effort to reauthorize the Voting  Rights Act. It wasn't that long ago that it was bipartisan and passed  easily. The last time Congress voted to do so, in fact, the Republican  minority leader, Senator McConnell, came to the floor and said: ``This  is a piece of legislation which has worked.''  [[Page S6918]]    Well, let's make sure we keep it working for America. In our Nation,  there is no freedom more fundamental than the right to vote, and the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will help ensure that every  American can exercise that right that he famously called the  ``precious, almost sacred'' right.   I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Blumenthal, and my colleague  Senator Warnock for joining us on the floor and a number of our  colleagues for the collaboration and hard work on preparing this  legislation for introduction and our House colleagues who passed their  version of the bill earlier this summer.   I particularly want to thank the man for whom this bill is named. I  was honored to count him as a friend--even more when he came in on more  than one occasion at my invitation to campaign in the State of  Illinois. I was honored to join him on a Sunday morning walk, which I  will never forget, over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John and I talking  about that moment in history. It is something I will treasure for a  lifetime.   We, in his name, need to honor him and to honor the principles that  he gave his life for, making certain that everyone has an opportunity  to help us build a beloved community.
