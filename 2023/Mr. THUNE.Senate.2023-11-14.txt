 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, recent events--notably, Putin's war of  aggression in Ukraine and Hamas's deadly October 7 attack on Israel-- have thrown the importance of national security into sharp relief. At  its most basic level, of course, national security means having a  strong military, a fighting force that can meet and defeat any threat  it is called upon to face. But there are other key components of  national security as well. There is border security, there is economic  security, and there is energy security.   Now, what do I mean by energy security? I mean a strong and stable  energy supply that does not depend upon imports from hostile countries  or unstable regions of the world. You only have to look at the soaring  costs and supply challenges countries like Germany have faced in the  wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine to realize that relying on energy  from other countries, particularly hostile countries, can leave a  country in a deeply vulnerable position.  [[Page S5484]]    The United States has been doing a good job of maintaining our energy  security. We developed domestic resources, both renewable and  conventional, which meant that we were able to minimize our reliance on  other countries. But President Biden upended that trajectory with his  singular focus on Green New Deal policies, and now we are at an  inflexion point, honestly.   President Biden's energy policies have put us on a dangerous  trajectory, one that could easily result in significant disruptions to  our domestic supply. For starters, there is the President's notable  hostility to conventional energy production. Since the day he took  office, President Biden has pursued an agenda that is hostile to  conventional sources of energy--namely, oil and natural gas.   He set the tone on his first day in office when he canceled the  Keystone XL Pipeline--a pipeline project, by the way, that was already  underway and was to be paired with $1.7 billion in private investment  in renewable energy to fully offset its operating emissions. He also  almost immediately froze new oil and gas leases on Federal lands,  sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that his administration  would be reluctant to work with them to increase American energy  production. And he has continued along the same lines ever since, with  a recent notable example being his cancelation of seven oil and gas  leases in the small portion of the ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge, that is available for energy exploration and development.   The problem with the President's actions, of course, is that our  Nation is nowhere near being able to end our reliance on conventional  energy. And let me just say, I am a big and longtime supporter of  renewable energy, but we are simply not in a position yet where we can  rely predominantly on alternative energy technologies. The President  himself admitted as much in his most recent State of the Union Address,  but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing policies that seem designed  to eventually force our Nation to rely on other countries for oil and  gas, with all the attendant security and economic risk that brings.   And the President's energy agenda isn't limited to canceling oil and  gas leases or discouraging investment in conventional energy  production. Also of deep concern is the President's apparent  determination to force Americans to adopt electric vehicles on a broad  scale within the next decade. And why is this so concerning? Because  our electric grid is nowhere near capable of supporting that kind of a  widespread transition to electric vehicles. Rising electricity demand  is already stretching our grid, which has been weakened by the move  away from conventional energy sources.   In February, the PJM Interconnection, which manages a substantial  part of eastern America's electric grid, warned that fossil fuel plants  are being forced to retire at a faster rate than new renewables can be  brought online--at a rate of roughly 2 to 1. In other words, we are  rapidly approaching a situation in which we simply don't have the  ability to keep up with our current electricity demand. Add charging  for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles on  top of that, and we would be looking at a future of widespread  blackouts and brownouts, to say nothing of soaring electricity prices.   So it goes without saying that a nation that can't reliably keep its  lights on or its homes heated is a nation that is less than secure. To  make matters worse, the Biden administration has proposed a rule that  would severely constrain supply chain for distribution transformers,  which is a critical component of America's electric grid.   Stakeholders are already facing significant backlogs for these  critical components, whether they are trying to recover from a storm,  improve the grid, or tie in new development. The Biden administration's  proposed rule would guarantee that these problems would get worse.   Recent events remind us that we can't take our Nation's security for  granted. We have to work constantly to maintain our Nation's strength,  both to ensure that we are always prepared to meet any threat and  because being strong is the best way to discourage any threat; and  energy security is an essential part of maintaining that strength. If  we want to maintain our energy security and if we want to maintain the  kind of energy supply that can not only deal with all domestic energy  demands but will leave us free from overreliance on other countries, we  can't keep heading down the path the Biden administration has set us  on.   I hope the President and his allies will realize this important point  before it is too late.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).   The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 309 Leg.]                                  YEAS--51       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Butler      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--48       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Scott (SC)           The motion was agreed to.
