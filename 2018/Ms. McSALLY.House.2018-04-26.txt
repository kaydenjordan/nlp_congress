 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tammie Jo Shults, the  Southwest Airlines captain who heroically and expertly landed the  damaged Boeing 737 last week. She saved 148 lives through her courage,  skill, professionalism, and nerves of steel.   We also mourn the death of Jennifer Riordan, who was killed by the  immediate effects of this mishap.   Tammie Jo Shults was a hero long before this successful emergency  landing. Captain Shults was one of the first female fighter pilots for  the U.S. Navy and one of the first to fly the F/A-18. Although she was  never allowed to fly in combat, she became an aggressive pilot and an  instructor. Tammie Jo reminds us that the airplane doesn't care whether  you have ovaries or not, as long as you have the qualifications and  training to complete the mission.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I introduced a resolution on Monday to  commend Captain Tammie Jo Shults for her unflappable courage that saved  so many lives and for paving the way for women in the military and  commercial aviation to finally fly in combat and lead as equals.  Generations of women can fight for freedom and save lives, like she  did, because of her.   Thanks for leading the way, Tammie Jo, for all of us.                            ____________________
