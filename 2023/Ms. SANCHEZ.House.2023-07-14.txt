 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to point out just one of the  very troubling and extreme amendments in the NDAA, specifically Mr.  Green's amendment which would effectively cut all Federal Government  support to filmmakers who distribute films in China.   This amendment takes a page right out of 1950s McCarthyism, and it  will devastate the film industry. It requires the DOD to create a  blacklist of studios that often, by necessity, have made changes to  films in anticipation of distribution in China.   It would decide, without any evidence necessary, to withhold  assistance for filmmakers who edit sexual or violent scenes to make  films more appropriate for children. Further, it would ensure that  these American filmmakers can no longer film on U.S. public lands or  access resources paid for by American taxpayers.   Filmmaking is a First Amendment right, and this amendment attacks  that right by allowing the DOD to censor content and editorial  viewpoints of American films. The Green amendment could also push film  production overseas.   In my home State of California, this amendment would devastate an  industry that brings in $226 billion alone in jobs and economic  activities.   Sadly, this amendment is just one of many dangerous and extreme MAGA  [[Page H3603]]  amendments attached to what has been a historically bipartisan bill.  This amendment would hurt American industries and workers, and it does  not belong in the NDAA.                            ____________________
