 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Captain Janet  Days during Women's History Month.   Captain Days is the first African-American female to be the  commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Station Norfolk. This naval  station is the largest naval base in the world. It is the hub of U.S.  Naval operations in the Atlantic, Europe, and the Caribbean, and  Captain Days is an exceptional choice to lead the station.   In her distinguished military career, she has earned seven Navy and  Marine Corps Commendation Medals, two Army Commendation Medals, and a  Defense Meritorious Service Medal.   She has served on several ships, including the aircraft carrier USS  David D. Eisenhower during Operation Enduring Freedom.   She is an American hero, and I am proud to honor her accomplishments  on the floor today.                            ____________________
