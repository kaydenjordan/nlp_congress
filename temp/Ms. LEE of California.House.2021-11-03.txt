 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res.  760, but let  [[Page H6155]]  me just say I, too, support the basic rights of the Cuban people, the  basic human rights of the Cuban people. As an African American who has  engaged in many protests for justice, I know the impact of keeping  government and police forces from interfering in our actions for our  basic rights.   We should not excuse the Cuban Government for limiting their own  people's freedom and opportunity. But let me just say: Here in  Congress, we need to also take a hard look at the failed U.S. policy  that has not helped the Cuban people and too often inflicted harm on  them. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again  expecting a different result. Well, for 60 years we have been squeezing  the Cuban people thinking that if we starve them just enough it will  somehow lead to democracy.   So it is long overdue to support policies that truly help the Cuban  people. The Obama administration showed us that we can take a new  approach. That is through engagement, diplomacy, trade, travel, and,  yes, support for human rights for the Cuban people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution on the  suspension calendar today and we should have an honest debate about a  new Cuban policy that talks about and supports what real human rights  for the Cuban people mean.
