 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from California for  her brilliant leadership on this very important matter.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, the George Floyd Justice  in Policing Act of 2020. I am proud to cosponsor this long-overdue  proposal to end brutality in law enforcement and to address the  systemic racism that has marred American law enforcement for too long.   With this legislation, we finally say enough is enough. We have had  enough of racial and religious profiling. We have had enough of no- knock warrants and chokeholds. We have had enough of qualified immunity  and enough of police using military-grade equipment on our streets.   This bill will help us move from, frankly, a culture of impunity all  too often in our law enforcement entities to a culture of  accountability.   We serve the public, whether we are in law enforcement or whether in  the Halls of Congress. This bill reaffirms that principle in a  democracy. I am proud to support it in the memory of the murdered  George Floyd.
