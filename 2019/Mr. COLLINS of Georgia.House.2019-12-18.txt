 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to enter into a debate that should  surprise no one. This has not been a surprise, and it is not even  something that we would not have thought about.  [[Page H12134]]  From the very moment that the majority party in this House won, the  inevitability that we would be here today was only a matter of what  date they would schedule it, nothing else.   In fact, how it even began to look even further was, on September 24,  the Speaker announced an impeachment inquiry even before seeing the  call transcript that we are going to hear so much about today.   You know, it is not about what this body can do and its  constitutional oath, and there has been a lot of ``constitutional'' and  ``Founders'' thrown around and will be all day today. But there is one  thing that I will mention all along, and that is, also, the Founders  were very concerned about a partisan impeachment in which politics or  the majority, who have their strength, can do what they want to do,  regardless of any facts.   In fact, I have said it before, and I will say it again, I do not  believe, no matter what was said today and even what has been said-- this is not a solemn occasion. When you go looking for something for 3  years, and especially this year since January, you ought to be excited  when you find it, but they can't because I know what has now happened.  It took me till last night, but I was thinking about it. Why do we keep  calling this a solemn occasion when you have been wanting to do this  ever since the gentleman was elected? The President came forward and  did what he saw fit for the American people, but yet they wanted to  impeach him. And it hit me. Now I know.   The reason they wanted to is now they are realizing what I told them  and have been telling them for the last few weeks, that the clock and  the calendar are terrible masters. The clock and the calendar are  terrible masters. They do not care about anything except getting the  time done and the calendar fixed. They do not care about facts. They do  not care about time. And one day, the clock and the calendar will hang  along this body in a very detrimental way.   How do I know this? Because one of our Members, Ms. Tlaib, said on  the night she was sworn in: We are going to impeach.   Well, you know the rest. In May 2019, Al Green said: I am concerned  if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected.   That is probably the most prescient thing said by the majority in the  last year is that they said: We can't beat him if we don't impeach him.   There is a reason behind the impeachment. Even Speaker Pelosi said it  would be dangerous to leave it to voters to determine whether President  Trump stays in office. Really? After we just said the Pledge of  Allegiance, we go back to the Speaker's own words and she said it would  be dangerous to leave it to the voters.   I will tell you right now, Madam Speaker, we on the Republican side  have no problem taking our case to the majority and to the people of  this country because they elected Donald Trump, and it is a matter for  the voters, not this House, not in this way, not in the way this is  being done. It has trampled everything this House believes in.   I said it yesterday, and I believe this to be true today, I will  fight this on process, which has been deplorable, to use a word of the  majority. It has been awful.   The calendar and the clock make it impressive that we actually do it  quickly. We don't care about rules. We don't care about minority  hearing days. We don't care about giving the opportunity for witnesses  to be called because the chairman gets to determine what is relevant.  Wow, that is pretty good. Let the accuser determine what is relevant to  the one being accused.    The people of America see through this. The people of America  understand due process, and they understand when it is being trampled  in the people's House.   You see, it is also not a matter of process, which will be discussed  today. It is a matter of actual facts. I will fight the facts all day  long because what we have found here today is a President who did not  do as being charged. In fact, they had to go to abuse of power, this  amorphous term that you are going to hear many arguments about that  abuse of power, except for one thing, the call itself, the two parties  say no pressure. Nothing was ever done to get the money. In fact, they  didn't even know the money was held.   But there is something that very much bothers me about the facts.  There were five meetings--we will hear about those today--in which  there was never a linkage made. There was one witness who is depended  on over 600 times in the majority's report that, in the end, after  questioned, had to say: Well, that was my presumption of what was  happening.   You see, this is an impeachment based on presumption, basically also  a poll-tested impeachment on what actually sells to the American  people.   Today is going to be a lot of things. What it is not is fair. What it  is not is about the truth. What is true today, and I just heard it just  a moment ago in the articles themselves where it said--and the Speaker,  I believe, actually talked about this, that the President weakened a  foreign leader.   Do you know what the truth of the matter is, Madam Speaker? The most  interesting and deplorable thing that I have heard over the last few  weeks is the actual attack by the majority on President Zelensky  because they realize the whole crux of their case is that if he was not  pressured, their house of cards falls. By the way, it has already  fallen.   But if we can't show pressure, then we either have to call him a  liar, a world leader, or we have to make up names to call him. That is  exactly what happened in the Judiciary Committee when a Member of the  majority actually compared him to a battered wife. That is below the  dignity of this body, to take a world leader and, when he doesn't make  your case for you, to belittle him, especially, as is going to be often  said by the majority, that they are in the middle of a hot war with  Russia.   You see, President Trump actually did give them offensive weapons.  President Trump did nothing wrong. We are going to talk about that all  day long today.   We went on process, and we went on facts. Why? Because the American  people will see through this.   Before I close this first part, I will have to recognize that even  the minority leader in the Senate recognizes that the House did not do  their job because he can't make the case to his own Members so he is  having to ask for witnesses, ask for more time. You see, and even  yesterday, it was sort of funny. I thought it was hilarious that the  minority leader in the Senate went out and did a press conference and  said: They denied my witnesses. They denied my requests.   Well, welcome to the club, Mr. Schumer. That is exactly what has  happened over here for the last 3 months.   Today, we are going to talk a lot about impeachment. We are going to  talk a lot about our President. We are going to talk about two Articles  of Impeachment, abuse of power because they can't actually pin anything  of factual basis on him--the President did nothing wrong in this  issue--and then they are going to talk about obstruction of Congress.   You know, obstruction of Congress, as I have said before, is like  petulant children saying we didn't get our way when we didn't ask the  right way, and we didn't actually go after it and try to make a case.   You know why, Madam Speaker? The clock and the calendar are terrible  masters. The majority will own that problem today because to the clock  and the calendar, facts don't matter. The promises to the base matter,  and today is a promise kept for the majority--not a surprise, a fact.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).    Mr. Speaker, I wish, as the gentlewoman just  said, that they would examine the factual conduct, but I guess that is  not going to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I also remind my chairman that  impeachment was never meant as a political weapon in between elections  when you can't win the next one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Conaway).    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1\1/ 2\ minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1\1/ 2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, it gives me pleasure to yield  1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I would remind this whole body  that it is more than eight lines. In fact, there are four facts: There  is no pressure. There is no conditionality. They did nothing to get it.  And they got the money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Spano).    Mr. Speaker, I would have to disagree with my  chairman. I am not sure what he has been watching, but the facts are  not undisputed. They are very much disputed, not only by the minority,  but by the witnesses who actually testified.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I would never have thought that  a Department of Justice investigation was used as a money revenue plot,  but I guess one thing is true: It was a loser for the minority in a net  profit situation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I do believe that our elections  should be free and fair. I do believe that with all my heart. Except it  seems like in this case impeachment is based on the fact that the  Speaker said last month it would be dangerous to leave it to the voters  to determine if Mr. Trump stays in office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I am glad that my colleague  just mentioned Georgia, because since 2014 the actual voter  participation among minorities--African American female and African  American male, Hispanic male and Hispanic female--has risen double- digits. I am very proud of what Georgia is doing to get everybody to  the poll. I am glad he chose to highlight it. Unfortunately, he just  highlighted it in the wrong way.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. King).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   As I have reminded many times, we have followed a sham process that  we have had to deal with, and we have followed the facts and won both.   I will remind that, if you want to talk about elections, remember, it  was the Speaker of the House who said we can't trust the voters; it is  too dangerous to leave it with the voters for President Trump next  year.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Madam Speaker, it is interesting that the  President was supposedly given rights in the Judiciary Committee, but  maybe who would he have asked questions of, three law school professors  and a staff member? Not a lot of due process there.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), another member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I know this is probably not  true, but I think the speakers are not working on the majority side  because I have talked about it, and many of our Members have talked  about the facts.   Let's just go over them real quickly: no pressure, no conditionality,  nothing was ever denied them, and when they got through, they actually  got the money, and they never did anything for it.   We have talked about the facts. That is a distraction that doesn't  need to happen.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gooden).    Madam Speaker, the only urgent threat to this  body is the clock and the calendar and the desire to impeach the  President before we go home for Christmas.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. David P. Roe).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1-2/3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams).     Madam Speaker, I also remind my chairman that  the impeachment was not to be used between election cycles to defeat a  sitting President who you think will be reelected.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Buchanan).                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The chairman hears us. He doesn't want to acknowledge it. When you  have nothing but a process that was completely amuck, you talk about  process. I have already debunked the facts many times. Let's do it one  more time.   No pressure by either Mr. Trump or Mr. Zelensky. In fact, what really  just horrifies me is they continue to say that Mr. Zelensky, who is the  supposed victim here, said many times there was no pressure. The  Democrats are calling him a liar and weakening him in his own country.  That is deplorable.   There is no conditionality in the transcript or conditionality after  that. Five meetings prove that. They were all high-level meetings. No  conditionality. Two of those meetings were after the Ukrainians  actually knew of the possibility that aid was being held.   They have not ever addressed the truths and the facts. After there  was nothing done to get the money, guess what? They got the money. That  is the fact. That is what they don't want to deal with. That is where  we are today. So let's continue to see how the sham was perpetrated.  That is what many of our Members are talking about.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Bergman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Speaker, I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I am just amazed by what the  chairman just said. If it was obvious that he violated the bribery  statute clearly, then why didn't we add it as an Article of  Impeachment?   The reason why? It didn't.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am glad to know that Mr. Trump was giving them lethal aid,  actually, something to fight back with, not what was previously given  to them. And there was, again, from the President, himself, no pressure  put on him.  [[Page H12161]]    Your whole case is sort of destroyed if you are coercing somebody if  there was no pressure felt; yet, we don't seem to get that part on this  floor debate today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Montana  (Mr. Gianforte).    Madam Speaker, I am back. I also noticed some  changes around here since I left. I notice I have a new manager on the  other side, who, as I came back in from getting a quick bite, I noticed  gave an eloquent defense of his side of this story that we are telling.  I just wish we could have had that same eloquent defense before the  Judiciary Committee, where he could have been asked questions instead  of just giving one side.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate anybody who would  come and give testimony. But it is interesting to see that the same  chairman who just spoke eloquently about those who testified would have  to actually dismiss completely almost anything by Mr. Volker or Mr.  Morrison.   But, again, I will say, at least they had the ability and the  willingness to come and testify, unlike the chairman, who wrote a  report, sent it to the Judiciary Committee, and didn't.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Granger).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I see how this is playing out. Instead of coming to  testify for 7 or 8 hours and answering all questions, we are going to  do it in potshots.   Again, let's talk about Mr. Volker. He never testified that anyone  wanted to investigate Vice President Biden. What he did testify to,  which was left out, was that they wanted to, if the Ukrainians are  doing bad things, place Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma to avoid  anything that needed to be investigated and found out.   Let's at least tell the story. Again, they had plenty of time to do  this in an actual hearing, not here. This is what they want. This is  what they have been wanting. The majority has played this the whole  time. We will play this out as long as they want to. It would have been  better, though, if they actually had a case, to have made it in the  proper setting instead of not coming and not testifying.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Weber).    Madam Speaker, I always like to be polite,  and I do appreciate the gentleman from California confirming everything  I just said in my statement a moment ago.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Madam Speaker, undoubtedly, H. Res. 660 does  not matter to the majority, in particular, the manager of this bill,  because the inspector general, his transcript has not been released.  There have not been documents that were transferred that were supposed  to be transferred to the White House, and we are still not sure we got  everything we are supposed to get in the Judiciary Committee.   I guess when you want to be transparent and open, you hold it in a  SCIF and do whatever you want.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Steube).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Madam Speaker, I also would like to remind  the gentleman from California that Mr. Sondland also said he had no  direct evidence; he presumed that that was going on.   I guess we are back to presumption again.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Flores).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).    Madam Speaker, before I call my next speaker,  may I ask the time remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), who is a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Wow, I just love this, again, potshot it in  when you can.   Remember, quid pro quo didn't work out really well for them because  that was supposedly who had pressure on President Zelensky. In fact, it  didn't work out, so, well, you had to go poll test it. The majority  didn't work out because focus groups didn't like it.   So, what do we do? We throw it in here, a bribe. It is all in their  report, but if they had a bribe or if they actually had a crime, it  would be in the articles.   Guess what? He doesn't have it. He can't put it in there. This is all  fluff and circumstance because they can't get to the President, and  that is what is killing them.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Bucshon).    Madam Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).    Madam Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Madam Speaker, I yield 35 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time that the  gentlewoman did not have, I yield 35 seconds to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Madam Speaker, for reasons that I really  don't understand, I am having to yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, it is a shame, on the floor of  this House, when you accuse somebody and then make them prove they are  not guilty of what you are accusing them of.   Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. John W. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the time  remaining for both the majority and the minority.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Long).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Watkins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am sure it did strike a chord with the chairman  since he showed up a little late, hadn't heard all of the arguments. We  beat the facts back all the time. It is the majority side that had to  run through this. That clock and that calendar are killing him, and it  is killing him because his arguments are falling flat.   To speak of evidence, we looked at the evidence, and the evidence  doesn't fit anything.   And by the way, if the gentleman had extortion, put in articles. The  gentleman can't because he can't make the case. He can only put it in  his notes and then come to the mike when he can't be questioned and  talk about it. That is the question, and that is the chord that has  been struck.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).    Madam Speaker, it would have been nice if  they had actually thought those crimes were bad enough to have put them  in the articles, but they didn't.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Ratcliff).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. WALDEN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I would ask the gentleman if  he is ready to close.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. MULLIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the minority whip.    Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago just off of  this floor, I said that a dark cloud was descending upon this body. And  today, because of the clock and the calendar, it is closing.   It is amazing to me what I just heard from the majority leader: that  Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler presented a compelling case for impeachment.   If this is a compelling case for impeachment, I am not sure why we  are here right now.   It is not anywhere close to compelling.   But you know what is interesting is what I have heard today. The  majority leader just spoke and said that the President was given every  opportunity to come prove his innocence.   I tell you what, Madam Speaker, let me have just a few minutes, stop  the clock, and let me go around to the press corps and everybody here  and I am going to accuse you of something.   You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. Now prove it is  wrong. You did it.   Guess what? You don't want to, because deep down, you know that that  is turning the entire jurisprudence of this country upside down.   You are not guilty until you are proven innocent. You are innocent.   And today from this floor, we have heard the majority leader say this  President is guilty, and not the other way around.   He is innocent, and these articles come nowhere close to proving it.   But what is left of this body? Let's have an honest conversation,  Madam Speaker.   What we have found over the past few weeks is that it is okay for the  majority to tear down a foreign leader because they can't make their  case. They have called him a liar or weak or worse, or as he was called  in the committee, he even looked like a battered wife.   It is below the dignity of this body and this majority to tear down a  foreign leader because they can't make their case against this one.   We have broken rules in this House, even to this moment. Chairman  Schiff and the others have broken H. Res. 660 by not turning over the  things that they should be turning over.   I still have not gotten a transcript and the White House still has  not gotten their stuff.   I guess to the minority here, the rules today don't matter either.   You see, there is a problem here, because we are going to vote on  this tonight while breaking the rules. What a shameful incident.   But we also found a creative interpretation of minority rights. We  saw the rise of partisanship, because of the things that have been done  even further.   We have even seen Members smeared in reports by drive-by political  hacks when they match phone numbers of the ranking member and members  of the press.   That ought to concern every one of you as much as it concerns every  one of us. Nothing but a drive-by hit.   But you know something? This majority leader also just said wherever  law ends, tyranny begins.   But I will say this: In this House, wherever the rules are  disregarded, chaos and mob rule actually begin, and the majority has  taken that to a new level.   It has been said today, where is bravery?   I will tell you where bravery is found and courage is found: It is  found in this minority, who has lived through the last year of nothing  but rules being broken, people being put down, questions not being  answered, and this majority saying, Be damned with anything else, we  are going to impeach and do whatever we want to do.   Why? Because we won an election.   I guarantee you, one day you will be back in the minority, and it  ain't going to be that fun. Because when you look at it, when you  actually trash the rules of this House, you want to really look at:  What did you gain at the end by trashing the institution you claim to  love?   Those are the things we have found out so far.   But you know they are really careful in saying, Oh, you want to deal  with process and process.   As I said last night in the Rules Committee--where they didn't want  to listen--I will win on process and I will win on facts, because we  have the truth on our side.   Let me remind you that here is what the facts actually say. There was  no pressure. Look at the call between President Zelensky and President  Trump: no pressure. There was no conditionality. There was nothing done  to get the aid, and the aid actually came.  [[Page H12192]]    There were five meetings, but when you look at it right now, none of  which matter, because right now the dark cloud is descending upon this  House.   I am fearful, Madam Speaker, when I look out into that abyss. I don't  know what I see, but I tell you what I do see. I see coming up a  President who will put his head down, even through this sham  impeachment, and he will do his job. He will put the American people  first. He will tell them, I care about you. He will still put the  economy first, and he will make sure that this country stands strong.   That is what I see in this abyss. That is where we are going.                                time  1945    Madam Speaker, it is with that hope in the future that I recognize  right now that I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the Republican leader of this House.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
