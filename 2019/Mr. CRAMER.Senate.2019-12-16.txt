 Mr. President, today's 75th anniversary of the beginning  of the Battle of the Bulge presents an opportunity to honor the heroism  of the Allied forces who fought in this last major German offensive in  Western Europe during World War II. More than 650,000 troops from the  United States, Great Britain, Belgium, Canada, and other countries  fought in this battle to defeat Nazi Germany. These soldiers bravely  fought for 38 days from December 16, 1944, to January 25, 1945, and  their victory made possible the final defeat and surrender of Germany  in May 1945.   More than 40 Senate colleagues joined in cosponsoring S. Con Res. 23,  which my West Virginia colleague, Mr. Manchin, and I introduced and the  Senate passed last week to remember the significance of this historic  battle.   The Battle of the Bulge was an attempt by the Germans to split the  Allied forces and pressure them to seek a negotiated peace. These  troops, located in the Ardennes region of Belgium and Luxembourg, were  greatly outnumbered by the German Army as they faced harsh weather  conditions and treacherous and unknown terrain.   It is difficult to comprehend the massive losses incurred from this  one battle--including 89,000 American casualties. Nineteen thousand  American soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice, with another 47,500  wounded and more than 23,000 captured or missing in action. Other  nations suffered great losses as well. Belgium lost more than 74,000  civilians, in addition to many more who suffered through other  atrocities that come with war. They persevered through this dark time  and rebuilt their lives the best way they could after the war ended.   In the decades since, the citizens of Belgium and Luxembourg have  generously hosted thousands of U.S. veterans as they have kept the  memory of the Battle of the Bulge alive through numerous memorials and  museums. Among them has been one of North Dakota's most distinguished  World War II veterans, Lynn Aas of Minot.   Mr. Aas enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1942 at the age of 21 and  was called into service in March 1943. He was assigned to the 193rd  Glider Regiment in the 17th Airborne Division. Arriving in England in  August 1944, he  [[Page S7047]]  mastered glider-use techniques and was deployed in France on December  24. He first went to Camp Mourmelon, followed by Charleville-Mezieres,  where his division was attached to George Patton's U.S. Third Army.  There, he was among those ordered to defend a 30-mile defensive  position along the Meuse River whose mission was to prevent the German  advance in the Belgian Ardennes area.   On January 5, 1945, Private First Class Aas crossed the Belgian  border and settled in a wooded area near Bastogne. Combat ensued 2 days  later as the Battle of the Bulge was raging. The fighting was so  intense the area became forever known as Dead Man's Ridge. As he and  his unit continued to advance toward Luxembourg, they pushed enemy  lines back towards the Siegfried Line.   In February, after the battle had ended and after weeks of combat in  exceptionally harsh conditions, he returned to France to Camp Chalons- sur-Marne. He was reassigned to the 194th Glider Infantry after his  regiment disbanded because of heavy casualties Private First Class Aas  helped prepare for the airborne operation Varsity. On March 24, he left  Coulommiers and landed in Germany near Wesel to help capture Rhine  bridges and secure towns to protect Allied ground forces. The following  day he was wounded by shrapnel and was hospitalized in Belgium and then  Paris, where he spent several weeks recovering.   Private First Class Aas returned to North Dakota following the war,  earned his law degree from the University of North Dakota, and served  in the State legislature for four sessions. To this day, he remains a  community leader in Minot. He is one of the best examples of the  thousands of World War II veterans we proudly call ``the greatest  generation.''   For his valorous conduct in action, Mr. Aas has received prestigious  distinctions, including the Purple Heart Medal, the Bronze Star Medal  for heroic and meritorious service in Belgium, as well as the  Luxembourg Medal of Honor and the honorific diploma of Citizen of Utah  Beach--Sainte-Marie-du-Mont / Citoyen d'Utah Beach--Sainte-Marie-du- Mont. It was my honor in October 2017 to join French Consul General  Lacroix, who made a special trip to Minot to present France's highest  military recognition, the Legion of Honor, to Mr. Aas, who was then 96  years old.   Mr. President, as we remember this 75th anniversary of the Battle of  the Bulge, let us once again remember and honor the heroism and  sacrifices of our American soldiers, who paved the way for victory in  World War II and for our freedom today.                            ____________________
