 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my Democrat colleagues to  unite with Republicans and put pressure on the Senate to have an adult  conversation about our debt and spending.   We collected $4 trillion last year. Our mandatory spending is $4  trillion, automatic spending? And of the $2 trillion of discretionary  spending, 80 percent is unauthorized. That means that 90 percent of  spending is not even considered by this institution.   We have programs like Medicare that are going bankrupt. We have  bipartisan issues supported by Trump and Obama that could save billions  of dollars for the seniors to save Medicare, like site-neutral payments  and overbilling by Medicare. It is fraudulent overbilling, dishonest  billing that is supported by broad groups of think tanks.   We have to save these programs for the people that were promised  them. We need to have the backbone in Washington, D.C., to stand up for  we the people and challenge special interest groups.   I urge my colleagues to be with us on this issue.
