 Mr. President, on Tuesday morning, I visited with  Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. We talked about the military's needs  and national security priorities, and we talked about the fact that  more than a month into the new fiscal year, Congress still hasn't  funded the military for fiscal year 2020. We shouldn't have needed to  talk about that. We should have passed the Defense appropriations bill  for 2020 weeks ago, but Democrats won't let us.   Last week, Democrats blocked consideration of the 2020 Defense  appropriations bill for the second time. Apparently they have every  intention of continuing to block military funding. This is politics at  its worst. And make no mistake--this is politics. A couple of months  ago, Democrats and Republicans got together and agreed on defense and  nondefense funding levels for 2020 and 2021. The idea was to pave the  way for the passage of appropriations bills in a timely fashion. It  seemed for a moment that despite Democrats' fixation on partisan  politics and impeachment, we could actually go about funding the  government and the military in a somewhat bipartisan fashion, but  apparently that was too much to ask of the Senate Democrats. Senate  Democrats are currently running from the agreement, attempting to  derail the defense funding bill with poison pills that would prevent  the bill from ever being enacted into law.   Funding our military should be the first priority of every Member of  Congress. The safety of our country depends on the strength of our  military. If we don't get national security right, the rest is  conversation. Getting national security right means making sure our  military is adequately funded, making sure we are funding the needs of  the current military and preparing for future priorities. It should go  without saying that an essential part of this responsibility is getting  that funding passed in a timely fashion.   Right now, since we haven't passed the 2020 funding bill, the  military is operating under a continuing resolution that maintains  funding levels from last year. There are multiple problems with that.   In the first place, the military is operating without all the funding  it needs. For example, the Pentagon can't fully support the pay  increase military members should be getting.   In addition, the continuing resolution prevents the military from  starting key projects that will help ensure our men and women in  uniform are prepared to meet the threats of the future. The Pentagon  can't start new procurement projects. New research and development  initiatives that keep us a step ahead of our adversaries are put on  hold.   All told, under a continuing resolution, the military's purchasing  power is reduced by roughly $5 billion each quarter. Five billion  dollars each quarter that we continue to operate under a continuing  resolution is the amount of purchasing power that is lost to our  military to meet their critical priorities. To put that in perspective,  that is the equivalent of losing out on about 56 F-35 Joint Strike  Fighter planes, depending on the variant, every 3 months; or nearly 2  complete Virginia-class attack submarines, like the recently  commissioned USS South Dakota; or about 5,000 Joint Air-to-Surface  Standoff Missiles, like those used to clean up the site of the Baghdadi  raid or strike Syrian chemical weapons facilities in 2018. That $5  billion isn't spare change; it is funding for critical military  priorities.   In November of 2018, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy  Commission released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to  the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power,  like Russia or China. That is a dangerous situation for our country to  be in, and we need to keep working to rebuild our military. That starts  with making sure our military is fully funded in a timely fashion.   On the floor last week, I noted that Democrats would like us to  believe that they are serious about legislating and that their years- long obsession with impeaching the President isn't distracting them  from doing their job. After the Democrats' defense filibuster last  week, it is becoming clear that the Democrats are incapable of putting  anything ahead of partisan politics, including the safety of our  country and the well-being of our military.   It is particularly ironic that the Democrats are blocking this  defense funding bill, which would provide $250 million in assistance to  Ukraine, at the same time they are trying to impeach the President for  allegedly delaying Ukraine funding. Think about that.   It is hard to know what to say to my Democrat colleagues. It should  not be this hard to convince them that funding our military is more  important than scoring points against the President.   I hope the leader will continue to bring up the defense funding bill  and that enough of my Democratic colleagues will decide to join us in  getting this funding to our military. It is the very least we can do  for the men and women who spend every day working to keep us safe.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Perdue).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Perdue).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Indiana (Mr. Braun), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the  Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Perdue).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Braun)  would have voted ``Yea'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran) would  have voted ``Yea''.    Mr. President, today I congratulate a former staff  member of mine, James Long, on his recent promotion to colonel in the  Air Force Reserve.   Jim served for a year as an Air Force fellow on my staff back in  2011. He worked hard and did a great job for us as we worked to make  sure the men and women of the military were properly funded, organized,  trained, and equipped. In particular, Jim was very helpful with respect  to intelligence community issues, having previously served as a senior  special agent at the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of the  Inspector General, where he conducted and oversaw investigations of CIA  officers and contractor personnel. After leaving my office, he went on  to work with the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations as the  chief of the Crime Integration Desk, as well as being individual  mobilization augmentee to the Commander of the Investigations  Collections Operations Nexus Center at Marine Corps Base Quantico.   Last year, while continuing his work in the Air Force Reserve, Jim  was hired by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector  General to build its first Major Frauds and Corruption Unit. He  currently oversees large-scale criminal investigations and has put  together a team of anti-fraud professionals, including special agents,  forensic auditors, forensic accountants, data scientists, and analysts,  to investigate and uncover significant fraud schemes. His team was also  an integral part of the recent high-profile fraud case involving misuse  of disaster relief funds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  administered in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.   Jim has had a long and distinguished career in the military, where he  has served for over 26 years. He first served for 4 years in the Marine  Corps, and after going to college, he joined the Air Force Reserve,  where he has risen through the ranks to his current position as  colonel.   Jim continues to have a stellar career serving the Nation, including  being deployed to Kirkuk, Iraq, in 2008, where he commanded 57 combat  missions.   Again, I wish to congratulate Colonel Long on his promotion and wish  him and his family the very best as he continues to serve our Nation,  both in his capacities at the Air Force Reserve and at the Department  of Homeland Security.                            ____________________
