 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2316) to amend the Mineral Leasing Act  and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to repeal provisions relating only to  the Allegheny National Forest.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2316         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cooperative Management of       Mineral Rights Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PROVISIONS REGARDING THE ALLEGHENY NATIONAL                     FOREST.         (a) Repeal.--Subsection (o) of section 17 of the Mineral       Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 226) and section 2508 of the Energy       Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486; 106 Stat. 3108) are       repealed.        (b) Notice Requirement Not Affected.--Nothing in this Act       shall be construed or interpreted--        (1) to limit, modify, or otherwise affect the existing       requirement to provide in writing 60-day advance notice of       specific activities in accordance with the order dated       December 16, 1980, in the case United States of America v.       Minard Run Oil Company, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9570 (W.D. Pa.,       Dec. 16, 1980); or        (2) to limit existing authority of the Forest Service under       provisions of law codified in section 551 of title 16, United       States Code.        (c) Permitting Authority Not Affected.--Nothing in this Act       shall be construed or interpreted to alter, repeal, or       otherwise limit the existing authority of the Forest Service       to permit the harvest or sale of timber derived from the       Allegheny National Forest.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for allowing H.R. 2316 to come to the  floor.   The Allegheny National Forest, located in my district in northwestern  Pennsylvania, is located near the first commercial oil discovery in the  country. The Allegheny National Forest is Pennsylvania's only national  forest and, since its creation in 1923, has been home to numerous  recreational and commercial activities.   Oil and gas has been produced from privately owned subsurface  minerals within the forest for decades, and mineral owners worked  cooperatively with the Forest Service to safely produce oil and gas  within the national forest boundaries.   Mineral owners routinely provided 60-day notification of drilling  plans  [[Page H7641]]  prior to the commencement of operations, and the Forest Service then  issued a notice to proceed, or NTP. However, in 2006, the Forest  Service deemed issuance of an NTP to be a major Federal action that  triggered the application of the National Environmental Policy Act.   This designation requires a full environmental analysis of the  Allegheny National Forest, and environmental groups were quick to sue  the Forest Service to enforce the new rule. After settling with these  groups, the Forest Service issued a moratorium when issuing NTPs until  the full environmental analysis was completed. This moratorium had  immediate and severe impacts on the mineral rights owners, who were  unfairly denied access to their mineral property.   The oil and gas industry sued, claiming that the Forest Service did  not have the authority to preclude the development of privately owned  minerals, and in 2009 the U.S. District Court of Western Pennsylvania  agreed and lifted the moratorium in the Allegheny National Forest. The  lower court's decision was confirmed on appeal in 2013. This bill fully  repeals the invalidated language from the Mineral Leasing Act and the  Energy Policy Act of 1992 in accordance with these court decisions.   Throughout the litigation, the Forest Service claimed section 2508 of  the Energy Policy Act of 1992, codified in the Mineral Leasing Act,  provided them with the authority to restrict mineral development. It is  critical to strike this language. Had this regulation not been  challenged, over 11 million acres of split estate minerals throughout  the country would have been locked up, devastating mineral owners and  local and State economies.   A similar version of this bill passed the House during the 114th  Congress, demonstrating the support for protecting private property  rights in the Allegheny National Forest.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to implementing this crucial solution. I  urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1547) to provide for the unencumbering of  title to non-Federal land owned by the city of Tucson, Arizona, for  purposes of economic development by conveyance of the Federal  reversionary interest to the City.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1547         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Udall Park Land Exchange       Completion Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Tucson,       Arizona.        (2) Non-federal land.--The term ``non-Federal land'' means       the approximately 172.8-acre parcel of City land identified       in the patent numbered 02-90-0001 and dated October 4, 1989,       and more particularly described as lots 3 and 4, S\1/2\NW\1/      4\, sec. 5, T.14S., R.15 E., Gila and Salt River Meridian,       Arizona.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF FEDERAL REVERSIONARY INTEREST IN LAND                     LOCATED IN TUCSON, ARIZONA.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, the Secretary shall convey to the City, without       consideration, the reversionary interests of the United       States in and to the non-Federal land for the purpose of       unencumbering the title to the non-Federal land to enable       economic development of the non-Federal land.        (b) Legal Descriptions.--As soon as practicable after the       date of enactment of this Act, the exact legal descriptions       of the non-Federal land shall be determined in a manner       satisfactory to the Secretary.        (c) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may       require such additional terms and conditions to the       conveyance under subsection (a), consistent with that       subsection, as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect       the interests of the United States.        (d) Costs.--The City shall pay all costs associated with       the conveyance under subsection (a), consistent with that       subsection, including the costs of any surveys, recording       costs, and other reasonable costs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1547 completes the transfer of the Bureau of Land  Management's reversionary interest in Udall Park, located in Tucson,  Arizona, nearly three decades after the city donated $4 million worth  of land to the Bureau of Land Management to complete their portion of  the exchange.   Twenty years after the exchange took place, the Bureau of Land  Management threatened to invoke its reversionary interest because the  city dared to hold a local farmers market in the park. The city of  Tucson has invested millions of dollars in this community park,  building swimming pools, recreation centers, and athletic fields, and  it deserves to have clear title to the land and complete jurisdiction  over the uses of the park.   The bill is bipartisan and has nearly unanimous support from the  Arizona congressional delegation. I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 965) to redesignate the Saint-Gaudens  National Historic Site as the ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical  Park'', and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 965         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Saint-Gaudens National       Historical Park Redesignation Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF SAINT-GAUDENS NATIONAL HISTORICAL                     PARK.         (a) In General.--The Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site       shall be known and designated as the ``Saint-Gaudens National       Historical Park''.        (b) Amendments to Public Law 88-543.--Public Law 88-543 (78       Stat.749) is amended--        (1) by striking ``National Historic Site'' each place it       appears and inserting ``National Historical Park'';        (2) in section 2(a), by striking ``historic site'' and       inserting ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park'';        (3) in section 3, by--        (A) striking ``national historical site'' and inserting       ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park''; and        (B) striking ``part of the site'' and inserting ``part of       the park''; and        (4) in section 4(b), by striking ``traditional to the       site'' and inserting ``traditional to the park''.        (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation,       document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to       the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site shall be considered       to be a reference to the ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical       Park''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Augustus Saint-Gaudens is one of the most prolific  sculptors in our Nation's history. His work includes Boston's Robert  Gould Shaw Memorial, Chicago's Standing Lincoln, and New York's William  Tecumseh Sherman Memorial. Most notably, Saint-Gaudens designed a $20  double eagle gold piece for the U.S. Mint, considered one of the  greatest American coins ever issued.   The Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site is a 190-acre historic site  in Sullivan County, New Hampshire. The site encompasses the summer home  and studio of this renowned American artist, whose annual presence in  Sullivan County helped spawn the Cornish Artist Colony in nearby  Cornish, New Hampshire. This colony, which was  [[Page H7643]]  comprised of painters, sculptors, and musicians, helped drive a period  of American artistic resurgence called the American Renaissance in the  years following the Civil War.   The main house and surrounding gardens were initially designated as a  National Historic Landmark in 1962, which was converted to a National  Historic Site in 1964, when the grounds were donated to the National  Park Service. The current property contains 21 buildings, a number of  Saint-Gaudens' sculptures, and miles of hiking trails.   This bill simply changes the designation of Saint-Gaudens National  Historic Site to a National Historical Park, allowing the National Park  Service to better relay the impact and legacy of this historic American  artist.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for  this piece of legislation and thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire  (Ms. Kuster) for putting this forward, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2582) to authorize the State of Utah to  select certain lands that are available for disposal under the Pony  Express Resource  [[Page H7644]]  Management Plan to be used for the support and benefit of State  institutions, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2582         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Confirming State Land Grants       for Education Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.         (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights, the       State of Utah may select any lands in T6S and T7S, R1W, Salt       Lake Base and Meridian, that are owned by the United States,       under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land       Management, and identified as available for disposal by land       exchange in the Record of Decision for the Pony Express       Resource Management Plan and Rangeland Program Summary for       Utah County (January 1990), as amended by the Pony Express       Plan Amendment (November 1997), in fulfillment of the land       grants made in sections 6, 8, and 12 of the Act of July 16,       1894 (28 Stat. 107) as generally depicted on the map entitled       ``Proposed Utah County Quantity Grants'' and dated June 27,       2017, to further the purposes of the State of Utah School and       Institutional Trust Lands Administration, without further       land use planning action by the Bureau of Land Management.        (b) Application.--The criteria listed in Decision 3 of the       Lands Program of the resource management plan described in       subsection (a) shall not apply to any land selected under       subsection (a).        (c) Effect on Limitation.--Nothing in this Act affects the       limitation established under section 2815(d) of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law       106-65).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2582, introduced by the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love), seeks to resolve an ongoing standoff between the State of Utah  and the Bureau of Land Management over statehood-era land grants to  promote responsible land management and enable the United States to  fulfill its commitments to provide land for the support of Utah's  higher education system.   Since 1998, the Bureau of Land Management has cited an administrative  technicality to favor land exchanges over State selections of land,  which has held up the State of Utah's selection of roughly 500 acres of  Bureau of Land Management land classified for disposal.   The land in question has been selected by the State for the benefit  of Utah State University, and this bill makes it clear that State  selections are equally acceptable as land exchanges and would confirm  that the Bureau of Land Management may process the State's current  selection as well as future State selections in the immediate area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, being from the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2937) to amend the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act of 1977 to authorize partnerships between States  and nongovernmental entities for the purpose of reclaiming and  restoring land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining  activities before August 3, 1977, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2937         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Community Reclamation       Partnerships Act''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCE.         Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this       Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a       provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a       provision of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act       of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.).       SEC. 3. STATE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING FOR CERTAIN                     REMEDIATION.         (a) Memoranda Authorized.--Section 405 (30 U.S.C. 1235) is       amended by inserting after subsection (l) the following:        ``(m) State Memoranda of Understanding for Remediation of       Mine Drainage.--        ``(1) In general.--A State with a State program approved       under subsection (d) may enter into a memorandum of       understanding with relevant Federal or State agencies (or       both) to remediate mine drainage on abandoned mine land and       water impacted by abandoned mines within the State.

Section 413(d) (30 U.S.C. 1242(d)) is amended in the second       sentence by inserting ``unless such control or treatment will       be conducted in accordance with a State memorandum of       understanding approved under section 405(m) of this Act''       after ``Control Act'' the second place it appears.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5  [[Page H7646]]  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for allowing H.R. 2937 to come to the  floor. This legislation, introduced by my friend from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood), will help address the challenge of abandoned coal mines  present in many affected communities across the Nation.   The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act enables States to partner  with Good Samaritan entities to reclaim abandoned mine sites and  facilitate acid mine drainage cleanup. H.R. 2937 creates more  opportunities to address this challenge.   Mr. Speaker, representing the Pennsylvania Fifth Congressional  District, just to note, my congressional district has more abandoned  mine sites than any congressional district in the country, so I am very  grateful for the leadership that Mr. LaHood has shown in bringing H.R.  2937 forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my  colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I am very appreciative  to the author of this bill for his leadership. Having a congressional  district that has significant presence of abandoned mine lands, I know  that the authorities and the protections he is seeking here will be  good for all, for the communities, for the environment, and for the  economy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, October is National  Disability Employment Awareness Month, and it is a time when we  celebrate the numerous contributions and skills of American workers  with disabilities.   Many Americans with disabilities struggle to find employment  opportunities despite the wealth of skills they have to offer. In 2016,  only 27.7 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities were  employed.   More employers should recognize the fresh perspectives and skills  that these men and women can add to an organization.   Workers with developmental disabilities tend to be reliable,  dedicated, and loyal employees with a positive attitude and a strong  work ethic.   Right here on Capitol Hill, my office participates in the  Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual  Disabilities. This program is designed to give students with varying  intellectual disabilities an opportunity to gain congressional work  experience, and it has been rewarding for everyone involved.   Mr. Speaker, hiring an individual who has a disability can have a  profound impact on their life. They experience the independence,  economic self-sufficiency, pride, and community that come with a job.   These individuals promote workforce diversity and can truly enhance  the workplace for the better.                            ____________________
