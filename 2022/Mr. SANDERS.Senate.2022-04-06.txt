 Mr. President, I look forward to offering two rollcall  votes on motions to instruct conferees to the so-called  ``competitiveness'' bill based on the assurances given to me by the  majority leader. I am not quite sure when we are going to get to that,  but I look forward to offering those two rollcall votes.   The first motion would instruct the conference committee not to  provide $53 billion to the highly profitable microchip industry without  protections for the American people.   The second motion would instruct conferees not to provide a $10  billion bailout to Blue Origin, a space company owned by Jeff Bezos,  the second-wealthiest person in America, who is also the owner of  Amazon. Amazon is a company which, in a given year, pays nothing-- zero--in Federal income taxes after making billions in profits; and, by  the way, in a given year, Mr. Bezos himself, one of the wealthiest  people in the country, has paid nothing in Federal income taxes despite  being worth nearly $200 billion.   Let me be very clear. Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a very  beautiful $500 million yacht. It looks very nice to me, not that I know  much about yachts; but that one looks very nice. Mr. Bezos has enough  money to purchase a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms. I am not  quite sure you need 25 bathrooms, but that is not my business--and here  is that mansion. So, no, count me in as somebody who does not think  that the taxpayers of this country need to provide Mr. Bezos a $10  billion bailout to fuel his space hobby.   When all is said and done, both of these motions are--the one on $53  billion for the microchip industry and $10 billion for Mr. Bezos--touch  on an extremely important issue that is very rarely discussed in the  corporate media or on the floor of the Senate, and that is how we  proceed--how we go forward with industrial policy in this country.   I should be very clear in saying I believe in industrial policy. I  believe that it makes sense on certain occasions for the government and  the private sector to work together in a mutually beneficial way to  address a pressing need in America.   Industrial policy, to me, means cooperation between the government  and the private sector--cooperation. It does not mean the government  providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to extremely profitable  corporations without getting anything in return: Here is your check. Do  what you want. Have a nice day.   In other words, will the U.S. Government develop an industrial policy  that benefits all of our society or will we continue to have an  industrial policy that benefits just the wealthy and the powerful?   In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said:         The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the       rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.    I am afraid that what Dr. King said 54 years ago was not only  accurate back then but is even more accurate today.   We hear a lot of talk around here about the need to create public- private partnerships. That all sounds very good, but when the  government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all of the risk  and privatizes all of the profits, whether it is handing the microchip  industry a $53 billion blank check or giving Mr. Bezos a $10 billion  bailout to fly to the Moon, that is not a partnership. That is the  exact opposite of a partnership. That is corporate welfare. That is  crony capitalism.   Each and every day, I have heard my Republican colleagues and some  corporate Democrats blame inflation on runaway government spending. In  fact,  [[Page S2032]]  one of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus has even suggested that  we need to take a strategic pause when it comes to making urgent  Federal investments in childcare, healthcare, education, affordable  housing, paid family and medical leave, and home healthcare--policies  that would substantially improve the lives of the American people.  Well, you know what I believe. I believe that maybe--just maybe--the  time has come to take a strategic pause when it comes to providing tens  of billions of dollars in corporate welfare to some of the most  profitable corporations and wealthiest people on this planet.   The American people are becoming increasingly sick and tired of  corporations making recordbreaking profits while ordinary people  struggle to pay outrageously higher prices for gas, for rent, for food.  They are sick and tired of the high cost of prescription drugs,  childcare, housing, groceries. They are sick and tired of CEOs making  350 times more than the average worker while over half of our people  live paycheck to paycheck. The American people are sick and tired of  the wealthiest people in our country and the most profitable  corporations in some cases not paying a nickel in Federal income tax.   What does this so-called competitiveness bill do? Instead of  addressing any of these issues, this bill provides $53 billion in  corporate welfare to the microchip industry, with no protections for  the American people, and a $10 billion bailout to Mr. Bezos. Now, that  may make sense to Mr. Bezos, and it may make sense to other corporate  leaders, but it does not make sense to me nor do I think it makes sense  to the American people.   In terms of the microchip industry, the American people should know  the truth. We are talking about an industry that has shut down over 780  manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000  American jobs over the last 20 years as a result of moving their  productions overseas. They have shut down plants in America and moved  them overseas for cheap labor.   In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies closed  plants in America and hired people--sometimes at starvation wages--in  other countries, and now, believe it or not, these very same people,  these very same companies, are in line to receive $53 billion in  corporate welfare to literally undo the damage that they caused.   Now, some of my colleagues make the point that the microchip industry  is enormously important for our economy and that we must become less  dependent on foreign nations for microchips. I agree. There is no  argument about that. But we can and must accomplish that goal of  breaking our dependence on foreign countries for microchips without  simply throwing money at these huge corporations while the taxpayer  gets nothing in return.   I suspect five major semiconductor companies will likely receive the  lion's share of this taxpayer handout. They are Intel, Texas  Instruments, Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung. These  five companies that are in line for a $53 billion bailout made over $75  billion in profits last year.   The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer  assistance is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I wish them the very  best, but let us be clear: Intel is not a poor company. Intel is not  going broke--far from it. In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in  profits. We are talking about a company that had enough money to spend  over $14 billion during the pandemic not on research and development  but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy  shareholders. We are talking about a company that could afford to give  its CEO, Mr. Pat Gelsinger, a $116 million compensation package last  year. We are talking about a company that could afford to spend over  $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past 20  years. Does it sound like this company, as well as the others, really  needs corporate welfare? I don't think so.    Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this  legislation is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made  $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion in  buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good- paying American jobs to low-wage countries and spent more than $40  million on lobbying over the past 20 years. That is Texas Instruments.   And on and on it goes.   So the first amendment that I would like a vote on and expect a vote  on would instruct the conference committee to prevent microchip  companies from receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue  warrants or equity stakes to the Federal Government. If private  companies are going to benefit from over $53 billion in taxpayer  grants, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with  the American people, not just wealthy shareholders.   In other words, all this amendment says is that, if these investments  turn out to be profitable as a direct result of these Federal grants,  the taxpayers of this country have a right to get a return on that  investment.   This is by no means a radical idea. These exact conditions were  imposed on corporations that received taxpayer assistance in the  bipartisan CARES Act, which, as you will recall, passed the Senate 96  to 0. In other words, every Member of the U.S. Senate has already voted  for the conditions that are in this amendment.   In addition, this amendment would instruct the conference committee  to require these highly profitable companies not to buy back their own  stock, not to outsource American jobs, not to repeal collective  bargaining agreements, and to remain neutral in any union-organizing  efforts.   Again, this is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were  imposed on companies that received funding from the CARES Act, and that  passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0.   The second motion that I have introduced touches on an issue that we  have very, very rarely discussed on the floor of the Senate.  Unbelievably, the so-called competition bill would provide some $10  billion in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person  in America, for his space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in  America. So we are looking at a space race between the two wealthiest  guys in America.   You know, when I was a young man a few years ago and Neil Armstrong  went to the Moon, I recall like yesterday the kind of incredible joy  and pride in this country because the United States of America did  something that people never ever thought would be possible. Who would  have dreamed of sending a man to the Moon? Extraordinary. The entire  world, not only people in America, watched that event with bated  breath. All over the world, TV sets were on on every continent on  Earth. It was just an extraordinary accomplishment for all of humanity.  That is what Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the Moon--that it  was not just for the United States--but we, of course, our Nation, took  special pride because that was an American project.   I worry very much that what we are seeing now is not a space race  between the United States and other countries as to which nation will  return to the Moon or perhaps get to Mars but, rather, a space race  between Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos--the two wealthiest people in America-- as to who will gain control over NASA and future space explorations.   In other words, if we are able to accomplish the unbelievable,  extraordinary goal of sending a person to Mars, I want the flag that  will be flying on that planet to be the flag of the United States of  America, not the flag of SpaceX or Blue Origin.   Let us be clear: The $10 billion in this bill for Jeff Bezos and his  space company, Blue Origin, is just the tip of the iceberg. The reality  is that the space economy, which today mostly consists of private  companies using NASA facilities free of charge to launch satellites  into space, is already very profitable and could become and will likely  become even more so in the future.    Bank of America predicts that by 2030, the space economy will triple  in size to $1.4 trillion. That is ``trillion'' with a t.   According to the most recent data, private corporations made over $94  billion in profits a year for goods or services that are used in  space--profits  [[Page S2033]]  that could not have been achieved without the assistance of NASA, a  government Agency funded by the taxpayers of America.   And while we are talking about the profitability of satellites  today--and that is already a very profitable industry--sometime in the  future--not next year, not 10 years from now, but sometime in the  future--the real money may come to those who not only provide  satellites but those who figure out how to mine lucrative minerals or  asteroids. Does this sound like science fiction? It is not. This is  exactly what is being worked on right now, mining lucrative minerals on  asteroids.   In 2015, the famous astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, predicted:         The first trillionaire there will ever be is the person who       exploits the natural resources on asteroids . . . . There's       this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless       resources. I look at wars fought over access to resources.       That could be a thing of the past, once space becomes our       backyard.    End of quote, Mr. deGrasse Tyson.   Who gets to own the resources discovered by private corporations in  space?   Well, as a result of a little-known 2015 SPACE Act that passed the  Senate by unanimous consent with virtually no floor debate, private  corporations are able to own all of these resources. In other words,  the taxpayers of this country will get a zero-percent return on the  investment they made in these private enterprises, which could turn out  to be unbelievably lucrative.   Is that what we want space exploration to become? Do we really think  that it is acceptable for NASA to hand out billions of dollars to some  of the wealthiest billionaires in America today to make them even  wealthier? Or do we want to use space exploration to benefit all of the  American people and improve life here on the planet for everyone?   It is time that we had a serious debate on the future of NASA,  instead of just handing out $10 billion to Mr. Bezos.   Let me conclude by saying that I happen to believe and support space  exploration. I think the benefits could be extraordinary for the  American people and for people all over the world. But if we continue  down the path of privatizing space exploration, it also has the  potential to make the obscenely rich even richer and more powerful than  anyone can possibly imagine today. In my view, we cannot and must not  allow that to happen.   I yield the floor.
