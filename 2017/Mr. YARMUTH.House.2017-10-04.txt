 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget we are debating here today is a  shockingly extreme document that gives to the rich and takes from  everyone else. It calls for more than $5 trillion in spending cuts that  threaten our economic progress and our national security, and it  willfully ignores the needs and priorities of the American people.   This budget isn't about conservative policy or reducing the size of  our debt and deficits. It is not even about American families. This  budget is about one thing: using budget reconciliation to ram through  giant tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations and to do it  without bipartisan support.                                time  1415    This budget and the tax cuts it exists to support are built on a  foundation of lies. They are part of a dangerous and deceptive three- step process Republicans have used before with serious consequences for  our Nation and the American people.   This is what they do. First, my Republican colleagues call for  massive tax cuts for the rich, claiming they will generate so much  economic growth, that they will pay for themselves. Last week,  congressional Republicans announced a $2.4 trillion tax cut plan that  benefits the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Yes, I said  trillions with a T.   For example, under this tax plan, millions of families making $50,000  a year would be subject to a tax increase, while millionaires get a  $230,000 average tax cut. That is not tax reform. That is a shakedown.   In total, individuals will see their taxes go up by more than $450  billion, while corporations, wealthy pass-through entities, and rich  estates get a tax cut totaling $2.9 trillion.   One might justifiably ask why anyone would want to do that. After  all, the income disparity in the United States is greater than almost  every other country on Earth, and it is getting larger. Just a few  decades ago, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned about one- fourth of all national income. Today, it is close to 40 percent. Yet,  once this plan is fully phased in, 80 percent of the entire tax cut in  this plan goes to just the top 1 percent, while 45 percent of all  households with children see a tax increase.   You could be someone who gets a $1 million salary, owns billions in  corporate stock, be a partner in a hedge fund, or just the heir to a  massive fortune, no matter the type of millionaire you are, Republicans  make sure you will get a tax cut. No matter how many times President  Trump, Secretary Mnuchin, or my colleagues across the aisle say it and  how much they hope the American people will fall for it, these tax cuts  won't pay for themselves.   That is not just my argument. That is the conclusion of the Federal  Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, and respected economists of  all stripes.   Conservative economist and former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin  said: ``There is just no evidence that the tax cuts actually pay for  themselves.''   Even Goldman Sachs, Secretary Mnuchin's former employer, says any  growth will be minimal, maybe up to two-tenths of a percent.   Bruce Bartlett, the man who wrote Reaganomics, which codified the  trickle-down theory, told Congress last week that he now thinks it is:  ``bull.'' Well, that is half of the word he used, but you get the idea.   The historical record is clear. We went through this in the early  1980s, the early 2000s under George W. Bush, and we recently saw it  play out to disastrous effect in Kansas. Now congressional Republicans  want to try it again.   We all know the truth. The tax cuts in this plan will increase  deficits and debt by approximately $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years  alone and trillions more in the years after. These aren't special,  supernatural tax cuts. They aren't going to magically defy expert  analysis, historical precedence, and empirical evidence. This budget  will  [[Page H7779]]  blow enormous holes in the Federal budget, which brings me to the  second part of the Republican deception.   When the growth fails to happen as promised and these tax cuts keep  digging our economy down deeper and deeper, Republicans will again  bemoan the horrors of deficits and debt.   These cries will lead us to the third and final part of the plan.  They will call for congressional action, not to roll back the tax cuts  to the wealthy that caused all the damage, but for drastic cuts to  important programs that the American people need and support.  Education, healthcare, research, infrastructure, and veterans' benefits  are already threatened in this budget. It includes an astonishing $5.4  trillion in spending cuts; $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid  alone. It even assumes $49 billion in cuts to veterans' benefits.   The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for  American families cannot be overstated, but more cuts will be coming if  my Republicans get their way with this budget. We will see more attacks  on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance, on  important benefits and services that help American families get ahead,  and on key investments that keep our economy and our Nation strong.   To be clear, and with all due respect to my friend and colleague from  Tennessee, by voting on this budget, for this budget, they are  jeopardizing meals and food assistance for 515,000 hungry children in  Tennessee so that the wealthiest person in that State, who has a net  worth of $8.8 billion, can get a massive tax cut.   Democrats have a different budget and a far different vision for our  country. Our priorities reflect the priorities of the American people.   We invest in programs that will grow our economy, create good-paying  jobs, and provide real support for working families; public investments  that lead to a brighter future, such as rebuilding roads, bridges, and  other vital infrastructure; retirement security for seniors now and for  millions of Americans who fear they will never be able to afford to  stop working; affordable education so that young people will be able to  compete for the careers of the future; affordable, quality childcare  for hardworking parents; and affordable quality healthcare for all  Americans.   We believe in a government that helps individuals with nowhere left  to turn and a Tax Code that helps families get ahead. Those are  American priorities, and they should be the priorities of this  Congress.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this budget and support  the Democratic alternative.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, we have had numerous letters submitted to us taking a  position in opposition to this budget resolution, and I think they are  pretty compelling, and I would like to read from some of them.   Here is a letter from the Main Street Alliance:         Main Street Alliance, a network of small business owners       throughout the country, strongly urges you to oppose H. Con.       Res. 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. This budget,       if enacted into law, would cut $3.4 trillion from Medicaid,       Medicare, Social Security, education, employment and       training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure       spending over the next 10 years. This will significantly harm       small business owners and their employees, damage local       economies, and decimate State budgets.        We urge you to protect Main Street small business owners,       working families, communities, and economies, and oppose the       House budget resolution. Reject any budget that enables tax       cuts for the very wealthy and large profitable corporations       to lose revenue, since it will force deep cuts in vital       programs that harm small business.    This letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security  and Medicare:         On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,       I urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the House fiscal year       2018 budget resolution, and the Republican Study Committee       budget. Instead, I ask you to support the Democratic Caucus,       Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Congressional Black       Caucus budgets.        The committee-passed budget resolution would slash funding       to Medicare and Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and       make it easier for Congress to cut Social Security, all to       pay for massive tax cuts for the very wealthy and profitable       corporations.    This from the American Public Health Association:         On behalf of the American Public Health Association, a       diverse community of public health professionals who champion       the health of all people and communities, I write in strong       opposition to the House FY 2018 budget resolution, H. Con.       Res. 71. This proposal does not eliminate sequestration and       would drastically cut nondefense discretionary spending. Such       cuts would devastate our Nation's public health and safety       net system and would have a disproportionate impact on our       Nation's most vulnerable citizens.        The proposal also includes the House passed repeal of the       Affordable Care Act that would force millions to lose       coverage, end the Medicaid expansion, drastically reduce       Federal funding for the Medicaid program, and lead to       increased cost and fewer benefits for millions of Americans.    This letter from the AFSCME, American Federation of State and County  Municipal Employees:         On behalf of the 1.6 million members of AFSCME, I urge you       to oppose H. Con. Res. 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget       resolution approved by the House Budget Committee and       scheduled to be considered in the full House.        This budget would impose considerable hardship on many       Americans in order to slash taxes for the wealthy and       corporations to boost defense spending. Rather than       increasing revenues for investment that creates jobs and       spurs economic growth, the proposed budget creates a fast-      track process for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit       corporations and the wealthy.        In fact, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center,       the Trump GOP tax cut would largely benefit the richest 1       percent. The budget also relies on the gimmicks of dynamic       scoring and sham accounting, hiding the true cost of       unnecessary and harmful tax cuts.    And this, from AARP:         Proposals creating a defined contribution premium support       program, restricting access by raising the age of       eligibility, or allowing hospitals and providers to       arbitrarily charge customers higher prices than Medicare can       make healthcare unaffordable for older Americans. These       proposals do little to actually lower the cost of healthcare       but simply shifts cost from Medicare on to individuals, many       of whom cannot afford to pay for their care.        Efforts to reduce or cap Medicaid funding could endanger       the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who       depend on the essential services provided through this       program.        Furthermore, caps could result in significant cost shifts       to State governments unable to shoulder the cost of care       without sufficient Federal support.        Proposals to block grant the program or impose work       requirements will make SNAP less responsive and accessible in       times of need, and without clear work requirement exemptions       for the elderly and disabled, would bar these individuals       from receiving SNAP benefits.        We ask you to reject the cuts proposed in H. Con. Res. 71.       We stand ready to work with you to develop proposals that       protect and improve Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and       SNAP.    This from the Alliance for Retired Americans:         On behalf of the more than 4.3 million members of the       Alliance for Retired Americans, I am writing to urge you to       vote against H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY       2018. This budget blueprint cuts spending by $5.4 trillion       over 10 years, disseminating numerous domestic programs,       including those that benefit older Americans.        It is shocking that the same budget that cuts services for       many low-income Americans and raises taxes on the middle       class will  [[Page H7802]]       also carry instructions to provide $2.4 trillion in tax cuts       to corporations and wealthy Americans.        These tax cuts, which will increase the deficit, sets up       the perfect scenario for Congress to slash Medicare and       Medicaid. We are not fooled by the House leadership's tax       giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Americans       and urge you to oppose this draconian budget. We will be       watching how you vote on this important issue.    This is a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs:         On behalf of the Coalition on Human Needs, I strongly urge       you to vote ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 71, the proposed FY 2018       budget resolution, and to vote for the substitute budgets       advanced by the Congressional Progressive Caucus,       Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic alternative       budget resolution. Our members understand that the economic       security of millions of American families depends on building       on the progress we have made in health coverage, jobs, basic       living standards, and ensuring that our children are well       prepared for productive lives.        But the majority's proposed budget does not build. It       breaks apart our engines of progress. It will make our Nation       weaker for decades to come.        The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be       a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars       from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security       and opportunity.        Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax credits, nutrition       assistance, education, and housing assistance, these are just       some of the services the budget would massively cut.        The budget takes trillions in funding that supports       economic security and progress and hands it to the wealthy       and corporations in the form of enormous tax cuts.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this has been a robust debate. We had a robust debate  in the Rules Committee yesterday, and we have had robust debates in the  committee markup and during hearings, as well, over the priorities of  this country.   As we close this debate tonight, recognizing there will be a few  minutes tomorrow for comments, I just want to say that, since this  could very well be the last time that I get to appear in Budget  Committee business with Chairman Black, I have truly cherished the 9  months that we have spent working together.   The chairman is a gracious, fair, thoughtful, and very, very  collegial individual, and I wish her the best in her campaign, at least  through the primary. I thank her and her very, very competent and  professional staff for all of the courtesies they have shown us during  this year and this process.   I also want to pay tribute to the Democratic staff, people who work  very, very hard every day and are brilliant in their fields and make me  sound smarter than I probably am, but I would like to read their names:  Jon Antista; Erika Appel; Ellen Balis, the staff director; Hayden  Flanery; Jon Goldman; Elliott Grantz; Jocelyn Harris; Najy Kamal; Sam  Lau; Sheila McDowell; Diana Meredith; Farouk Ophaso; Kimberly Overbeek;  Scott Russell; and Ted Zegers.   They do terrific work, and I want them to know how much I and all the  members of the Budget Committee, the minority, appreciate their work.   I would also like to thank my personal staff, led by my chief of  staff, Julie Carr, for the work they contribute to this process as  well.   In closing, there are a few comments I want to make about this  debate.   We heard several times during the day that it is really not fair to  talk about the consequences of the tax proposal that will be the end  result of this process because the details haven't been ironed out yet.  That is, you know, fair enough as it goes, but there were enough  details in the outline that we saw last week to make a pretty good  guess as to what the impact of these tax cuts would be.   Now, we have read over and over, as Republican speakers spoke, the  fact that they were willing to jeopardize the health and safety and  nutrition of their citizens to give the wealthiest people in their  State tax cuts. Most of these numbers that we read were in the billions  of dollars: $38 billion, $16 billion. These are individuals with net  worths of astounding amounts.   The outline that was publicly released last week said that the  Republicans intend, under this tax proposal, to eliminate the estate  tax. If they eliminate the estate tax, much of that money is not going  to be taxed. They will get to keep it. I don't think that they are  going to be out there creating new companies. Maybe their children will  do it if they inherit it. Maybe they have given some of it away so  those estates aren't quite as big. I suspect many of them have.   The point is, when you are talking about wealth, collectively, the  wealthiest persons in the 50 States, collectively, have $750 billion in  net worth, which means that, if they paid the estate tax, there would  be over $300 billion in money that they would save if you eliminated  the estate tax.   So while, yes, we may be off plus or minus 3 percent or 5 percent or  10 percent, the fact is that this is an enormous break for the people  who have been the most fortunate in this country. I think it is more  than fair to say, if you say you are going to eliminate the estate tax,  if you say you are going to eliminate the AMT, the alternative minimum  tax, and we can go look at President Trump's 2005 tax return, which  said he paid $31 million in tax because of the alternative minimum tax,  it doesn't take any details to know that he would have saved $31  million in that year if you eliminate the alternative minimum tax.   So, yes, the rates may vary. Ultimately, the tax bill that we have  presented to us may not lower the highest rate from 39.6 to 35 percent,  but if it does, we know the impact that that will have. We know who  will benefit most from that. It is the wealthiest 1 percent of this  country.    As I will say tomorrow when we close this debate, I am in the top 1  percent. Half of this body are millionaires. They are all going to  benefit. We are all going to benefit. Meanwhile, the people who rely on  many of the programs that will be slashed under this Republican budget  will suffer. That is not fair.   Now, Republicans will make the argument, as they always do because  this is a matter of religious faith to them, that if you give people  more money, they will magically create all this growth. Well, has that  really happened?   Out of the Fortune 500 companies, I think, in a recent study, 92 of  them paid 20 percent or less in corporate tax. Collectively, they  eliminated 300,000 jobs over a 5-year period. So they had more money  than corporations paying 35 percent. Did they use it to create more  jobs, more wealth among middle class and working families? No. They  used it to pay dividends, to buy back stock, and to increase the wages  of their CEOs.   That is what has happened in modern history every time we lower  corporate tax rates or we let them bring taxes in from overseas. They  do not create more jobs with the money that they save.   So I think it is very, very fair for us to look at this entire  process, the budget proposal, which does anticipate a tax cut--which  they claim is revenue neutral, but it is a tax cut--and the outline  that we saw last week and say: Who, really, is this going to help?   It is not going to help the people who need the help. It is going to  give more money to the people who already occupy one of the strongest  economic positions in a country with the greatest disparity of wealth  in the world.   So as we conclude this debate, I urge my colleagues to carefully  consider the alternatives that will be proposed by the Democratic  Caucus, by the Congressional Black Caucus, and by the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, and compare the values and the priorities of those  budgets to those that the Republican budget represents.   I think, on balance, anybody in good faith will say that those  budgets, not the Republican budgets, are the budgets that will create a  stronger, fairer society in this country, and those are the ones that  we should proceed to adopt.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1800
