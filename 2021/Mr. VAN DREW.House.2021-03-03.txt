 Madam Speaker, I am not so sure about that, but I thank  the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1.   We were warned for years about the rise of socialism. Well, here it  is, served on a platter, using your money to pay for politicians  campaigns.   Do you like those robocalls during campaign season?   How about the negative TV ads and the mailers?   Or how about all of the political stuff that just comes out?   Well, your tax dollars are paying for them. And, yes, this is  taxpayer dollars, no matter how they tell you otherwise.   Madam Speaker, this bill puts Washington, D.C., in charge of our  States' elections and how those elections are run. It would keep the  status quo, like we saw this past November, with voter rolls that are  not up to date and live ballots being mailed to voters who have died,  moved, or even multiple ballots to the same voter.   Madam Speaker, elections do have consequences. And when leaders said  the goal was to change America, they were telling the truth; and here  we are.
