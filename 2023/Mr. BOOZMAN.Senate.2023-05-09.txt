 Mr. President, I would like to take this  opportunity to recognize and congratulate CSM Steven Veazey on his  upcoming retirement from the Arkansas Army National Guard after 44  years of distinguished military service to our great Nation.   CSM Veazey had an exceptional career in the Arkansas National Guard.  For the past 12 years, he has served as the senior enlisted adviser to  the adjutant general and Arkansas Governor on all issues regarding the  welfare, readiness, morale and proper utilization and progress of the  Arkansas enlisted force.   After enlisting in the Army in 1979, CSM Veazey would go on to serve  in various duties and leadership roles as an infantryman. He deployed  in support of the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and twice in  support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As the senior enlisted leader of  the Joint Forces of the Arkansas National Guard, his integrity,  character and transparent leadership built an enduring trust with the  8,000 enlisted members under his command. His passion for building a  trained, ready, and resilient force will have lasting positive impacts  on the Arkansas National Guard, the servicemembers, and their families.   As the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee responsible  for ensuring our Armed Forces and their families have the  infrastructure and facilities to support their needs, I met with CSM  Veazey as he encouraged congressional support to strengthen National  Guard priorities and military readiness. Arkansas can be proud of his  advocacy and leadership that integrally contributed to the U.S. ability  to maintain our military superiority.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate and a grateful nation, I extend my  deepest appreciation to CSM Veazey and his family for their many years  of exemplary military service and sacrifice. I wish him nothing but the  very best in the future.                            ____________________
