 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to speak about the epidemic  of gun violence that continues to plague our country. In fact, gun  violence is now the leading cause of death for children.   As a pediatrician, I understand that we have to look at this as a  public health crisis and work on multiple levels to keep our children  and communities safe from gun violence.   I am focused on pragmatic solutions and proud that both parties came  together last Congress to take some commonsense steps to keep guns away  from people who are likely to pose a danger and to address the mental  health crisis in this country that has led to higher rates of firearm  suicide.   There is more to do, and I invite my Republican colleagues to join us  to enhance background checks and close loopholes that allow some people  to buy guns without a background check, to increase funding for  research so that we can make evidence-based decisions in our  legislation, and to incentivize safe storage because children should  not have access to their parents' weapons.   There are areas where we worked together last Congress, and we can do  more.   Not a single Republican Member of Congress lost their race last year  because they voted for commonsense safe gun ownership laws. We can do  more to protect children and communities, and we should do it together.                            ____________________
