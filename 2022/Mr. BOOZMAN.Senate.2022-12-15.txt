 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the  Huneycutt family for earning the distinction of Arkansas Farm Family of  the year.   This honor reflects the dedication of brothers Ted and Steve  Huneycutt to farming and the important role they play in Arkansas' No.  1 industry. Ted and his wife Cindy have four children: Sara, Trey,  Luke, and Greyson. Steve and his wife Leanne also have four children:  Josh, Jessica, Ashley, and Logan. The family has been farming in Clark  County since 1882.   On their 4,000-acre farm, the Huneycutts raise cattle and grow  cotton, wheat, corn, soybeans, and hay. They also operate the Barn at  Richwoods and Benchmark Ag, a risk management service providing  producers with cash sale recommendations along with commodity futures,  options and crop insurance. The Huneycutts are in the process of  launching Ouachita Valley Meat Company, which will provide producers  the products and processing capabilities to sell their own products.   The family is committed not only to farming and producing safe  supplies of food and fiber to the world, but also to serving their  community by lending their time and skills to numerous boards and  committees.   The Arkansas Farm Bureau's program honors farm families across the  State for their outstanding work on their farms and their positive  impact and work on behalf of their neighbors. This recognition is a  reflection of their contributions to agriculture at the local and State  level and its implications for improved farm practices and management.  The Huneycutts are well-deserving of this honor, and I wish them luck  as they compete in the Sunbelt Expo Southeastern Farmer of the Year  program next year.   I congratulate Ted, Steve, Cindy, Leanne, and their children on their  exceptional achievements in agriculture and ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring them for this accomplishment. I wish them continued  success in their future endeavors and look forward to the contributions  they will continue to offer Arkansas farming and agriculture.                            ____________________
