 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, Senate Democrats celebrated  the anniversary of their reckless taxing-and-spending spree. As the  Democratic leader put it, ``this legislation is paying huge  dividends.'' Well, he is right about that, but the windfalls from the  deluge of liberal spending are headed all in the wrong directions.   Last year, Senate Republicans warned anyone who would listen about  the dangers of our colleagues' plan. We explained how green slush funds  dreamed up by leftwing activists wouldn't bring on the American  industrial renaissance that Democrats were claiming it would, how half- baked climate schemes that relied on Chinese components and raw  materials would give American workers and job creators the short end of  the stick, and how crucial industries would face even heavier reliance  on foreign supply chains.   But Washington Democrats paid these warnings no mind. They rammed  through their radical spending on a party-line basis. Afterward, the  senior Senator from West Virginia boasted that he ``did it to help  America.'' The senior Senator from Montana said he ``look(s) forward to  seeing the benefits of that bill.'' And President Biden summed up their  action by saying:         We are going to invest in America again. . . . That's been       my economic vision.    Well, it is now crystal clear. Either Democrats didn't know what  their own bill was actually designed to do or they knew exactly what it  would do and decided to sell out American workers and job creators.   Here is the inconvenient--and dangerous--truth. Of the $110 billion  this scheme has spent on green projects so far, foreign companies are  involved in over 60 percent of it. In fact, foreign entities have their  hand in 15 of the 20 biggest projects receiving money from the bill,  and a full $8 billion is benefiting companies either based in or with  significant ties to the People's Republic of China--over $100 billion  in leftwing spending, and the majority has some tie to foreign  countries, including America's biggest strategic adversary.   So our Democrat colleagues sold their reckless spending spree as a  ``Made in America'' investment, but the only thing it appears to be  making in America is a mess.                                   S. 2226    Now, on another matter, Mr. President, almost 2 years ago, the United  States took an important step toward deeper cooperation with two of our  closest friends: Australia and the United Kingdom.   The AUKUS agreement promises to equip our Australian allies with  cutting-edge U.S. attack submarines to help deter aggression in the  Indo-Pacific and clear the way for closer collaboration between all  three nations on advanced defense technologies.   Like Ranking Member Wicker, Vice Chair Collins, and many other  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been supportive of this  important effort. Outcompeting China is going to take a coalition of  committed allies and partners. Senate Republicans want AUKUS to be more  than just a talking point or a one-time summit deliverable. We want it  to be an enduring contribution to our collective security and a major  expansion of defense cooperation with our closest allies.   But standing in the way of the historic opportunity--AUKUS--is the  same persistent roadblock holding back our other efforts in military  modernization. President Biden's defense budget request grossly-- grossly--underestimates what is required to meet the challenges his own  national defense strategy identifies.   If we are serious about deterring conflict in the Indo-Pacific, we  must address America's aging attack submarine fleet.   Senior military leaders say they need 66 attack submarines to carry  out necessary missions, but the Navy currently has 49. Right now, our  defense industrial base produces 1.2 new submarines a year, but the  Department of Defense will need to double production capacity just to  avoid further reductions in the fleet.   Our allies' significant investments in shipbuilding are welcome steps  that will improve our mutual security, but if the United States doesn't  increase our own shipbuilding capacity and production rate, we will  both fall behind, as China erodes our key advantage in the undersea  domain. As Ranking Member Wicker has pointed out, that means funding  for more attack submarines and concrete investments in the production  lines that will help us meet our goals.   If the administration is serious about making AUKUS a success, it  should work with Congress this fall to make urgent supplemental  investments in meeting military requirements in the Indo-Pacific.  Importantly, the administration should also prioritize removing  barriers in the technology transfer process that prevent more effective  long-term cooperation with our closest allies.   The reforms laid out in Pillar Two of AUKUS are essential not just  for putting more cutting-edge U.S. technology in the Indo-Pacific but  also for tapping into our allies' own technical advances and industrial  bases.   If we are serious about building secure, high-tech supply chains, we  should go further to shore up this critical pillar of AUKUS and lower  barriers to cooperation with our closest allies. As I have said before,  for the purposes of defense technology cooperation, we should treat  Australia and the United Kingdom like we treat Canada.   So, today, I joined Ranking Member Wicker, Vice Chair Collins, and  several of our colleagues in making the  [[Page S3716]]  case to President Biden. I hope and expect that the administration will  recognize the need to invest further in our capacity to counter growing  threats in the Indo-Pacific. And for our part, I expect the Senate to  continue our work to provide for the common defense in earnest.    Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the  remarks of the majority leader. Everybody on this side of the aisle  feels exactly the same way.                                   S. 2226    I also want to offer my congratulations to those deeply involved in  passing this important NDAA. We kept our record. This is the 63rd year,  I guess, and a good way to wrap up this session. This is really  important for our country.    Mr. President, in 2018, we reestablished the Senate  NATO Observer Group. I ask for the following Republican Senators to  participate in the group: Tillis, cochair; Barrasso, Ernst, Rounds,  Hagerty, Moran, and Scott of South Carolina.                            ____________________
