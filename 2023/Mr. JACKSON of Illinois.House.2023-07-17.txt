 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and a privilege  to share the podium today with my esteemed colleague, Sheila Cherfilus- McCormick, as we embark on this significant CBC Special Order hour, an  hour that has come. We are going to dive deep into understanding how  terms like colored people have shaped our racial conversation and  histories. This isn't just an exploration of the past, it is about how  we forge our future. We will be tackling the importance of diversity,  equity, and inclusion.   Mr. Speaker, across every field and sector, we are seeing a retreat  on this promise, and we are going to stress why it is so vital that our  education system is inclusive, recognizing and celebrating our racial  diversity, rather than suppressing it. We see a future where  understanding our collective past enables us to shape a more equitable  society.    Remember, this conversation isn't just about us or Congress. It is a  conversation for every single American because together we can make a  difference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from the great  State of New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable   Donald  Payne, Jr. from the great State of New Jersey for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Nevada  (Mr. Horsford), who is the honorable chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable chairman  of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman   Steven Horsford, from  the great State of Nevada.   It is now my privilege to yield to the Honorable Congresswoman Joyce  Beatty from the great State of Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman Robin Kelly from Illinois for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my coanchor,  Representative Jonathan Jackson from the great State of Illinois.   Last week, a colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle  referred to Black servicemembers as ``colored people'' on the very  floor we stand on today.   I, like many of my esteemed Congressional Black Caucus colleagues,  could not believe what I was hearing. As a person of color, it was  jarring. Not only was the Congressman's comment beneath the office he  was elected to serve, but it was a stinging reminder that racism is  very much alive in today's day and age. We see it everywhere, from the  highways we drive on to the neighborhoods plagued with disinvestment.  As we have learned, we can see it even here on the congressional floor  and in the Halls of Congress. Despite the progress we have made as a  nation, a dark cloud of racism looms directly over our heads. We hear  about it and see it every single day.   Unfortunately, Congressman Crane is not alone. Republican Senator  Tuberville has struggled to denounce white nationalism.    Let me be clear. The term ``colored people'' is a racist and  antiquated term and is simply beyond the pale. In no place should it be  tolerated and certainly not on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives.   It was Maya Angelou who once said, ``When someone shows you who they  are, believe them the first time.''   Last week, Congressman Crane showed the Republican Party's true  colors and their agenda. It is plain as day to see that their roots and  what they are trying to push us back to is a day and age when racism  and white supremacy actually led the way.   Their attacks on DEI are astonishing and are an attempt to roll us  back to the dark and gloomy days of the United States when we did not  embrace and see each other as equals.   As we stand here today, not only should these words be stricken, but  every Member of this body should stand in alliance with the  Congressional Black Caucus to denounce these terms and vow to never  return back to the day and age where we saw Black people or colored  people as less then.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick from the great State of Florida for her remarks.  [[Page H3636]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from the great State of Texas for her  comments.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove from the great State of California  for her remarks.   I would like to take a point of privilege and speak to the Record.  Mr. Speaker, may I make an inquiry about the time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heart  burdened by the weight of history and a spirit ignited by the promise  of the future. We gather here in these hallowed halls of power, where  words bear the weight of action, and action shapes the destiny of our  Nation.   But the words uttered by our fellow Congressman--and I have waited  for a sufficient response for him to apologize to the Honorable  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty and to other Members that seek truth and  justice--but he has remained silent, and he says he has misspoken.   Misspoken means to also not have been made clear, so if he could  clarify his remarks on who is a colored person--as the grandson of two  soldiers that fought in U.S. wars, I would like to know what he was  speaking about for colored.   When my grandparents could not go on the first-class car after  returning from Europe, at the Union Station had to go sit in the  second-class car for colored people, behind Nazi POWs that were allowed  to go in the first-class car, we are trying to overcome a horrid racial  past.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you  a little history. When we hear, as African Americans, our brothers and  sisters referred to as colored people in the year of 2023, it doesn't  just make us uncomfortable, it transports us back through centuries of  struggle, resilience, and a pursuit of justice often denied.   I stand here before you today, not just as a Member of Congress, but  a freedom fighter. Our fight as Americans started before the country  was even born. It has been over 400 years when the first persons that  were imported from Africa had been enslaved.   Nearly two centuries after, in 1787, our Nation held a Constitutional  Convention. It was there that the infamous Three-Fifths Compromise was  struck. Three out of five Americans that had been enslaved were counted  as representation for taxation, not for votes. The humanity of a person  was whittled down to a fraction.   Can you imagine the audacity, the horror?   Just 2 years later, in 1789, we stand witness to a profound paradox  that happened; the same 1789 that gave birth to this illustrious  institution, the United States of House Representatives, founded in  1789.    On the one hand, we celebrate the inauguration of our first  President, President George Washington--his picture stands proudly in  this Chamber--a milestone in our Nation's narrative.   Yet, let us not overlook the uncomfortable truth that this esteemed  leader was himself a holder of Americans enslaved; a chilling reminder  that our Nation's foundation was laid with the sweat and blood of those  in chains.   In the years that followed, from 1740 to 1834, Southern slave States  employed another insidious tool to maintain the oppressive status quo,  the anti-literacy laws. I have not been able to find any other nation  that had instituted or enacted anti-literacy laws.  [[Page H3638]]    Imagine a system so threatened by the enlightenment of its subjugated  people that they made it illegal for the enslaved and free people of  color to learn to read and write.   In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was enacted, transforming ordinary  citizens into accomplices for the slavery system. A free territory was  no longer a sanctuary. It could transform into a hunting ground for  those seeking freedom. Aiding the enslaved, a profound act of humanity  was suddenly a criminal act punishable by fine and imprisonment.   This Act didn't just target the enslaved. It cast its nefarious  shadow over the entire Nation, implicating all in the perpetration of  this abhorrent institution.   In the wake of this Act, 7 years later, in 1857, the Supreme Court  reached a decision in the Dred Scott case that shook the very  foundation of freedom and human dignity.   The Court ruled that all Black people, regardless of their status as  free or enslaved, were not and could never become citizens of the  United States. This wasn't just a judicial ruling; it was a  heartrending affirmation of the racial prejudice deeply rooted in our  society, a prejudice that permeated even our Nation's highest courts.   In the year 1863, we saw a light, the Emancipation Proclamation.  Freedom--after 246 years, freedom, it seemed, was finally within our  grasp. A bloody Civil War, fought over the right to keep human beings  in bondage, ended 2 years later, our Nation's deadliest war, and we  dared to dream of a new dawn for our people.   Yet, as the sun of liberation rose, the shadows of oppression  heightened. In a bitter twist of irony, freedom unveiled a new face of  subjugation. The Black Codes of 1865 were enacted.   Though the iron chains of slavery had been shattered, this new set of  manacles were fastened around us, chains woven with legal threads and  tightened by the grip of racial bias. They were not as visible as the  shackles of old, but they were no less oppressive, no less real.   A century later, in 1963, at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial, the  Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., gave voice to the bitter truth: ``One  hundred years later, the colored American is still not free.''   A hundred years after emancipation, the struggle was far from over.  We had been unshackled, yet we remained bound by the chains of systemic  discrimination, segregation, and marginalization.   The term ``Jim Crow law'' surfaced in 1892. Just 4 years later, there  was Plessy v. Ferguson. The verdict cemented the doctrine of ``separate  but equal,'' which inherently meant being unequal.   Despite these oppressive circumstances, our ancestors fought with  courage and determination. They fought for the Civil Rights Act in  1866, and fought in 1964, 1965, and 1966.   Our ancestors fought for the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery. Our  ancestors fought for the 14th Amendment to have equal protection under  the law and guaranteeing citizenship. They fought for the 15th  Amendment so that we could have the right to vote for African-American  men.   These victories did not come easy. They were bought with blood,  sweat, and tears of our forebears.   Today, we find ourselves in 2023, but the echoes of our past are  loud. Our colleague, Mr. Crane, has evoked the ghost of a very painful  past by addressing us in this Chamber as colored people.                                time  2045    We have served in every war, Mr. Crane. It is a term as archaic as  the prejudices it represents.   In doing so, he blurs the line between past and present, reminding us  of an era we have struggled to move beyond. His words are not just a  singular lapse in judgment but a symptom of a much larger disease--a  disease that seeped into the highest courts of our land, where the 14th  Amendment--the very symbol of our freedom--has been twisted into a  weapon against affirmative action.   This very amendment, a cornerstone of liberty and equality, has been  misused to dismantle a policy intended to level the playing field that  has been historically skewed against African Americans.   Our attention is then drawn to the targets of this regressive  decision: Harvard University, founded in 1636, and the University of  North Carolina founded in 1789. The Supreme Court in 2023, cited the  14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, in the name of Make America Great  Again.   Now, we have our colleague (Mr. Crane) using the words ``colored,''  the words that my mother and father had to see growing up in South  Carolina and Florida and Virginia for colored water fountains, colored  schools.   Can we please move forward? Can we please demand an apology to this  great body of distinguished men and women from Mr. Crane?   I ask: Is it truly a coincidence that these specific institutions  have been targeted as the battlegrounds for the dismantling of  affirmative action, or is it an insidious reminder of our painful  history, a pointed jab at the very heart of our struggle for equality  and access in opportunity?   The African American community has been in bondage longer than we  have ever been free. Our exclusion has lasted longer than our  inclusion. Even half a century after the Civil Rights Act of 1965, we  ask ourselves: Are we truly free to meritocratically grow?   This timeline, this history is a testament to our resilience. It is a  reminder of our past, a measure of our progress, and a marker of the  journey ahead. We stand on the shoulders of those who have come before  us, those who have struggled, and those who have sacrificed. We owe it  to them and to ourselves to keep the flame of justice burning bright.   This journey has been long, and it is not over, but we will not  falter, we will not tire, we will not rest until we can unequivocally  say that we are free--until justice is not just a word in our Pledge of  Allegiance but a reality in our lives.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 48 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, July 18, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
