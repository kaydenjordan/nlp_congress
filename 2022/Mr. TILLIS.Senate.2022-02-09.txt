 Madam President, I want to start by thanking my friend  from the great State of New Hampshire for signing on to a letter I just  want to briefly describe and send the letter to the desk.   I send a letter to the desk which has been signed by seven Members of  this body, and we expect several more to be added over the next day, if  not this evening.   Ladies and gentlemen, it is pretty simple. I was thinking that my mom  is one of the few people who probably watches C-SPAN a lot when her son  is on the floor. We have so many instances where we have 90 or so  Members standing on the floor, looking at a door to the left or the  right or the rear, wondering where that last Senator is who is holding  the vote open.   So, Mom, when I am on the floor and looking that way, it is because  we have a Member who may be coming to vote or maybe not.   What we have here is a situation where any one Member is able to hold  the vote open. Out of respect for that Member--technically, the vote  could be called after the time is called, but it is not out of respect  for our Members.   So what I have simply done is circulate with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle and say: How about this as a proposition: If you are  the last Member to vote and your vote will not change the outcome, then  instruct the desk and the Presiding Officer to simply call the vote.   We had nearly 80 Members already agree that is a reasonable  proposition, and every one of those Members has an opportunity on an  exception basis to say: No, this vote is important to me; you have to  hold it open.   They could be caught in traffic. They could be coming from the  airport--any number of valid reasons.   There was a vote on this this afternoon, and the reason I missed that  vote was I am a ranking member of a subcommittee, and the witnesses  were just about to testify. I could have held the vote open or I could  have been rude to the witnesses and left when they prepared the  testimony. I felt like it was more important to hear their testimony.  That vote, by the way, passed by a huge margin. That is an example  where I am perfectly happy to show respect to my colleagues, not hold  the vote open, and move on.   Tonight, we are going to have several votes stacked up, and  invariably, we may have someone come in--I don't think it is malicious,  but they are unintentionally holding up the proceedings of this body. I  think if we simply have them, their scheduler, their chief of staff, or  anyone in their office simply say ``The boss has to vote on this  bill,'' then they could call the cloakroom, and the vote could be held  open, which is a tradition here.   I want to thank Senator Shaheen, the Presiding Officer. I want to  thank the 77 people who have signed on to this letter just to show that  we want to do the work of the people, we want to do it in a timely  manner, and we want  [[Page S599]]  to show the utmost respect to the Members and to the staff who are also  held up for sometimes no good reason.   So this is a good step forward. It is a baby step. It is not a sea  change. But I think we can change the behavior of the Senate by being  mindful of how our actions can affect the proceedings on the floor and  every one of our calendars.   So, again, Madam President, I send that letter to the desk. I have  shared a copy of the letter with both cloakrooms. I will be sending a  letter to Senator Schumer, who I understand will gladly accept it.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, February 2, 2022.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       As you know, despite our collective efforts to encourage       Members to vote on the Senate floor in a timely manner, votes       are often left open well beyond the allotted time,       frustrating a majority of Members from both sides of the       aisle. Often, the outcome of the vote is not in doubt.        With this in mind and in order to expedite floor votes, we       are instructing the Presiding Officer to close any vote in       which: (a) one of the signatories below is the last remaining       vote; and (b) the Member's vote would not change the outcome.       However, on any particular vote, if a signatory requests that       the vote be held open, they may do so by providing notice to       their Cloakroom.            Sincerely,          Thom Tillis, Angus S. King, Jr., Christopher A. Coons,             Roy Blunt, Shelley Moore Capito, Patrick J. Leahy,             Kyrsten Sinema, Jon Tester, Ron Johnson, Amy Klobuchar,             Jon Ossoff, John Barrasso, Patty Murray, Sheldon             Whitehouse, Rick Scott.          Mark R.

I look forward to seeing it  work in action.   I yield the floor.
