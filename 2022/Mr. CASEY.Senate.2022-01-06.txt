 Mr. President, I rise, as so many of us have done, on this  day to do a couple of things--No. 1, to reflect and remember. That is  important for so many reasons, but we are also here, I think, to  express gratitude and commendation for so many who work in this  building, the staff and the Capitol Police and so many others who kept  us safe 1 year ago today on that awful day.   I will get to some other issues in a moment, but I want to start with  just some reflections on what I remember about that day but also what I  think the country experienced on a day of horror and terror and  desecration--a day when a group of Americans came to this building to  stop the counting of the electoral votes, and they were told to do that  by the then-President of the United States.  [[Page S65]]    We know all the death that ensued from that, especially of law  enforcement officers; something on the order of 140 injures, some of  them grievous, permanent injuries to law enforcement--all based upon  the violence based upon a Big Lie, a deliberate falsehood that started  long before even election day. It started during the course of the 2020  election.   But despite that Big Lie--I don't want to spend all of today talking  about that--despite that Big Lie and the violence that flowed from that  Big Lie and the near collapse of our democracy, despite that, we know  that something on the order of 60 judges throughout the country-- Federal judges and State judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans  and even some appointed by the former President--called out that Big  Lie by rejecting the arguments based upon that Big Lie in about 60  different matters before those judges.   So we know what happened, and I think the January 6 Commission will  continue to put the evidence on the record and hold people accountable,  but I think on a day like today, I want to focus on two issues. One is  to express that gratitude that I mentioned before for the thousands of  Americans who work in this building, the thousands who are not Members  of Congress who helped us on that day, everything from getting us to  safety to making sandwiches for us when we were in a safe, secure  room--something that basic.   But, of course, so many Americans now know, after all these months  have unfolded, about the sacrifices made by so many on that day,  especially law enforcement, but people in this building, who work in  this building--have done so for years--they, too, were terrorized on  that day. It wasn't just Members of Congress and the Nation more  broadly.   We even had the image--the horrible, disturbing, racist image--on  television of an American walking through the halls of this building  with a Confederate flag. It never happened before. Not even during the  American Civil War had that happened.   So when we talk about those who have done so much, here is what we  are talking about: We are talking about people who suffered devastating  injuries, as I said before, some of them lifelong. The emotional toll  that this violence imposed upon members of the staff here in the  building, both during the siege and in its aftermath, is almost  incalculable. So we are grateful for their service on every day, every  day of their work, but especially on that terrible day.   I also want to thank--and we can't do this enough; we can do it a  thousand times, and it wouldn't be enough--the U.S. Capitol Police and  the Metropolitan Police Department for all they did to protect us, to  ultimately quell the violence, and to literally protect our democracy.  These officers were bruised and beaten. They were attacked with bolts  and bricks and bats and bear spray, as we saw so much, as well as stun  guns. They had broken bones. They had concussions, chemical burns,  scars, stitches, and on and on. That is what violence does to a human  being.   They were also subjected to--those who happened to be Black Americans  in law enforcement or in communities of color--they were subjected to  horrific racial epithets, the kind of language that should never be  tolerated not only here in the Capitol but anywhere in our country.  Some of them were even attacked by an American flag--by a flagpole with  an American flag on it.   So what this all adds up to is, unfortunately, not just a mob going  into a building; this is about domestic terrorism. I think it is an  important day to be thankful that so many stood up to that domestic  terrorism in law enforcement. So we both offer our gratitude and try-- as inadequate as it is by mere words--on a day like today to bestow  some measure of both gratitude and commendation for what they did on  that day.   Finally, Mr. President, I think today is a day for resolve, to be  determined to take action, legislative action. The best way we can do  that is by passing the Freedom to Vote Act. That is the best thing we  can do, not only for the next couple of weeks, but really it might be  the most important thing any of us work on.   I want to thank Senator Klobuchar and so many others who have worked  on these issues, not just in the aftermath of January 6 but for  thinking about the future--the future of our democracy, literally the  future of whether someone will have a clear pathway in the right to  vote, the ability to vote in ways that so many Americans were able to  vote in the midst of the pandemic.   There were a lot of people back in 2020 who said: Oh, you know, in  Pennsylvania, you had a big turnout for President in 2016, but that  turnout is going to go way down because it is a reelection, and there  is a pandemic, and people won't vote, and people will be afraid to  vote.   Guess what happened. We went from about 6 million votes in 2016 to  almost 6.9 million votes. Almost 900,000 more people voted in  Pennsylvania than did just 4 years earlier--probably the highest  turnout in more than 120 years in our State, just like it was for the  Nation.   Now, that didn't happen in our State just because people were more  interested; it happened because we had pathways by way of a change in  State law to allow them to vote, very similar to what we are trying to  do by enacting into law the Freedom to Vote Act--being able to vote  early, being able to vote by way of a mail-in ballot, having a drop  box.   What if you are 90 years old and you live in a rural area in  Pennsylvania? We have 48 rural counties, by the way. What if you live  in a rural area, and you can't get to the county election bureau to  drop off your mail-in ballot? Shouldn't you have a drop box if you are  90 years old and you want to vote? What if you live on a farm? What if  you are running a farm and you have a busy life or you are running a  small business? Shouldn't you have the opportunity to vote or should  you just be restricted to 1 day in the year, 1 day every year for a  general election, and if you can't get to vote that day, then you are  not able to vote? Why would we go back to those days? But apparently a  lot of people in this Chamber are supporting efforts all across the  country--hundreds of voter suppression bills.   As Reverend Warnock said, seems like some people don't want some  people to vote. I don't understand that, after we had record turnout in  Pennsylvania from 2016 to 2020 because we had different pathways for  people to vote. That is what we are trying to do with the Freedom to  Vote Act, to have national standards so people will have a chance to  vote in the way that they want, in a way that is helpful in terms of  their family life or their work life. But we are at a point now where  the Big Lie is perpetuating itself in more ways than one.   Let me conclude with one thought. My hometown newspaper, the Scranton  Times-Tribune, published an editorial today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  and as part of my remarks an editorial entitled ``Long year after 1/6/ 21, it continues,'' which is dated today.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Times-Tribune, Jan. 6, 2022]                    Long Year After 1/6/21, It Continues         It would be sobering enough today to look back on the Jan.       6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, thus on the people of the       United States and the nation's representative democracy, as a       singular event. That's impossible because the attack       continues. It carries on in statehouses like Pennsylvania's,       where lawmakers continue to question the outcome of the 2020       presidential election--the most transparent and heavily       scrutinized vote in the nation's history--craft bills to       diminish the sort of heavy turnout that carried President Joe       Biden to victory, waste public money on fraudulent searches       for fraud, and gerrymander congressional districts in the       cause of minority rule. More than 60 Republican members of       the Pennsylvania Legislatures endorsed disqualifying       Pennsylvania's electoral votes, which would have       disenfranchised 6.8 million Pennsylvania voters, on the       preposterous claim that the election law that they had passed       less than a year earlier unconstitutionally had skewed the       election.        It continues in the person of disgraced politicians, such       as Republican Reps. Dan Meuser and Fred Keller of Northeast       and Central Pennsylvania, who supported a lawsuit spawned in       Texas that aimed to disenfranchise their fellow       Pennsylvanians. Then they voted in the Congress of the United       States, after the mob attacked it, not to certify the duly       vetted Electoral College results from Pennsylvania.  [[Page S66]]         It continues in the movement to replace, with partisan       hacks, the professional election administrators who resisted       pressure in 2020 to cook local and state election results in       favor of President Donald Trump.        It continues in the shameless efforts of many Republican       members of Congress--who sensibly ran for their lives as       Trump-inspired rioters invaded the Capitol--to characterize       the Jan. 6 insurrection as anything other than what it was       and is.        Another day of infamy.        Americans who care about the future of U.S. democracy       cannot view Jan. 6, 2021, as a one-off. It is a date that       should be considered in the same sentence as other insidious       attacks--Dec. 7, 1941, and Sept. 11, 2001.        Though the Capitol insurrection was not as deadly as the       other attacks, it potentially is more serious because it came       from within. And the ongoing results are profound. There is       no doubt that it has emboldened totalitarians abroad to       challenge democratic regimes and movements. It is not       coincidental that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has       amassed troops on the Ukrainian border and that Chinese       dictator Xi Jinping crushed a democracy movement in Hong Kong       and increased menacing conduct toward Taiwan in the wake of       the insurrection.        Just as sustained action was required following the 1941       and 2001 attacks, so it is required in the wake of the 2021       insurrection.        Congress must pass the For the People Act, which would       establish a host of election reforms, and the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Acts, which would restore       protections for voting that the Supreme Court foolishly has       diminished by weakening the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        That will require suspension or elimination of the       filibuster in the Senate, which undoubtedly would produce       political howling. But the filibuster is a mere procedural       rule in one chamber of the Congress. Allowing any one of 100       senators the power to diminish the voting rights of millions       of Americans is not how a representative democracy is       supposed to work.        Likewise, Congress should update the Electoral Count Act of       1887 to eliminate its potential to be a vehicle for a coup.        And the select House committee investigating Jan. 6, along       with the Department of Justice, aggressively must move to       hold accountable not only the rioters, but those who       facilitated them in any way.        At some point, Americans might be able to view Jan. 6,       2021, as a crisis that U.S. democracy survived. But that day       is not today.     I won't read all of it, obviously, but the point that this  editorial makes is that the attack continues today. It is not over. It  is not some event in the past that we are just reflecting upon, as  important as it is to reflect and remember and offer gratitude and  commendation. Here is what the editorial says, and I will just read a  short portion of it. It says:         [T]he attack continues. It carries on in statehouses like       Pennsylvania's, where lawmakers continue to question the       outcome of the 2020 presidential election--the most       transparent and heavily scrutinized vote in [our] nation's       history--craft bills to diminish the sort of heavy turnout       that carried . . . Joe Biden to victory, waste public money       on fraudulent searches for fraud, and gerrymander       congressional districts in the cause of minority rule.    It goes on from there, saying that the attack continues by all of  this work to lie about the election of 2020 and to pass voter  suppression bills all across the country.   The good news is, that is not going to happen. We are not going to  allow a partisan minority to prevent us from passing legislation to  keep that pathway to the right to vote clear in the ways that it was  clear so that so many Pennsylvanians and many Americans--as I said, in  my home State, hundreds of thousands more voted in a pandemic than  voted just 4 years earlier.   So on this day when we remember with horror that day just a year ago  and we say thank you to those law enforcement officials and others who  work in this building and did so much for us and for the Nation, we  also are determined to move forward to protect our democracy and ensure  that this great American experiment continues for generations.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
