 Mr. Speaker, the world is confronting an unprecedented  food security crisis. The World Food Program reports that a record 349  million people across 79 countries face acute food insecurity.   The COVID-19 pandemic flattened economies, fractured supply chains,  and caused huge spikes in inflation. Then came Russia's invasion of  Ukraine, one of the world's most important breadbaskets.   During Global Child Nutrition Month, I am not just hopeful that  tackling these challenges is possible; I am confident that we can. That  is because the U.S. Government, our farmers, and NGOs have responded to  the crisis with historic investments, expanding global food, nutrition,  and agricultural programs, including Food For Peace, McGovern-Dole,  Feed the Future, USAID's nutrition, maternal and child health programs,  and the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.   Mr. Speaker, it is easy to turn on the news and become overwhelmed,  but the U.S. has not only been ready to provide support to those who  are hungry, we have been at the forefront. Each of these proven  programs deserves our support, and I call upon my colleagues to  increase funding for these programs in the annual appropriations bills.  There are lives in the balance. We can end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our Rules Committee meeting last night was  an embarrassment.   Republicans went on and on about locker rooms, the same creepy  stereotypes they leaned on when they tried to stop gay marriage.   They went on and on about fairness, but no mention of the unfairness  girls' sports teams face when it comes to unequal resources, unequal  pay, and unequal treatment.   They went on and on about safety, but no mention of the number one  reason America's schools are unsafe: gun violence. Our kids are being  slaughtered, for God's sake. Does anybody on the other side even care?   Republicans claimed trans people don't even exist, which makes me  wonder why they wasted all our time on their creepy obsession with  controlling the lives of people they think aren't even real.   Republicans now believe Congress--Congress--should be empowered to  pick and choose which kids should be allowed to play on the soccer  team.   You can't make this stuff up.   What is next? A bill about who can play together at recess?   Republican hypocrisy is breathtaking. Republicans want to ban trans  kids from sports, but they won't ban child marriage in States like West  Virginia and Tennessee.   The same party systematically taking away women's reproductive rights  across the country, the same party that won't lift a finger as our kids  are massacred in our schools, that takes NRA blood money instead of  addressing an actual problem like gun violence, now wants to use  protecting girls as their sick excuse for targeting trans kids.   Enough is enough. Stop the fearmongering.   The truth is that this bill would mean more trans kids, already  vulnerable as it is, would be bullied, beaten, and killed. It would  deprive trans kids of the opportunity to learn about teamwork,  discipline, and sportsmanship.   Finally, let me just say that the trans community deserves so much  better than this. I hope they know that they have allies in Congress  and across the country who care about them and who will fight for them.  It shouldn't be a radical idea to respect people for who they are, and  it shouldn't be a radical idea to love people for who they are.   I urge my Republican colleagues to stop the lies, stop the bigotry,  stop the hate. Leave kids alone. I urge a ``no'' vote on this awful,  rotten rule and a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill.
