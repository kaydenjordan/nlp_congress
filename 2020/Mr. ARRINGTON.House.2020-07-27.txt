 Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Pennsylvania  responsibly and carefully sanitized the podium up here before I began  my 5-minute remarks, but I will tell you that there is not enough  disinfectant in all of the District of Columbia to sanitize this  Chamber on account of my Democrat colleagues who fail to condemn what  has been going on in what once were great American cities throughout  this Nation. It is shameful, Mr. Speaker.   Leaders are elected to this great body with its history and with the  full confidence of the American people that we will call evil by its  name. But they sit idly by and are complicit in their silence and do  not condemn the chaos, the destruction, the violence, the crimes, and  the terrorism that is ravaging our Nation.   As we speak and as we sit in this quiet and peaceful Chamber, there  are citizens--our fellow Americans--who feel that their lives and their  private property are threatened. They can't even bear arms with their  constitutional right to protect themselves and their property without  being prosecuted by some rogue city attorney.    We have got to stand up to this mob. We have to say: No more will you  burn our cities; no more will you terrorize our communities and  intimidate and use fear to squelch any attempt by our local leaders to  stop this now.   But they are intimidated, Mr. Speaker. The local leaders have  completely bowed the knee to these leftist extremist groups that have  hijacked peaceful protest.   There are folks with righteous indignation who have taken to the  streets to speak their truth to power, and I respect that. God bless  them. That is the American way.   We just celebrated one of the greatest who demonstrated peacefully  and, through love for his country and his fellow man, made more  difference than 1 million mobs could have. His name is John Lewis, and  I am honored to have served with him.   But what is happening right now is these local leaders are either  unwilling or incapable of stopping it. This weekend was 2 months of  persistence in this violence and in the crimes perpetrated against  Federal officers and local law enforcement who have been hamstrung to  even defend themselves, let alone the property that they have been  asked by their ``courageous leaders'' to defend. They are getting  fireworks shot off in their face.   Where are the city leaders?   Where is Mr. Biden? He is safe in his basement. That is courageous  leadership? That is what America needs right now?   Criticize President Trump all you want. He is at least doing  something to stand up to the mob and protect taxpayers' Federal  property.   Our Federal law enforcement officers are doing their job faithfully  and dutifully while our citizens' rights are being completely trampled.  There is no pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness in these cities.  They are burning.   Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged police  stations, and assaulted officers, ABC says: ``in peaceful  demonstrations that have intensified.''   Are you kidding me? In Texas, we call it bull with the end of that  word with a T.   Mr. Speaker, you know it. You know that these things are happening,  and they wouldn't happen in parts of Texas because the citizens would  not allow it.   What do we do with fireworks, broken windows, spray paint, and lasers  being shot at them?   Seattle experienced an antipolice riot where 59 police officers were  injured by arson, vandalism, and assault. I have got the list of  Federal crimes right here. These people ought to be prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law. They should be locked up away from the  citizens who are just trying to live out their lives in this great  Nation.   These are the Federal crimes: advocating to overthrow the government,  aggravated assault and battery, arson, assault with a deadly weapon,  attempting to kill an officer, conspiracy to impede or injure an  officer, and demands against the U.S.   This is domestic terrorism as defined by the statutes that we stand  on and that we have debated. They say that domestic terrorism is  violent crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to respect that you gaveled me out because I  respect the rules of this Chamber, so I thank you for the indulgence.                            ____________________
