 Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to recognize the  Greenville, South Carolina Foothills Chapter of the Korean War Veterans  Association for their exemplary work to ensure that all of South  Carolina's fallen Korean war veterans are never forgotten.   In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Wall of  Remembrance as an addition to the Korean War Memorial, but they didn't  fund the project. In response, the Foothills Chapter made it their  mission to raise nearly $20,000 to cover the inscription costs of the  55 soldiers from Greenville County who died in combat during America's  ``forgotten war.''   After 4 tireless years, the Foothills Chapter recently announced they  raised $207,000, which is enough to provide inscriptions, not only for  the 55 soldiers from Greenville County, but for all 483 servicemembers  from South Carolina who were killed while serving their country in  Korea, as well as 93 servicemembers who were captured and held as  prisoners of war.   Once again, I recognize the Greenville Foothills Chapter of the  Korean War Veterans Association and, in particular, my friend, former  State senator Lewis Vaughn for carrying on the legacy of South  Carolinians who made the ultimate sacrifice in Korea.                            ____________________
