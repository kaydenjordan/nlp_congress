 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Garamendi), my friend.                Recognizing Brigadier General Thomas E. Kunkel     Madam Speaker, we are here today to recognize the  accomplishments of the freshman class of the 116th Congress as we  approach the 100th day since we were sworn into office. History is  before us. Congress is 230 years old.   As co-president of the freshman class, alongside my colleague,  Representative Colin Allred of Texas, we ring with a dutiful pride,  deeply humbled by this opportunity to serve in a legislative session  that will mark the conclusion of a decade and the beginning of another.  We take stock of new representation, new voices, people, that the likes  of this body have never seen before, what the American people called  for in their voting booth, and all that this great body represents.   This class of freshman Democrats, 67 Members strong, from every  corner of our great Nation, is the largest in nearly 45 years. Our  class represents several historic firsts. With 42 new women in  Congress, the House of Representatives is more female than at any point  in the Chamber's deep history.   Representative Davids of Kansas and Representative Haaland of New  Mexico are the first Native American women to serve in this Chamber.   Representative Omar of Minnesota and my fellow Michigander,  Representative Tlaib, are the first Muslim women in Congress.   We now have more African American women and men serving in this body  than ever before.   Nearly two-dozen new Members, from both sides of the aisle, have  served our country as members of the military or Central Intelligence  Agency.   Representative Ocasio-Cortez of New York is the youngest woman to  ever serve in the House, and Representative Finkenauer of Iowa is the  second youngest.   Representative Van Drew of New Jersey is a dentist.   Representative Schrier of Washington is a pediatrician.   Representative Underwood of Illinois is a nurse.   Representative Hayes of Connecticut was the Teacher of the Year.   And Representative Shalala of Florida, the longest serving health and  human services secretary in history. Representative Mucarsel-Powell,  also of Florida, is the first South American immigrant Member of  Congress.   This freshman class brings its brilliant diversity, experience, and  unity, a broad array of skills and life experience, to the Halls of  Congress, generating a commitment to address legacy issues and usher in  opportunities for the common good to promote the general welfare for  all American people.   President Lincoln's words bear down on us. He, who was once a Member  of this very body, said: ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.  We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in  spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can  spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will  light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.''   The issues of today are complex, enormous, and often frustrating, but  we do not bemoan. We bring a commitment to serve, to problem solve, and  create opportunity. We are reminded that this very body saw us through  western expansion to become a land of sea to shining sea, through pain,  by the way. And we did reconstruction following a brutal Civil War.   And now, in the year 2019, in the first 100 days of the 116th  Congress, we have been hard at work. We have passed the For the People  Act, a historic bill to clean up corruption and restore ethics in  Washington, putting voters at the center of elections.   We passed the Paycheck Fairness Act, to finally fulfill gender  economic equality in the workplace and bring more people into the  middle class.   We passed a universal background check bill, to keep firearms out of  the hands of those who seek to do evil, and we will do more commonsense  gun safety legislation to put the safety of all communities at the top  of the priority list.   We have held hearings, long overdue, on climate change and outrageous  prescription drug prices, on Government oversight on human rights  abuses at our border, and we have led on matters of safety and  security.   And we are evaluating all the ways to meet our country's  infrastructure needs.   We, the people, for the people, a country in a new moment.   As a representative from the great State of Michigan, I have been  privileged to introduce my first piece of legislation, the bipartisan  Building Blocks of STEM Act, which promotes STEM education and pathways  to education in the sciences, particularly for young girls.   As the chairwoman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, I have  had the opportunity to preside over hearings on bioengineering and  advanced manufacturing, essential to regional economic development,  particularly in places like southeastern Michigan.   I passed a bipartisan amendment to the Rebuilding America's Schools  Act and led an effort to maintain funding for advanced technological  educational training programs, an important initiative with active  grants in my district.   This was all in the first 100 days: multiple townhalls, coffee hours,  and Manufacturing Mondays.   The question before us, the Moon shot of 2015, what will usher in new  scientific advancements in the workforce to help us achieve them? It is  for those who dare to create a vision.   There are 18 freshmen currently serving as subcommittee chairs,  holding informative hearings and driving important policy discussions  on issues like veterans' healthcare, small business advocacy, trade  assistance, and for justice and equality, for the individual  hardworking Americans residing and fueling the energy in the towns  throughout suburban metro Detroit, where I represent, and their young  children dreaming of their future. They are eagerly, and sometimes  quietly, counting on us to wage great discussion, to think deeply and  penetratingly, to seize the duty at hand.   Congress often feels like being on a great ship, each side weighing  side to side, sometimes in stormy weather, but we have all taken the  oath to reside on this ship, to come together for the remainder of our  service, to improve the outcomes for the next generation and for those  to come, the whispers of time and time.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Madam Speaker, we are so proud of our freshman class.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia),  someone whom her constituents know as ``Senator Sylvia'' from her great  service in her State's capitol, but whom we knew as the great  Congresswoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Levin), my friend and fellow Michigander.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn), my dear friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Horn for showing us  what leadership looks like.   It should also be noted that our presiding Speaker this evening, Ms.  Xochitl Torres Small, the Congresswoman from the great State of New  Mexico, is also a member of our freshman class.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse),  my friend.    Well, I am delighted to be among the freshman class, and  I am so proud of all of our accomplishments, particularly that we have  18 freshmen chairing subcommittees from all of the various  great committees, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the Small Business Committee.     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Neguse for sharing  some of his time with Congresswoman Hill from California.   This Special Order hour has truly been special, and what a delight to  reflect on these first 100 days with a historic freshman class in a new  season here in the Nation's Capital.   Madam Speaker, I would like to conclude this Special Order hour of  the freshman class of the 116th Congress, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
