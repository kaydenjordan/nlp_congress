 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R.  2339 the Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco  Epidemic Act of 2019. This critical legislation provides a  comprehensive approach to address the youth tobacco epidemic, which has  surged in recent years with the introduction of such new tobacco  products as e-cigarettes. The bill will prevent the loss of an entirely  new generation to a lifetime of nicotine addiction.   Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, disability,  and disease in the United States, and it is attributed to more than  480,000 deaths in the United States each year. Even more concerning is  the rapid escalation in youth e-cigarette use, as youth use of nicotine  in any form is unsafe and can seriously harm brain development and lead  to other forms of addiction. In 2019, 5.3 million middle and high  school students have reported to have used e-cigarettes. According to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these recent increases  have erased the decline in any tobacco product use that occurred in  previous years.   As the first registered nurse elected to Congress, I am proud to  support the Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco  Epidemic Act. Particularly, I am pleased to be joined by the American  Public Health Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, National  Medical Association, NAACP, and the National Black Nurses Association,  who have all shown their support for this critical legislation.   As representatives of Americans from all corners of our country, we  have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our  communities and especially our children. On behalf of my home state of  Texas, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2339.    Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the critical  need to rebuild and strengthen our infrastructure in the United States.   This is why I support the Democrats' Moving Forward Infrastructure  Plan to create an estimated 10 million jobs by investing $760 billion  over 5 years in the Nation's roads, bridges, transit systems, railways,  airports, ports, inland waterways, wastewater and drinking water  systems, brownfields, and broadband.   Building our Nation's 21st century infrastructure also presents a  unique opportunity for us to create a more inclusive technical  workforce. The high-skilled jobs of the future can be accessed by our  communities if support is provided for technical training and learning  skills. A skilled technical workforce that reflects the diversity of  our Nation is critical to our continued growth and advancement.   It is no secret that our basic infrastructure is in crisis. This  framework would bolster the Federal role in order to help communities  around the country undertake transformative projects that are smarter,  safer, and made to last.                            ____________________
