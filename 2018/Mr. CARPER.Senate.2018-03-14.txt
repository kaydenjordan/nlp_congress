 Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about the  legislation before us, which is the banking legislation that has been  reported out of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote and awaits  our attention here today.   Mr. President, like my colleague from Washington State, I will also  speak briefly to the issue that is being raised in States across  America and in schools across America, where students are demonstrating  their support and their solidarity with the folks in Parkland, FL,  where 17 kids were lost earlier this year.   My dad was a hunter, grew up in West Virginia. I was born in West  Virginia and grew up in Virginia. I bought my first BB gun when I was  10 years old, and I still have the shotgun that my grandfather gave me  just before he died, when I was just a pup of a teenager. In my family,  we are big believers in Second Amendment rights--to own and bear arms.  We are also big advocates of using common sense with respect to  weapons.   My dad was not only a hunter, he was also a gun collector. He would  buy and sell guns to other people whom he knew. From the time my sister  and I were little kids, my dad would always say to us, ``Just use some  common sense.'' He said it a lot to us when we were growing up. We must  not have had much of it because he said it very often. My dad said that  it didn't make common sense for somebody who had serious mental health  problems or a felony record to be able to go to a gun show and buy a  weapon. It also doesn't make a lot of sense for people who can't fly on  airplanes because they are on a terrorist watch list to be able to buy  guns. My dad would have said that didn't make a lot of sense.   What is happening across the country is that the kids are leading us.  In a verse in the Bible, it reads that the ``child shall lead them.'' I  think that is really what is going on here, and I think States are  already starting to address this issue in a more constructive way than  we have done thus far.   My hope is that the children will lead us and that the States will  lead us as well. Maybe we will be able to come to agreement on some of  these issues that are respectful of our Second Amendment rights in the  Constitution but that are also consistent with the kind of common sense  that my dad always talked about with respect to everything, including  the buying and selling of weapons.   Mr. President, I remember standing on this floor--I think it was  about 8 years ago--when we debated the Affordable Care Act. That was at  a time when we were spending about 18 percent of the GDP for healthcare  in this country--18 percent. The Japanese were spending 8 percent. They  had better results in Japan for their healthcare than we had, and they  covered everybody. Think about that. We had been spending 18 percent,  and they had been spending 8 percent. They had gotten better results in  healthcare--in life longevity for adults and in lower rates of infant  mortality. They covered everybody. When people went to bed in this  country at that time, 40 million people went to bed without having any  healthcare coverage. I think most of us realized at the time that that  was not a good thing. I used to say that the Japanese can't be that  smart and we can't be that dumb.    We passed the Affordable Care Act. There was a lot of debate and a  lot of amendments offered in committees, including in the Finance  Committee on which I served, Republican amendments and Democratic  amendments. As we know, the final vote here on the floor was not a  bipartisan vote. It was a huge issue that we were trying to address-- delivering healthcare to 300 million Americans.   For those who supported the legislation, even they realized that it  was not perfect and that we were going to have  [[Page S1700]]  to come back at some point in time and make changes to it. The  Democrats felt that way. The Republicans and Independents felt that way  as well. We ended up not coming back and offering modest amendments or  making tweaks to the legislation. At the end of the day, we ended up  with a battle here, initially over the repeal of the ACA and later over  repealing and replacing it.   I felt proud of the work we had done on the ACA. In my knowing it was  not perfect, I always looked forward to coming back shortly after we  had adopted it, actually, and making some tweaks. I felt the same way  about Dodd-Frank, the banking legislation that we passed after the  great recession about 7 or 8 years ago.   I will just remind everybody, especially our young pages here today,  who were probably about 7 or 8 years old at the time, that we didn't  fall into a burning ring of fire--we fell off a cliff. The unemployment  rate shot up to 10 percent, and banks stopped lending money to send  kids to school or to allow people to buy a car or a house. Credit was  shut off for businesses as well. The unemployment rate skyrocketed. Our  economy was locked up, and we felt that we had to do something.   What we tried to do was to figure out how we ended up in that mess in  the first place. What had gone on is that the people who wanted to buy  houses, who were not creditworthy, ended up being loaned money by banks  across the country to buy houses. In many cases, the appraisals for the  houses were not worth the paper they were written on. The  creditworthiness of the buyers was not worth the paper it was written  on as well. We had unqualified people who were trying to buy property.  They were unable, realistically, to repay their loans. It all worked  just fine until we went into a slump. As the unemployment rate started  to go up, people found it more and more difficult to make their  payments.   In the olden days, I remember the first house I lived in when I was a  kid. My parents borrowed money from a bank for a mortgage, and then  they paid it off to that bank. I remember, when they paid off the  mortgage to the house they owned in Danville, VA, it was a big deal. My  dad actually took the mortgage and burned it up outside, not inside our  house.   Yet, 7 or 8 years ago, for a lot of people, after they borrowed money  from banks, the banks sold those mortgages to somebody else, oftentimes  to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would package  those mortgages into mortgage-backed securities--into a security that  could be sold to investors in this country and to investors around the  world. As long as housing prices continued to rise, everything worked  fine. When they stopped rising and started falling, a number of those  mortgage-backed securities were riddled--almost like Swiss cheese--with  bad mortgages. As more and more people failed to be able to pay their  mortgages, the mortgage-backed securities lost their value. Those  investors around the world who had invested seriously in mortgage- backed securities got scared, and it started to spiral down from there.   That was not really the only reason we got into a burning ring of  fire all those years ago, but it was a big reason. Part of what we  decided to do with Dodd-Frank was to make sure that didn't happen  again. We would make other mistakes, but we were not going to make that  mistake again.   The legislation was passed. Again, not everybody was for it. I voted  for it and helped to write some of the provisions in the bill. I knew  at the time, as I think we all did, that anything that big--a massive  change in our banking regulatory approach in this country--was going to  have to be tweaked and revisited just like the Affordable Care Act. It  has taken a while.   For the most part, our Republican friends--not all and probably not  including the Presiding Officer--were interested in repealing Dodd- Frank. I and, I think, the majority of folks on our side were  interested in fixing the provisions that needed to be fixed but not in  throwing the baby out with the bath water.   The legislation before us today was reported out of the Banking  Committee but not unanimously. It was reported out, I think, last fall,  by the chairman of the committee, Mike Crapo from Idaho, whose name is  on the bill. I am going to spend some time here today talking about  what it does and what it doesn't do.   If the bipartisan bill before us becomes law, 90 percent of Dodd- Frank will remain unchanged. Let me say that again. If the banking bill  before us today becomes law, 90 percent of Dodd-Frank will remain  unchanged.   The legislation that has been authored by Senator Crapo and others  does not touch some of Dodd-Frank's most important reforms. Some of  those most important reforms include the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. It remains. The Financial Stability Oversight Council remains.  It is affectionately known as FSOC, and it works to identify and to  address overarching threats to the financial system. The regulations  that crack down on risky derivative trading remain, and the ability of  the FDIC to wind down failing complex institutions through an orderly  liquidation authority remains.   Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve would retain the  authority to apply enhanced standards to any bank with over $100  billion in assets. In addition, banks with over $100 billion would  still be subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Those  requirements include, one, meaningful stress tests; two, increased  capital requirements to provide a cushion in tough times and bad times;  and, third, vital international reforms to leverage in liquidity  standards.   I have a number of charts. I have more charts today than I think I  have ever brought to the Senate floor. I promise we will be done by  sundown. It will seem that long, but in reality it will not be.   Let me start off, if I could, with a couple of claims made about the  bill and, then, talk about the reality.   One of the claims is that this bill would gut Wall Street reform that  was passed after the financial crisis to prevent another global  meltdown.   That is the claim. Here is the reality. This bipartisan bill makes  targeted, commonsense fixes that will provide tangible relief to  community banks and credit unions, while leaving in place the rules and  regulations that will keep Wall Street accountable.   Before we look at the next claim, like the Presiding Officer, I do  customer calls all over my State. The Presiding Officer has a big  State, and I have a little State. I visit businesses, schools,  hospitals--you name it. I do customer calls literally every week,  including the credit unions and small community banks. Sometimes they  come to see me, and oftentimes I go to see them. For years, during  those customer calls, visiting credit unions and community banks,  especially in the central and southern part of our State, they would  say to us: We didn't create the financial meltdown that led us to the  great recession. Yet we bear the burden of the regulatory reform for  that meltdown.   It wasn't their fault. We need a lot of the regulation that is  adopted in Dodd-Frank, but keep in mind that credit unions and  community banks didn't cause the problem but yet they bear a big part  of the burden of fixing it.   Another claim is that this bill rolls back stress test requirements  for all big banks. I will say it again. This bill rolls back stress  test requirements for all big banks. That is the claim.   Here is the reality. This bill continues to require stress tests for  all banks over $100 billion in assets. That would be the largest  financial institutions. That is the reality.   The claim is that this bill does nothing to protect consumers. That  is the claim--that the bill does nothing to protect consumers.   Here is the reality. This bill actually creates new protections. It  provides free credit freezes and allows year-long fraud reports. It  allows parents to turn credit reporting on and off for minors. It  provides free credit monitoring for all Active-Duty servicemembers.   I am a retired Navy captain. Our Presiding Officer is a colonel--Navy  salute.   It was one of the things that Senator Coons and I insisted on in  order to support this legislation, and that was to provide free credit  monitoring for all Active-Duty servicemembers as part of the bill.   Another reality in terms of new protections is that it encourages  banks to report suspicious behavior they become aware of.  [[Page S1701]]    That is a little bit of the claims and the reality. I can go on with  that, but I will not. I will actually turn to the words of other  people, starting off with questions from Senator Jon Tester of Montana,  a senior member of the Banking Committee. The first question he asked  last November was to a fellow who had been nominated to be Chairman of  the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, who was confirmed on this floor with  80 or 90 votes--a big bipartisan vote.   Senator Tester asked Mr. Powell, who was a Governor, if I am not  mistaken, at the time within the Federal Reserve System. He asked:         Part of that bill--    The bill before us today--       is eliminating the Volcker Rule compliance for community       banks that have less than $10 billion, as long as they have       less than 5 percent, trading assets and liabilities. Any       concerns there?    The witness, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, said: ``None.''   Senator Tester went on to ask the Federal Reserve Chairman--I think  this was in February of last year. Senator Tester, my colleague, is a  farmer out in Montana. He asked Jay Powell, who was not yet the  Chairman of the Federal Reserve:         But I'm a dirt farmer, OK? I just, kind of, read things as       they are and don't read a lot of extra stuff into it. You're       the--you're the man on the Fed and so I need to know your       opinion. Does 2155 require the Federal Reserve to weaken any       of the Dodd-Frank enhanced prudential standards for . . .       [foreign banks] such as Deutsche Bank, UBS or Barclays?    This was the response of Chairman Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve:         It does not, according to my reading of the text.    I will just add that this is the text of the bill.   Senator Crapo, the chairman of the Banking Committee, has put  together this bipartisan legislation, with a lot of help from Jon  Tester and others. In a hearing last July, he questioned the woman who  was then-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen. I think she did  a very good job. She stepped down, and I thank her for her service and  leadership.   Senator Crapo said:         There appears to be growing consensus that Congress should       consider changing the $50 billion SIFI threshold [for big       banks]; also, changing the Volcker rule, exempting certain       institutions from company-run stress testing requirements and       reducing the burdens on community banks and credit unions.    He went on to ask:         Do you agree that it would be appropriate for Congress to       act in each of those areas?    He asked: Do you believe it would be appropriate for Congress to act  in each of those areas--changing the SIFI threshold, changing the  Volcker rule, exempting certain institutions from stress test  requirements, reducing the burdens on community banks and credit  unions.         Do you agree that it would be appropriate for Congress to       act in each of those areas?    She said four words: ``I do--I do.''   Again, in February of last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet  Yellen, on the Volcker rule, said:         So, yes, let me reiterate what I said there. It's important       to look for every way we can to mitigate the regulatory       burden. What we've suggested previously and I would reiterate       with respect to Dodd-Frank is that Congress might want to       consider exempting community banks from the Volcker rule. . .       .    That is what she said last February, a year ago.   Then, former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo spoke. I think  his position is held now by Andy Cohen. Last year, Daniel Tarullo said:         We have found that the $50 billion in assets threshold       established in the Dodd-Frank Act for banks to be       ``systemically important,'' and thus subject to a range of       stricter regulations, was set too low. . . .    He went on to say:         The fact that community banks are subject at all to some of       the Dodd-Frank Act rules seems unnecessary. . . .    I will say it again.         The fact that community banks are subject at all to some of       the Dodd-Frank Act rules seems unnecessary to protect safety       and soundness, and quite burdensome on the very limited       compliance capabilities of small banks.    Dan Tarullo said that last April.   Here are the words of former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker,  whom I got to know and work with when I was in the House of  Representatives. He was Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and I was on  the Banking Committee. He was a giant then and still is--literally and  figuratively.   Here are his words in February of this year. He said:         I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee has forged       ahead with meaningful bipartisan financial reform to ease the       unnecessary regulatory strain on small banks, helping them to       flourish as an engine of economic prosperity. . . .    He goes on to say that he doesn't agree with every single word of the  legislation before us today, but he concluded by saying:         I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this       important piece of legislation and look forward to its swift       passage.    This is in a letter to Senator Brown, I believe. It doesn't mean he  agrees with every single sentence and paragraph, but he looks forward  to it.   Former Congressman and former Banking Committee chairman and my  colleague Barney Frank, spoke on whether Dodd-Frank needs reforms in a  CNBC interview last February. He was asked if Dodd-Frank needed  reforms, and he said: ``Of course.''   On the $50 billion SIFI threshold, he said: ``I think it should be  changed,'' and he went on to say: ``It's too low, I believe it is.''   Again, former Congressman Barney Frank on November 27 of last year  said:         If this bill became law tomorrow, well over 90 percent of       the Wall Street reform bill would be unchanged. . . . The       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; the strict regulation       of derivative trading; the orderly liquidation authority; the       risk retention requirements on securitizations and most other       provisions would remain in full force. . . .    In full force.   We are almost done here. I thank my colleague from Vermont for his  patience.   This is former Congressman Barney Frank on relief for community  banks. These words are from the CNBC interview last February, a year  ago.         With regard to banks under $10 billion, some of them are       spending more money than they should complying with       provisions that were never really intended to apply to them       and I understand that. The Volcker Rule which says that large       banks should do more lending and less derivative trading,       which I think is a wholly good thing, a number of small banks       which never did much derivative trading are overdoing the       effort to show [that] they aren't there. I would exempt some       of the banks under $10 billion from some of those rules and I       would agree to raise the $50 billion threshold.    Last but not least, a couple of comments more--one from the  Bipartisan Policy Center recently; the words of two of the folks from  there:         As U.S. politics descends ever further into partisanship,       there are still signs that old-fashioned legislating is not       dead. This week, the Senate Banking Committee will mark up       one of the first significant pieces of financial regulatory       legislation in years with real bipartisan support. . . .        These are not major changes. Yet taken together, they are       constructive and should provide greater incentives to extend       credit, particularly to Main Street small businesses, without       undermining the progress made since the crisis in making the       financial system safer.    This statement is from the president and CEO of the Independent  Community Bankers of America:         The markup of S. 2155 is a rare opening for real, impactful       relief that will strengthen economic growth, job creation,       and consumer protection. It is the culmination of years of       collaborative effort to achieve consensus among Members of       Congress across the spectrum and community bankers in their       home States and districts. Community bankers urge all members       of the Senate Banking Committee to vote YES on S. 2155.    This is from the president and CEO of the Credit Union National  Association, or CUNA:         This bill includes credit union-specific provisions that       provide meaningful regulatory relief, a sign that       policymakers are praying close attention to the needs of       credit union members. We thank Senator Crapo and his       colleagues for working across party lines to advance       regulatory relief legislation that benefits community       financial institutions, and look forward to continuing to       work closely with them as the bill moves through the       legislative process.    I hope we will keep these words in mind in the hours and days ahead  as we take up this important legislation.   I have no interest in undoing Dodd-Frank. I am a strong supporter of  Dodd-Frank. I helped to write some of the provisions in Dodd-Frank, and  I have no interest in pulling the plug on Dodd-Frank.  [[Page S1702]]    Can we make some reasonable changes? Yes, we can. I felt the same way  about the Affordable Care Act.   With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Vermont, and I thank  him for his patience.
