 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, for the second consecutive Congress, House Democrats  have shown us what their priorities are.   Is their top priority, H.R. 1, about improving roads and bridges? No.   Is their top priority, H.R. 1, about improving access to healthcare?  No.   Is there top priority, H.R. 1, about ensuring that our communities  are safe? Absolutely not.   No, their number one priority is themselves and their elections.  Instead of prioritizing these important issues, they have offered H.R.  1 to eliminate our State-based system of elections, to codify practices  like ballot harvesting, and to establish a Federal match with taxpayer  funds for campaign contributions.   I guess Federalizing our elections becomes the only option when your  ideas, the very thing our constituents should be judging us on, are  defunding our police and promoting government-run healthcare. The  American people have soundly rejected those ideas, but that hasn't  stopped our colleagues from finding a way to work around the will of  the American people.   Madam Speaker, the bill we are debating today, H.R. 1, is that  workaround and, if adopted, will allow our colleagues to continue  bypassing the issues most important to the people while guaranteeing  their reelection to Congress.   The American people are smart, and they are going to remember when  they step into the voting booths next November that the top priority  for House Democrats was not to address the health or safety of the  American people, it was to undermine our Constitution in order to win  elections.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone in this Chamber to vote ``no'' on H.R.  1.
