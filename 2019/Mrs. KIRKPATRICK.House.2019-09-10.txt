 Mr. Speaker, the President cut 127 military  projects, worth $3.6 billion, to construct 175 miles of wall on our  southern border. The halted projects affect every branch of the  military here and abroad.   Fort Huachuca, in my district, will lose $30 million in funding  designated for the reconstruction of an overdue transportation  equipment building. Fort Huachuca is a vital asset to our local economy  and our entire national security.   Not only does this action defy Congress' role in appropriating funds,  I believe it is disrespectful to our Armed Forces and the American  taxpayers.   The President has made it very clear he is more willing to protect  his own political campaign over protecting and delivering for our  military. Ultimately, this type of decisionmaking puts us all at risk.   Mr. President, fund our military, not your wall.
