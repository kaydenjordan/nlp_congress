 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the humanitarian  crisis happening right now in the Nagorno-Karabakh region in South  Caucasus. It is a tragedy unfolding before our eyes, with reports from  the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stating that over 65,000 ethnic  Armenians fled to Armenia from Nagorno-Karabakh since September 23. I  expect the number of refugees will continue to rise rapidly in the  coming days. They need immediate humanitarian aid: food, water,  shelter, and clothing. Sadly, this is not the first time in history  that the Armenian people have faced this kind of violence, aggression,  and worse.   The Nagorno-Karabakh region has a long and complicated history.  Armenia and Azerbaijan were both a part of the Soviet Union. As the  USSR collapsed, conflict broke out and Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a  bloody war in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It left tens of thousands  of people dead, millions of civilians displaced, and the legal status  of Nagorno-Karabakh in flux but under the rule of a de facto Government  of the Republic of Artsakh. Violence largely stopped in 1994. However,  deep tensions remain.   I may be one of the few Members of this body or either Chamber of  Congress who visited the region following the first Nagorno-Karabakh  war. During my visit in 1997, I met with local  [[Page S4745]]  leaders and civilians impacted by the conflict and saw firsthand the  impact of the fighting.   Today, we are witnessing a new tragic chapter for the people of this  region as the Government of Azerbaijan is moving to not only control  the territory but to drive out the ethnic Armenian population from the  region in the process. I have serious concerns that this may not be the  end; that the aggressors may once again subject this region to a  campaign of ethnic cleansing and cultural genocide on the ethnic  Armenians who remain in Nagorno-Karabakh or decide they have future  territorial aspirations in the region.   After years of uneasy peace, the Government of Azerbaijan began a 44- day war in 2020, seizing much of the territory around Nagorno-Karabakh.  This left Nagorno-Karabakh further isolated. Russian peacekeepers,  under the terms of an agreement they helped broker, were supposed to  secure the Lachin corridor, which is the only humanitarian supply line  between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.   The Azeris asserted control over the corridor in December 2022, set  up a military checkpoint, stopped the flow of commercial goods, food,  and medicine, and ultimately prevented the flow of humanitarian aid to  the region, setting the stage for the final set of hostilities that we  saw on September 19 and the complete defeat and surrender of local  security forces of Nagorno-Karabakh.   I say this because it is important to recognize the actions of the  Azerbaijan Government were deliberate and calculated and I believe  meant to achieve the outcome we are seeing today: tens of thousands of  ethnic Armenians fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh for their lives.   I know the Azeris have very different feelings of the conflict and  the outcome, but the United States cannot sit by and tolerate  atrocities by either side in armed conflict. That cannot be the way to  move forward because it does nothing to resolve differences and will  never allow people and families to have any sort of reconciliation and  closure after decades of conflict.   In light of Azerbaijan's renewed aggression, the U.S. Government must  respond. I was relieved to see the State Department and USAID announce  $11.5 million for the humanitarian response that is needed in Armenia.  I fear, however, this is only a small portion of the actual need so I  urge additional funds be readied to support the refugees quickly.   We need to do more. It is very clear the Azeris have not met the  conditions for waiver of section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.  Therefore, I have called for the immediate cessation of all U.S.  security assistance to Azerbaijan.   My colleague Senator Whitehouse and I have pressed the State  Department and the Treasury Department to use its existing authority to  issue Global Magnitsky Sanctions on those responsible for the human  rights abuses against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.   Given the change in the situation on the ground, I believe that the  administration needs to exert more pressure and, indeed, take a more  active role in ensuring that the government of Azerbaijan understands  that there are consequences for its actions and that the United States  is watching.   The region is at an inflection point. After decades of conflict, I  understand the skepticism of both sides grounded in centuries of  mistrust, but the process for a durable peace has to begin somewhere.  The governments in Baku and Yerevan must take this window seriously and  avoid divisive and hateful rhetoric that only fans the flames of  mistrust and conflict. Without it, I worry only future bloodshed will  follow.   I will continue my longstanding support for the Armenian people from  Nagorno-Karabakh, and I call on my Senate colleagues to urge the  administration to do the same.   We cannot sit idly by while a nation defines the world, claims  territory that is in dispute, and has a systematic policy which appears  to be emerging of ethnic cleansing.   We must stand up against this, and I urge all my colleagues to urge  the administration to take a strong and vigorous stand against what is,  I think, deplorable, despicable conduct by the government of  Azerbaijan.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today joined by my colleague Senator  Whitehouse to honor the life and legacy of Brother Michael Reis, a man  who made it his mission in life to never, ever give up on any kid.  Brother Michael found his vocation joining the De La Salle Christian  Brothers in the 1970s, and I was privileged to be a product of a  Christian Brothers High School.   Like the founder of his order Saint John Baptist de La Salle, Brother  Michael dedicated his life to educating and lifting up children at risk  of being consigned to the margins of society in life.   He began his career in New York as a math teacher but was soon drawn  into the world of social work. He moved from the classroom to a  residential facility for justice-involved youth. Fortunately, his  journey brought him to Rhode Island, where he first worked as a  chaplain at the Adult Correctional Institute.   In 1974, he cofounded Ocean Tides, a residential program that  provides a challenging, safe, and healthy learning environment for  young men who have experienced severe educational difficulties in  regular school settings and, indeed, have had other complicated social  problems.   Over the years, I have met many students who have been transformed by  their experiences at Ocean Tides. I have had the privilege of hosting  them in my Senate office and here at the Capitol. Their poise,  leadership, and thoughtfulness gave me confidence in our shared future  and also exemplified the remarkable contribution that Brother Michael  made to our community and to these young men.   He literally transformed their lives, lives that were, in many cases,  headed to a very difficult, dangerous, and destructive end and now are  lives that are poised for success, for contributions to the community,  for a vindication of his faith in all men and women.   In 1983, Brother Michael expanded his focus to support at-risk youth  and their families by founding Tides Family Services, which promotes  family preservation and keeping youth within their communities through  individual, family, and group counseling, home visitations, educational  and court advocacy, as well as the networking of social services.   With a mere startup fund of $15,000, Brother Michael built an  organization that employs over 140 dedicated staff and serves 500  youths a day. And when I say ``serve,'' I mean it. I have talked to  these counselors. They will literally pick up young men from their  homes and drive them to school so they get there and then get them  back. They will counsel them. They will encourage them. They will  support them. They will give them confidence in themselves so that they  can succeed.   It is a remarkable organization reflecting the spirit of Brother  Michael, the dedication of Brother Michael, and his commitment to  making sure that no child, as they say, is left behind.   I was proud to secure Federal resources to support the work that  Tides is doing and the families it serves. Strong families are the  foundation for everything else--economic security, educational  attainment, civic participation, and healthy communities. These are  investments that change lives and strengthen our society.   Brother Michael lived the mission of the De La Salle Christian  Brothers. For over 40 years, he worked across systems, finding  innovative ways to reach and support our most challenged youth and  bring along partners to support this cause. His vision, tenacity, and  great love of our community built two organizations that to this day  are places of hope and healing for struggling youth and families. We  are forever in his debt.   Brother Michael left us on Sunday, September 24, 2023, but his work  lives on in the lives he changed, in the institutions he built, and  most importantly, in the example he left for all of us.
