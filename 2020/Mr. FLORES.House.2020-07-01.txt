 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100-year  anniversary of American Legion Earl Graham Post 159.   American Legion Post 159 was chartered 13 February 1920 and named  after First Lieutenant Cyrus Earl Graham, Texas A&M University class of  1916.   Lieutenant Graham was a member of the United States Army Air Corps  and was killed in action in France on 9 November 1918.   From the beginning, The American Legion created an egalitarian  organization open to membership regardless of race, gender, or  religion. Post 159 has embodied these goals and has been a community- minded organization since its inception 100 years ago.   During this period, Post 159 has been dedicated to serving the local  Brazos Valley community through events such as the Brazos County Fair  and the historical Juneteenth Celebration, both of which were hosted on  The American Legion grounds. These events saw over 1,000 people come  together to embrace our community.   Post 159 of The American Legion continues its commitment to the  community to this day, with programs that provide activities for local  youth and veterans, as well as support for Active Duty military members  serving overseas.   The annual Resource Fair and Veterans Assistance program provides  over $20,000 in financial assistance to veterans in need.   Madam Speaker, it is clear that The American Legion Earl Graham Post  159 has had a significant and positive impact on the Brazos Valley  during its 100-year history.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to recognize this significant milestone and their contributions  to our veterans and to our community.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, and for our military men and women who  protect us and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                     Honoring Clifford Spiegelman, Ph.D.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Dr. Clifford Spiegelman of College Station, Texas, who passed away  on 14 May 2020.   Dr. Spiegelman, known as Cliff to his family and friends, was born on  15 May 1948 in Long Island, New York, to Charlie and Doris Spiegelman.   In school, he was recognized as an accomplished athlete and won  numerous awards for track and other sports. He also excelled in the  classroom and pursued a career in academics, receiving his bachelor of  science from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1970, his  master's degree in managerial economics from Northwestern University in  1973, and his Ph.D. in statistics and applied mathematics from  Northwestern University in 1976.   Cliff started his career with the agency now known as the National  Institute of Standards and Technology, commonly called NIST. He later  became a tenured professor at the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M  University.   Serving on the faculty at Texas A&M for over 30 years, Cliff became  renowned in his field and a highly sought-after expert in the  application of statistical expertise to forensic science, chemistry,  and medicine. In 2019, he was named a distinguished professor of  statistics, the university's highest rank for faculty. His  contributions to the field of statistics were further recognized in his  appointment as a regents professor in 2019.    Cliff was particularly known for his helpful nature and deep  commitment to justice and fairness in the criminal justice system. He  was nationally recognized for his research on statistical  interpretation of criminal evidence, such as bullet fragment analysis  and firearm tool marks.   He was a fierce advocate of accuracy by investigators to prevent  false convictions. He further expanded his advocacy through his work  with the Innocence Project, testifying pro bono in evidentiary  admissibility hearings and providing research that played critical  roles in overturning false convictions of innocent individuals.   His commitment to justice extended outside of the courtroom as well.  He  [[Page H3049]]  served on the Texas Forensic Science Commission as well as the Texas  Holocaust and Genocide Commission, where he worked to ensure that the  death statistics of the Holocaust and other genocides are reliably  reported.   Dr. Spiegelman leaves a professional legacy that is unmatched in his  field. However, his proudest accomplishments were outside of the  workplace.   Cliff married Dr. Katherine Bretzlaff in 1990, a fellow professor at  Texas A&M. Together, they raised two daughters, Lindsey and Abigail,  who each carry their parents' commitments to academic excellence,  strong work ethic, and kindness to those around them.   In the tributes written by the many individuals and organizations  positively impacted by Cliff's work, nearly all spoke of Cliff's pride  in his family and his frequent excitement to share the achievements of  his daughters.   Madam Speaker, Dr. Clifford Spiegelman's life was defined by his  outstanding accomplishments as a professor, mentor, and expert in  statistics, as well as his commitment to his family and friends. He  will be forever remembered for his strong principles and commitment to  excellence and as a devoted husband, father, and friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Spiegelman family. I have requested the United States flag be flown  over our Nation's Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of Dr.  Clifford Spiegelman.                                time  1815                 Honoring the Life of Lewis Merriman Buttery     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Lewis Merriman Buttery of Lampasas, Texas, who passed away on 20  December 2008. Lewis Buttery was born on 20 March 1924 in San Angelo,  Texas, to Albert James and Dorothy Hoss Buttery.   On his 18th birthday, just 3 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor,  he attempted to enlist in the United States Navy. He had hoped to join  his older brothers in service--one, an Army artillery officer, and the  other, a naval aviator. Unfortunately, Lewis was denied enlistment at  that time due to health issues.   This denial only strengthened his resolve to serve his country. Each  month he attempted to enlist until he was finally accepted and sworn in  on 20 October 1942.   Lewis was called to Active Duty in June of 1943 and was sent to the  University of Texas to continue pursuit of his engineering degree. He  was later sent to Midshipmen School at Columbia University in New York.  In March 1944, Lewis was commissioned as an ensign and ordered to San  Francisco to complete gunnery school.   He was ultimately assigned to USS Patrol Craft Escort 880 in Adak,  Alaska, as a gunnery officer.   In preparation for the invasion of Japan, his ship was converted into  a weather ship, and he became the aerological, or weather, officer. The  ship was transferred to the Marshall-Gilbert Islands area to transmit  weather observations and to guide Army Air Corps bombers which were  preparing the way for the invasion of Japan. The invasion did not occur  due to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, after which Japan  quickly surrendered.   Prior to being released to Inactive Duty in the Ready Reserve in July  1946, he became the executive officer of the ship and was promoted to  lieutenant junior grade.   Lewis was called back to Active Duty in June 1950 at the start of the  Korean war, but his orders were ultimately canceled before he could  reach his ship in San Diego. Ultimately, Lieutenant Buttery received an  honorable discharge in 1954.   Following World War II, Mr. Buttery came home and finished his degree  in chemical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He also  married Virginia Kerzee in Limestone County, Texas, raised a family,  and had a successful career.   Lewis was also a student of maps and cartography. Prior to the war in  1941, he completed courses in surveying and mapping at Texas A&M  University and continued that avocation through the rest of his life.  During his extensive work-related travels, Mr. Buttery collected  numerous atlases and maps, which he and his wife later donated to the  University of Texas at Arlington's Cartographic History Library.   He was a founding member of the Texas Map Society and author of  numerous monograph and facsimile portfolios devoted to early Texas. One  of his works, entitled, ``Regional Maps of Texas: 1720-2001; Region 1  North Texas,'' contains many valuable insights about the mapping  history of large portions of Texas. The maps that he and Virginia  donated and the works that he published will continue to educate future  generations interested in cartographic history.   He was very proud of his time in the Navy and believed that it molded  and shaped him throughout the remainder of his life. In recognition of  this, the ``Navy Hymn'' was solemnly played at his funeral.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of Lewis Merriman  Buttery.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country in these difficult times, for our military men and women who  protect us, and the first responders who protect us at home.                   Honoring the Life of Michael Ty Spradlin     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Senior Airman  Michael Ty Spradlin of Bryan, Texas, who passed way on 5 February 2020.  Known as Ty to his family and friends, he was killed in a motorcycle  accident at Yokota Air Force Base in Japan.   Ty was born 5 March 1991 in Wheelock, Texas, to Theresa Lynn Spradlin  and Michael Todd Spradlin. He graduated from Bryan High School in 2009  and enlisted in the United States Air Force in 2012.   Over his 8 years of service in the United States Air Force, Ty worked  as a crew chief on a variety of C-130 planes. He traveled to many  countries and enjoyed the opportunity to see the world.   During his service, Ty traveled to the Philippines, Australia,  Thailand, Kuwait, and Korea. He served at three different squadrons  over those 8 years, including: the 353rd Special Operations Group,  Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, Japan; the 755th Aircraft Maintenance  Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona; and the 374th  Maintenance Squadron, Yokota Air Force Base in Japan.   Senior Airman Spradlin bravely served his country, and his legacy  will be forever woven into our American military history. Ty was not  only a proud public servant; he was a friend to all, a loving son, a  brother, and an uncle.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Spradlin family.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of Senior Airman Michael  Ty Spradlin.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women, and for our  first responders who protect us at home.                     Honoring the Life of Wayne Purselley     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Wayne Purselley of Waco, Texas, who passed away on 29 February 2020.   Wayne was born on 27 June 1932 in Loving, Texas, to Herman and Ida  Purselley. He attended Texas A&M University and, upon graduation, was  commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force,  ultimately serving for 22 years. He flew 6,000 hours as navigator and  served as a missile launch officer before retiring as a lieutenant  colonel.    Following his retirement from the Air Force, Wayne became a teacher  and planetarium director for Richfield High School in Waco, where he  wrote and taught the ``Christ Revealed in the Stars'' lecture series  for many years.   Wayne was a dedicated member of Highland Baptist Church for 45 years,  where he served in both leadership and teaching roles. In addition to  his many roles within the church community, Wayne served as the  president of the local Military Officers Association of America  chapter, as well as the chairman of the McLennan County Republican  Club.   Wayne served our community and country for many years, and his legacy  will be forever woven into our American history.   Wayne was a committed and faithful husband to his wife, Barbara; a  loving  [[Page H3050]]  father; a committed teacher; a mentor; a community servant; and a  friend to many.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Purselley family.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of Wayne Purselley.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who protect  us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                  Honoring the Life of Colonel Glenn Starnes     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Colonel Glenn Starnes, who passed away on 30 March 2020.   Glenn was born 27 January 1959 as the second son of Charles and  LaVerne Starnes. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1981 and was  commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps.   Colonel Starnes led a life of service to both his country as a  dedicated marine and to the Texas A&M community as a member of the  Office of the Commandant's staff.   Glenn served in the Marines for 30 years and commanded at every  level, from field artillery battery to field artillery regiment. While  serving his country, he was stationed in seven States and two  countries. He fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom through two tours of duty in 2003 and 2005. Glenn also served  on joint duty with the U.S. Central Command and later served as an  exchange officer with the United Kingdom's Joint Headquarters.   Colonel Starnes was awarded the Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars,  the Bronze Star with Combat ``V'' Device, the Defense Meritorious  Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, and the  title of Officer of the Order of the British Empire from the Queen of  England.   After 30 years of service Glenn retired from the Marine Corps in  2011.   In 2012, Colonel Starnes joined the Texas A&M University community as  assistant commandant for operations and training for A&M's  internationally recognized Corps of Cadets.   In his 8 years on this job, Glenn was a tireless worker who loved the  Corps and the opportunity to serve as mentor for many of its members.   He was highly respected by his colleagues, and many Aggies feel  fortunate enough to call him friend. Colonel Starnes' 30 years of  dedicated service embody the core values of Texas Aggies: respect,  excellence, leadership, loyalty, integrity, and selfless service. His  loss will be deeply felt by the Texas A&M community and the Corps of  Cadets.   Madam Speaker, Colonel Starnes served his country proudly for many  years, and his legacy will be forever woven into our American history.  He was not only a dedicated public servant, he was a loving son, a  husband, a father, an effective mentor, and a loyal friend to hundreds.

Honoring Colonel David McIntyre, Ph.D.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Dr. David McIntyre of College Station, Texas, who passed away on 8  June 2020.   Dr. McIntyre was born on 13 May 1949, in Houston, Texas, to David and  Mary McIntyre. From a young age, Dave felt a sense of duty and a call  to selfless service which guided him throughout his life. He followed  this call to the United States Military Academy at West Point where he  was commissioned as armor officer in 1971. Following graduation from  Airborne School and U.S. Army Ranger School, Dave was assigned as a  scout platoon leader and jumpmaster in the 82nd Airborne Division at  Fort Bragg in North Carolina.   Over 30 years of dedicated service, Dave traveled all over the United  States and to more than 45 foreign countries. He served with an armored  cavalry reconnaissance unit at the Czechoslovakian border, flew to the  base of Mt. Everest in a Russian Mi-17 Hip helicopter, participated in  the changing of the guard with the Gurkha Rifles at the Khyber Pass,  and led a delegation to Angkor Wat.   In addition to his many years of service in the field, Dave placed  great focus on academics and serving our country through education. He  graduated with honors from the Command and General Staff College and  earned his first master's degree from Auburn University. He then went  on to serve as a professor of English literature at West Point while  earning a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland. After 30 years of  service, Dave retired as a colonel from his post as Dean of Faculty and  Academics at the National War College in Washington, D.C.   In June 2008 Dave was appointed to the National Security Education  Board by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate. He  served on this board for 4 years until 2012.

He relished spending time with his  family and seven grandchildren at home in College Station, Texas.   I first met Colonel McIntyre when he and I ran for this congressional  seat in 2010. As I got to know him, I found him to be a fierce  competitor, a policy expert, a committed public servant, a man of  integrity, and an ultimate gentleman. I can tell you firsthand that we  will miss his contributions to Brazos Valley and to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, Dr. David McIntyre's life was defined by his  outstanding accomplishments as Army officer, professor, an expert in  homeland security, as well as his commitment to his family and friends.  He will be forever remembered as a true leader in his field, a devoted  husband, father, and friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the McIntyre family. I have requested that the United States flag be  flown over our Nation's Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service  of Dr. David McIntyre.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our veterans, for our  military men and women who protect us, and for our responders who keep  us safe at home.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
