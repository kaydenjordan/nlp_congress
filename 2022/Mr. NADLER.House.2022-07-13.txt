 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1224, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6538) to create an Active Shooter Alert Communications  Network, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6538.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act, is bipartisan  legislation that would improve the tools available to law enforcement  as they respond to the disturbingly frequent threat of active shooters  faced by our communities.   Far too many of our cities have experienced the threat of an active  shooter situation. Since we last voted on this very bill--only a few  weeks ago--Highland Park became the most recent city to face the terror  of a mass shooting, following Buffalo, Uvalde, and so many others.   In 2021, the FBI designated 61 situations as active shooter  incidents, a more than 50 percent increase compared to 2020, and nearly  double the number of such incidents just 4 years ago.   These incidents require law enforcement to make challenging decisions  about how best to keep the public safe, including when and how to  inform the public as a situation unfolds. FEMA, the FCC, and wireless  providers already have a system in place to send time-sensitive,  location-targeted alerts for weather emergencies, AMBER Alerts for  child abduction cases, and other public safety emergencies.   This bill simply enables law enforcement to use this system for  active shooter alerts, giving them an additional tool to save lives. It  is bipartisan legislation and should be completely uncontroversial.   Indeed, our colleagues overwhelmingly supported this legislation when  we last voted on it, but the opposition of a few Members prevented it  from garnering the two-thirds support it needed to pass under  suspension of the rules. Those Members in opposition have made absurd  claims about the bill--instead of examining what it actually does--but  we won't take the bait.   Instead, we are listening to our law enforcement and first responders  who have called for this legislation. Today, we are taking action to  save lives when tragedy strikes. We will continue to do much more to  actually prevent these tragedies, but the least we can do is to improve  the tools we give law enforcement to respond to a crisis. That is what  this bill does.   H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act, directs the attorney general  to appoint a coordinator to work with Federal, State, local, and Tribal  Governments to better use our existing emergency alert system for  active shooter situations.   It directs the coordinator to establish an advisory panel, comprised  of law enforcement officers who have responded to active shooter  incidents, along with other public safety and emergency response  experts.                                time  1245    The coordinator is also directed to establish best practices for  using emergency alerts for active shooter incidents, to promote the  adoption of those best practices, and to report to Congress on the  effectiveness of these alerts. This bipartisan legislation is endorsed  by a broad range of Federal, State, and local law enforcement  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cicilline for his work in developing  this important legislation, I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting it once again, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is a member of the Judiciary  Committee and sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say that if the theater  across street were on fire, I would like to know about it. Fires  spread.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), one of the sponsors of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There is a reason that this bipartisan legislation is endorsed by the  Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National Association of Police  Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Policing  Institute, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District  Attorneys Association, and several State and local law enforcement  organizations.   When tragedy strikes--and unfortunately we know that it will strike  again--we want our law enforcement and first responders to have all the  tools they need to keep our communities safe. We want our people to  have the warnings that they need, just as with the AMBER Alert system.   I urge my colleagues to stand with law enforcement and to support  this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
