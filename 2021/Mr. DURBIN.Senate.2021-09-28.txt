 Mr. President, I am glad that the Democratic leader came  to the floor after the Republican leader. He certainly clarified some  of the statements that were made by Senator McConnell and brought a  dose of reality into the picture. I listened carefully to Senator  McConnell's speech, and I was waiting for one word. I knew he would say  it at some point, and yet I don't think he did. I might have missed it,  but I don't think he ever used the word ``filibuster''--``filibuster,''  the requirement of 60 votes to proceed with the business of the Senate.   The reason why that is essential is the Democrats are prepared to  accept the responsibility of funding the government and dealing with  our national debt, acknowledging our debt ceiling. And if the  Republicans don't care to be part of that conversation--or to engage in  it, that is their wish--that is what they can have. But Senator  McConnell has put in a filibuster, a requirement of 60 votes, which  makes it literally impossible for the Democrats on their own to accept  their responsibility. He didn't mention that the entire time.   I think we have reached a new low point in the U.S. Senate, where the  Republican leader and his followers, to a person, are prepared to  jeopardize the economy of the United States for purely political  reasons. We know that this filibuster means we need Republican votes to  move this measure. And he has made it quite clear that he won't give  those votes, at least as of yesterday. I can only hope that Republican  Senators going home, maybe this weekend, hearing from their  constituents and businesses, will have second thoughts about this and  accept that bipartisan responsibility that we all face.   There is a second you had to listen very carefully to catch with  Senator McConnell's opening statement. He went on to say at great  length that the last time we passed a debt ceiling extension was in  August. And, he said, incidentally, all the spending leading up to  August was covered by that debt ceiling. Well, that may have been true.  What did he fail to tell us? There was another bill that he voted for,  Trump supported, the Republicans supported, and the Democrats voted  for, too, in December for $900 billion in spending. That wasn't covered  by the earlier August debt ceiling. He knows that. So to say all the  debt of the Trump administration has been taken care of just isn't the  fact. And I am glad we have a chance to clarify that.   He seems to think that we are going to ``hurt families and help  China'' if we press forward with the reconciliation bill. Does it hurt  families to find an affordable way to have quality daycare for their  kids? I don't think so. Does it hurt families when children get a  chance for pre-K education so they are ready for school when the day  comes? Does it hurt families when we extend education from K-12 to K-14  and say to our community colleges, We are going to give you a mission:  Prepare the workforce for the 21st century? Give these Americans the  skills they need for a good paycheck and a home and a family and a  future.   According to the Senator from Kentucky, that hurts American families.  I think he is just flatout wrong. It helps them in critical ways. It  really addresses expenses and challenges they face and need a helping  hand to succeed.   And in terms of helping China, a competitive American workforce,  investment in research and innovation does not help China. If we invest  in this country, in its people and its ideas, we have always succeeded  and led the world.   So I disagree with the Senator from Kentucky completely. His  approach--tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, corporations that,  frankly, can escape any tax liability--hasn't worked. And it won't  work. It is fundamentally unfair, and it fails to invest in the people  that need it the most: working families, middle-income families,  children and their future.   (Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.)    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.
