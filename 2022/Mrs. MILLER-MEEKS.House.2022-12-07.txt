 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pearl  Harbor Remembrance Day.   Eighty-one years ago today, our Nation endured a tragic loss when  Pearl Harbor was targeted in a surprise attack, resulting in over 2,000  military and civilian casualties, more than 1,000 injuries, and the  loss of a naval fleet.   The attack on Pearl Harbor was intended to cripple the United States,  but it did just the opposite. Men and women across the country rallied  together to support our country as it entered World War II, from  enlisting in the military to volunteering for the  [[Page H8805]]  war effort. This tragedy united our country against a common enemy.   As a 24-year Army veteran, we must always remember this day as a  reminder to be vigilant and always prepared.   Today, we honor those who lost their lives in the attack on Pearl  Harbor. May we never forget their sacrifice and service to our great  Nation.                            ____________________
