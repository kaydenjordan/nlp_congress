 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate my  predecessor, the Honorable Dr. Donna Christensen, on the unanimous  approval of the Virgin Islands legislature to rename the Charles  Harwood Memorial Complex in her honor.   Dr. Christensen has spent her life as a public servant and a leader  in each of her roles, whether it is medical, educational, or political.  For decades, she has built a legacy as a pioneer. She was the first  female physician to serve as a Member of Congress, the first female to  represent an offshore territory in Congress, and the first female to  represent the Virgin Islands in this body.   Acutely aware of the unique challenges faced by Virgin Islanders, Dr.  Christensen has remained a staunch advocate for health equity for  minorities in the territory and underserved communities, such as her  influential work for minority health in the Affordable Care Act. In my  work, I continue to build on her legacy through the tireless battle to  attain equitable treatment for the people of the Virgin Islands.   I thank Dr. Christensen.                            ____________________
