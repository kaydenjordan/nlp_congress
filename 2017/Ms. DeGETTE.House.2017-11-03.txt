 Mr. Speaker, as one of the authors of the original bill  20 years ago, I rise to express deep disappointment that the House has  not been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on how to fund the  extension of CHIP.   The September 30 deadline has long passed, and now 9 million children  and families are waiting anxiously for us to figure this out. My home  State of Colorado is likely to run out of CHIP funding in January, with  termination notices going out to worried families in the next few  weeks.   Yet here we are with a partisan bill that asks us to pay for low- income children's insurance on the backs of seniors and the most  vulnerable.   The bill also cuts the Affordable Care Act, which could result in  668,000 people enrolled in ACA plans losing their health insurance.  Nobody should have to lose coverage in order for others to keep it.  This is a false choice, and it is out of step with what the American  people have been calling on us to do. Only the 115th Congress could  find a way to make the CHIP bill partisan.   Irrespective of what happens today in this vote, I urge my colleagues  to get together across the aisle, across the Capitol, find a way to  reauthorize this important bill in a way that doesn't cut benefits for  other people. Let's  [[Page H8460]]  truly give kids these benefits that they need, and let's move on with  our business.
