 Madam President, I had the privilege of knowing Tom  Udall's uncle when I served in the House of Representatives. He was not  only a great leader, but he was a funny man. I have repeated some of  his lines and jokes so often. I don't even give him credit anymore. I  hope his family and his memory will forgive me.   I have often repeated his prognosis for politicians. Morris Udall  said: Once you get politics in your bloodstream, only embalming fluid  will replace it. I have often thought of what drives us, the men and  women of the Senate and the House, to continue to engage in this life's  work of politics, with all the cost that it incurs in our lives.  Clearly, we are driven by something more than just comfort.   To my friend, Tom Udall, let me say I am glad you proved your uncle  wrong. As much as I wish you were staying with us for a while longer, I  know that you are not leaving public service. You never will. You are  just leaving this chapter.   In the Udall family, public service is a noble tradition. Your uncle  always served with honor in the House for three decades. Your cousins-- Mark Udall, Mike Lee, and Gordon Smith--have all served in the Senate.  Your father, Stewart Udall, answered President Kennedy's call for the  best and brightest and served as President Kennedy's Secretary of the  Interior.   I want to mention one footnote that should never be forgotten,  particularly at this moment in history. When we watch the NFL and their  dedication to the notion of Black Lives Matter, they should remember  that over 50 years ago, it was your father, as Secretary of the  Interior, who said to the NFL football team that was using RFK Stadium  that they had to integrate and bring in their first Black player or he  wasn't going to renew their Federal lease on that premises. He changed,  overnight, the fate of that Washington football franchise when it came  to the issue of race. That shows the kind of leadership which 50 years  later looked so visionary.   But when it comes to preserving America's national treasures in the  20th century, the Udall name ranks right up there with Teddy Roosevelt.  Roosevelt was a giant of conservation. He believed that we have a moral  obligation to preserve our planet and the treasures of it for future  generations.   I have no doubt that your father and your mother would be proud of  your service in the Senate. You have carried on this legacy with such  perfection by preserving America's irreplaceable national treasures. I  have vivid memories of two majestic national monuments that are in  Utah--Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. President Obama showed  real leadership in creating those monuments, and you have led the fight  to preserve them through the current administration.   The passion with which you spoke about the history and importance of  these treasures is something I will never forget. I was proud to  cosponsor your proposal, the ANTIQUITIES Act, to make clear that only  Congress can alter the list of protected national monuments. Thank  goodness we have public servants like Tom Udall, who is willing to  fight to preserve a piece of this world so that future generations can  see it as God created it. Your ``30 by 30 Resolution,'' which you  cosponsored with Senator Bennet of Colorado, is another example of  creative, innovative Udall ``conservationism.''   Your efforts to preserve America's most sacred treasures do not end  with open spaces and a healthy environment. You have also been a brave  and tireless champion of the need to preserve the fundamentals of our  democracy. Along with your efforts to protect national monuments, you  also led to preserve the delicate balance of powers envisioned by our  Founders. You were the lead sponsor in this Chamber in the For the  People Act to protect voting rights, strengthening government ethics,  and changing the way congressional campaigns are funded--a bill that I  have built on myself to try to protect our body politic   Our goals were always the same: to break the grip of special  interests on our politics and government while making it more  affordable for men and women with good ideas but without massive wealth  to run for Congress. These last years have shown us how fragile our  democracy can be and how much work we have to do to restore people's  faith in government.   I want to point out one particular bill--TSCA. Tom, I will never  forget what you did with that. I don't know how many months--maybe even  years--that you weathered on despite opposition, not only from the  other side of the aisle but sometimes from our side of the aisle, to  get this issue into perspective. There were chemicals that were being  put into things as basic as furniture that American families had no  idea would be dangerous.   I have never forgotten this image. You told this story on the floor.  To think that that cushion on your couch is treated with some chemical  that could be harmful to individuals and that every time you, as a  father, sat down on that couch and pulled that baby close to you, you  could have been spraying chemicals in that baby's face. I thought about  that ever since you gave that speech and how much work you did to make  sure that we remedy that wrong and that we gave notification and  clearance before these chemicals were being used in products that  American families didn't even know about. I gave you my word that I  would push hard with you on that. I was just one of the soldiers in the  back of the ranks, but I was proud of every moment of it.   I wish you and your wife Jill a special happiness in the next  chapter. Jill, of course, is originally a native of St. Louis, and I  grew up across the river. We had many fun times talking about her youth  and reminiscing about mutual friends. She is just an exceptional person  herself, and you know it and I do too. To your daughter Amanda, I wish  an equally happy and healthy future. As our friend John Lewis might  say, may you continue to find ways to get into good trouble.   In this Senate, you have been the voice for so many people who had no  voice. You have chosen to be an advocate for Native Americans. And if  there is ever a cause which every single Member of the Senate and the  House should take as their own, it is to bring justice to this group of  people who were here before us and were not treated well by this  government.   I will close now with a thought from one of their great leaders,  Sitting Bull. In negotiations with the Federal Government, Sitting Bull  advised: Let us put our minds together and see what future we can make  for our children.   This is the spirit which Tom Udall has brought to the U.S. Senate in  every aspect of public service. It has been an honor to work with you,  Tom. I wish you all the best because you are the best.

I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, when you are new to the U.S. Senate, it  is not unusual for friends and people back home, after you have been  there a while, to say: So who are the good guys and who are the bad  guys in the Senate? Who are the ones you really like and what can you  tell us about the rest of them?   It is a common question that is asked, and I do remember, as a new  Senator here, reflecting on that question and saying: You know, if I  had an important decision to make in the Senate, whatever the issue  might be, there are two Senators whom I always want to sit down and get  their advice. One was Carl Levin of Michigan--one of the most  thoughtful, smart guys I had a chance to serve with, and the other was  Paul Sarbanes. He just always struck me as a man of substance, who took  questions seriously. He was respected in the U.S. Senate for his  service, of course, to Maryland, and he was just a good person. He  brought real integrity to the U.S. Senate.   So when I learned that he passed away just a few days ago, I wanted  to put a few things in the Record.   He was a man of towering intellect and integrity, but he was modest.  He didn't care about headlines. He did so much good work behind the  scenes. He was given some of the toughest assignments.   Think about the responsibility of dealing with the great recession  and then working with Republican Congressman Oxley to put together a  really significant reform of Wall Street and the financial community.  We knew we could trust Paul Sarbanes to do it, and he did it in a  bipartisan fashion.   He was a proud son of immigrants. He never forgot it. His parents  emigrated from the same town in Greece but only met in America.   The Sarbanes owned a famous restaurant in Salisbury, MD, and gave it  the quintessentially American name--the Mayflower Restaurant. Paul  worked in the restaurant as a boy, and he and his family lived above  the restaurant.   He graduated from public high school, won a scholarship to Princeton  University, studied as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, and in  1960 earned a law degree from Harvard. Not bad for an immigrant's son.   From Harvard, Paul went to the White House, where he was one of the  best and brightest who answered President John Kennedy's call to public  service. There, he worked as an administrative assistant to Walter  Heller, who was Chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic  Advisers.   Paul Sarbanes' parents taught him that serving one's nation in public  service was a noble calling.   One of the many Greek words Paul Sarbanes learned from his parents  was the word ``idiotes.'' It is the Greek root word for the English  word ``idiot,'' but it has a different meaning in Greek. It means  someone who takes no part in the affairs of his community. In the  Sarbanes family, that was almost a curse.   Paul and his parents believed that service to others and to their  adopted homeland was a noble calling. So Paul first ran for elective  office. In 1966, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates.   In 1970, the people of Maryland elected him to the U.S. House of  Representatives. He was a young Congressman when he wrote one of the  successful Articles of Impeachment against then-President Nixon for  lying about his Watergate burglary.   In 1976, he won his first election to the U.S. Senate. He would go on  to serve 30 years in the Chamber. He was a voice of reason on both the  Senate Iran-Contra and Whitewater committees.  [[Page S7268]]    When corporate swindling at Enron and other large corporations  cheated millions of Americans out of their life savings, it was Paul  Sarbanes' leadership that enabled the Senate to pass the most far- reaching corporate accountability reform since the Securities and  Exchange Commission was created 70 years before.   That Sarbanes-Oxley reform law passed in 2002. It was designed to  prevent the kind of corporate abuses that had so damaged America's  economy and shaken the faith of the American people in the economic  markets.   In 2002, things came full circle for me. There was created an award  in the name of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois--a man whom I first met  as a college intern who inspired me to get started in this business.  Paul Sarbanes won in 2002 and became the first recipient of the Senator  Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award that is presented by the  University of Illinois to honor men and women in public service who  exhibit the finest qualities of leadership. It was a perfect match,  and, for me, it came full circle.   What a coincidence it is that the people who have been my heroes in  public life so far, so many are named Paul: Paul Douglas, who had  started me as an intern, who introduced me to Paul Simon, who preceded  me in the U.S. Senate, where I served with Paul Sarbanes.   They basically say in my office that I have been raised according to  the Gospel of ``Saints'' Paul.   I want to quote briefly from Senator Sarbanes' final speech in the  Senate before he retired in 2006. It speaks powerfully to the kind of  leaders America is looking for today.   Here is what Paul Sarbanes said:         Throughout my years in public service, I have worked to the       limits of my ability to provide the people of Maryland and       the Nation dedicated, informed, and independent       representation based upon the fundamental principles of       integrity and intelligence. I have been guided in this effort       by a vision of a decent and just America, based on a strong       sense of community and offering fairness and opportunity to       all its people.    I know I join all my colleagues in thanking Paul for doing his part  so nobly and so well to help us move toward a more perfect Union.   And let me say a word about his wife Christine. She was his real  partner in life. I can recall when he retired, and I said: Paul, I am  sorry to see you go. And he said: Let me ask you a question. When are  you supposed to leave around here? It is a question many of us have  asked ourselves over and over.   As far as he was concerned, I said: What do you want to do the most?  He said: Travel with Christine.   They were able to do that for a limited period of time because  Christine died of cancer in 2009. She was a wonderful person-- intelligent, just like Paul--and the two of them were pure happiness  together.   Loretta and I wish to express our condolences to the Sarbanes family,  especially to their children--Michael, Janet, and a man I have come to  know and respect, his son, Congressman   John Sarbanes, as well as  their grandchildren, his friends and former staff members, and the  countless people whose lives are better because of Paul Sarbanes.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
