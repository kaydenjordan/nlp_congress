 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Chair for  his support of my amendment.   This amendment is based on legislation I have introduced previously,  the Corey Adams Searchlight Act.   I want to talk about why this amendment is so important.   It is about helping services members who have been heroes and have  given so much for our safety.   The bill is named after my constituent, Corey Adams.   Corey always wanted to serve his country and follow in his fathers  and grandfathers' footsteps and join the Air Force after high school.   Corey served 4 years on active duty, then joined the Air Force  Reserve.   Sergeant Corey also served six months in Afghanistan in 2009.   Sergeant Corey Adams was later diagnosed with Post traumatic stress  disorder and later moved into his parent's home in Milwaukee, WI.   On March 20, 2017 the Adams family was changed forever.   Segreant Corey Adams was missing.   His family tried to file a missing persons report soon after he went  missing,   It took eight days before the police determined he met the critical  missing persons criteria, a crucial delay. 18 days after his  disappearance, Corey Adams' body was recovered from Dineen Park, one  mile from his mother's home.   No family should have to suffer a tragedy like this. This Sunday  would have been Corey's 50th birthday.   In the aftermath of this tragedy, Wisconsin became the first state to  enact a green alert system to find veterans who are reported missing.  Delaware, Tennessee, and Texas have since enacted laws to do so, and  other states are currently looking to do the same.   When a Veteran goes missing, we should ensure that we have their 6.
