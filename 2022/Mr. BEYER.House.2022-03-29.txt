 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  bipartisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act which includes the Legacy  IRA Act. This legislation, led by my colleague Mike Kelly and I, would  encourage charitable giving by American seniors. Donating to charity is  a hallmark of American society. We are fortunate to have one of the  most generous countries in the world. In spite of, or possibly because  of, the upheavals in recent years, we have seen increases in American  charitable giving to the highest levels in our history.   We must do all we can to encourage this impulse, particularly among  middle-income seniors who wish to continue giving post-retirement. The  Legacy IRA Act would enable seniors to make tax-free contributions from  their traditional IRAs to charities through life-income plans. This  bill is a win-win, for philanthropic seniors who want to continue  giving, and for charitable organizations that benefit from donations. I  would like to thank Chairman Neal for his support in including this  measure in the SECURE Act and Rep. Kelly for his partnership on this  important legislation.
