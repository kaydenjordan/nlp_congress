 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also  want to thank Chairwoman McCollum and Ranking Member Joyce for working  with me on this very important amendment.   In North Carolina's Eighth Congressional District, we are fortunate  to have the Uwharrie National Forest. Throughout my time in Congress, I  have heard horror stories from my constituents of the danger of the  public roads within the Uwharrie National Forest.   I have seen these roads firsthand and can testify to the critical  need of paving these roads.   My amendment works towards improving and maintaining these roads and  assuring public access to this State treasure.   One of my constituents had a heart attack, and the ambulance couldn't  get down the road because of the ruts and the washouts. Thankfully, the  desperate, resourceful paramedics got out of the ambulance and sprinted  down the road with a stretcher.   Another one of my constituents, their house burned to the ground  because the road was so impassable, a firetruck couldn't get down to  put out the blaze.   These are just a few of the examples of the severe public safety  concerns that my constituents are facing due to the inability of the  Park Service to maintain these roads.   It is unacceptable, and it is one reason why I have worked so hard to  advocate on behalf of Uwharrie National Forest and advocate for more  resources for the Park Service in general.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the Chief of the Forest Service, Ms.  Christiansen, for her attention to this issue and for working with me  to address this public safety crisis.   In addition, Mr. Chair, I want to, again, thank Chairwoman McCollum  for her work to increase funding for road construction in this  legislation.   I will continue to work and stress the urgency of this issue until my  constituents are safe. It is my duty as a Congressman to get this done.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as  the en bloc.
