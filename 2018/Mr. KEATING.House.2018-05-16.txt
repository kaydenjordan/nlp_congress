 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement  and many distinguished accomplishments of Captain Timothy A. Tobiasz,  Commanding Officer of the United States Coast Guard Air Station Cape  Cod, Massachusetts.   Captain Tobiasz has honorably served our country with over 32 years  of Active-Duty military service. His career began in the U.S. Army as a  Black Hawk assault pilot, where he served in the 9th Cavalry Brigade,  9th Infantry Division ``Old Reliables'' at Fort Lewis, Washington.   In 1991, he was accepted to the United States Coast Guard's Officer  Candidate School, commissioning as an ensign in 1992.   From there, he quickly rose to the rank of captain, and during his  32-year military career, Captain Tobiasz amassed over 7,000 flight  hours and qualified in nine different aircraft, to include the MH-60  Jayhawk, MH-90 Hornet, HC-130 Hercules, MH-65 Dolphin, and the HC-144  Ocean Sentry.   He served at Coast Guard Air Stations Clearwater, Florida; San Diego,  California; HITRON-10 Kodiak, Alaska; New Orleans, Louisiana; Savannah,  Georgia; and Cape Cod, Massachusetts; and as the commanding officer of  two bases.   In addition to his remarkable aviation career, Captain Tobiasz served  in the U.S. Senate as a military liaison officer, as a budget and  program reviewer at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, a senior military  adviser to the U.S. Northern Command/NORAD combatant commander, and a  National Security Fellow at the Harvard University's John F. Kennedy  School of Government.   Of his many outstanding achievements during his storied career, I  would like to highlight three.   In 1999, then-Lieutenant Tobiasz was one of only six pilots selected  to pioneer Helicopter Interdiction Squadron 10. This successful concept  led to one of the most significant policy changes in Coast Guard  aviation history through the development of the aviation use of force  policy and establishment of a permanent command in Jacksonville,  Florida, now responsible for armed counterdrug operations around the  entire globe.   In 2005, while serving as the operations officer at Coast Guard Air  Station New Orleans, Lieutenant Commander Tobiasz led rescue operations  during and immediately after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast,  and in a 10-day period, aircrews under his leadership saved over 1,400  lives.   Most recently and just last year, Captain Tobiasz was called upon  again to lead air rescue operations following landfall of Hurricane  Harvey over Texas and Louisiana. Thanks in great part to his  extraordinary coordination and unflappable judgment, he strategically  directed 53 aircraft and 415 aviation personnel for 21 different units,  saving lives of over 1,700 civilians.   Mr. Speaker, I join a very grateful Nation in thanking Captain  Timothy Tobiasz and his family for their service and sacrifice, and  wish them the absolute very best in their next careers.                            ____________________
