 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the select  committee on China.   As a 23-year veteran of the United States Navy and a former Navy SEAL  commander, I am acquainted with China and its looming threat. Without  question, China's actions represent a threat not only to national  security but also our environment.   As Secretary of the Interior, I led a delegation of officials to the  Pacific Islands and witnessed firsthand China's intentions. I can tell  you, their intentions are clear: control and dominance in the South  China Sea and the hemisphere.   It should be noted that China has the largest standing Navy, greater  than the United States. They have stolen U.S. technology and have  increased their capacity for nuclear weapons. China continues to  threaten democracies, such as Taiwan, the Philippines, and even our  territories.   On the environmental front, the People's Republic of China is the  world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases; the largest source of  marine debris; the worst perpetrator of illegal, unreported, and  unregulated fishing; and is the world's largest consumer of trafficked  wildlife and timber products. In fact, 90 percent of the world's  plastics found in oceans comes from four rivers in China.   China's actions today represent a clear and present danger, and they  use any means available to them--blackmail, data hacking, and  espionage.   It is time to act in a bipartisan way, and I strongly urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this  critical bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a select committee  to investigate the weaponization of the Federal Government, something I  have a lot of experience with firsthand.   I proudly served as the 52nd Secretary of the Interior. Despite the  deep state's repeated attempts to stop me, I stand before you as a duly  elected Member of the United States Congress and tell you that a deep  state exists and is perhaps the strongest covert weapon the left has  against the American people.   There is no doubt the Federal Government deep state coordinates with  liberal activists and uses politicians and willing media to carry their  water.   The deep state runs secret messaging campaigns with one goal in mind:  to increase its power to censor and persuade the American people.   Dark money groups funded by liberal billionaires and foreign  investors funnel money to shell organizations and repeatedly attempt to  destroy the American West. In many cases, they want to wipe out the  American cowboy completely, remove public access to our lands, and turn  Montana into a national park. They want to control our land and our  lifestyle.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two parts of a five-part series  of investigative articles by the Capital Research Center titled:  ``Arabella's Long War: Web of `Pop-Up' Groups'' and ``Arabella's Long  War: `Keep it in the Ground.' ''             [From the Capital Research Center, Nov. 12, 2021]     Arabella's Long War: Web of ``Pop-Up'' Groups--How Leftist ``Dark   Money'' Activists Brought Down Trump's Secretary of the Interior and            Paved the way for Biden's Radical Environmentalists                             (By Hayden Ludmig)                          A Web of ``Pop-Up'' Groups         Enter Arabella Advisors, a consulting firm based in       Washington, DC, that quietly runs arguably the most powerful       activist and lobbying network in politics. Arabella manages       four in-house nonprofits collectively called the ``sisters,''       each of which controls a small army of activists and a legion       of ``pop-up'' groups. And each pop-up group is made to look       like a slick, stand-alone website. These pop-ups target       virtually every issue in politics--control of the courts,       abortion access, gun control, and voter registration and       mobilization, even the Trump-Russia collusion hoax--pushing       left-wing policies in every corner. What makes Arabella so       powerful is how these ``pop-ups'' deceive individuals into       believing they represent genuine local grassroots interests,       such as one pop-up in Alaska created to oppose creation of       the Pebble Mine run from Arabella's plush offices in DC.        Arabella's network is extraordinarily well-funded. In 2019       alone, the four ``sisters'' reported total revenues exceeding       $730 million and poured out $648 million. Between the       network's creation in 2006 and its Form 990 filing for 2019       (the latest available), Arabella's empire has received more       than $3 billion and spent nearly $2.5 billion. Most of that       funding was directed to the network's flagship 501(c)(3)       nonprofit, the New Venture Fund, whose largest known donors       include the Gates, Ford, Hewlett, Packard, and Buffett       Foundations.        Beginning in 2017, Arabella turned its guns on Trump's       Department of the Interior using a pop-up pair: Western       Values Project (WVP) and its ``sister,'' Western Values       Project Action (WVPA).        According to their websites, WVP and WVPA were created in       2013 in Helena, Montana, to expose corrupt corporate       lobbyists preying on public lands in the West. In reality,       WVP is run by the 501(c)(3) New Venture Fund while WVPA is       run by the 501(c)(4) Sixteen Thirty Fund, Arabella's in-house       lobbying shop. Whatever staff the groups actually have would       have been paid by one of Arabella's nonprofits or possibly by       Arabella Advisors itself; we'll likely never know. But in its       2018 Form 990, New Venture Fund revealed that it is the       ``paymaster'' for Sixteen Thirty Fund (which reported zero       employees on its own 2018 Form 990) and ``pays the salary and       immediately invoices Sixteen Thirty Fund, which reimburses       the full amount.''        It's common for groups to use both kinds of nonprofit to       maximize their ability to lobby through the 501(c)(4) and       raise non-lobbying funds through the 501(c)(3), since donors       may deduct donations to the 501(c)(3) from their taxes. But       Arabella takes that tactic to another level, using pop-up       fronts for its nonprofits that can take advantage of the New       Venture and Sixteen Thirty Fund's respective tax advantages       without disclosing their relationship to one another.       Donations to WVP and WVPA in fact benefitted the Arabella-run       nonprofits behind the projects, as an archived version of       WVP's website from October 2019 reveals.        Until late 2019 the website for WVP and WVPA revealed a       handful of staffers, including Chris Saeger, ex-      communications director for the Montana Democratic Party and       former Service Employees International Union (SEIU) staffer;       Jayson O'Neill, a Democratic staffer for Montana's       legislature and Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D); and Yetta Stein, a       staffer for the left-wing political action committee End       Citizens United and staffer for the 2018 reelection campaign       Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT). The archived website also showed a       small advisory board consisting of:        Kjersten Forseth, a former chief of state for Colorado       State Senate Democrats, former director of the left-wing       strategy group ProgressNow Colorado, political director for       the Colorado AFL-CIO, and chief political strategist for       Rocky Mountain Voter Outreach, a Denver-based get-out-the-      vote and ballot initiative firm.        Kent Salazar, an environmental health manager for       Albuquerque, New Mexico, former New Mexico State game       commissioner for Gov. Bill Richardson (D), and a board member       for the left-wing National Wildlife Federation.        Pat Smith, a lawyer representing Indian tribes in Montana,       member of the 2010 Montana Redistricting Commission, and       appointee of Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) to the Northwest       Power and Conservation Council.        WVP's advisory board also included Caroline Ciccone, who in       2019 was executive director of the New Venture Fund pop-up       and anti-Trump ``oversight'' group Restore Public Trust.       Ciccone is a former communications director for the       Democratic National Committee (DNC), Obama appointee to the       U.S. Small Business Administration, and Democratic       strategist. From 2014 to 2017 she led Americans United for       Change (AUFC), a top left-wing strategy group whose national       field director Scott Foval was recorded in late 2016 by       undercover journalists from Project Veritas bragging that       AUFC had paid mentally ill and homeless people to instigate       violence at Trump campaign rallies. ``We know that Trump's       people will [tend to]  [[Page H137]]       freak the f-- out,'' Foval said in the video. ``It is not       hard to get some of these a------- to `pop off.' '' The       scandal ultimately led back to Robert Creamer, co-founder of       the powerful consulting firm Democracy Partners and a former       general consultant to AUFC who directed parts of a vast       network of advocacy groups all aligned in support of Hillary       Clinton's presidential bid. This led to speculation that his       firm helped Clinton's campaign violate collusion laws. Foval       described Creamer's role in the scandal as the ``kingpin''       who is ``diabolical, and I love him for it.'' Within days of       the video's release Creamer resigned, and Foval was fired.        Also present was Kyle Herrig, a New Venture Fund board       member who sat on the advisory boards of at least five New       Venture Fund projects, including American Oversight, a       judicial activist and litigation group; Allied Progress,       which attacked Trump cabinet officials; and the Ciccone-run       Restore Public Trust.        In early 2020 it was announced that Western Values Project       and these three Arabella ``pop-ups'' were being rolled into a       new organization: Accountable.US, itself a former New Venture       Fund project fully established as an independent nonprofit       sometime later that year, headed by president Kyle Herrig and       executive director Caroline Ciccone. (It appears that Western       Values Project Action remains a project of Sixteen Thirty       Fund, but that remains unclear as of writing.)        This reveals that Western Values Project, far from being a       grassroots group, is enmeshed in a deeply networked, highly       coordinated cabal of professional activists--and it always       was.                                   ____              [From the Capital Research Center, Nov. 12, 2021]    Arabella's Long War: ``Keep It in the Ground''--How Leftist ``Dark   Money'' Activists Brought Down Trump's Secretary of the Interior and            Paved the Way for Biden's Radical Environmentalists                             (By Hayden Ludwig)         Summary: For years ``dark money'' activists ran a       coordinated campaign to sabotage and undermine the Trump       administration from the offices of Arabella Advisors in       Washington, DC. The campaign culminated in the most extreme       environmentalist regime in American history under President       Joseph Biden. This report goes inside that campaign to       destroy Trump's Department of the Interior and promote the       Left's war on affordable energy.        In 2019, the Capital Research Center's groundbreaking       report on Arabella Advisors exposed the half-billion-dollar       network for the first time, dragging Arabella into the       limelight as the posterchild of the Left's ``dark money.''       Since then we've continued to uncover this now $730 million       activist empire, tracing its shadowy campaigns on everything       from abortion on demand to packing the Supreme Court to its       war on the Trump administration.        This report on the Arabella network examines the       professional Left's years-long campaign to undermine       President Donald Trump's Department of the Interior, laying       the groundwork for the Biden administration's crusade against       oil and the most radical environmentalist policies in       American history .                          ``Keep It in the Ground''         The U.S. Department of the Interior is primarily       responsible for managing roughly 450 million acres of federal       land and conservation of their natural resources, most       critically the nation's vast reserves of oil and natural gas.       It manages hundreds of dams and reservoirs, regulates       drilling on public lands, runs the National Park Service, and       maintains public monuments, including dozens attacked by       radical Black Lives Matter activists in 2020.        The department also plays a role in foreign diplomacy and       national security. Under President Trump that included       international wildlife trafficking bans, encouraging trade of       precious metals and rare earths, and promoting his Indo-      Pacific security and economic strategy.        But the department's openness to expanding oil and gas       production brought the sharpest attacks from the Left. Since       the department is entirely under the president's purview,       halting all drilling on public land is far easier than       attempting to halt private oil and gas production       nationwide--the radical Left's ultimate goal.        ``The natural place to start phasing out supply is on our       public lands and oceans where a ban on new leasing will keep       up to 450 billion tons of carbon pollution in the ground,''       Center for Biological Diversity director Kieran Suckling said       in 2015. Bill McKibben, founder of the ultra-leftist 350.org,       has also stated that ``public lands are one of the easiest       places for us to control the flow of carbon into the       atmosphere.''        Unsurprisingly, that's been the policy of Democratic       presidents and their activist allies for years. President       Barack Obama canceled lease sales in the Artic and Atlantic       offshore sites and banned the leasing of coal on federal       lands. Phasing down ``extraction of fossil fuels from our       public lands'' was in the Democratic Party's 2016 platform.       That same year a 350.org activist asked Democratic       presidential nominee Hillary Clinton what she meant by       ``extraction on public lands is a done deal?'' Clinton       replied, ``That's where [President Obama] is moving: No       future extraction. I agree with that.'' Her running mate,       Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, later assured another 350.org       activist that ``I actually am now in that position.''        But even ``phasing down'' is too conservative for today's       ``keep it in the ground'' Left. No less than 20 Democratic       presidential hopefuls vowed to ban drilling on public lands       outright during their party's 2020 primary. Ever the pawn of       the radical Left, on January 27, 2021--exactly one week after       his inauguration--President Biden indefinitely suspended       development of new oil and gas wells on public lands, which       the left-leaning San Francisco Chronicle cheered as ``a first       step to halting the granting of federal drilling leases       permanently.''        Why does this matter? Federal lands account for roughly 24       percent of America's oil, natural gas, and coal production.       In 2019, total crude oil production reached an all-time high       of 4.471 billion barrels, with a significant chunk of that       growth coming from oil drilled on federal lands. Biden's ban       blocks future development of these key resources, removing       them from the supply stream and hampering the energy       independence the United States struggled to achieve in recent       years. This means higher gasoline and household electricity       prices, an estimated $11.3 billion in lost federal royalties       and rental fees, and the destruction of hundreds of thousands       of jobs across the economy.        With a single executive order, the Left could advance its       crusade to ``keep it in the ground'' for years in the name of       global warming. The stakes couldn't be higher--all that stood       in its way was the Trump administration.     We all knew politics was ugly, but we need to investigate  and uncover corruption no matter where it lies. It is time to bring  light to the shadows of the deep state and do our duty.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  critical piece of oversight investigations.
