 Mr. President, I appreciate very much my colleague from  Florida's continued focus on the need to fully account for what went  wrong with the Biden administration's horribly botched withdrawal from  Afghanistan; however, I regret that I must oppose his amendment because  this is not the right venue for establishing a committee of this  nature.   In the coming months, we are going to consider the annual National  Defense Authorization Act, and important oversight issues such as the  ones raised in the amendment by the gentleman from Florida should be  debated within that context and that framework.   This legislative effort to remove outdated authorities that were put  in place two decades ago for a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq to  prevent them from abuse in the future has to be kept, in my estimation,  as clean as possible to enable them to be signed into law without  further delay.   As I said before, by allowing these authorizations to live on long  past their original purpose, Congress has forfeited the power to  authorize military force to the executive branch.   I know my colleague from Florida cares deeply about oversight issues,  as evidenced by this amendment, so I hope he and I can work together  both to pass a clean repeal of these two outdated authorizations and  then discuss  [[Page S988]]  robust oversight measures for Afghanistan within the confines of the  NDAA process.   In closing, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment  in order to keep this bill a clean repeal of the 1991 and 2002  authorizations.                           Vote on Amendment No. 13     I ask for the yeas and nays.
