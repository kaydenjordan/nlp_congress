 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, our colleague across the aisle a moment ago talked about  the District of Columbia being special. There is nothing special about  being second class, which is what has happened to the residents of the  District. For two centuries, the people of the District of Columbia  have been disenfranchised, denied fair representation, excluded from  our great democratic experiment. Over 700,000 residents--who just like  my constituents and your constituents--work hard, pay their taxes, and  contribute every day to the betterment of our society. Yet, they do not  have an equal voice in this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to remedy this great injustice. Eleanor  Holmes Norton should have the same opportunity that every one of our  Members does: To see her name on that board for every vote, to walk  into the well and cast her ``yea'' or ``nay'' on behalf of the  constituents she represents.   We thank Congresswoman Norton for her service and for her tireless  fight to bring dignity to the residents of Washington, D.C.   House Democrats committed to this moment when this body passed H.R. 1  more than a year ago. We observed then and we reiterate today: There  are no constitutional, historical, financial, or economic reasons why  the 700,000 Americans who live in the District of Columbia should not  be granted Statehood.   At a time when Americans of all political stripes are demanding a  greater voice and participation in the political town square, the  residents of D.C. are being forcibly kept out of the town square by  this bizarre and indefensible anachronism.   Today, we are declaring enough is enough. It is time to give a voice  and a vote to the residents of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 51.
