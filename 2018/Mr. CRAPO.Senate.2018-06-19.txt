 Mr. President, I first thank Senator Alexander for the  great efforts he has undergone to bring this legislation forward.   The Senate is working as it should. We are processing amendments.  Hopefully, we will make it through all of our appropriations bills this  year and go back to regular order so that we avoid the kinds of  collisions we have had all too often in the past few years as we try to  accomplish the business of our government.   As we have been told, the next amendment planned to be voted on in  the next few minutes, we hope, is the Crapo-Whitehouse amendment. This  amendment is one that focuses on our nuclear energy in the United  States.   Nuclear energy is a carbon-free emissions source of energy. It is  becoming recognized as one of the more important parts of the energy  solution in the United States, and our amendment does a very simple  thing. It creates a pilot project at the Idaho National Laboratory to  begin perfecting and implementing the process of processing spent naval  fuel into fuel that can be utilized in our new, advanced reactors.   Currently, when naval fuel from our reactors in our Navy ships is  spent, it still has about 80 percent of its value or its energy in it.  The new, advanced reactors need about a 20-percent level. So we can  literally get about four times as much fuel out of a spent naval fuel  rod for new, advanced reactors as is in the rod itself, once it is  ready for processing.   This is a tremendous source of new energy for the United States and  one that should help us as we move forward in developing an ``all of  the above'' energy policy for the United States. I encourage my  colleagues, when we have the opportunity to vote for this, to support  it and help us to move forward in this important part of our national  energy policy.
