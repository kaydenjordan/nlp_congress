(D) Recommendations and guidelines to help maintain and       continuously upgrade tools, capabilities, and services       provided under such program.        (E) Recommendations for using the data collected by such       program for creating a common framework for data analytics,       visualization of enterprise-wide risks, and real-time       reporting.        (F) Recommendations for future efforts and activities,       including for the rollout of new tools, capabilities and       services, proposed timelines for delivery, and whether to       continue the use of phased rollout plans, related to securing       networks, devices, data, and information technology assets       through the use of such program.        (3) Form.--The strategy required under subparagraph (A)       shall be submitted in an unclassified form, but may contain a       classified annex.        (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the development       of the strategy required under subsection (b), the Secretary       of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representative a report on cybersecurity risk posture based       on the data collected through the continuous diagnostics and       mitigation program under subsection (g) of section 230 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added by subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Office of Management and Budget  and the Department of Homeland Security  [[Page H7794]]  released a report on the cybersecurity risks faced by Federal agencies.  Among the findings of that report was that almost 75 percent of our  Federal agencies are vulnerable to cyber threats, in large part due to  their inability to understand cybersecurity risks and, therefore, to  properly prioritize resources.   Mr. Speaker, it is statistics like this that should make the state of  our Nation's cyber readiness and resilience deeply troubling to all of  us. And it is one of the main reasons that DHS' Continuous Diagnostics  and Mitigation, or CDM, program has been one of my top priorities  during my time as chairman of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Protection Subcommittee. That is because CDM has the potential to  provide solutions to this problem by dramatically increasing visibility  across Federal networks, thereby dramatically improving the ability of  DHS, OMB, and agency security officers to better understand the  technology assets being utilized across their agencies.   Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, looking across all networks and  systems the Federal Government owns and operates, it comes down to  fingers on government keyboards, whether they be laptops, desktops,  tablets, servers, or in data centers.                                time  1715    We need to know what we have before we can try to defend it.   That is why the CDM program is so crucial to the cybersecurity  posture of our Federal Government. Through its phased rollout, CDM  requires DHS to provide agencies with the capabilities to collect the  cybersecurity risk information necessary to make better decisions. It  not only allows the ability to combat our enemies in cyberspace, but  also to help Federal CIOs manage information technology.   The security data that CDM capabilities and tools collect will help  Federal CIOs and DHS make smarter choices about where taxpayer dollars  are going and to understand some of the most basic questions a  cybersecurity expert faces, including what devices are on the network.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 is necessary to codify the CDM program at DHS  and ensure that these authorities will exist to allow the continued  progress of this essential cybersecurity program.   Making sure that Federal agencies have access to the tools and  capabilities they need to defend their networks and getting DHS the  data to understand cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, and to  coordinate our Federal network defenses, are paramount concerns in this  technological age.   My goal, and the goal of the bipartisan group of cosponsors  supporting H.R. 6443, is to help boost the long-term success of the CDM  program.   This bill also ensures that this program keeps pace with the cutting- edge capabilities being developed in the private sector, thereby  avoiding the type of vendor lock that has previously been a problem. In  that way, this bill ensures that we will be modernizing and updating  our systems before they become legacy technologies unsupported by  vendors and at even greater risk of being exploited by our digital  adversaries.   It is DHS' CDM program that will help Federal agencies and the whole  of the Federal Government to understand the threats they face and the  risks that these vulnerabilities pose in real time. Authorizing the CDM  program will further DHS' role in the cybersecurity mission throughout  our government and will continue to strengthen and elevate this  important program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friends across  the aisle, Ranking Member Thompson and Congressman Langevin, for their  support of this bill. I would like to thank the ranking member of the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, Mr. Richmond,  for cosponsoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this is, very simply, commonsense legislation that will  strengthen our Nation's cybersecurity posture and thereby strengthen  our Nation's national security.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6443,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
