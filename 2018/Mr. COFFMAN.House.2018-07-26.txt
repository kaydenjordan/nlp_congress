 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5515, the  John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  I wish to thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, Chairman  McCain, Senator Inhofe, and Ranking Member Reed for their leadership  throughout the conferencing of this bill. The bill contains a number of  significant policy and funding initiatives that continue our commitment  to maintaining military personnel and family readiness.   To that end, this bill:   Increases end strength across the Services and reserve components  allowing the military services to increase mission readiness while  reducing strain on service members and their families;   Extends pay and bonuses for service members in high demand fields,  providing the military services with necessary tools to attract and  retain critical talent;   Improves the Transition Assistance Program to ensure that service  members who are leaving the military receive training and resources  tailored to their post-military career plans;   Requires a comprehensive review of wounded warrior care and mental  health care services, ensuring the highest possible quality of care to  those who have sacrificed for our nation;   The bill also continues to provide oversight of critical issues,  including additional protections for victims of sexual harassment,  improvements to the Department of Defense's process for reporting  crimes to the FBI database, and the establishment of a Department of  Defense prescription drug monitoring program to share information with  state drug monitoring programs.   In conclusion, I want to thank my fellow conferees for their  contributions to this truly bi-partisan conference report, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to support its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the installation  of the 7/20 Memorial in the city of Aurora. This memorial is dedicated  to those who lost their lives, the wounded, and the countless families  impacted by the theater shooting tragedy.   On July 20th, 2012, 13 members of our community were killed and 70  more were injured when a lone gunman senselessly opened fire in a  crowded movie theater. This crime devastated our community, the  families who lost loved ones, as well as those who suffered lifelong  injuries.   On July 27, 2018, the city of Aurora is dedicating a memorial  designed by the world renown artist, Douwe Blumberg. Mr. Blumberg's  piece is titled: Ascentiate. The sculpture displays 83 cranes  outstretched in flight to represent the victims of the shooting.  Thirteen clear cranes in the middle of the garden represent those who  lost their lives.   This memorial is designed to provide comfort for those in need. Let  us all remember this tragedy by recognizing the 7/20 Memorial and the  memorial foundation for commemorating the victims and their families.                            ____________________
