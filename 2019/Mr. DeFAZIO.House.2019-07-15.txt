 Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Representative  Malinowski for bringing this forward.   Again, I have long expressed concern about the cozy relationship  between the United States and Saudi Arabia across a number of  Presidencies, both Democrat and Republican. For years, we have turned a  blind eye toward their human rights abuses at home, their repression of  women, and their export of radical Wahhabism, destabilizing the Middle  East, Pakistan, and, now, up into the Balkans.   It is long past time for the United States to take action, but Trump  has taken the U.S. blind eye toward Saudi abuses to a new extreme. He  and Pompeo have cozied up to Mohammad bin Salman, who was, according to  U.S. intelligence agencies, European intelligence agencies, and, now, a  report from the United States, involved in the brutal murder of a U.S.  resident, a noted journalist because he had the temerity to write  articles critical of His Highness MBS.    And what does Trump do? He goes to Saudi Arabia. He does the sword  dance. He calls them up on the phone and cozies up to them day after  day after day.   This legislation here in the House will help to begin to right the  wrongs of the past, right the wrongs of this administration, and to  send a strong message to the Saudis that what they are doing in Yemen  is not acceptable, what they are doing throughout the Middle East and  other parts of the world, exporting radical Wahhabism and  destabilizing, murder is not acceptable. None of these things are  acceptable.  [[Page H5800]]    The President wants to arm them. We need to disarm this relationship  and hold them accountable.
