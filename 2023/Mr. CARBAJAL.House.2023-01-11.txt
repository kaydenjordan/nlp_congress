 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Representative for the  central coast of California, which has endured some of the worst storms  and flooding in recent memory, to say thank you.   Thank you to our firefighters, our emergency crews, our search and  rescue teams, our law enforcement officers, and all of our first  responders and local leaders who have stepped up to save lives and  protect property in our communities.   I share one story of this effort. On Monday, members of the Lompoc  Fire Department reacted quickly to save a couple from rising flood  waters.   As they carried out the rescue, they discovered that moments before,  the woman had given birth. Thanks to the quick work of the Lompoc Fire  Department, all three were rescued and are resting safely.   Mr. Speaker, our first responders have stepped up to avert further  disaster this week, and I am proud today to take a moment to recognize  their service in the permanent Record of this body.                            ____________________
