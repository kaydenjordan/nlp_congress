 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  Stuart MacVean, president and CEO of Savannah River Nuclear Solutions,  who will be retiring today.   Stuart has led SRNS since 2016, and since that time has overseen  numerous successes and unprecedented growth at the Savannah River site.   Under his leadership, SRNS has made significant strides in its  development of the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility, the  American plutonium pits for nuclear deterrence. The site has also begun  shipping downblended surplus plutonium to achieve progress in its  environmental remediation and cleanup activities.   His contributions have made South Carolina, and our neighbor Georgia,  safer. I offer best wishes to Stuart and his wife, Kelly, for continued  success.   Welcome to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of our valued ally Italy to  Washington.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
