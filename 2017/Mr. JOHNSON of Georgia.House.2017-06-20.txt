 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Nadler for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1393, the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax  Simplification Act of 2017, is an important, bipartisan bill that will  help workers and small businesses across the country--large businesses,  also.   As the proud sponsor of this legislation in both the 110th and 111th  Congresses, I am very familiar with how hard legislators on both sides  of the aisle have worked since then to bring this bill to this point. I  want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman Bob  Goodlatte, for ushering this bill to the House to this point, and I ask  my colleagues to please vote in favor of this legislation.   H.R. 1393 would provide for a uniform and easily administrable law  that will simplify the patchwork of existing inconsistent and confusing  State rules. It would also reduce administrative costs to the States  and lessen compliance burdens on consumers.   Take my home State of Georgia as an example. If an Atlanta-based  employee of a St. Louis company travels to headquarters on a business  trip once a year, that employee would be subject to Missouri tax, even  if the annual visit only lasts for 1 day. However, if that employee  travels to Maine, her trip would only be subject to tax if her trip  lasts for 10 days. If she travels to New Mexico on business, she would  only be subject to tax if she was in the State for 15 days.   Acuity Brands is a leading Georgia-based lighting manufacturer that  employs over 1,000 associates and has over 3,200 associates nationwide  who travel extensively across the country for training, conferences,  and other business.   In a letter in support of a prior, nearly identical version of this  bill, Richard Reece, Acuity's executive vice president, writes that  current State laws are numerous, varied, and often changing, requiring  that the company expend significant resources merely interpreting and  satisfying States' requirements. He concludes that ``unified, clear  rules and definitions for nonresident reporting and withholding  obligations would undoubtedly improve compliance rates, and it would  strike the correct balance between State sovereignty and ensuring that  America's modern mobile workforce is not unduly encumbered.''   We should heed the concerns of Acuity, and numerous other businesses  across the country, by enacting H.R. 1393 into law.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    With over 57 cosponsors during this Congress,  it is clear that the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification  Act of 2017 is an idea whose time has come.    I thank my colleagues for their work on this bill and, in particular,  Congressman Bishop, for his leadership on this bill in the 115th  Congress. He has carried the torch for our esteemed former colleague,  the late Howard Coble, who passed this bill out of the House in the  112th Congress.   I also thank our staffs, who have worked tirelessly to build support  for this legislation along bipartisan lines.   This bill is a testament to the good that can come from working  across the aisle on bipartisan tax fairness reforms. I am optimistic  that the passage of H.R. 1393 augurs well for the passage of other e- fairness legislation, which is critical to countless small businesses  across the country, during this Congress.  [[Page H4950]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.    I urge my colleagues in the Senate to bring  this bill up for a vote soon. This country's employees and businesses  deserve quick action.    Mr. Speaker, the United States has been a  leader welcoming refugees for decades. Refugees seek our shores to  escape war, political and religious persecution, and sometimes fear of  imminent death. People flee danger seeking refuge and safety. As  Americans, we should be the last to perpetuate an environment that  causes refugees to live in a state of fear and terror right here in  America.   I represent the residents of Clarkston, Georgia. As a refugee  resettlement hub, Clarkston is often referred to as the most diverse  square mile in America. Clarkston's refugees have established  themselves as taxpayers; they have started thriving businesses; and 91  percent obtain jobs and become completely self-sufficient within 6  months of arriving in the U.S.   The great diversity and cultural richness that they bring to our  communities has made the Fourth District a better place to live, work,  and play. Today we show our support for refugees. Today we should all  stand to send a message that we will continue our work to support  refugees as they continue to boost local economies and contribute to  our communities with their unique and enriching cultures.                            ____________________
