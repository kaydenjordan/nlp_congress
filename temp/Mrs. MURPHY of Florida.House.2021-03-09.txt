 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my  amendment in the en bloc package. If it is approved, I will vote for  the bill.   The PRO Act aims to protect the right of workers to decide whether to  form a union that can negotiate with their employer over working  conditions. It proceeds from the principle that America is stronger  when the middle class is stronger, and the middle class is stronger  when unions are stronger.   This principle is personal to me. I grew up in Virginia, and my dad  worked at a power plant and he was in a union. He was a refugee from  Vietnam. He had an incredible work ethic, but he struggled with English  and relied on the union to fight for him to have a living wage and good  healthcare. This allowed our family to have opportunities we otherwise  wouldn't have had.   There are many provisions in the PRO Act I support. There are also  provisions that give me pause, especially the changes made to the  definitions of employee and joint employer in the National Labor  Relations Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Education and Labor Committee and  Democratic leadership for working  [[Page H1157]]  with me to craft an amendment that addresses my concerns enough for me  to support the PRO Act passage. My amendment requires GAO to prepare a  report on the impact of these two changes on workers in businesses. The  President is required to consider the report, and he can recommend that  Congress modify one or both of these definitions.   My amendment also expresses the sense of the House that Congress  shall consider whether to accept, reject, or modify any recommendations  received from the President. This is called evidence-based  policymaking, and we should do more of it.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for my amendment.
