 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support passage  of the House's second package of appropriations bill for fiscal year  2021 as a proud member of the Appropriations Committee and chair of an  appropriations subcommittee.   The defense division of the bill will safeguard our national security  and give our troops a much-needed pay raise.   I appreciate the inclusion of language to expedite replacement of  PFAS firefighting foams and funding to study their health implications.   The bill also supports research for metastatic cancer and encourages  clinical trials that affect the demographics of our population.                                time  1100    The Commerce-Justice-Science division includes language from my PACE  Act, which I introduced with Congressman Alcee Hastings. Our  legislation seeks to disrupt the distrust and improve communication  between police and communities of color.   I am also proud that my colleague, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, and  I secured $8 million for the Matthew Shepard hate crime investigation  and prosecution grant program that was previously authorized and will  now be funded for the first time.   The bill addresses the growing problem of online child exploitation  by carving out $40 million for Internet Crimes Against Children task  forces.   Funding is also included to research coral reef disease and harmful  algal blooms, two significant problems for sea life in the State of  Florida.   I am particularly proud of the Energy and Water division, as a member  of that subcommittee. The bill funds Everglades restoration projects at  a historic $250 million, a major bipartisan achievement. I am also  grateful for the inclusion of a fix to cut red tape that has delayed  Everglades restoration projects and will allow them to begin. To  protect our investment, the bill includes language that I wrote to  block oil drilling in the Florida Everglades.   I am encouraged that this bill provides increases for the Office of  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and ARPA-E.   I am glad that the Financial Services division includes $500 million  for election security grants for States to fight foreign intervention  because, apparently, the President isn't interested in doing that.   The report also includes language to improve postal security, which  affected my office as well as the offices of Congresswoman Maxine  Waters and numerous other leaders after a failed bombing attempt, an  incident that raised serious postal security concerns.   I am also pleased that the bill includes funding for pool safety  grants that address swimming pool drownings, the number one cause of  accidental death for young children in this country.   Next, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education division  includes vital funding for EARLY Act activities, an initiative I passed  to promote breast cancer awareness for young and at-risk women. I was  diagnosed with breast cancer at 41 years old, and I am proud to say  that I am now approaching my 13th year as a survivor, and I appreciate  the opportunity to make sure we can educate more young women and women  at higher risk of their risk of breast cancer so they pay attention to  their breast health.   Additionally, the bill includes support for Holocaust survivors, who  face countless obstacles as they age.   Further, the bill protects unaccompanied migrant children by ensuring  Members of Congress can visit child detention facilities with no prior  notice--important accountability provisions. Language similar to my  Families, Not Facilities Act was included to help unaccompanied migrant  youth find sponsors.   Finally, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development division  provides investments in our transportation infrastructure and housing  programs. I am glad to see $60 million for housing homeless veterans  who have given so much for this country.   I applaud the inclusion of provisions throughout the minibus to  assert our authority as a coequal branch of government by prohibiting  funds from being stolen by the President to pay for any border wall,  which would be grossly irresponsible.   I thank my fellow subcommittee chairs and, once again, thank  Chairwoman Lowey as she retires from the Appropriations Committee, and  their intrepid staff for the hard work that went into producing this  minibus that takes care of the many needs people of all backgrounds  face in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
