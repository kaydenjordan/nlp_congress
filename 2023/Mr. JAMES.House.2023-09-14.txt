 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to say something that possibly  no one in this Chamber's storied history has ever said: The Detroit  Lions are the best team in football--you heard me--at least after week  one.   The Detroit Lions went into Arrowhead Stadium last week, faced the  2023 Super Bowl champions, and walked away with a W.   Now, it used to be considered child abuse to turn your children into  Lions fans. I have three little boys: John, 9, Hudson, 8, and  Christian, 4. We all love the Lions.   Detroit football is back. When was the last time the Detroit Lions  were the first team to score in the NFL season? When was the last time  that on third and short, we actually ran the ball and made a first  down? When was the last time there was a team on fourth and 25, deep in  their own territory in the fourth quarter, and it not be the Detroit  Lions?   This is an indication that we have turned a new leaf, and the good  days are ahead.   I am 42, and this might be the best year in my football life after  the Michigan Wolverines have beaten the Ohio State Buckeyes 2 years in  a row and the Detroit Lions have only lost two games since last  October.   Now, of course, we need to keep winning under our boy Dan Campbell's  outstanding leadership and his staff, but I know our boys in southeast  Michigan have what it takes to win.   The Detroit Lions' very first game at Ford Field is this Sunday, and  Lions fans, I need you to make this the loudest game in Ford Field  history, even louder than we were when we played the Bears in 2011 on  Monday Night Football. Let's show up and show out.   Lions, I love you. Keep grinding. Let's restore the roar. Let's go  17-0 and not just win the NFC North title but the whole doggone thing.  Let's win the Super Bowl.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for wearing Honolulu blue. Oh, shoot. He is  gone. Well, I appreciate you wearing blue today for the Lions, Mr.  Yakym. Go Lions.                            ____________________
