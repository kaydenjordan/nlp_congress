 Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for December 2019. This is my second scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2020  on September 9, 2019, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. The information  included in this report is current through November 25, 2019.   Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on October 16, 2019, two  measures with significant enforceable budgetary effects have been  enacted. The first, the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020,  and Further Health Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-69), provided  continuing appropriations and extended several authorizing provisions.  Specifically, division A of that law extended discretionary  appropriations through December 20, 2019, and division B extended a  number of health programs, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program, and certain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provisions.  Division B also extended and increased benefits under the U.S. Victims  of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund and repealed a rescission of highway  funding that had been included in the 2015 highway bill. CBO estimated  that division B would increase outlays by $1.1 billion over 10 years.   The second measure with significant budgetary effects to be enacted  was the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act (P.L. 116- 71). This law directed the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue  silver coins to commemorate the women who played a vital role in  rallying support for the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. CBO  estimated that P.L. 116-71 would save $2 million in 2020 and be budget  neutral over the 5- and 10-year windows.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared tables A-D.   Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolution. This information  is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of  the CBA.   The two enacted pieces of legislation that I mentioned earlier led to  the Environment and Public Works Committee, EPW, exceeding its  allocation (P.L. 116-69) and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  Committee generating $2 million in savings in 2020 (P.L 116-71). The  House of Representatives' construction of division B of the P.L. 116- 69, which combined numerous authorizing matters into one division,  contributed to EPW's breach of its allocation. As EPW's highway  rescission repeal provided the largest single budgetary effect, the  entire division's effects were assigned to EPW consistent with  longstanding congressional enforcement practices. It is important to  note that EPW's highway repeal alone was scored by CBO as not producing  an outlay or deficit effect. A detailed discussion of CBO's scoring of  a similar provision is included in CBO's formal August 2019 estimate of  S. 1992, a bill to amend the FAST Act to repeal a rescission of funds,  which was reported earlier this year from EPW.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table shows  that the Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for  current the fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary  spending are $666.5 billion for accounts in the defense category and  $621.5 billion for accounts in the nondefense category of spending. As  no full-year appropriations measures have been enacted for fiscal year  2020, the amounts shown on the table reflect the budgetary authority  effects of advanced or permanent appropriations made available in prior  law.   The 2018 budget resolution contained points of order limiting the use  of changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPs, in appropriations bills.  Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for 2020, shows  the Appropriations Committee has not yet enacted full-year CHIMPs for  this fiscal year.   Table D provides the amount of budget authority enacted for 2020 that  has been designated as either for an emergency or for overseas  contingency operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced  Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. Funding  that receives either of these designations results in cap adjustments  to enforceable discretionary spending limits. There is no limit on  either emergency or overseas contingency operations spending; however,  any senator may challenge the designation with a point of order to  strike the designation on the floor.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   CBO provided a spending and revenue report for 2020, Table 1, which  helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the  latest continuing resolution, which provides funding through December  20, 2019. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget  Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views  current-law levels as being $1,173.2 billion and $668.4 billion below  budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays,  respectively. Details on 2020 levels can be found in CBO's second  table.   Current-law revenues are consistent with the levels assumed by the  budget resolution.   Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's  figures for all enforceable periods.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule, table 3. This rule was established under  section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate PAYGO scorecard  shows that there is currently $2 million in room in 2020 due to the  enactment of the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act.  Please note that the deficit effects of division B of the Further  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Further Health Extenders Act  of 2019 are excluded from the Senate's PAYGO scorecard pursuant to  Title VIII of division B of that law.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on  September 9, 2019. No budgetary points of order have been raised since  that filing.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that this statement and the accompanying  tables be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2020    2020-2024  2020-2029 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Armed Services:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0  [[Page S6853]]    Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:     Budget Authority....................        -2          0          0     Outlays.............................        -2          0          0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Energy and Natural Resources:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Environment and Public Works:     Budget Authority....................     8,058     38,589     77,069     Outlays.............................       415        683      1,130 Finance:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Foreign Relations:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Judiciary:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Rules and Administration:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Intelligence:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Indian Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority................     8,056     38,589     77,069         Outlays.........................       413        683     1,130 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ This table is current through November 25, 2019.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $562 million in budget authority and $854 million in estimated outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenue for off-budget amounts. As a   result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. c Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to   publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first   published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget   has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending   measures pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H.
