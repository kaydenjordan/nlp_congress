 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut is here in  the room and mentioned the bill we have been working on together, the  Fix NICS bill. I want to remind all of us what the motivation was, at  least on my part, for introducing this legislation and express my  gratitude to the Senator from Connecticut, as well as the Democratic  leader Senator Schumer, and others who have cosponsored this  legislation.   It was just a few short months ago when someone murdered 26 people  worshipping in a small church just outside San Antonio in Sutherland  Springs. He had purchased these firearms having lied on the background  check when they asked him whether he was a convicted felon, whether he  was honorably discharged from the military, and whether he had ever  committed any domestic violence. He lied.   If he had told the truth, he would have been prohibited from buying  those firearms and perhaps--maybe, perhaps--he would have been  dissuaded, slowed down, or perhaps would not have committed that  terrible atrocity that day when 26 people lost their lives, and 20 more  were injured.   We have come to find out that the Air Force, which had convicted him  of two of those offenses--domestic violence and the felony--failed to  upload the information that was required in the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System. If they had, then he would not have  gotten away  [[Page S1261]]  with lying because the FBI background check system would have revealed  the truth.   I can state that I have the utmost confidence that if the Fix NICS  law were in effect at the time he was attempting to purchase those  firearms, in all likelihood, he would have been prohibited from  purchasing those guns, and I would conclude from that, lives would have  been saved, and the lives which were changed forever because of the  terrible injuries that the other 20 received would not have been  changed in such a terrible way.   I told myself at the time that I cannot go to another church  service--we went to the church that met in a tent just down the street  from the place where the shooting took place a week after the shooting.  The pastor and his wife who lost their teenage daughter were there. The  wife was distraught, as you can imagine. The pastor summoned a power  that is greater than human power to preach that day. It was emotional,  it was inspirational, but it was a terrible tragedy. I told myself that  day that I never wish to look another family in the face and say we  failed to do everything that was in our power to prohibit or to stop  something like that from happening again.   Fix NICS, as I think people who are familiar with it understand,  basically takes the laws that currently exist and makes sure it is  applied so people like this shooter in Sutherland Springs can't lie  their way out of it and get access to firearms and ruin people's lives  in the process.   I realize it may not be as comprehensive as some people would like.  The problem is around here, if you ignore the things you can agree on  and just look to fight about things you can't agree on, nothing ever  happens--no problems ever get solved. I think a good place to start  would be to pass this bipartisan Fix NICS piece of legislation.   I hope our colleagues would consider it. I understand they have a  different view on some aspects of guns, but what we had here was a  catastrophic failure. We had a systemic failure. The school system  failed, the mental health authorities failed, the local law  enforcement, the Federal law enforcement failed. Our society failed to  provide the tools to identify people who cry out, in essence, on social  media like this young man did when he posted on YouTube essentially the  threat he actually carried out, which was going to go shoot up a  school. When that was referred to the FBI, they didn't follow up on it  and nothing ever happened.   Looking back on this particular young man, he was sending signals out  on a regular basis that he was a ticking timebomb and people were going  to get hurt and potentially die, as they did.   I hope that rather than leave here this week with nothing to show for  our efforts, we would at least agree to pass what enjoys broad  bipartisan support and to perhaps prevent another shooting like that  which occurred at Sutherland Springs.   The President has made clear, thinking now about the Las Vegas  shooting, that he believes bump stocks ought to be regulated by the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I agree with that. So those  are two things we could do, perhaps, that might save lives in the  future, but to just say it is not enough, we ought to do more, and to  fail to do what is within our grasp, which we can agree to, to me,  seems like a bizarre way of doing business, and I think it is an  abdication of our responsibility.   I don't want to see another family who has lost a loved one as a  result of one of these mass shootings that might be prevented by some  action we might take on Fix NICS or the bump stock issue, for example.   There may be other things we need to do. We have done some things,  such as trying to address the mental health challenges that people like  Adam Lanza's mother had. Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, was  obviously mentally ill, but he wouldn't accept the treatment his doctor  prescribed.   What we did last December--during the Obama administration--passed  something called the 21st Century Cures Act, which included a bill I  sponsored called the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, which  encouraged the use of assisted outpatient treatment. For example, if  Adam Lanza's mother couldn't handle her son--he wouldn't take his  medication or comply with doctor's orders--she could go to a civil  court and essentially get a court order requiring him to comply with  his doctor's orders and to take his medication.   Again, I am not suggesting that any one of these in isolation is a  panacea, but there are things we can do step-by-step, bit-by-bit, to  reduce the likelihood that these terrible mass shootings occur in the  future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another note, we heard some great news  yesterday, in terms of our economy. Consumer confidence has jumped to a  17-year high. Optimism continues to surge as employers and payroll  services across the country continue to implement the reforms to our  Tax Code that we passed last December in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   What is more, the Treasury Department has now released the new  withholding tables that went into effect earlier this month and reflect  the changes passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I got a call from someone close to me. I will leave it at that--I  don't want to embarrass her--who said she opened her paycheck, and she  had $240 more in her paycheck than she had in the previous month as a  result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. She didn't regard this as crumbs;  she thought it would make a positive difference in her life.    I think many Americans are having the same experience, seeing an  increase in their take-home pay even in the month of February. As I  said, for some, it is several hundred dollars extra each pay period,  which is money that can be saved for a rainy day or invested for their  retirement or future, or it could be used to pay for their child's  education or to put new tires on their car. A married couple with two  children, making about $75,000 a year, will see an estimated tax cut of  approximately $2,000.   That is just on the individual side. What we are seeing across the  country is greater than just what is happening to single families and  households, though. It is good to see at the micro level or the  personal level, so to speak, what the impact is, but we also have to  see the bigger picture in terms of our economy, the jobs created, the  investment opportunities, and the way to grow our economy, and the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act has had a profound impact on that.   So far, at least 417 companies have announced new investments, pay  raises, bonuses, and charitable contributions. They have added new  employee training and increased contributions to pensions and 401(k)  retirement accounts. According to the White House, more than 4.4  million workers have been positively affected. It is no wonder the tax  law is becoming more and more popular as people have learned more about  it. Even the New York Times has had to agree that the public is  learning to love the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because of the positive  impact on hard-working American lives.   I see the wide-ranging effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in my  State. Thanks to a competitive tax system, for example, Fort Worth- based companies like American Airlines paid large bonuses to their  employees. AT&T, which is headquartered in the Dallas-Fort Worth  Metroplex, paid $1,000 to more than 200,000 men and women across the  country who work for that company. Just as important, AT&T announced $1  billion in capital investments, which could create as many as 7,000  jobs.   Texas also proves that the effects of tax reform are more than just a  one-time-only impact. Waste Management, based in Houston, has already  paid bonuses to drivers and landfill workers, but its CEO emphasized in  an interview that the company will continue to spend money on its  people beyond 2018. ExxonMobil, headquartered in Las Colinas in the  Dallas area, will expand oil production in West Texas. Oncor, one of  the largest investor-owned utilities in the State, will issue future  refunds to customers on their utility bills. And Walmart, which is the  largest employer in Texas, increased starting wages, expanded parental  leave, and offered financial assistance to employees who choose to  adopt.   It is not just the big players, though; small businesses are doing  the same  [[Page S1262]]  thing. In Corpus Christi recently, I visited with the owners of  Groomer's Seafood, who plan to expand distribution facilities serving  thousands of restaurants statewide. American Bank in Corpus Christi is  projecting that it can lend an additional $120 million as a result of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That is money it can lend to small  businesses to grow or start a new business. In San Antonio, my  hometown, Cox Manufacturing will move up construction of a new 8,000- square-foot plant. In Amarillo, up in the Panhandle of Texas, Happy  State Bank made news to go with its name, which is higher hourly pay.  In Lumberton, TX, the women running an engineering company called Leak  Sealers paid tax savings forward to employees, calling on other  businesses to do the same.   Our colleagues here in Washington who voted against the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act made a big mistake. I think they are beginning to realize that  now, as the good news is rolling in. They have mostly kept quiet in  terms of the criticism they lodged against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as  we were debating it because they can't deny the facts, and they can't  deny what is happening all across America--more take-home pay, more  jobs, more money being invested and coming back home from overseas, and  its generally being a very positive piece of legislation.   Some have said--like Ms. Pelosi--that the tax cuts we passed just  help job creators and give crumbs to others, but that is not true.  Individuals will benefit from lower rates across the board. They will  see an increase in the standard deduction and the child tax credit too.   One overlooked part of the law will help bring investments and jobs  to distressed communities, creating opportunity zones in every State.  That is something our colleague Senator Scott championed and made sure  was part of the bill.   So, Mr. President, amidst our pain, anguish, and the horror of  terrible incidents like that which occurred in Parkland, FL, there is  good news to be found, but it is hard to focus on the good news when  our constituents are looking at us and asking what we are going to do  to make sure that the next potential mass shooting is prevented and  that we have done everything in our power to try to stop it. I am not  sure we will be able to stop all of them, but we can stop some of them.  We can make sure that incidents like that which occurred in Sutherland  Springs, TX--that somebody who is already illegally disqualified from  purchasing a firearm doesn't get their hands on one.   Well, we know what we have to do, and what I am asking all of our  colleagues to do--including the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, who  is a cosponsor of Fix NICS, along with the Republican majority leader-- let's do this. Let's pass this bill. We could do it in one day, give  people an opportunity to debate it and vote on it. If we keep looking  for the perfect and make sure that the perfect is somehow the enemy of  the good, we will end up with nothing. But we can't end up with  nothing. America deserves something that will make a difference. The  people in Parkland, FL, and in Sutherland Springs, TX, deserve  something better, and I believe that Fix NICS is the best place to  start.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
