 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of the late Dr. Stephen Prescott, former Oklahoma Medical  Research Foundation president.   Dr. Prescott served OMRF with outstanding leadership for 15 years,  building the institution into what it is today. He dedicated his life  to a scientific career, immersed in medical research, and loved  traveling the world, often in conjunction with his professional  commitments. But what he loved more than anything was his wife of 52  years, Susan, his two children and grandchildren.   During his time at OMRF, Dr. Prescott oversaw the largest campus  expansion in the foundation's history, making the facility one of only  11 Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence in the United States.   Throughout his career, he received numerous awards, authored more  than 250 scientific articles, served on the NIH, and even founded a  biotech company. As a direct result of his many years of hard work  and accomplishments, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in  2020.    Mr. Speaker, Dr. Prescott made an immense impact on OMRF, and as a  result, the lives of thousands of Oklahomans. As a leading facility for  health research, I want Americans to know how instrumental his role was  in creating a facility where researchers are working hard to understand  and develop new treatments for diseases like cancer, heart disease, and  aging.   I am honored to recognize Dr. Prescott, and I am grateful for the  profound impact he has had on my district and far beyond. He will be  greatly missed.                            ____________________
