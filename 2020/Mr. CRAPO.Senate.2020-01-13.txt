 Mr. President, today I honor Idaho veteran Conrad Jeffries  for his service to our nation and for his efforts to address alarmingly  high suicide rates in our country, especially among our Nation's  veterans and servicemembers.   Conrad knows firsthand the personal costs of military service and the  challenges servicemembers face returning to civilian life, and he has  dedicated considerably of his time, talents, and resources to serving  our country and helping his fellow veterans and military families. On  January 12, Conrad Jeffries embarked on a more-than 200 mile run from  Los Angeles to Las Vegas to raise awareness about rising suicide rates  among veterans, Active-Duty servicemembers, and first responders. I  understand his running route is intended to honor three sailors who  committed suicide aboard the U.S.S. George H.W. Bush in September and  promote the use of suicide screening forms to identify the root causes  of and prevent veteran suicides. Conrad has said, ``Veteran suicide is  not the problem. Veteran suicide is the outcome.'' Conrad has  admittedly faced his own personal struggles and has since dedicated his  life to solving veteran suicide. This includes working to help others  who struggle with mental health and substance abuse.   Conrad, who was raised in American Falls and lives in Boise, ID,  served our Nation for 13 years in the Idaho Army National Guard and  U.S. Coast Guard.  [[Page S160]]  His service included deployment with the 116th Combat Brigade and  attachment to Joint Special Operations where he conducted personal  security detachment missions as a convoy commander. In 2013, Conrad  earned Idaho's Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year Award.   I commend Conrad Jeffries for his extraordinary commitment to helping  others through his actions to end suicide. His candid sharing of his  experiences and empathy on the topic is instrumental as work continues  to combat veteran suicide. Suicide prevention, specifically within the  veteran community, has been one of my priorities in Congress. I co-led  in the introduction of S. 1594, the Show Esteem and Respect for  Veterans by Increasing Care and Equity, SERVICE, Act to address the  alarmingly high veteran suicide rates by allowing veterans open access  to mental healthcare at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. I also  joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in asking the U.S.  Department of Defense, DOD, to look for and explain any gaps in  addressing the alarmingly high rates of suicide in the National Guard.   Many well-intended people identify a problem, want to fix it, but get  bogged down trying. Others, like Conrad, just face the obstacles, plow  ahead, work hard, and literally ``run'' to fix it. I wish Conrad well  and thank him for his efforts on behalf of his fellow veterans,  military families, and all Americans to end veteran suicide.                            ____________________
