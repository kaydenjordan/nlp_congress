 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and sister in  service, Representative Tlaib, for cohosting this special session with  me this evening to discuss the critical issue of reproductive justice  in our country.   As chair of the Abortion Rights and Access Task Force in this first- ever pro-choice majority Congress, I am proud to join my colleagues  tonight as we stand up and push back against these unprecedented,  coordinated attacks on our collective reproductive rights and  liberties.   You see, Mr. Speaker, the stakes could not be any higher. Since 2011,  anti-choice politicians have pushed a wave of nearly 450 restrictive  laws through State legislatures and now all the way to the U.S. Supreme  Court. Over the last year alone, they have enacted 25 bans across  dozens of States, pushing comprehensive reproductive healthcare,  including abortion care, further and further out of reach.   They are working overtime to peddle harmful misconceptions and to  legislate abortion out of existence.   As a result, reproductive health facilities have been forced to shut  their doors, forcing individuals to travel across State lines, shoulder  additional financial burdens, and jump through unnecessary and  humiliating hoops just to access comprehensive care.  [[Page H1500]]    Just this morning, I, along with several of my House colleagues,  marched to the Supreme Court to stand in solidarity with the justice  warriors who are on the front lines, fighting for our collective  humanity because, today, the Supreme Court begins deliberations on the  constitutionality of a Louisiana State law that, if upheld by the  Court, would literally shut down every abortion clinic across the State  except for one.   To put this further into perspective, Mr. Speaker, this could leave  just one doctor to provide abortion care for nearly 1 million  individuals of reproductive age across the entire State.   If Louisiana's clinic shutdown law takes effect, it will not only  decimate abortion access in Louisiana, but it will further embolden  State legislatures around the country to do the same.   Additionally, this law is literally identical to the Texas law struck  down by the Court just 3 years ago in the Whole Woman's Health case.   Since the Texas case, the facts certainly haven't changed. The  precedent certainly hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is  the makeup of the Supreme Court, a court that is now filled with judges  who want to strip us of our bodily autonomy.   Laws that restrict reproductive freedom undermine the very nature of  equality and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us.   Every person, every individual, regardless of income, sexual  orientation, or gender identity, deserves equitable access to  comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including queer, trans, and  nonbinary individuals. As I often say, people don't live in checked  boxes; we live in nuance and intersectionality.   Abortion is healthcare. Reproductive justice is economic justice.  Reproductive justice is racial justice.   Mr. Speaker, the stakes are high. Our fundamental human rights and  liberties are not and should not be up for debate.                                time  1730    I am proud to stand here on the floor today to remind the courts that  Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land and that the days of the Hyde  amendment are numbered and that we stand with our partners in  community, the organizers and resisters who are fighting day in and day  out to ensure that every person has the right to self-determination  over their reproductive health.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Again, I thank Representative Tlaib for cohosting the  Special Order hour. This is a joint Special Order hour in partnership  with the Congressional Progressive Caucus and also the Pro-Choice  Caucus. It is exciting that we are the first pro-choice majority  Congress in the history of Congress.   As heartened as I am by those who come here to speak, support, to  affirm our reproductive rights and freedoms, it is shameful that our  reproductive rights are even up for debate. It is 2020. Support for  abortion access is at an all-time high. In fact, nearly 80 percent of  Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. There is not a  single State in the Nation where making abortion illegal is popular.  But here we find ourselves having to fight back against these insidious  efforts to undermine our reproductive rights and freedoms, and we just  keep pushing.   Just last month the House passed legislation to move us one step  closer to ratifying the ERA. So we will just keep speaking out,  organizing, and mobilizing when it comes to equality and justice on all  fronts. I am glad to see so many of our colleagues here tonight pushing  back against these draconian efforts that want to take us backwards. We  won't stand for it--not now, not ever.
