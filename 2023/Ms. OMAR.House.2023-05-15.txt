 Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay my respects to the  celebrated heroes of the Somali Youth League.   On May 15, 1943, 13 brave, young, and bright men founded SYL to  liberate Somalia from colonial control. Their mission was to see a free  and united Somalia and prosperity for its people.   Eighty years later, we cannot forget their sacrifice or let their  deaths be in vain. As Somalis in the diaspora, young or old, or in  Somalia, our call today has to be for unity, for freedom, and for  leadership.   SYL fought for liberty, and we must renew that call to liberate  ourselves from clan mentality, violence, and lead to create a better  tomorrow for all of us.                            ____________________
