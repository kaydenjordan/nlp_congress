 Did your boss, Dr. Bolton--I mean Ambassador       Bolton, tell you that Giuliani was ``a hand grenade''?         What do you think he meant by his       characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade?        Ms. Hill. What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in       the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was       making publicly about the investigations that he was       promoting, that the story line he was promoting, the       narrative he was promoting was going to backfire. I think it       has backfired.    Mr. Manager NADLER. In June, as Ambassador Bolton became aware of Mr.  Giuliani's coordination with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, he told  Dr. Hill and other members of the National Security Council staff that  ``nobody should be meeting with Giuliani.'' But, he, of course, did not  know of the President's plot as to why people were meeting with  Giuliani.   Dr. Hill also testified that Ambassador Bolton was ``closely  monitoring what Mr. Giuliani was doing and the messaging that he was  sending out.'' But Ambassador Bolton was keenly aware that Mr. Giuliani  was doing the President's bidding. That is also why the President fears  his testimony.   During a meeting on June 13, 2019, Ambassador Bolton made clear that  he supported more engagement with Ukraine by senior White House  officials but questioned that ``Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the  president on Ukraine.'' He joked that every time Ukraine is mentioned,  Giuliani pops up.   Ambassador Bolton also communicated directly with Mr. Giuliani at key  junctures. According to call records obtained by the House, Mr.  Giuliani connected with Ambassador Bolton's office three times for  brief calls between April 23 and May 10, 2019, a time period that  corresponds with the recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch and the  acceleration of Mr. Giuliani's efforts on behalf of President Trump to  pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that would benefit his  reelection campaign.   For instance, on April 23, the day before the State Department  recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch from Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani had an 8- minute 28-second call from the White House. Thirty minutes later, he  had a 48-second call with a phone number associated with Ambassador  Bolton.   If he were called to testify, we could ask Ambassador Bolton directly  what transpired on that call and whether that phone call informed his  assessment that Mr. Giuliani was ``a hand grenade that was going to  blow everyone up.'' We can ask Mr. Bolton why, when there are  approximately 1.8 million companies in Ukraine--several hundred  thousand of which have been accused of corruption--the President was  focused on only one. He didn't care about anything else. He cared only  about the company on which the former Vice President's son had been a  board member. Can you believe that he was concerned with corruption and  only knew about one company, when there are hundreds of thousands that  were accused of corruption?    Although Ambassador Bolton did not listen in on the July 25 call  between President Trump and President  [[Page S425]]  Zelensky in which President Trump asked the Ukrainian President a  favor--a favor to investigate one company and Joe Biden's son--we have  learned from witness testimony that Ambassador Bolton was opposed to  scheduling the call in the first place. Why? Because he accurately  predicted, in the words of Ambassador Taylor, that ``there could be  some talk of investigations or worse on the call.'' In fact, he did not  want the call to happen at all because he ``thought it was going to be  a disaster.''   How did Ambassador Bolton know that President Trump would bring this  up? What made him so concerned that a call would be a disaster? I think  we know, but only Ambassador Bolton can answer these questions.   Based on extensive witness testimony, we also know that throughout  this period, multiple people on the National Security Council's staff  reported concerns to Ambassador Bolton about tying American foreign  policy to President Trump's ``domestic political errand,'' as Dr. Hill  so aptly put it.   After he abruptly ended the July 10 meeting--the meeting in which  Ambassador Sondland abruptly told the Ukrainians that a White House  meeting could be scheduled in exchange for the announced  investigations--Ambassador Bolton spoke to Dr. Hill and directed her to  report her concerns to National Security Council's legal adviser John  Eisenberg.   At the end of August, Ambassador Bolton advised Ambassador Taylor to  send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo to relay concerns about  the hold on the military aid.   Ambassador Bolton also advised Mr. Morrison--Dr. Hill's successor as  the top Russia and Ukraine official on the National Security Council-- on at least two different occasions to report what he had heard to the  National Security Council's lawyers, it sounding so suspicious.   On September 1, Ambassador Bolton directed Mr. Morrison to report to  the National Security Council's lawyers an explicit proposal from  Ambassador Sondland to a senior Ukrainian official that ``what could  help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the  mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.''   On September 7, Ambassador Bolton instructed Mr. Morrison to report  to the lawyers another conversation Mr. Morrison had with Ambassador  Sondland. This time, Ambassador Sondland had conveyed that the  administration would not release the military aid unless President  Zelensky announced the investigations demanded by President Trump--the  investigations of one company because the President was so concerned  about the corruption in Ukraine. It was one company that had had Vice  President Biden's son on the board, and the President just happened to  pick that company from hundreds of thousands to be concerned about  corruption. And the President also opposed funding for corruption aid  to Ukraine.   Why did Ambassador Bolton tell his subordinates to report these  issues to the national security lawyers? What does he know about how  the lawyers responded to the concerns of Dr. Hill or of Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman and Mr. Morrison? Again, only Ambassador Bolton can  answer these questions, and we must assume that the answers go to the  heart of the President's misconduct, given the President's attempt to  block his testimony. Why would the President oppose the testimony of  his own appointee as the National Security Advisor of the United States  unless he knew that testimony would be damming to him? Those are other  reasons the President fears Ambassador Bolton's testimony.   I would like to now turn to Ambassador Bolton's knowledge of and  concerns about President Trump's illegal withholding of the military  aid to Ukraine.   Of course, we all know that under the Anti-Impoundment Act of 1974-- passed to prevent President Nixon from refusing to spend money  appropriated by Congress--withholding money appropriated by Congress is  illegal; nonetheless, the President did it for obviously corrupt  motives.   By July of last year, Ambassador Bolton was well aware that President  Trump was illegally withholding security assistance to Ukraine, and he  and his subordinates tried to convince the President to pursue  America's national security interests and release the aid instead of  continuing to withhold vital military assistance to the President-- instead of holding that vital military assistance hostage to the  President's personal political agenda.   Throughout the rest of July, over the course of several interagency  meetings, the National Security Council repeatedly discussed the freeze  on Ukraine's security assistance. As National Security Advisor,  Ambassador Bolton supervised that process. These meetings worked their  way up to the level of Cabinet deputies, and every agency involved,  except for the Office of Management and Budget, supported releasing the  aid. OMB, meanwhile, said its position was based on President Trump's  express orders.   We know that a number of individuals at OMB and the Department of  Defense raised serious concerns about the legality of freezing the  funds, which we know is illegal. We now have an explicit ruling from  the Government Accountability Office, which we didn't need because we  knew that is why the law was passed in 1974, that the freeze ordered by  President Trump was illegal--and he was obviously told this--and  violated the Impoundment Control Act.   We also know that after the meeting of Cabinet deputies on July 26,  Tim Morrison talked to Ambassador Bolton, and according to Mr.  Morrison, Ambassador Bolton said that the entire Cabinet supported  releasing the freeze and wanted to get the issue to President Trump as  soon as possible.   When did Ambassador Bolton first become aware that President Trump  was withholding military aid to Ukraine and conditioning the release of  that aid on Ukraine announcing political investigations? What was he  told was the reason? What else did he learn about the President's  actions in these meetings? Again, only Ambassador Bolton can answer  these questions, and again we must presume that President Trump is  desperate for us not to hear those answers. I hope not too many of the  Members of this body are desperate to make sure that the American  people don't hear these same answers.   We know that Ambassador Bolton tried throughout August, without  success, to persuade the President that the aid to Ukraine had to be  released because that was in America's best interest and necessary for  our national security.   In mid-August, we know Lieutenant Colonel Vindman wrote a  Presidential decision memorandum recommending that the freeze be lifted  based on the consensus views of the entire Cabinet. The memo was given  to Ambassador Bolton, who subsequently had a direct, one-on-one  conversation with the President in which he tried but failed to  convince him to release the hold.
