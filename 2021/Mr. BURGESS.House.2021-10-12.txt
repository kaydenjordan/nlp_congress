 Mr. Speaker, this is a lot of money that we are talking  about. But it is not just the volumes of money; it is the velocity with  which we are spending money over these last 2 years.   Yes, the coronavirus is terrible. Yes, the American economy needed  some help. But we passed the big American Rescue Plan in February, and  the States and municipalities, as of this date, have spent 2.5 percent  of that money.   I am also on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We are one of the  principal authorizing committees in the United States House of  Representatives. Have we had a single hearing on how much money we have  pushed out to the healthcare sector, to the States, to the  municipalities? No, we have not.   Have we had a single hearing of what is likely to be required going  forward? The answer is: No, we have not.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter I penned to Frank  Pallone, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, asking him  can we please do just a modicum of the oversight that we are required  to do in the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   [[Page H5619]]                                            House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, October 7, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I urge you to hold a hearing on the       implementation of the American Rescue Plan, so that we may       fulfil the oversight responsibilities of the Energy and       Commerce Committee. Nearly seven months have passed since the       enactment of the American Rescue Plan, but despite costing       the American taxpayer $1.9 trillion, many Americans have yet       to feel or recognize its effects. As the House committee with       jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human       Services, the agency responsible for allocating many of these       funds, it is only reasonable that proper oversight is       enforced to ensure Congressional intent is practiced and the       taxpayer dollar used accordingly during implementation.        During consideration of the American Rescue Plan, many       lawmakers heard from states and localities on the urgent need       for emergency funding. While I do not doubt that many       localities were in need of assistance, it was reported that       as of this summer, most had spent only 2.5% of the $350       billion that was appropriated to states and localities in the       American Rescue Plan.        I understand this large sum of funds will take time to       properly distribute, and states and localities must be       prudent and spend allocations in ways which will prove to be       an investment and grant long-term security, but it is       imperative that these funds have adequate direction from       Congress stipulating the appropriateness of their       expenditure. States and localities need certainty that they       are spending funds as directed and that these funds will not       be at risk of being revoked for improper use. Fortunately, as       directed by Section 602 of the American Rescue Plan, the       Treasury Department is requiring expenditure reports with an       interim report for all states and localities having been due       on August 31, 2021, and quarterly reports starting October       31, 2021 for states and cities with populations of 250,000       residents or more.        I am afraid that Congress and the American people may lose       sight of the significance that $1.9 trillion in one single       stimulus package may mean and the responsibility associated       with appropriating such funds. While these funds were       appropriated with the intention of helping communities       recover from and respond to the devastation of the COVID-19       pandemic, it is important that the American people are aware       of specific projects being funded by this package. I have       read reports of the American Rescue Plan being used by cities       to buy 78 electric vehicles, build technology labs at       recreation centers, and fund long avoided infrastructure       projects. Although these projects may have merit, are they       really the intent of the American Rescue Plan?        It has been a tumultuous and difficult year for Americans       across the country, with businesses, schools, and social       endeavors operating different than the norm--Congress and the       Energy and Commerce Committee have been no different.       However, as we continue to consider historically large       spending packages, we have an obligation to our Constituents       to oversee the implementation and use of these funds.            Sincerely,                                          Michael C. Burgess, M.D.,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, we have heard over and over again that what  awaits is a manufactured crisis. The American people have some  experience now dealing with manufactured crises. Since January of this  year, they have seen a never-ending array of manufactured crises.   Look, I live in Texas. It is a border State. There are a lot of  problems on the southern border. We hear about it every time we turn on  the news.   The border wall was supposed to be built. It was to help that  problem. But there are stacks and stacks of material to build that  border wall that are just sitting because the current administration  has put a pause on all of that and said we are not building any more.   What is going to happen to all of that material, that material that  was paid for with borrowed money that, yes, is part of the debt? What  is going to happen to that? It is going to be stolen; it is going to be  diverted to some other use, probably to no good end.   But had that wall been in place, maybe the streams of people that  were coming across the border at Del Rio a couple of weeks ago could  have been interrupted.   The Dallas Morning News, on Sunday, had a story about how 250 buses  transported Haitians from Central America up to the lower Rio Grande  Valley. Could our Department of Homeland Security not have had some  visibility on who was renting 250 buses to bring the 15,000 people to  the southern border? Maybe they could have spent some of that money in  that regard.   I don't know if anybody has noticed, but gas is $1 a gallon more than  it was 9 months ago. We are in for a cold winter, Mr. Speaker. It would  be nice to have some provisions to deal with that cold winter, but this  administration has turned a blind eye to the energy needs of our  constituents in this country.   It is almost as if they wanted to harm the people of this country. I  know that is not true. I know them to be good people. But at the same  time, what I hear from my constituents is an incredible amount of  frustration with what is coming from the administration and what is  coming from the Congress. It is time we took care of the needs of the  American people, and we ought to get on with it.
