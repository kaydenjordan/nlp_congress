 Mr. Speaker, what a glorious week to celebrate the  50th commemoration of Apollo 11.   I rise as someone whose eyes were wide open when this magnificent act  occurred.   I had the privilege of serving on the House Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, as well, and on the Space and Aeronautics  Subcommittee. I even served as they were building this massive space  station.   It is likewise a privilege to represent the area on which NASA's  Johnson Space Center is located. Just a few weeks ago, I walked through  mission control and saw those outstanding men and women symbolizing  those who were at their station on the very day that Neil Armstrong  touched this magnificent planet. And then to be able to say, ``one  small step for man, and one large step for mankind,'' but to know what  the astronauts go through, and the stars in the eyes of children.   Every year, I hold a Christmas party of 15,000 for the children in  our community. The most popular people that come are the astronauts  that I invite.   I am excited about celebrating this 50th commemoration of Apollo 11.  I salute the astronauts, the teams, and NASA because it opens our eyes  to the wideness of space, the wonderment of science, and the greatness  of America.   God bless them. Congratulations. And God bless America.                            ____________________
