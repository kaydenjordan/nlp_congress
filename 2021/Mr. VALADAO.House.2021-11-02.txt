 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate our veterans next week, I  rise to honor the dedication and selflessness of the brave men and  women who have served our Nation.   California's 21st Congressional District is home to thousands of  veterans who are especially valued members of our community. Our  veterans have made incredible sacrifices to the cause of freedom, and  America is forever in their debt.   As Members of Congress, we have the responsibility to ensure our  veterans receive the benefits they are entitled. Those who have  courageously served our country deserve our support, and we must  protect their care.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking our veterans  for their service to our country in honor of this Veterans Day. It is a  privilege to represent these men and women in Congress.                            ____________________
