 Mr. Speaker, I have been blessed these  last 4 years to represent the people of West Virginia's Third  Congressional District, but now country roads are calling me home.   My State is facing a crisis in our judicial system, and I believe  back home is where I am needed most to best serve the people of West  Virginia. This Sunday, I will be stepping down from the people's House  to serve as a justice beginning Monday on our State Supreme Court.   We are proud West Virginians, always working to make sure the State  we love is the very best it can be, and taking care of one another when  times are tough. In Congress, I have tried to use that Mountain State  can-do spirit to help West Virginia grow and prosper. Here are just a  few examples.   Helping newborn babies. We have worked to help the most innocent  victims of the drug crisis: newborn babies exposed to drugs during  pregnancy. The cry of a precious, tiny baby suffering through  withdrawal is heartbreaking. We were able to cut through Federal red  tape and pass legislation, signed by the President, so facilities like  Lily's Place can help children get a healthy start in life.   Protecting miner's healthcare. Our government made a promise to our  miners: You go into the bowels of the Earth, mine the coal that fuels  our Nation, forge the steel that won world wars, and we will guarantee  you a secure healthcare benefit. We kept that promise, passing  legislation protecting healthcare for our retirees and their widows.   As go the roads, so go the jobs. As a member of the House  Appropriations Committee, I helped fund the FAST Act, bringing $2.5  billion of funding just to West Virginia. Now, we are fixing our roads  and bridges, and investing in water and sewer infrastructure,  transitioning the West Virginia economy. We are bringing broadband to  our State in rural parts.   Growing more jobs. My motto is a good job solves a lot of problems.  You can feel hope and opportunity returning to the hills of West  Virginia. In fact, our 2017 economic growth rate was one of the highest  in the country.   I will never forget standing in the Oval Office with President Trump,  surrounded by our hardworking coal miners, as he signed the legislation  I helped pass that saved one-third of all coal mining jobs in America.  Coal trains are full again and paychecks are back in workers' pockets.    This has truly been a team effort. I want to thank the incredible  staff for their hard work and dedication to our constituents. We have  handled over 5,000 constituent service requests these last 4 years.   We were able to help people like Wetzel Sanders, a true American  hero. Wetzel was a corporal in the Army and was injured in the attack  on Pearl Harbor. He took shrapnel to the knee, was bandaged, and went  back into the fight. He is now 95 years old, and I was able to present  him with a much-deserved Purple Heart he should not have had to wait 76  years to receive.   We have also helped people through some of their most difficult  times. In a matter of hours in late June 2016, 23 people lost their  lives and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Thousands of residents were  left with nothing but the clothes on their backs, due to devastating  floods. We worked hard to help our residents recover and rebuild to get  their lives headed back in the right direction.   Let me reassure the people of the Third Congressional District, my  dedicated staff will continue to serve the people of West Virginia, and  our constituent service won't skip a beat.   Mr. Speaker, I thank West Virginia House Members, my fellow  colleagues,  David McKinley and Alex Mooney, and Senator Capito and  Senator Manchin for the opportunity to serve and work with them. They  are dedicated public servants.   I will miss hosting middle school students late at night, right here  on the House floor, talking about the greatness of our country, and  sharing a quiet moment with our heroes on an honor flight from back  home at our war memorials here in Washington.   I will not miss sleeping on a $99 cot each night these past 4 years  in my office here in Washington, but I was never here in Washington to  get settled in.   Finally, I would like to thank my wife, E.B., and our children,  Hollin, Charles, and Olivia, for supporting me each and every step of  the way. They have been incredibly patient and understanding about the  time public service has taken from our family time. I love them very  much.   Again, I thank the citizens of the Third Congressional District for  the opportunity to serve them in the United States House of  Representatives.   God bless America and God bless West Virginia.                            ____________________
