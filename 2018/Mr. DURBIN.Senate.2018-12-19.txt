 I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner)  and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, let me first say how grateful I am to  Senator Grassley for his friendship, No. 1., and his leadership, No. 2.  It has been one of the highlights of my Senate experience to work with  him on this bill. We trust one another. It reached a point where he  said: I am not going to make a big decision unless you tell me it is  all right, and I hope you will feel the same way when it comes to  decisions affecting me. And I did, and it  [[Page S7840]]  paid off because we came to trust one another. We worked together to  reach a point last night where we passed a bill which I think will be  judged in a positive way in the history of our country.   I might add that Senator Mike Lee of Utah was an early ally in this  effort, but our team wasn't putting together a winning record until  Chuck Grassley joined the squad--not only joined it but led it. Then we  brought in Cory Booker, who was a valuable spokesperson and ally when  it came to bringing groups together on the left and in the center to  achieve this bill. Last night, the four of us celebrated a victory. But  the victory was not ours; it was a victory for the American people and  for those who want to make sure we have a just system when it comes to  criminal law and prison terms that follow from those convicted.   For those three Senators who joined me, I can't thank you enough. I  really hope we can get the band back together sometime for another  issue. Maybe it is the second step. Whatever it is, I would like to  continue to work with this group and expand it to those who would like  to be part of our effort.   I think we showed something last night that most American people  wouldn't believe: that a bipartisan group of Senators from across the  political spectrum could tackle one of the toughest political issues of  our day; assemble an array of support--left, right, and center--from  Members of the Senate, as well as organizations devoted to law  enforcement and civil rights; and at the end of it, have something we  all felt was a fair product to send over to the House, which I hope  will act on this very quickly.   I will say a few words about how we reached that point in a moment,  but I want to take time now, as Senator Grassley has, to honor the  staff of my office, who have done such an exceptional job to bring us  to this moment.   Joe Zogby. Joe has been my chief counsel for several years now. For 6  years, he has worked tirelessly to get this legislation through the  Senate--and I mean tirelessly. He fielded calls to negotiate the  provisions of this bill at the same time he was coaching his sons in  baseball and trying to take care of his family responsibility. Joe was  available every hour of the day and night.   A special word of thanks to his wife, Lamece Baligh, and their sons,  James, Elias, and Luke. I want to apologize to them for taking their  dad away so many times for lengthy conversations, but we would never  have reached success last night without that input from their father  and husband.   This win would not have happened without the dogged determination of  Joe Zogby. He is a rabid Phillies fan, so he is always looking forward  to the next season and the next victory. Last night, finally, we won  the World Series and passed this bill on the floor of the Senate.   No matter what assignment I give to Joe Zogby, whether it is the most  technical, difficult, and challenging immigration issues or coming up  with a new system of criminal justice or improvements to our system  criminal justice, he always rises to the occasion. I am truly blessed  to have him as my chief counsel. I may get the headlines, but, believe  me, Joe Zogby deserves the credit.    By his side was Rachel Rossi. Rachel is a detailee to our office. She  comes from the public defender's office. She told me this morning that  they had warned her ahead of time this was probably going to be a  pretty lackluster and boring experience, and nothing serious was going  to be considered or passed during the time she was a detailee. Well,  quite the opposite was true. She was here to be an integral part of the  construction of this legislation and its passage. She is leaving as  detailee at the end of the year, and I am going to miss her. While she  will be missed, she is leaving our office on the highest possible note.   Rachel, I wish you the best. You were an important part of the  legislation that passed last night.   Stephanie Trifone is our office counsel. She is involved in every  issue that goes through the Senate Judiciary Committee. She played a  supporting role to ensure that the bill was properly written and  fielded countless calls and emails to keep our Senate staff and other  staff well informed. She has been a steady hand, and we needed her  every step of the way.   The rest of my team has its own assignments. Some of them worked  tangentially on this bill, but I really couldn't function without Dan  Swanson. He takes another agenda in the Senate Judiciary Committee,  primarily on the civil side, and there is none better. There are times  when people who were so-called experts would visit my office and say:  Where does this Swanson learn all of these issues in such detail?   Well, he is a pretty bright guy, and I am lucky to have him. His day  in the hot seat will soon come when we face another issue.   Debu Gandhi is an associate counsel. He is relatively new compared to  the others, but I like his style and his determination. I have never  asked anything of him that he hasn't produced the very best quality  project in a timely way.   Manpreet Kaur Teji is the legislative correspondent who has to field  all of the mail when I get up and give speeches that either make people  happy or angry. I thank her for her commitment to our office.   I want to say a word about my floor staff. Reema Dodin has been with  me since she was an intern in my office in Chicago. She went on to  graduate law school and came to join my staff and eventually became my  floor director. I didn't realize how much she was studying Senate  procedure, but she has really become a valuable asset, not just to my  office but to the Senate when we consider the options under the Senate  rules.   Having been parliamentarian in the Illinois State Senate for 10 or 12  years, I can tell you that those who work in the parliamentarian's  office, as well as those in support staff who are interested in Senate  procedure, are absolutely essential to the successful consideration of  important bills. Reema is in a unique position of helping to maneuver  and whip the bill on both the Democratic and Republican sides of the  aisle. She certainly did her job last night with 87 votes in favor of  our legislation.   MJ Kenny is by her side. He is the deputy floor director. He was  always in the cloakroom and always on the floor to ensure the FIRST  STEP Act had a fair shot of consideration and passage. MJ and Reema are  an incredible floor team. I am lucky to have them, and I thank them  both.   Corey Tellez is my legislative director. She ensured that all of the  staff worked together to finalize the bill. She kept our office and  other offices well informed every step of the way.   Emily Hampsten, my communications director, has been sending out  messages from my office on a bipartisan basis from the beginning. She  is always there with a smile and does professional work, and I thank  her so much for her work.   Claire Reuschel is my director of scheduling. She controls my life  more than anyone other than my wife. She sends me places when she  thinks it is right, and she usually has good judgment in those  decisions. She has navigated thousands of meetings and phone calls on  this legislation and so many other things. To say that she is an  important part of this process is a gross understatement.   Finally, Pat Souders is my chief of staff. He has been with me from  the beginning. He started off in the House and now has assembled, I  think, the best team on Capitol Hill. I thank him for not only finding  these talented people but making sure that they get along with one  another and that in their cooperation we can serve the people of  Illinois first and the Nation in the most effective way. I couldn't do  it without Pat Souders.   Let me say that this moment in history arrived because we had an idea  that was due; it is an idea whose time was due. It was due for a number  of reasons.   Thirty years ago, in the war on drugs, we were so frightened by crack  cocaine that as a House Member, I ended up casting what I considered  one of the worst votes in my career. I voted for the 100-to-1 crack to  powder disparity in sentencing. It meant what it said: You would get  100 times the penalty for the same amount of crack cocaine as you would  have in powder cocaine--the same narcotic, different form, dramatically  different results.  [[Page S7841]]    We tried this in an effort to scare America straight, to let them  know we were serious. We would get tough and use all of the political  muscle we could find to stop the spread of crack cocaine. It was cheap.  It was easily produced. It was deadly, especially to the fetus being  carried by the addicted mother, and it scared us. I voted for that bill  and have regretted it ever since.   I know what happened; it didn't work. You couldn't scare people  straight. We ended up with more people addicted. The price of drugs on  the street went down, and we started filling our prisons, primarily  with African-American and Latinos inmates who were convicted under  these crimes. We knew in our heart of hearts that like so many other  laws, it was unfair. The majority--majority--of users of narcotics and  dealers of narcotics are White. Seventy-five percent of those who are  convicted and sent to prison for crimes related to drug dealing and use  are African American and Latino.   This disparity on its face tells us that our system was fundamentally  unfair and ineffective. I believe that is the reason we decided last  night to stop trying to muscle our way through the drug war and start  using our brains: What is it that will work, that will make certain  those who are truly guilty pay a price and those who can be  rehabilitated get that chance? It is as basic as that.   There is a second thing that has happened in America in recent years,  and it is heartbreaking when you see the results. We are facing the  worst drug epidemic in our history. For the first time in decades-- maybe in modern memory--we are being told that life expectancy in the  United States is going down. It is because of the opioid drug epidemic.  Thousands of people are dying because of overdoses of opioids, heroin,  and fentanyl.    The opioid epidemic has opened our eyes to something else. Narcotics  and their problems are not confined to the inner city. They are not  confined to people of color, and they are not confined to the poor.  This opioid epidemic has touched every corner of America in every  State. There is no suburb too wealthy, no town so small that it can  avoid this opioid epidemic. What it has done, sadly, is educate all of  us in what happens with addiction and what we need to do to fight it.   We now look at drug addiction not as a moral curse but, rather, as a  disease that needs to be treated. That doesn't mean we should give up  on prosecuting kingpins and doing everything we can to stop the flow of  narcotics, but we have come to realize that just sticking someone in  jail, if they lived long enough to reach that point in their lives, is  no guarantee they are going to come out of jail without that addiction.  We have to be thoughtful.   We also have to have rehabilitation that is available for people  across the board, whether they are rich or poor. That is something our  opioid legislation of several weeks ago moves toward solving.   The other thing we have come to understand is, the cost of the  current system is unsustainable. We cannot continue to fill our prisons  at great expense and not put money into things that count in terms of  protecting our communities. Arresting someone after the crime is, of  course, part of a just society, but it doesn't stop that original crime  from happening. We have to think about the crime prevention that makes  our homes and neighborhoods and towns and cities safe all across  America, and that was part of the calculation last night in this  embarkation on a new approach.   Finally, I want to say that virtually every major issue that passes  on the floor of the U.S. Senate--virtually every single one of them-- has someone backing it, pushing for it with a personal passion on the  issue. I feel--not personally but having visited so many prisons and  worked with so many people who have served time in those prisons--that  we need to have a more just system, a more effective system.   I want to give credit where it is due. Jared Kushner, President  Trump's son-in-law, spoke to me about his feelings on prison reform the  first time we ever met. I know it is personal to him, and I know it  means a lot to him and his family. Because he cared and because he  mobilized the conservative side of the political equation, we had an  amazing vote last night with 87 Members of the Senate supporting the  bill. All of the Democrats and then, on top of that, 39 of the  Republicans were also supportive of the bill. I might add, Senator  Lindsey Graham was absent. Now that he is back from Afghanistan, he  told us he would have made it 88 if he were here.   I will close by saying thank you again to Senator Grassley. Thanks to  Aaron Cummings. I thanked him personally last night. He worked so  closely with Joe Zogby and with Rachel Rossi during the course of this;  they really became a team. I think it was one of the reasons we closed  this deal and sent it to the House. It is, however, the first step. We  have to start thinking about the second step, and we need the help of  all of our colleagues.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill  ) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, McHenry, IL, lost one of its favorite sons  on November 21. Donald Doherty was the mayor of McHenry from 1961 to  1973. He was a county board member for 20 years. He was a husband, a  father, grandfather, a veteran of the U.S.  [[Page S7907]]  Army, and someone who truly loved his community. He was 91 years old.   If you go down Green Street in McHenry, you will come to the  intersection of Pearl Street and Green Street and a sign for Honorary  Donald P. Doherty Drive. Donald loved living in McHenry. People could  always find Donald along Green Street at St. Patrick's Church or at  city hall or at his family's drug store, Bolger Drugs. McHenry and his  family were his life.   Before Donald became mayor in 1961, he ran the Bolger Drug Store. He  was famous for going out of his way to help customers. If his store  didn't have it, he would make sure the customer got it. The community  rewarded him by choosing him to be mayor for 12 years.   His love of the community continued well after his time as mayor. He  went on to serve as a member of the county board, the Knights of  Columbus, and the McHenry Area Chamber of Commerce where he received  the chamber's highest honor, the Frank E. Low Award. Donald often would  consult succeeding mayors if they needed help. During McHenry Fiesta  Days, you could find him as the parade marshal.   Donald helped make McHenry a better place to live for people. He  loved car rides, playing bingo with his friends at the McHenry Country  Club, and he missed playing Scrabble with his late wife, Rosalie. He  leaves behind 10 children and 21 grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank a  remarkable woman whose commitment to justice has helped more people in  my State and in our Nation than she will probably ever know.   Her name is Cathy Hurwit. For the last 20 years, she has served as  chief of staff to my friend from Chicago, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.   Cathy Hurwit is retiring from public service at the end of this year.  This week, as she was packing up her office in the Rayburn building, a  coworker happened to see her pull a photo from a drawer and pack it  away with her books and files. It was a signed photo of Cathy with  President Barack Obama.   That small incident tells you a lot about Cathy Hurwit. You see, for  Cathy, public service has never been about personal gain. She has no  use for ``vanity walls'' covered with photos of herself with powerful  people.   Where others might hang a photo of themselves with a President, Cathy  Hurwit hangs a poster from a rally to save Social Security and  Medicare. For her, public service has always been about helping others  and making our government better and fairer.   Cathy Hurwit is an icon in the progressive movement. She is committed  to her values, and she is a genius at organizing and legislating. She  knows how to use power to help others, whether in the minority or  majority.   She didn't set out to work on Capitol Hill. Her first job after  college was working as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, helping migrant  laborers in Utah.   She went back to school to earn a master's in journalism. After her  first year, she was hired as a summer intern by Congressman Toby  Moffett. She never went back to ``J school.''   She worked as Congressman Moffett's energy policy director for 3  years.   She then worked as adviser to the Subcommittee on Environment,  Energy, and Natural Resources of the House Government Operations  Committee, followed by 2 years as legislative director for then- Congressman, now Senator, Ed Markey.   Cathy left Capitol Hill to become legislative director for Citizen  Action, a coalition of progressive organizations, from 1988 to 1997.  After that came 2 years as legislative director and healthcare policy  expert for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal  Employees, one of the great public employee unions in our country.   Cathy had vowed never to return to Capitol Hill. Thank goodness,  Congresswoman Schakowsky persuaded her to change her mind.   Few people know more than Cathy Hurwit about the complexities of  healthcare policy or about the consequences of the healthcare policy  decisions we make in Congress for ordinary people. If you are among the  millions of Americans who are grateful that insurers can no longer deny  you coverage or charge you astronomically more for health insurance  because of a preexisting medical condition, you can thank Cathy Hurwit.  She was fighting for a Patients' Bill of Rights more than 20 years ago.  With Congresswoman Schakowsky and others, she helped to include that  and other essential protections in the Affordable Care Act.   Her work has improved the lives of millions of Americans.   While Cathy is leaving the Hill, she is not leaving the fight. I hope  that she will find a little more time to enjoy a good show at the  Kennedy Center. I know that she will continue to be a force for social  justice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3784         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's       Workforce Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of       the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,       less than half of what the United States spent on labor       market policies 30 years ago.        (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported       training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in       technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand       over time.        (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States       are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and       job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers       making less than $40,000 annually.        (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training       services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation       could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to       changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions       in technologically-oriented occupations and industries.        (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States       for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,       increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness       of the United States.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Automation.--The term ``automation'' means a device,       process, or system that functions without continuous input       from an operator, including--        (A) advanced technologies, such as--        (i) data collection, classification processing, and       analytics; and        (ii) 3-D printing, digital design and simulation, and       digital manufacturing;        (B) robotics, including collaborative robotics, and worker       augmentation technology;        (C) autonomous vehicle technology; or        (D) autonomous machinery technology.        (2) Dislocated worker.--The term ``dislocated worker'' has       the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Workforce       Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102).        (3) In-demand industry sector or occupation.--The term       ``in-demand industry sector or occupation'' has the meaning       given the term in section 3 of that Act.

A bill to acknowledge the rights of States with respect to  sports wagering and to maintain a distinct Federal interest in the  integrity and character of professional and amateur sporting contests,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3784         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's       Workforce Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of       the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,       less than half of what the United States spent on labor       market policies 30 years ago.        (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported       training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in       technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand       over time.        (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States       are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and       job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers       making less than $40,000 annually.        (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training       services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation       could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to       changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions       in technologically-oriented occupations and industries.        (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States       for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,       increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness       of the United States.
