 Mr. Speaker, 2017 was an amazing year for the Needville  High School Blue Jays. The Lady Jays won the Texas State 4A  championship.   They lost over one-half of their team in 2018. The naysayers said  there was no way the Needville Blue Jays will play for the State title  in 2018.   The naysayers never talked to Rockie, Evan, Meghan, Treasure,  Samantha, Anna, Baley, Madison, Samia, Maddy, Kaitlyn, Tori, or Coach  Amy Schultz.   The Lady Jays knew they would play the State finals in 2018, and they  did just that. Last week, their season ended with a record of 41-9 and  the Texas 4A State runner-up.   The Lady Jays were a true team. They put their heart and soul on the  line for their hometown of Needville. It is a town we all love.  Needville is proud of our girls.   We will see the naysayers next year at the 2019 State championships.                            ____________________
