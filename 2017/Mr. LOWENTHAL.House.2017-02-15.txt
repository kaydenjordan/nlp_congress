 Mr. Speaker, last week, Congressman Steve Chabot and  I, as the co-chairs of the Cambodia Caucus, called upon Secretary  Tillerson and the administration to prioritize human rights, democracy,  and the rule of law in Cambodia.   Just days later, Sam Rainsy, the leader of the opposition party in  Cambodia, resigned in the face of a proposed bill that would dissolve  the opposition party if he continued to lead the party.   This law on political parties would give the government far-reaching  powers to suspend political parties at will. I urge the Cambodian  National Assembly to set aside this undemocratic law that dangerously  moves Cambodia toward being a one-party state, and to allow the  Cambodian people to freely choose their own leaders.                            ____________________
