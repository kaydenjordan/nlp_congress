 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a bipartisan bill that will  aid our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis.   I am proud that two provisions of mine are included in the final  package of the bill. These provisions would establish a mandatory drug  management program for at-risk beneficiaries in Medicaid and Medicare.    This bipartisan effort shows that we can do things when we put  partisan politics aside and work together.   I want to thank Chairman Walden for all of his hard work over the  past year as we crafted this bill. He led the charge, and I appreciate  it, Mr. Chairman, so much.   I also want to thank Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, my Democratic  colleague and friend. Five years ago we developed the first drug  management program in Medicare, and now we developed a drug management  program in Medicaid.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
