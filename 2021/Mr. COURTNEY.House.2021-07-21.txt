 Madam Speaker, last January, in one of his first  executive orders, President Biden extended the student loan pause on  monthly payments through the end of September.   This order allowed all direct student loans issued by the Federal  Government through the U.S. Department of Education, again, to have a  grace period during the recession that we are still experiencing. Even  with a good job growth last month, 800,000 jobs added to the economy, a  5.6 percent unemployment rate, and having people starting to again  recover, the need for that pause was blindingly obvious.   A couple weeks ago, myself and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley wrote to  President Biden and the Secretary of Education calling on the President  to extend that pause again. We are about 60 days away from all these  student loans snapping back with very high interest rates, and again,  at a time when the economy is still recovering.   Madam Speaker, this is exactly what the Small Business Administration  did for disaster loans issued during COVID when they extended the grace  period allowed of 1 year, when those loans were issued during COVID, to  have that grace period extended into 2022. That was a smart, wise move  recognizing that this is the wrong time to add debt burden on  individuals and businesses as the U.S. economy starts to recover.   Again, we understand that at some point we are going to have to have  a return to student loan debt payments, but, again, there are  additional reasons why this pause makes sense.   Two of the largest debt servicers, the Pennsylvania Higher Education  Assistance Agency, which services a large number of student loan debts,  announced a couple of weeks ago they are withdrawing from the program,  which means that borrowers are going to be shifted to new servicers, as  well as the New Hampshire Higher Education Loan Corporation.   So again, the dislocation and the change that is happening with  student loan servicers are additional reasons why the President and  Secretary Cardona should agree to our request.   Moving forward, it is time for Congress to act to fix some of the  problems within the student loan space.   Congressman Dusty Johnson and I, on a bipartisan basis, back in  January, introduced the Recognizing Military Service in the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness Act. A companion bill in the Senate was  introduced by Senator Rubio and Senator Hassan.   Again, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program was created back  in 2007 basically to allow teachers, nurses, people serving in the  military, cops--who will, again, make 10 years of payments on their  student loans while holding down public service jobs--to be eligible  for discharge of their student loan debt.   The last administration butchered this program. People who, again,  for 10 years abided by the rules were refused and denied student loan  discharge, including people serving in the military.   Our bill will untangle that bottleneck, will recognize that people  who are on Active Duty overseas, away from their families, who again,  were allowed a grace period in terms of monthly payments, those months  will be credited towards public service loan forgiveness. It has been  endorsed by every veteran service organization from VFW to the Iraq and  Afghan War Veterans, and again, is a smart bipartisan bill which will  help a population of people who perform the highest form of public  service; namely, wearing the uniform of this country.   We should also, as Congress, change the law to allow people to  refinance down the interest rate on their student loan debt. When these  loans snap back, we are looking at 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent  interest on legacy student loan debt.   The rest of the economy with a zero percent benchmark at the Federal  Reserve is refinancing debt on homes, on consumer loans, on auto debt,  but student loan borrowers are trapped unless Congress acts.   H.R. 3024 allows the Department of Education to refinance down the  interest rates on student loan debt so that people, again, in a very  low-interest rate environment--and the chairman of the Federal Reserve  announced the other day he is going to keep the benchmark at zero  through 2021. Student loan borrowers should get the benefit of those  low interest rates just like every other middle class family that  refinances their home or their consumer debt.   So, extend the pause. Let's fix the problems in the meantime.  Congress can act.   The millennials, the young people of this country deserve our help,  both to act with the tools that we have, and also, calling on the  administration to provide an additional grace period just like we did  for small businesses.                            ____________________
