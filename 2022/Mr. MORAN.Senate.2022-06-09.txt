 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, secondly, I would ask unanimous consent  that I be allowed to speak even though it may go a moment or two longer  and that the vote be delayed to allow me to complete my remarks.    Mr. President, I want to speak this morning really to  America's veterans and provide an update on our work to get our toxic  exposure legislation across the finish line.   The Senate is in the midst of considering the Sergeant First Class  Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. This is historic. It is  bipartisan.   I hope that we can keep it becoming, when something is bipartisan,  that it is historic because we ought to be able to solve these problems  for veterans and really for Americans in a way that brings us together  and not pulls us apart, and this is an effort to show that that can be  done. This legislation will deliver on a promise we made as a country  to take care of our service men and women, both when they deploy and  when they come home.    The Heath Robinson Act will provide access to healthcare and benefits  for millions of veterans who are sick from illnesses connected with  toxic exposures.   When we send our warfighters into harm's way, it is with the  understanding that we will have their back. When they come home bearing  physical, mental, or invisible wounds of war, we care for those wounds.  Toxic wounds should not be treated differently.   John Buckley, a retired U.S. Army colonel from Andover, KS, told me:         Our Soldiers were put into dangerous situations in Iraq and       Afghanistan. And many who suffered from their wounds or made       the ultimate sacrifice have been cared for by our nation.       Unfortunately, many too have been overlooked and ignored.       Especially those who are suffering from injuries after having       recurring and prolonged exposure to toxic fumes, burn pits       and other environmental hazards.    This legislation is designed to address what the retired colonel told  me.   Another Army colonel, this one from Leavenworth, KS, Pat Proctor, who  served in Iraq and Afghanistan, shared that many of the men and women  he served with are facing health challenges from being exposed to  toxins while deployed. He said:         There is no telling--[there is no telling]--how many of us       will be impacted as we get older.    I know many of our veterans live with the lingering fear, will the  toxic exposures from their service catch up with them and leave them  with a debilitating disease? And if that happens, will the VA be there?  Will Americans be there for them with the healthcare and benefits they  need?   William Turner, the former deputy commander general of support for  Kansas's own Fort Riley First Infantry Division, told me:         Our Veterans have served in multiple locations where they       have been exposed to a number of toxins that have resulted in       them developing serious illnesses, and they often struggle to       gain access to health care and benefits that help alleviate       some of the pain and suffering they are experiencing.    Sometimes we think these issues are something people in Washington,  DC, are talking about, but what we are trying to address is the real  circumstances of real Americans who have served our Nation and who are  deserving of our attention.   The former deputy commanding general went on to say--to note this:         It is absolutely imperative that we pass this bill to       guarantee exposed veterans receive permanent access to health       care.    Moving legislation through Congress can be a slow and frustrating  process. However, this week, when the Senate began debate on our bill,  I was encouraged by the resounding show of confidence. This bill--to  move forward on this bill, that vote was 86 Senators in favor.   We are now focused on an amendment process and will continue working  as quickly as the Senate will allow to get this bill to the House and  back on its way to the President's desk.   Whether Democrat or Republican, every Member of this Chamber  represents veterans at home, and I firmly  [[Page S2883]]  believe that every Member in this Chamber cares about those veterans.  Issues related to veterans often have a way of bringing us together to  find consensus, and that is what we have been attempting to do and we  will continue to do as we sort out what amendments could be considered.   We were able to deliver veterans choice through the MISSION Act,  landmark mental health legislation through the John Scott Hannon Mental  Health Improvement Act, and I believe we can do that again on this  legislation to deliver care and benefits to all generations of toxic- exposed veterans.   This country is good at recognizing the physical wounds of war, and  we are getting better at recognizing the mental wounds of war, but no  longer can we ignore the wounds of war from toxic exposure--the wounds,  like Agent Orange before it, that may not arrive until years later.   Throughout the remaining procedural votes on the Heath Robinson Act,  I urge my colleagues with remaining questions or concerns to reach out  so we can all, together, deliver on this promise to those who have  borne the battle. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see  that this bill crosses the finish line soon.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
