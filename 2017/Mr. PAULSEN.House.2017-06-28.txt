 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wayzata  High School girls synchronized swimming team, who recently won the  Minnesota High School State Championship.   The Trojans triumphed at the State meet last month, where the  undefeated team earned the championship title for the 11th consecutive  year. They faced tough competition, but Wayzata's excellent figure  scores put them over the edge to secure the win.   This talented team of dedicated girls, led by Head Coach Hensel,  worked hard all season, winning each of their meets by at least 11  points. That commitment didn't stop at the pool. It is also in the  classroom, where each of these students excelled as well.   Mr. Speaker, congratulations to all the members, athletes, students,  teachers, coaches, families, and fans of the Wayzata High School girls  synchronized swimming team on their outstanding performance this  season.                            ____________________
