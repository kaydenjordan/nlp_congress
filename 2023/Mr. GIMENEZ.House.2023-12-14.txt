 Madam Chair, the United States is facing a host of  pressing issues, from Communist China's increased aggression in the  Indo-Pacific to attacks by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists against our  dear friend, Israel. This NDAA ensures our military is ready and able  to meet these challenges head-on.   In south Florida and across the Nation, living and housing costs are  a priority for our men and women in uniform. This NDAA secures a 5.2  percent increase in pay to our servicemembers which is the largest in  20 years, it authorizes $394 million more than the President's budget  request for new family housing and barracks, and it increases  eligibility for cost-of-living allowances.   While this NDAA may not be perfect, it fully funds our military,  enhances capabilities and readiness, and supports our brave  servicemembers.
