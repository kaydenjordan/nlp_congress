 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic  Production Response Act. Instead of unleashing America's vast domestic  energy resources, President Biden has hobbled our Nation's energy  production, resulting in fuel shortages and rising energy costs for all  American families.   He went so far as begging foreign dictators for oil instead of  uplifting America's economy. It is worth noting that just a few short  years ago, America was energy independent.   House Republicans have made it clear that we are going to hold the  Biden administration accountable for its actions.   As we sit here today, President Biden is draining around 40 percent  of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The reserve was established to be  used for national emergencies, not for cheap political points or Band- Aids for failed policies.   The Strategic Production Response Act would require the Biden  administration to replenish and maintain the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, and this legislation would require the Secretary of Energy to  come up with a plan to replenish the reserve if oil is taken for  nonemergency reasons.   The President has ample solutions in front of him to fix America's  energy crisis. In fact, Republicans have been offering up long-term  energy solutions to the Biden administration, but they refuse to  listen. Instead, they have given in to the demands of left-wing special  interests and radical environmental groups and have left the American  people stranded.   In America, we do our part in making sure that the energy we produce  is done in a cleaner and safer way than any other country on Earth.   Unleashing American energy is the solution to our Nation's energy  crisis.   My message to President Biden is simple: The days of taking shortcuts  to cover up major policy failures are over. H.R. 21 is an important  step in holding the administration accountable for their actions, and I  am proud to support this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is another tactic to delay  implementation of the underlying bill.   Energy security is national security, and if my Democratic colleagues  recognized this, they wouldn't need to abuse the SPR and attempt to  offset the high prices caused by their very policies.   Let's protect our strategic reserves, which is now at the lowest  level since 1983, and unleash American production.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no opposition to this  amendment. This amendment would increase the percentage cap on Federal  lands identified in DOE's replacement plan for oil and gas production,  taking it from 10 percent to 15 percent.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment  would increase the percentage cap on Federal lands identified in  DOE's replacement plan for oil and gas production, taking it from  10 percent to 15 percent. Mr. Chair, I support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Chairman, I  urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON).  Mr. Chairman, I have no  opposition to this amendment. This amendment would increase the  percentage cap on Federal lands identified in DOE's replacement  plan for oil and gas production, taking it from 10 percent to 15  percent. Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits oil and gas  [[Page H371]]  leasing on any tract of land off the coast of Virginia. Virtually all  offshore oil and gas leasing occurs in the Gulf of Mexico.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 26, 2023, on page H370, in the third column, the  following appeared:  Mr. Chair, I claim time  in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to  it.  Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order against  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I do insist on the point of order.    The amendment violates clause 7 of rule XVI of  the Rules of the House because it is not germane to the underlying  bill.   Specifically, the bill limits the drawdown of petroleum in the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve until the Department of Energy develops a  plan to increase the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas  production.   The amendment requires the Secretary of the Interior to complete a  separate environmental review for each lease and permit before issuing  any oil and gas lease or permit.   Environmental reviews are outside the scope of H.R. 21. The amendment  is not germane.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I urge all Members to support the Perry amendment. While this  amendment raises an issue that is different from this bill, it is an  important facet to understanding the seriousness of the Energy  Secretary's plan.   This is a perfecting amendment that will enhance public transparency,  congressional oversight of department plans and operations, and bring  certainty in planning for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and efforts  to keep it appropriately filled for emergencies.   I thank the gentleman for his concern in offering this amendment.  Again, I have no objection, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, put plainly, this is not an  appropriate role for EPA or CEQ, neither of which oversee Federal land.   The agencies consulted in the plan already must comply with existing  requirements, so this amendment only serves to obstruct.   H.R. 21 is about strengthening the SPR by requiring any nonemergency  use to be accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. This  amendment undermines the purpose of the bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
