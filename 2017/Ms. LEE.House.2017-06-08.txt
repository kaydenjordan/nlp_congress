 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his most diligent work on behalf of the American people, and also  to our ranking member, Congresswoman Maxine Waters. I just want to  thank her for really educating this House and the public of the dangers  to consumers of this horrible bill, of course, which I stand in  opposition to.   It really is a wrong choice for American families. Shamefully, this  bill gives Wall Street a handout while stealing from the pockets of  everyday Americans. It would drag us back to the days where Wall Street  and billionaires get richer, while struggling families are left out in  the cold.   The bill significantly undermines both the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau and the rules it put in place to prevent predatory  lending and subprime loans, particularly in communities of color.  Families lost a generation of wealth prior to Dodd-Frank and have yet  been able to recover.   But this bill also, I must say, puts Wall Street recklessness back in  charge, and it will leave consumers out in the cold again. So it will  take us back to where we were before, and we cannot go back.   That is why we are asking for a ``no'' vote. It destroys protections  for seniors and jeopardizes their financial safety. So I hope that  Members vote ``no'' on this bill.
