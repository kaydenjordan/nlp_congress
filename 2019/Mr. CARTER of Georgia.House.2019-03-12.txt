 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of James ``Jamie'' Parker, who passed away on Monday, February 25,  at the age of 65.   Upon his passing, Mr. Parker had worked for 10 years as the editor  for ``Bryan County Now'' as well as the night editor for the ``Savannah  Morning News.''   He reported on nearly everything happening in Richmond Hill, from  sporting events to city council hearings, tear-jerking accidents, and  stories where individuals made heartwarming contributions to their  community.   His friends remember Mr. Parker not only as a trustworthy journalist  reporting on these stories, but also a great friend and having a heart  as big as the country.   Deeply dedicated to his community, he attended more local sporting  events than anyone else in town.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and the entire  Richmond Hill community during this difficult time.                            ____________________
