 Mr. President, last week Templeton Press published an  important new book, ``How to Educate an American: The Conservative  Vision for Tomorrow's Schools.''edited by the Fordham Institute's  Michael J. Petrilli and Chester E. Finn, Jr., and published by  Templeton Press. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the preface I wrote for the book.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Reforming Education the American Way: State by State, Community by                                 Community         I was participating in a humdrum educators' roundtable in       Buffalo, New York, in 1988 when ``Monk'' Malloy, president of       the University of Notre Dame, asked this question: ``What is       the purpose of a public school?''        There was a long silence until finally Albert Shanker,       president of the American Federation of Teachers, proposed       this answer: ``The public school was created for the purpose       of teaching immigrant children reading, writing, and       arithmetic and what it means to be an American with the hope       that they would then go home and teach their parents.'' The       reason to read this book is to judge for yourself whether the       twenty-two conservative luminaries who wrote its chapters       have produced a better answer today to Malloy's question than       Albert Shanker did thirty years ago.        Shanker was a patriot--an old-fashioned, anticommunist,       Hubert Humphrey--liberal Democrat union organizer whose       parents had immigrated from Poland. So he and this book's       conservative writers agreed on one thing: In coeditor Chester       Finn's words, ``Schools should inculcate a solid       understanding of and appreciation for why America exists and       what it stands for, to transmit history and civics and, yes,       a positive attitude toward its strengths as well as a       reasoned commitment to addressing its weakness.'' Or, in       Shanker's words, ``Public schools played a big role in       holding our nation together. They brought together children       of different races, languages, religions, and cultures and       gave them a common language and a sense of common purpose. We       have not outgrown our need for this; far from it.''        Today, there is elite disdain for such Americanism. But       this is not a popular attitude. Most audiences applaud and       some come to their feet when I say, ``We should teach more       United States history in our schools so our children can grow       up knowing what it means to be an American.'' There is       bipartisan support for this sentiment. After September 11,       2001, George W. Bush and Al Gore both reminded the nation       that principles create the American character--not       considerations of race, religion, or national origin. In my       first address to the US Senate, I introduced a bill to create       summer academies for outstanding students and teachers of       U.S. history. Within a day, Senator Ted Kennedy had rounded       up nearly twenty Democratic cosponsors without my asking.       Especially in today's internet democracy, an era Peggy Noonan       calls ``The Great Estrangement,'' Americans are hungry for       institutions that unite. I suspect that most would agree that       it would be a good idea to begin each school day with a       student leading the Pledge of Allegiance and then giving his       or her version of what it means to be an American.        According to education historian Patricia Graham, ``Schools       in America have danced to different drummers through their       long history''--and schools have a very long history. Hunter-      gatherer ``play schools'' helped children learn to survive.       Sumerian schools taught scribes to help a culture survive.       During the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, schools       taught youngsters to work and got them out from under their       parents' feet. Sociologist James Coleman said that in early       America, schools helped parents do what parents could not do       as well. That was especially true for teaching literacy.       Graham says, ``Now the drumbeat demands that all children       achieve academically at a high level and the measure of that       achievement is tests.''        This book's conservative writers would temper that drumbeat       with a second great conservative goal--in the coeditors'       words, ``to restore character, virtue, and morality to the       head of the education table where they belong.'' This is no       new thought. Plato said schools should create good men who       act nobly. Thomas Jefferson believed that a democracy       granting broad liberties needed institutions instilling moral       restraint. But Yuval Levin's essay suggests why character       education does not rise so easily on a liberal  [[Page S1252]]       list of priorities: progressive education wants to liberate       the student to be himself or herself, Levin writes, while       conservative education wants to form the student to be better       suited to the responsibilities of citizenship.        After embracing citizenship and character, the book's       authors diverge in their emphases. Several show a healthy       respect for school choice but also for its limits. There is a       shout-out for career and technical education. To me, Bill       Bennett's chapter is the most persuasive. He argues that       content must be at the center of any conservative consensus       on education. He reminds us that in the 1980s and 1990s,       conservatives were leading a content crusade with E.D. Hirsch       and Governors John Engler, Tommy Thompson, and Jeb Bush as       well as Bennett himself as chief architects. This movement       was called (shall we whisper it?) ``Common Core.'' This       state-by-state reformation of school standards and curricula       was well underway when the Obama administration tried to push       it faster by making Common Core a quasi-federal mandate.       Republicans imagined black helicopters flying. What       conservatives had invented, many Republican legislators had       voted into state law, and hundreds of thousands of classroom       teachers in forty-five states expected they'd be teaching was       suddenly condemned and abandoned . . . by conservatives.        This abandonment was less complete than it would appear.       Last year, our daughter's family lived with us in Tennessee       while her home was being remodeled. She placed two sons in a       nearby mountain elementary school. When the boys returned       home to their Westchester County, New York, public school, I       asked, ``Did they have trouble adjusting?'' ``Nope,'' she       said. ``Common Core here. Common Core there.'' Many states       simply renamed Common Core to avoid political flak and       charged ahead. One advocate told me, ``We won. But we're not       allowed to say so.'' The backlash to Common Core brings me to       the most obvious mission missing from this volume's       conservative agenda: local control of schools. America was       created community by community. The initiative for American       public schools was entirely at the local level, Marc Tucker       has written. He termed this an ``accident of localism.''        I have spent much of my public life trying to preserve this       localism. To begin with, federalism--the dispersal of central       authority--is a crucial tenet of American liberty. Our       revolution, after all was mostly about distaste for a king.       As a practical matter, my experience is that those governing       education from a distance have good intentions but limited       capacity and that schools can be only as good as parents,       teachers, and citizens in a community want them to be. The       saga of Common Core is the greatest proof of this pudding.       Here was a conservative crusade--new rigor in what students       needed to know--blown up by conservatives' fear that       Washington D.C., was forcing them to do it. The Common Core       federal directive was piled on top of other dictates from       Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama on       how to define standards, teaching, tests, curricula, and       remedies for low-performing schools. Almost everyone in       public schools became sick of Washington telling them what to       do. So, in 2015, teacher unions and governors united to help       Congress enact the ``Every Student Succeeds Act,'' which the       Wall Street Journal said was ``the largest devolution of       federal control to the states in a quarter century.''        Now, after the rise and fall of a national school board,       our one hundred thousand public schools have about the same       balance between federal leadership and state and local       autonomy that existed during the George H. W. Bush       administration. Once again, we have it about right. Thirty       years ago, President Bush and the governors set the nation's       first national education goals and then launched an ``America       2000'' initiative to help states meet those goals by creating       voluntary standards, voluntary tests, and start-from-scratch       schools. This was done the hard way, state by state and       community by community--not by federal mandates. Today's       environment is ripe for a revival of a content-based       conservative consensus, or in Bill Bennett's words ``a great       relearning,'' as the best way for our public schools to help       our country get where we want it to go. But this time, let's       avoid the lure of federal mandates and do the job the       American Way: state by state, community by community.                            ____________________
