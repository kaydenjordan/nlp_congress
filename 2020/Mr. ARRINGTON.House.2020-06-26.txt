 Madam Speaker, the vast majority of law enforcement  across the country are good. They are competent. They are professional.  And they serve with integrity. And when they don't, with the immense  power they have over their fellow citizens, they must be held  accountable, but that starts at the local level.   Policing is a State and local responsibility, not a Federal  responsibility. When local leaders fail to do their job and citizens  fail to hold them accountable, the system breaks down. You have  incidences of abuse and, sometimes, cultures of corruption.   So what is the solution? It is not another top-down, one-size-fits- all from Washington, D.C.   We don't need to Federalize policing. We need to hold our local  leaders accountable. We need to come alongside of them at all levels of  government to make sure that we don't recycle the bad actors. So we get  rid of them. And if we do, then the 1 percent won't take the 99 percent  that are protecting and serving us and risking their lives to do so.                            ____________________
