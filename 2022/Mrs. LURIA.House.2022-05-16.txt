 Mr. Speaker, a critical element of strengthening our  nation's cybersecurity is ensuring the Federal government employs the  best and the brightest with the most advanced cybersecurity skills.   Whether at CISA, our intelligence agencies, our military, or at other  departments across the Federal government, cybersecurity professionals  play an essential role in keeping our nation safe, and we must  prioritize their recruitment, development, and retention.   Unfortunately, it has been challenging to compete with the private  sector for cyber talent, so we must look to creative ways to strengthen  the Federal cyber workforce.   The President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition is one innovative part  of that effort.   Organized by CISA, this annual cybersecurity competition brings  together cybersecurity professionals, both civilian and military, from  across the Federal government to compete in a series of challenges that  test a wide range of cybersecurity skills.   My legislation would authorize this competition to ensure it remains  part of our Federal cyber workforce strategy and grants CISA the  necessary authorities to fully carry out the program.   Importantly, it addresses legal barriers that have prevented CISA  from directly providing cash prizes to winning teams and individuals  that work in other departments or agencies.   H.R. 6824 specifically authorizes CISA to confer cash prizes to the  winners, many of whom are in the military, for their achievement.   By passing this legislation, we demonstrate our commitment to further  developing a competitive and highly skilled Federal cybersecurity  workforce.   I thank Representatives Connolly and Garbarino for cosponsoring this  bill, and Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for their support  for authorizing this important program.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill  and look forward to working with them to get it enacted into law.  [[Page H4978]]
