 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this reckless  spending bill.   On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office announced the Federal  deficit has already exceeded $1 trillion in the first 5 months of  fiscal year 2021.   Spending this year is already up 25 percent, and this massive  spending bill adds another $1.9 trillion to our deficit.   We are currently enjoying low interest rates, but out-of-control  spending  [[Page H1262]]  will lead to inflation. In this current year, inflation has already  increased by 3 percent. Inflation leads to interest rate hikes. For  example, in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 20  percent.   The debt is already at $28 trillion. So higher interest rates will  cause a catastrophic death spiral.   This bill does not rescue our country. It literally puts us in peril.
