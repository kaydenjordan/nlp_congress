 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and recognize a very  important day in Guam's history, December 10, 1898. On this day, the  United States and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, officially handing  over Guam to the United States and ending the Spanish-American War.  This year, we celebrate the 125th year Guam has been part of our great  Nation.   Following the United States' acquisition of Guam, it established  America as a global superpower and ensured our position in the Indo- Pacific region. Now, 125 years later, the U.S. remains a global  superpower and the strongest force in the Pacific and the world, and  Guam is a developed and thriving community.   Since 1898, Guam has proven to be an essential piece of America that  is filled with patriotism and faith. From being a vital military center  in the region during World War II to being the tip of the spear against  China today, Guam is a hub of American success.   Guam is a beacon of hope and American values in the middle of the  Pacific. Our American flag is a symbol of liberty and freedom in the  region. It is also a warning to all people who seek to provoke  violence. The United States and Guam are forces that are not to be  reckoned with.   Let us take this day to reaffirm the United States' commitment to  protecting freedom, peace, and democracy across the Indo-Pacific while  maintaining the strong ties that connect Guam and our amazing country.                            ____________________
