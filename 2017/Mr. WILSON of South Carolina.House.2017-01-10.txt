 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, early this morning, the  Clemson University Tigers achieved the College Football National  Championship in what was one of the most stunning and unforgettable  endings to a football game. Trailing behind the formidable University  of Alabama for the majority of the game, the Clemson Tigers refused to  be defeated, culminating in a come-from-behind win at literally the  last second.   Throughout the entire season, the Clemson football team has shown  guts, grit, and determination to their team, their school, and the  State of South Carolina. This was a well-deserved win for a remarkable  school and a remarkable program. I join my two sons, Julian and Hunter,  who graduated from Clemson, and Clemson fans from across the Nation in  celebrating this historic victory.   Congratulations to Clemson superstars Deshaun Watson and Ben  Boulware, who were named most valuable players for the game.  Congratulations as well to President Jim Clements and his wife, Beth.  They are continuing in the world class tradition of Jim and Marcia  Barker.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.   Congratulations, Dabo Swinney and the entire Clemson football family.  Go Tigers.                            ____________________
