 Mr. Speaker, Democrats and Republicans support the  Corporation for National and Community Service and all of its volunteer  organizations like AmeriCorps, VISTA, and Senior Corps. President  Trump's 2020 budget eliminates the Corporation and all the volunteer  activities our communities rely on.   As we speak, the Corporation's CEO is executing a plan to close all  46 State offices in the next 90 days, which they are calling the  Sustainability and Transformation Plan. Contrary to its name, this plan  is a step towards accomplishing the administration's ultimate goal of  eliminating national service and abandoning local volunteers and  stakeholders.   Last month, the Corporation's own inspector general reported to  Congress:  [[Page H3224]]  ``Aspects of this plan present heightened risks of fraud, waste, and  mismanagement that warrant particularly close oversight.''   So now it is time for Congress to act to protect national service,  not fund a plan that promotes fraud, waste, and abuse. I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1458, the Keep Community Service Local  Act, which prohibits the closing of State offices.                            ____________________
