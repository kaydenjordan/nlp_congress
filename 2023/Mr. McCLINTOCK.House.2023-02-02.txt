 Mr. Speaker, it is often said that socialism is  sharing and capitalism is selfishness. It is precisely the opposite.   The only way to prosper in a capitalist society is to identify what  somebody else needs and to provide it for them better than they can  provide it for themselves, whether it is sweeping a floor or designing  a microchip.   Socialism is taking what one person has earned by helping others and  giving it to someone who hasn't.   Socialism always produces poverty and misery because when you take a  dollar from Peter and give it to Paul, both have been robbed of that  dollar's incentive to help each other. Peter has been denied the reward  of his dollar's worth of work, and Paul no longer needs to help someone  earn that dollar.   Socialism and slavery both spring from exactly the same rotten  principle, as Lincoln put it, that you work and toil and make bread,  and I will eat it. Both have been championed by the same party through  the ages.
