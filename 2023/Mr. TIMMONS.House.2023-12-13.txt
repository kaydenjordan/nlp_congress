 Mr. Speaker, Americans have lost faith in the  impartiality of the Biden administration. We have ample evidence that  the DOJ, FBI, and IRS have refused to do their jobs. Americans deserve  to know the truth, and Congress has a duty to investigate.   The question is simple: What did President Biden know about his  family's criminal enterprises and when?   That is the question. That is why this inquiry is necessary.   We have already uncovered that the Biden family received $25 million  in payouts from foreign adversaries. Their scheme was simple: Foreign  client has a problem; client pays a Biden; Vice President Biden travels  to the foreign country; Vice President Biden leverages U.S. influence  to force favorable outcomes for the client; and the Biden family earns  their fee.   That is the scheme. The proof of concept was Burisma in 2014, and  they replicated it again and again. If President Biden was complicit,  then our national security is vulnerable. His administration keeps  stonewalling while the President repeatedly lies about his involvement.   As a member of the Oversight Committee, I believe the evidence we  have uncovered thus far demands further investigation. This vote is the  only logical next step. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
