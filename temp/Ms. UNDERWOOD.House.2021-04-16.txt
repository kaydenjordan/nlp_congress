 Madam Speaker, this week was Black Maternal Health  Week, an important opportunity to discuss the disparities affecting  Black mothers.   Maternal mortality rates have dropped around the world, but in the  U.S. they have risen, leaving behind devastated families and children  who will grow up never knowing their moms. And for Black moms and other  women and birthing people of color, the crisis is even more severe.   Throughout Black Maternal Health Week, I had deeply impactful  conversations with moms, healthcare professionals, Secretary Becerra,  and activists who have poured their hearts into solving this crisis. I  was also inspired by other conversations I saw across the country.   The need to address our Nation's maternal health crisis has never  been more urgent, especially as we continue to confront a pandemic that  has exacerbated existing health inequities, particularly for pregnant  people. I am especially excited to have the Biden/ Harris administration's partnership in this critical work.    Madam Speaker, with the American Rescue Plan and solutions like the  Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, we can save lives, end disparities,  and achieve true equity for all of our moms.                            ____________________
