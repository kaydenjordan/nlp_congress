 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for  yielding me this time. Opponents of this bill are suggesting that we  are against women's health care. What we are vehemently opposed to is  the killing of innocent lives, innocent babies.                                time  1445    So let's call abortion abortion and be reminded that the one voice,  Madam Speaker, not heard today is that of the baby. So it is my  privilege, alongside my colleagues, to speak on behalf of those who are  not here today to speak for themselves. No taxpayer dollars should ever  go to fund abortions. This is a commonsense truth that even the most  ardent pro-abortion activists have a hard time arguing.   I am unapologetically pro-life, and it is no secret that I believe in  stronger protections for unborn children under the law, but I also  believe that we must assign greater respect for life within our  society. That is why it is so important for Congress to make a  statement, once and for all, that there is no place in the Federal  budget for abortion funding.   As an appropriator, I can tell you that the Hyde amendment has been  indispensable to stopping funding for abortion throughout our  government healthcare agencies. Now it is time to apply the same  longstanding provision across the entire Federal Government.   Madam Speaker, for my pro-life colleagues and me, fighting on behalf  of the unborn has been an uphill battle these last several years. The  abortion industry's fierce allies in the Senate and the Obama  administration have made sure that many worthy pro-life measures were  defeated. However, with a unified Republican government, our hope is  that our prospects have changed for the better. On just the second day  of his Presidency, President Trump issued an executive order blocking  Federal funding for international groups to provide or promote  abortions. For the pro-life community, this long-overdue action was a  welcome sign that the Trump administration will be a powerful ally in  the fight for life.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Madam Speaker, there are many policy improvements to  pursue: reasonable limits on abortions after 5 months of pregnancy,  stopping the shell game of title X funding at Planned Parenthood,  improving access to adoption services, and more. But a great place to  start is passing H.R. 7. It is our enduring responsibility to defend  the unborn, and it is imperative we get this right.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from Tennessee has attempted to imply  that several of our speakers today support the Hyde amendment because  they voted for very large omnibus spending bills that included the Hyde  amendment. I would like to be really clear that none of the speakers on  this side today do support the Hyde amendment, and, in fact, in the  last Congress we had a bill, the EACH Woman Act, sponsored by a number  of us, 129 cosponsors, which would repeal the Hyde amendment. Sometimes  people vote for large pieces of legislation because they do things like  keep our government open and build highways and roads. But we will do  everything in our power to repeal this poorly thought-out and  regressive amendment, and we will do everything we can to defeat this  bill today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).
