 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, thank you. I rise to speak about the tax  reform issue and the tax reform effort that is front and center for  this Congress and for all Americans. Particularly, I want to point out  the fact that Congress has not undertaken this difficult task for over  30 years, and for anyone who has been involved in this, they now  realize how difficult it really is.   In the years since the last major overhaul, Congress has, by  patchwork, added numerous carve-outs and special interests, passed  short-term tax extenders, which have made planning for families and  businesses very difficult, and has generally contributed to a tax code  that today is extremely complex, burdensome, and unpredictable.   My colleague from Idaho Senator Crapo has stated that we couldn't  have done worse if we had set out intentionally to do worse. Many of my  colleagues and I have heard story after story from our constituents who  have said the same thing. The Tax Code makes it hard for families and  businesses, especially small businesses, to comply and plan ahead, let  alone grow and prosper. This conversation hasn't gone away, so clearly  the system, as it stands, is not serving the American people as it  should.   It is imperative for the continued growth of the American economy  that  [[Page S7190]]  we simplify the system, reduce complexity, and create certainty. Tax  reform will bring relief to American families. Under the plan released  by the Senate Finance Committee, middle-class Americans will see a  benefit in the form of a lower tax bill, which means more money for  households to bring home. In addition to keeping more money in the  pockets of hard-working Americans, the Senate plan nearly doubles the  standard deduction, increases the child tax credit to help families  with the very real costs associated with raising a family, and  preserves an existing tax credit to help care for elderly family  members. This tax plan would also make it easier for individuals and  families to avoid a time-consuming and expensive tax-filing nightmare  by simplifying the Tax Code and eliminating deductions.   The aim of this entire exercise is to make the Tax Code simpler,  fairer, and easier to comply with, reducing the burden on taxpayers and  creating an environment that enables families and businesses to thrive.   Tax reform will help grow small businesses. As chairman of the Senate  Small Business Committee, I have focused on highlighting small business  issues in this tax reform process. The ranking member, Senator Shaheen,  and I held a bipartisan hearing in June to talk about tax policies that  would most benefit small businesses across the country. As a result, we  sent a bipartisan letter to the Senate Finance Committee, which was  drawing this bill, to outline the policies we determined were most  important. The topline issue was the need to address the individual Tax  Code along with the corporate Tax Code. Most of the Nation's small  businesses are organized in a way that they pay taxes through the  individual code. It is amazing they managed to create the majority of  new jobs in America, despite facing this higher tax rate, with the  added burden of spending time and money away from businesses to comply  with this complex Tax Code. Thankfully, Ranking Member Shaheen and I  are not the only ones who heard this message, and lower rates for small  businesses is part of this conversation.   Small businesses have identified tax policies that work for them,  along with changes that could be made to help more of them across the  country. Two of the examples are the cash method of accounting and  section 179 expensing. Cash method accounting is a simpler way for  small businesses to keep their books, and section 179 expensing allows  small businesses to immediately deduct the cost of investing in their  business up to a certain amount. Both of these commonsense policies  will reach more business owners in tax reform.   I am encouraged by the plan the Senate Finance Committee released  last week and the process they are undertaking this week to move this  bill forward. With tax reform, we have a real opportunity to make  changes that will have a tangible, positive impact on the American  people and create an environment for our Nation's job creators to  prosper. I am excited to see the kind of job creation that will result  from the changes we are considering, and I look forward to working with  my colleagues to make this a reality.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to take the opportunity  to highlight the innovation and the creative spirit that small  businesses in my home State of Idaho are known for. The small business  that I am honoring today goes above and beyond when it comes to  embodying that spirit. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small  Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize  Krehbiel's Sales & Service as the Senate Small Business of the Month  for November 2017. Known for their passion, friendliness, and  dedication to providing unparalleled service, Krehbiel's is the  definition of what it means to be a family-owned small business in  America.   Clint Krehbiel and his son Terry Krehbiel opened the doors to their  vehicle dealership in Aberdeen, ID, in 1972 while Terry was still in  high school. They have been proudly serving southeast Idaho for the  past 45 years. The Krehbiel family specializes in off-road recreational  and utility vehicles, along with various brands of lawn care equipment.  In addition to these products, they have expanded into several other  businesses, ranging from swimming pools to satellite sales and  installation.   Terry and his wife, Valerie, bought Clint's share of the business  when he retired in 1996 and have made it their life's work to carry out  the principles of honest and ethical business that Clint passed down  over the years. For the past four-and-a-half decades, the family's  commitment to their mission has been unwavering, and their loyalty to  their customers is second to none. Perhaps the most incredible display  of their dedication can be seen in the expansion of their business to  serve customers hundreds of miles away while still maintaining a high  level of customer service and a close-knit team of employees. At any  time, you can walk in and see Karalee Krehbiel-Bonzon, Terry and  Valerie's daughter, providing the exceptional customer service that she  has been known for ever since she started working at her family's  business in 2007. You will also see Valerie doing the bookkeeping by  hand, as she has done every day since 1980. Another long-time employee  is mechanic Charlie Wiebe. Charlie was hired in 1987 and is still with  the business to this day. He has been an integral part of building and  maintaining good relationships with customers and in training other  mechanics like the team's newest member, Tyler Jones.   Customer service is not the only thing that Krehbiel's is known for.  With over 60 years of combined experience, their factory-trained  technicians have built a reputation for high-quality, dependable  repairs for all manner of recreational and utility vehicles. The  company's reputation in this area brings in customers from miles around  who have never bought a vehicle from the Krehbiels but who have built a  bond of trust with their well-qualified mechanics.   Aberdeen is considered to be ``off the beaten path'' by most people.  Many say you need to have a reason to go there. Terry and Valerie,  along with their employees, have given many people a reason to do just  that. A continuous entrepreneurial spirit, quality customer service,  and strong relationships with long-time employees are all principles  possessed by the Krehbiels. I would like to extend my sincerest  congratulations to Terry and Valerie Krehbiel and all of the employees  of Krehbiel's Sales & Service for being selected as the November 2017  Small Business of the Month. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.  [[Page S7213]]                                ____________________
