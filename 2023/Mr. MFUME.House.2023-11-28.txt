 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez) and the chairman of the committee, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), as well as the cosponsor of this  bill, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bean) for their work on this  measure.   I rise today in full support, obviously, of this bill, which requires  the Inspector General of the Small Business Administration to submit a  quarterly report on the fraud that has occurred and is being uncovered  in the small business pandemic relief programs. We do want our money  back, and this is about the first step in doing that.   On June 27 of this year, the SBA's Office of the Inspector General  issued a white paper that the Small Business Administration disbursed  more than $200 billion in potentially fraudulent pandemic relief aid in  the form of loans and in the form of grants. It was all done through  the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and the Paycheck  Protection Program.   The Small Business Administration also issued another report. It was  titled: ``Protecting the Integrity of the Pandemic Relief Programs.''   In that report, they estimated that $36 billion of the $1.2 trillion  in small business pandemic relief money was obtained fraudulently. The  criminals and the fraudsters had a payday on the American public.   That level of fraud, highly significant in these programs, is  absolutely astonishing. It also absolutely reflects the  [[Page H5911]]  years-long repercussion of the 2020 decision that the ranking member  spoke about earlier to loosen the antifraud protections in an effort to  fast-track pandemic relief. Well, I hope we are learning from our  mistakes.   It is clear that we have to do all that we can to return all of the  money stolen from the Federal Government and bring the fraudsters and  the criminals to justice.   This bill, which I am proud to co-lead with my colleague from Florida  (Mr. Bean), ensures consistent reporting, regular reporting on progress  toward the goal by requiring the Inspector General of the SBA, who has  come before our committee on a number of occasions, to issue a report  to Congress every 3 months, every 90 days, which includes the total  dollar amount of small business pandemic relief funds that were made  and the number and the type of fraud in both the new fraud cases and  the suspected fraud cases, as well as the number of fraud cases that  have been resolved to date at the conclusion of that 90-day period. We  wanted to make sure we were regular in finding the money and reporting  the money.   Again, I thank Ranking Member Velazquez, Chair Williams, and my  colleague, Mr. Bean, for their work on this measure. We do want our  money back, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, my thanks to Chairman Williams and to the  ranking member, Ms. Velazquez of New York for their leadership. She and  I were having a conversation reminding ourselves that 84 percent of all  of the loosening of the guardrails that created the problems occurred  while the previous administration was in office. It is important for  the facts to be noted in that regard. It is not in an effort to cast  aspersions, but it is in an effort to make sure we tell the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today like the gentleman from Texas and the  gentlewoman from New York in support of H.R. 5427 which prohibits, as  you have heard, individuals convicted of defrauding small business  pandemic relief programs from receiving future non-disaster financial  aid assistance from the administration.    It sounds like it is common sense to me. If you put your hand in the  cookie jar and you steal the cookies, why should you be rewarded later  for that?   To this day, our Nation has to reckon with the fact that the  consequences of that decision in 2020 to fast-track the allocation of  the pandemic relief funds by weakening and removing the internal  controls really caused the problems. It was a recipe for disaster.   Are we even astonished that something like this would happen?   This is why so many of us argued against this in 2020.   While many of these antifraud controls are being reinstituted by the  Small Business Administration, fraud in these programs has run rampant.  We let the horse out of the barn and are wasting time looking at it  instead of trying to find a way to get it back in. So that is what this  measure does in many respects.   As the ranking member of the Small Business Subcommittee on  Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations, I have been, like many of  my colleagues on the committee, incredibly concerned by the misuse and  the abuse of pandemic relief funds.   Why?   It is a very simple answer: These funds could have been used to  protect jobs. They could have been used to lift small businesses out of  financial distress as they should have, and they could have created a  circular flow of income in so many communities, urban and rural,  throughout this country.   Instead, they lined the pockets of thieves and fraudsters. So that is  why I am pleased to be the Democratic co-lead on this along with Mr.  Williams.   This bill amends section 16 of the SBA Act to prohibit, as we said  before, anyone convicted of crimes related to financial misconduct or  making false statements with respect to small business pandemic relief  moneys from not being able to receive nondisaster financial assistance  in the future. It is kind of common sense. It really is.   So this bill ensures that those who knowingly and willfully stole  Federal funds are not given a similar opportunity in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez of New  York; the chair, Mr. Williams of Texas; Mr. Bean of Florida; and others  on both sides of the aisle for working to make sure that this bill has  the support it needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues later today to be able to  stand up and to vote for it.
