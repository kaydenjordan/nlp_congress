 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my fellow co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, Senator Jeanne  Shaheen, which would improve access to innovative diabetes  technologies. Our bill, the Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access to  Innovative Diabetes Technologies Act, would create a special task force  at the Department of Health and Human Services to examine and address  barriers that seniors face in accessing the latest diabetes management  technologies.   Since I founded the bipartisan Senate Diabetes Caucus in 1997 Federal  funding for diabetes research has tripled from $319 million to more  than $1 billion last year, and these research dollars are yielding  results. This past summer, the Aging Committee held a hearing in  conjunction with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Children's  Congress titled ``Redefining Reality: How the Special Diabetes Program  is Changing the Lives of Americans with Type 1 Diabetes.'' We heard  compelling testimony from Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers, Director of the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and  JDRF President and CEO Dr. Aaron Kowalski on the pipeline from private- public research to commercially available products.   New diabetes technologies--such as the artificial pancreas and  implantable continuous glucose monitoring systems--allow diabetes  patients to better manage and improve glycemic control, assess needed  therapy on a timely basis, and adhere to treatment regimens. These  technological advances make diabetes easier to manage. The market  arrival of cutting-edge diabetes technologies, however, does not  immediately benefit patients if our nation's seniors are unable to  afford them.   As Chairman of the Aging Committee, I have heard from numerous  seniors who, when transitioning from employer-provided insurance to  Medicare, were shocked to learn that the technologies they have relied  upon for years to manage their diabetes are no longer covered. For  example, one Mainer was unfortunately met with the reality that  Medicare's coverage denial of a particular sensor he needs for his  insulin pump means paying up to $8,000 out-of-pocket each year if he  wants to continue with his current treatment regimen. He wrote,  ``Because I am now 65, I am denied care that was available when I was  64.'' He continued, ``This approach not only puts me at risk but is  quite likely not cost effective. While the sensors are expensive, the  cost of ambulance calls and hospitalizations . . . is certainly more.''   I couldn't agree more. To better support adoption of these  technologies, our bill would require HHS to create a special task force  on coverage and payment for innovative diabetes technologies that would  bring all stakeholders--from patients to device manufacturers to  government officials who are making coverage decisions--to the same  table. The Task Force would identify and plan for changes in Medicare  coverage and payment policies to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries  have access to innovative diabetes technologies that are currently  available, as well as those that are in the pipeline. The Task Force  would also be tasked with developing strategies for supporting adoption  of these technologies.   This effort builds on my past advocacy with Senator Shaheen to  improve the day-to-day life of individuals with diabetes by improving  coverage of innovative diabetes technologies. In January 2017, in  response to our bipartisan effort, CMS first approved the use of  continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). We also successfully urged CMS last  year to support the use of smartphone apps in conjunction with CGMs.  These proven, lifesaving devices are relied upon by people with  diabetes to provide them with real-time measurements of their glucose  levels. This information is key to preventing costly--and sometimes  deadly--diabetes complications.   While I am pleased our advocacy has helped spur these policy changes,  I remain frustrated with the pace at which Medicare lags behind  commercial insurers. Greater adoption of new diabetes technologies can  literally change our country's future with regard to addressing the  explosive growth in the financial and human tolls of diabetes. Diabetes  accounts for an exorbitant one in three dollars in Medicare spending.  It is paramount that we encourage HHS to adopt a more cost-effective  approach to treating this chronic disease that affects more than 30  million Americans.   The Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access to Innovative Diabetes  Technologies Act encourages a proactive approach to diabetes technology  coverage and payment, and I encourage my colleagues to support its  adoption.   Thank you, Mr. President.
