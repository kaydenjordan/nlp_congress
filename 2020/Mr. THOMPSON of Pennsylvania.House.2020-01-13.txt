 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Peter Van Cise of Julian, Pennsylvania. Peter is a senior at  the Bald Eagle Area High School. When considering his post-graduation  options, Peter honorably chose to commit himself to serving his  country.   I am proud of Peter and pleased to announce that he has accepted a  fully qualified appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in  Colorado.   Peter is the son of Ann Van Cise and Dana Van Cise, an Air Force  veteran. He is the youngest of seven children. Peter excelled in the  classroom, on the soccer field, and in his community as a true leader.  I know that his hard work as a student will serve him well as he starts  his military career in the Air Force Academy.   Peter has continually demonstrated a sincere commitment to service,  and I wish him all the best in this exciting new venture.                            ____________________
