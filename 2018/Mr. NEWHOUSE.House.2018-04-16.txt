 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of Russell Jim, an elder of the Yakama Nation, who was highly regarded  as a champion for central Washington's environment.   Russell had a deep understanding of the Yakama Nation's culture, the  region's natural resources, and the Hanford nuclear site. He spent his  life and career protecting our environment and advocating for  responsible nuclear waste management.  [[Page H3331]]    He managed the Tribe's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management  program for almost 40 years and served in Tribal leadership for almost  60. Russell was a key player in preventing Hanford from becoming the  Nation's repository for radioactive waste, and he received an honorary  doctorate degree from Heritage University for his work.   Russell Jim will be remembered for his knowledge and passion for the  Yakama Nation and their way of life. My thoughts are with his family at  this difficult time, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring  his memory.                            ____________________
