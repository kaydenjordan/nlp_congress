 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing the community of Glasgow for leading the way with  their generosity during the holiday season. Earlier this month, members  of the community successfully conducted their annual Block of Bucks  program to help raise funds for local families to have warm clothing  during the winter months.   This charitable effort brought together a broad collection of the  community, including the Glasgow Soroptimists, student council leaders  from Glasgow High School, members of the National Guard, the local Elks  Club, a host of local businesses, and dozens of other volunteers.  Through their focused actions, the community of Glasgow raised over  $30,000 to provide more than 300 hundred children with winter clothing.  If you have ever experienced winter along the Hi-Line in northeast  Montana, you will know how important it is to have the proper gear. The  generosity of neighbors in towns like Glasgow is something that we can  all appreciate.   It is a Montana hallmark for neighbors to identify a need and then  gather the people and resources to meet that need at a local level.  Going into Christmas, I would like to offer a heartfelt thank you to  the folks in Glasgow for giving their time and talents to help others  by adding warmth to the holiday season.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
