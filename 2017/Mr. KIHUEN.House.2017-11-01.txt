 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-month anniversary of the  terrible shooting that happened in my hometown, Las Vegas, on October  1.   I rise to remember the life of Heather Alvarado, a woman who was  known for her hugs, her love of hot pink, and her beautiful green eyes.   Heather lived for her kids, Syrus, Albie, and Charlie, and had  traveled to Las Vegas to attend the Route 91 concert with her daughter.   Heather loved going on vacation with her family and spending time  outdoors. She loved planning parties for her children and friends,  including hosting elaborate Halloween parties every year. She was known  for her caring nature and kindness. Heather's husband, Albert, said  that she saw the good in everyone and would do almost anything to help  others.   I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Heather's friends  and family. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the State of  Nevada and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
