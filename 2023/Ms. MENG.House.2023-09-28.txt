 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the fiscal  year 2024 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill.   As a member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee, I am appalled by the dangerous cuts and policy riders the  majority has attached to this bill.   Yesterday, we heard from our friends across the aisle that the  purpose of our military is to deter a war if diplomacy fails. Cutting  funding for our State Department to levels not seen since 2009 and  proposing eliminating funding for USAID not only cedes America's  position as a leader on the world stage but also eliminates funding for  the very programs that seek to prevent violence and advance stability  in areas vulnerable to conflict. This bill weakens our national  security, not enhances it.   This bill also harms women all around the world. From eliminating our  contributions to critical multilateral agencies, including U.N. Women  and UNFPA, to cutting bilateral and multilateral international  reproductive health funding by nearly a third, we are sending a message  that the U.S. is willing to cede its role in helping the international  community achieve global health targets, address unacceptably high  global maternal mortality rates and gender-based violence, support  healthy families, or promote gender equity. This is all at the behest  of the majority's culture war.  [[Page H4723]]    I do not accept the premise that we are willing to risk 8.2 million  women and couples losing access to contraceptive services, resulting in  2.7 million more unintended pregnancies leading to 1.1 million  additional unplanned births and an additional 4,700 maternal deaths.  Women and girls deserve better.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this harmful legislation.
