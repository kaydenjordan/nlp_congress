 Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee report (H. Rept. 115- 772) to accompany House Resolution 954 should have included in its  waiver of all points of order against consideration of H.R. 4760 a  disclosure of the following violation:   Clause 12(a)(1) of rule XXI, requiring a comparative print to be made  publicly available prior to consideration of a bill amending or  repealing statutes to show, by typographical device, parts of statute  affected.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 954 Offered by Mrs. Torres         Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:        That on the next legislative day after the adoption of this       resolution, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, the House shall resolve       into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the       Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 4760) to amend the       immigration laws and the homeland security laws, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Whip or       their respective designees. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. No amendment shall       be in order except the amendments in the nature of a       substitute specified in section 2 of this resolution. Each       such amendment may be offered only in the order specified,       may be offered only by the Member designated, shall be       considered as read, and shall be debatable for 40 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent. All points of order against such amendments are       waived (except those arising under clause 7 of rule XVI).       Clause 6(g) of rule XVIII shall not apply with respect to a       request for a recorded vote on any such amendment. If more       than one such amendment is adopted, then only the one       receiving the greater number of affirmative recorded votes       shall be considered as finally adopted. In the case of a tie       for the greater number of affirmative recorded votes, then       only the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative       recorded votes shall be considered as finally adopted. After       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment,       the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House       with such amendment as may have been finally adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 2. The amendments in the nature of a substitute       referred to in the first section of this resolution are as       follows:        (1) A proper amendment in the nature of a substitute, if       offered by Representative Goodlatte of Virginia or his       designee.        (2) A proper amendment in the nature of a substitute, if       offered by Representative Roybal-Allard of California or her       designee.        (3) A proper amendment in the nature of a substitute, if       offered by Representative Ryan of Wisconsin or his designee.        (4) A proper amendment in the nature of a substitute, if       offered by Representative Denham of California or his       designee.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4760.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition.  [[Page H5379]]       Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous       question having been refused, the gentleman from New York,       Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him       for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished  gentleman from Washington, a member of the Rules Committee, for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I really came down here to take part in this debate  because, yesterday, for 7 hours, we were at the Rules Committee laying  out what are known as Goodlatte 1 and Goodlatte 2, these two bills.   This is the rule on what might be called Goodlatte 2. This is a rule  and a piece of legislation that represents several years' worth of work  that was done by Members of the Republican majority to approach an  issue that is known as DACA. It is to take some 700,000 young people,  and slightly older, who came to America not because they did it on  their own fruition as even a young adult, but as a child, where they  could not make a decision. They came with their parents to this  country.   We have been struggling for years to find the right answer on how to  answer the question of how to deal with these Dreamers.   It is the Republican Party that was challenged by our President who  said: I would like for Congress to tackle this issue. It was the  President of the United States that began debate and discussion on a  bipartisan basis with Republicans and Democrats, Senators and House  Members, down at the White House.   It found itself at a point where, then, Members came back here and  began working together. It did fall apart, but it did not end. It did  not end because the Republican Party in our majority have groups of  people who are from all across this country, as we have a Congressman  Curbelo from Miami, Florida, as we have a  Dan Newhouse from the State  of Washington. Each of these Members have care and concern about people  who live in their district and who have come and petitioned them:  Please, Congressman Newhouse, do something.   What did they ask for? They asked for two things, very simply. They  asked: Please allow us to come out of the shadows and recognize us.  And, secondly: Give us legal status.    Mr. Speaker, we are out of time.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what these bills do. They address the  issue in a compassionate, fair way.                                time  1515    They address the issues of coming out of the shadows, and they are  given permanent legal status that gives them options for the rest of  their life.   I think that what we have done, Mr. Speaker, is more than what we  were asked, and to not be a part of taking a vote on this today and  voting ``yes'' is another opportunity that we are given here today.   I hope the Members understand the importance.
