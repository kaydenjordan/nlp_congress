 Mr. Speaker, we are just days away from catastrophic  economic default. House Republicans are playing politics with the lives  of the American people to further an extremist agenda.   Putting the American economy at risk is reckless and dangerous. In my  district, default would eliminate 7,300 jobs, jeopardize Social  Security for 93,000 families, and put health benefits at risk for  281,000 people who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or VA health coverage.   Their proposals do not solve any of our economic problems. In fact,  the default on America is an egregious bill that puts vulnerable  families at risk. Their plan would be disastrous in my State of  Connecticut, resulting in 2,800 kids losing access to preschool and  childcare, 12,000 mothers would be blocked from food assistance, and it  would threaten medical care for 57,000 veterans.   It is a disgrace that leading into Memorial Day, House Republicans  have ghosted the city and left.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to come back to Washington, pay our  bills, and end this now.                            ____________________
