 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  incredible talent and achievements of Las Vegas High School's Mariachi  Joya. One of the top ensembles in one of the largest mariachi programs  in the United States, Mariachi Joya brings music, joy, community, and  culture to southern Nevada. I am proud to host them in our Nation's  Capital in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.   Launching in 2018, Mariachi Joya is one of the newest mariachi  programs in Clark County, but that hasn't prevented these talented  students from becoming a premier ensemble. Over 250 students at Las  Vegas High School participate in the school's mariachi program, and  many audition for Mariachi Joya, which takes 20 young artists each  year. These students, playing the guitarron, violins, and trumpets,  have quickly made Mariachi Joya the top ensemble group representing the  school.   Mariachi Joya's skyrocketing fame has taken them around Las Vegas and  throughout the country. The students perform locally at homecoming  assemblies, sports games, Mexican Independence Day celebrations, and  even at national conferences in Las Vegas. In celebration of Hispanic  Heritage Month 2021, Mariachi Joya came to Washington, DC, to perform  for the Mexican Embassy. The group made their State proud when they  performed virtually at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration.   Despite not being able to meet in-person during the pandemic,  Mariachi Joya continued to rehearse and perform together. They recorded  and produced an album virtually, ``Joya,'' which has nine tracks,  including one original song.   Director Stephen Blanco leads Mariachi Joya and is wholeheartedly  dedicated to his students. Mr. Blanco moved from Michigan to Nevada in  order to start Las Vegas High School's mariachi program. He has  developed an incredible program and was a semifinalist for the 2022  Grammy Music Educator Award.   Mariachi Joya highlights the vibrant Latino history and culture in  southern Nevada. It brings the Latino community together as it spreads  the beauty of its music. Most importantly, it has an impact on the  students who participate. It is giving kids a support system, turning  them into model students, and it boasts an impressive 100 percent  graduation rate. I am so honored to recognize this incredible program,  its brilliant students, and its contributions to the Latino community.  I look forward to seeing Mariachi Joya continue to grow and thrive in  the years to come.                            ____________________
