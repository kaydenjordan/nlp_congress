 Mr. Speaker, this Thursday marks 1 year  since the horrific shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took 17 precious  lives. My community faced our own tragedy just 9 months later when 12  of our friends and neighbors were stolen from us at the Borderline Bar  and Grill.   As our communities continue to mourn these devastating tragedies, we  must also honor the memories of those we lost with action. There is no  single answer that will stop every incident of gun violence, but to do  nothing with the argument that it will not fix everything is  unconscionable.   One of the first steps we need to take is passing H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which is being considered by the  House Judiciary Committee this week.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  bill, a critical first step to keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong  hands.                            ____________________
