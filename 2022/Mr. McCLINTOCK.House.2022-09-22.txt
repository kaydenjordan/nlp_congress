 Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2020, mobs of radical  leftists burned our cities, preyed on innocent citizens, attacked our  police officers, and occupied business districts during what one  leftist Democrat mayor called the summer of love. At least 25 people  were killed.   Republicans called for law and order. Democrats called for defunding  our police departments and releasing dangerous criminals onto our  streets, often within hours of their arrests. In the cities they  controlled, they did just that.   In those cities, crime has skyrocketed, including the fastest  increase in homicides ever recorded in our Nation. Ironically, the  greatest victims are their own constituents, who are now turning on  them.   Crime doesn't concern House Democrats, but losing political support  before an election, that scares them to death, so we have these bills  brought hurriedly to the floor today.   Let me point out the obvious. Republican communities have backed  their police departments with the local funds and the moral support  they need to do their jobs. Democratic cities have defunded and  demonized their police departments.   The Democrats' response is to take the taxes paid by the citizens who  fully funded their police departments and give them to those Democratic  cities that have cut them, and still virtually none of the money they  propose to spend is for actual law enforcement. It is, rather, for  intervention, de-escalation, training, public health, and social work  training, all administered by the increasingly corrupt and politicized  Department of Justice.   We have watched the Democrats utterly destroy the cities that they  have dominated for decades. Do we really want to let them do the same  thing to our country?   Americans need to ask themselves how much farther down this dismal  road they are willing to go. We can restore safety to all of our  communities the moment we summon the political will to do so.
