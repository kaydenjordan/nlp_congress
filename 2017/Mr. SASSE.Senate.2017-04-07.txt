 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to yours in  commending the chairman of the Judiciary  [[Page S2444]]  Committee, the Senator from Iowa, for the honorable, principled, and  commonsense way in which he led this committee through the last number  of weeks and months as he shepherded through this body the confirmation  of Judge--on Monday, Justice--Gorsuch.   The chairman from Iowa is a special man, and the 100 of us--or the 99  of us--who are privileged and blessed to serve with him know he is the  model of how to conduct oneself honorably in this job, and America will  benefit from Judge Gorsuch's joining the Court.   I add my voice to those commending the senior Senator from Iowa for  the way he has helped shepherd this body.
