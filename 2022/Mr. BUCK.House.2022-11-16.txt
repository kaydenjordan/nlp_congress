 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H8523]]    Madam Speaker, this bill is very simple. It removes a muzzle from  employees if they have been raped or harassed in the workplace.   By allowing women to expose predators in the workplace, this  legislation further protects future victims. It also puts employers on  notice that they must be more careful in performing due diligence and  doing background checks on applicants.   Finally, this bill is limited to cases of rape and sexual harassment.  This bill doesn't stop a worker from waiving their constitutional right  to free speech in any other circumstance.   If you have trade secrets, you may be subjected to a nondisclosure  agreement. If you object to the management practices of your employer,  you may be subjected to a nondisclosure agreement. If you are raped,  you may not be muzzled.   This legislation gives us a choice. We can protect rapists,  predators, and perverts in the workplace, or we can give voice to  victims, survivors, and the most vulnerable among us. We can assure  Americans that our employers will only hire those employees who respect  others in the workplace.   This bill received unanimous support in the Senate and has bipartisan  support in the House. The reason is simple: We all had mothers who  faced antiquated attitudes in the workplace. We don't want our  daughters and our granddaughters to face those same attitudes.   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this commonsense legislation. I  very much appreciate the Speaker and Representative Frankel's  leadership on this issue, and I hope that Republicans step up and do  the right thing.
