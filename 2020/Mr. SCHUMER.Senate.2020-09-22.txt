 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow the recently departed Supreme  Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will lie in repose at the Supreme  Court, and on Friday Ruth Bader Ginsburg will lie in state here in the  Capitol, the first time in our Nation's long history that a woman has  ever received the honor.   I can think of no more fitting tribute for a woman who made a life's  work of going where women had never gone before. Even with the benefit  of a few days, the loss of Justice Ginsburg is devastating. You need  only walk by the Supreme Court today, where flowers, candles, chalk- written notes, and spontaneous demonstrations have clogged the  sidewalks for 4 days straight, to know her impact on this country.   We will honor her this week, and, by all rights, we should honor her  dying wish, imparted to her granddaughter, that she ``not be replaced  until the next President is installed.'' All the words and encomia for  Justice Ginsburg from the other side ring hollow if they will not honor  her last dying wish.   Yesterday, the Republican side--so often, President Trump--seemed to  make it worse. President Trump mocked Justice Ginsburg's dying wish by  insinuating that her granddaughter was a liar, once again confirming  every terrible thing we know about our President.   He said that Justice Ginsburg's statement was something that ``sounds  like a Schumer deal or maybe Pelosi or shifty Schiff.'' That is the  President of the United States baselessly suggesting that Democrats  fabricated the dying wish of the late Justice Ginsburg. It was a  coarse, shameful, lying insult to the late Justice Ginsburg and to her  family.   If the President had a shred of human decency--even a little--he  would apologize, but we all know he will not. Everyone here in the  Senate ought to be disgusted by the President's comments. How low can  this President go? He knows no depth. You can never know that.   You would think that, after the Republican majority led a historic  blockade just 4 years ago to keep open a vacancy on the Supreme Court  because it was an election year, they would have the honor and decency  to apply their  [[Page S5735]]  own rule when the same scenario came around again. You would expect the  Senate majority to follow their own rule. What is fair is fair.   This is what Leader McConnell said in 2016:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new President.    This is the McConnell rule--the McConnell rule. This is the principle  that Leader McConnell and then-Chairman Grassley used to justify their  refusal to even meet with President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.   Here it is--the McConnell rule: When it is a Presidential season, you  can't vote on a Supreme Court nominee because ``the American people  should have a voice.'' Now, Leader McConnell repeated that refrain for  almost a year and so did almost every other Republican in the Chamber:         The American people shouldn't be denied a voice.        Give the people a voice.        The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court Justice       until we have a new President.        I don't think we should be moving on a nominee in the last       year of a President's term. I would say that if it was a       Republican President.        If an opening came in the last year of President Trump's       term and the primary process had started--    The primary process had started--       we'll wait to the next election.    I don't even have to tell you who those quotes came from. It was  nearly every single Republican in this Chamber. That is how they  justified the unprecedented blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court  nominee: no vote during a Presidential election year because we have to  let the people decide.   They promised to stay consistent if a Republican President won in  November. It turns out, a Republican President did win that fall, and a  Supreme Court vacancy did arise in the final year of his term, not just  during the primary process but long after it was over, with little more  than a month--a month--before the election.   Now, whoops, didn't mean it. It is different now. We are supposed to  believe this specious, flimsy, and dishonest argument that it is about  the orientation of the Senate and the Presidency or how angry  Republicans are at Democrats and all the big, scary things we might do  in the future. Maybe that will justify it--anything not to admit the  plain fact that they all made one argument for a year, an argument they  insisted was a ``principle'' when it was good for them politically, and  now they are doing the opposite thing.   The McConnell rule: ``The American people should have a voice in the  selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.'' It turns out, the  McConnell rule was nothing more than a McConnell ruse.   Leader McConnell, sadly, sadly, is headed down the path of breaking  his word to the Senate and the American people. He has exposed once and  for all that a supposed principle of giving the people a voice in  selecting the next Justice was a farce. Sadly, again--sadly--Leader  McConnell has defiled the Senate like no one in this generation, and  Leader McConnell may very well destroy it.   If Leader McConnell presses forward, the Republican majority will  have stolen two Supreme Court seats, 4 years apart, using completely  contradictory rationales. How can we expect to trust the other side  again?   For those of you on the other side who are still thinking about this  and maybe some who might change their minds, just think of what this  does to this body and people's word on one of our most solemn and  sacred obligations: to choose a Supreme Court Justice fairly and  honestly.   It is obvious why the Republican leader, when he comes to the floor,  sounds so angry and defensive in his remarks. I will note for the  record that the Republican leader did not once mention his principle in  2016--that the American people should have a voice in selecting the  next Supreme Court Justice--in any of his speeches because he can't  mention it.   Just to give you a sense of how far down the rabbit hole my friend  from Kentucky has gone, yesterday--listen to this--this is what he  said. Leader McConnell said that President Obama asked the Senate ``for  an unusual favor'' by fulfilling his constitutional duty to nominate a  Supreme Court Justice with almost a year left in the term--``an unusual  favor.''   Only the Republican leader could look at our system of government so  cynically. Apparently, the Senate's constitutional duty to advise and  consent is an unusual favor when a Democratic President is in office  but a categorical imperative when a Republican is in office.   That is actually his argument. I listened to the Republican leader  yesterday. I listened to him this morning. Gone are all the invocations  of giving the American people a voice. It is nothing so supposedly  high-minded this time. No, this time the Republican leader isn't even  hiding that his decision is nothing--nothing--but raw, partisan  politics.   According to the Republican leader, when the President and the Senate  majority are the same party, you can break all the rules to get your  Justice. Change the rules of the Senate to pass Supreme Court Justices  on a majority vote. Rush it through before an election. It doesn't  matter if you said the exact opposite thing 4 years ago, 2 years ago,  or even, for some Senators, a few months ago.   This is how our vaunted traditions of bipartisanship and compromise-- on life support before--now end. This is how. By one side--in this case  the Republican majority under Leader McConnell--deciding that the rules  don't apply to them, even their own rules. That, when push comes to  shove, it is brute political force, all the way down.   If my friends on the Republican side want that kind of Senate, they  can follow Leader McConnell down the very dangerous path he has laid  down.                            ____________________     Madam President, one final matter. According to the  official tally at Johns Hopkins University, the United States today  will reach a staggering milestone of 200,000 Americans lost to COVID- 19--200,000 Americans--more than any other country on Earth. Far more  than we should have. Far more than we would have had there been a  proper, coordinated, and energetic response to the virus by the Trump  administration.   In the face of this tragic milestone, what does President Trump do?  Does he mourn the astounding loss of lives? No, he goes off on the  campaign trail, where yesterday he told his supporters that the virus  ``affects virtually nobody.''   Affects virtually nobody? Tell that to the families and friends of  the 200,000 who are in mourning.   Seriously, the day before the United States hits 200,000 deaths from  COVID-19, the President said the virus ``affects virtually nobody.''   He also said: ``If you take the blue states out, we're really at a  very low level.''   He also said: ``It is what it is.''   This is our President? My goodness.   Do you want to know why we have the worst pandemic response of any  developed nation on Earth? You want to know why now nearly one out of  every five deaths from COVID-19 come from America? It is because  President Trump lied to the American people from day one about the  gravity of this disease, and he is still doing it now, in a desperate  and vile effort to boost his political fortunes.   And here in the Senate, Republicans will do anything--anything to  back him, no matter what he says or does, as long as he nominates their  judges.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Reserving the right to object. Because the Senate  Republicans have no respect for the institution, we will not have  business as usual here in the Senate, I object.    Madam President, over the course of her extraordinary  life, Justice Ginsburg did as much to advance the cause of justice as  she could manage. She was a trailblazer of women from all ages, from  all walks of life, who watched her tear down the barriers that  separated men from women, first from outside the corridors of power,  then within them.   As I said this morning, it is only fitting that she will be the first  woman to ever lie in state at the Nation's Capitol. After all, she made  a life's work  [[Page S5741]]  out of going where women had not gone before.   I rise now to offer a resolution that will honor her long and  illustrious career. Republicans came to us with this resolution, but it  ignored Justice Ginsburg's dying wish, what she called her most fervent  wish, that she not be replaced until the new President is installed. We  simply have added to the exact same text of the resolution the  Republicans gave us.   All the kind words and lamentations about Justice Ginsburg from the  Republican majority will be totally empty if those Republicans ignore  her dying wish and instead move to replace her with someone who will  tear down everything she built; someone who could turn the clock back  on a woman's right to choose; someone who could turn back the clock on  marriage equality; someone who would make it impossible to join a  union; someone who could take healthcare away from tens of millions of  Americans, send drug prices soaring, and rip away protections for up to  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions. That is what we are  talking about when we talk about this vacancy.   For hundreds of millions of Americans, everything is on the line.  Perhaps that is why Justice Ginsburg expressed her ``fervent'' wish  that she not be replaced until the next President is installed. She  knew how important the Supreme Court was in American life, and she knew  there would be great temptation to take advantage of the timing of her  death for political purposes. She knew the risks of her vacancy turning  into a power game driven by rank partisanship, so she expressed a  simple idea: Let the next President decide, whoever it might be. It  could be President Trump, it could be Vice President Biden, but let the  next President decide.   Don't rush a nominee through mere days before an election in what is  sure to be the most controversial and partisan Supreme Court nomination  in our Nation's entire history.   Maybe Justice Ginsburg hoped that her dying wish could save the  Senate majority from itself. It doesn't appear that way, but here on  the floor this afternoon, we ask our colleagues to acknowledge her  entire life and legacy, including her dying wish.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of the Schumer resolution  related to the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States, which is at the desk. I further ask  that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I  believe Justice Ginsburg would have easily seen through the legal  sophistry of the argument of the junior Senator from Texas. To turn  Justice Ginsburg's dying words against her is so, so beneath the  dignity of this body.   I do not modify.    Mr. President, I will be brief.   First, I want to thank all of my colleagues who have already spoken  and who will speak. We have over 15 of our colleagues talking about  this issue because it is so vitally important to the American people.   Now, let me tell you a little tale. About 40 or 50 years ago, after  Barry  [[Page S5761]]  Goldwater lost for the Presidency, some of the hard-rock conservatives  realized that they had to create something that would help them realize  their goals, and it gradually grew and grew and grew and by 1980 was  very strong with the election of Ronald Reagan.   At that point, these conservatives realized that their views would  never be enacted by the elected branches of government--the article I  branch and the article II branch--because their views were so far to  the right of not only the average American but even the average  Republican. They realized that the one way they could move America in  their hard-right direction was the courts, the nonelected branch. They  endeavored to place, through many different organizations--at the top  of the list, the Federalist Society, but many others--these people,  many of whom they had cultivated since they were in law school, on the  bench.   This vacancy caused by the unfortunate death of RBG would lock in  this hard-right agenda for a generation--for a generation. All the  things that people in America believe in could be undone by an  unelected group, the Supreme Court of the United States.   As my colleague from Oregon just outlined, healthcare would be so far  away from what the American people need.   The right of a woman to choose. The right of a woman to healthcare.  The ACA, which they want to repeal, which will go before the Court, has  protections for women's healthcare--gone.   The right of unions. This Court, even without such a conservative  majority, pushed forward the Janus case. I believe their goal is to  eliminate all unions and make America a right-to-work country, as they  have endeavored to make many States right-to-work.   LGBTQ rights, passed because of the courageous actions of Justice  Kennedy, could be evaporated.   Climate, dealing with climate change--we could see the Clean Air  Clean Water Act eviscerated by this new rightwing Court.   Voting rights--one of the most awful decisions, the Shelby decision,  led by Chief Justice Roberts, where they said ``Oh, there is no more  discrimination in America; we don't need the Federal Government to  protect voting rights''--undone, and we have seen what happened  throughout the country since then.   And civil rights--just about anything that this country has made  progress on and holds dear--will be undone by this new Court.   This is not just a political debate between Democrats and  Republicans. I tell the American people: Everything you need and want-- just about everything--will be taken away inexorably, month after  month, year after year, decision after decision, by this new Court,  which, as my colleague from Rhode Island has ably documented, has been  put forward by a hard-right group led by some very narrow, greedy  people who don't want to pay any taxes and who don't want any  government regulation. They are rich and powerful. They don't want  anyone interfering with any of that.   We will rue the day--rue the day--that we add another hard-right  Federalist Society-approved jurist to this Supreme Court, and America  will have a very, very difficult time recovering.   I urge my Republican colleagues, who know the hypocrisy of saying to  Merrick Garland ``You shouldn't go forward'' but to this new nominee  ``You should,'' for the sake of this body, for the sake of the country,  for the sake of progress, for the sake of the viability and forward  advance of our citizenry, think twice--think twice.   It is going to be a sad day in America and will lead to very bad  consequences for this country if a solid, hard-right majority on this  Court is able to rule over our lives.   I hope, I pray, and I will do everything I can to see that that  doesn't happen.   I yield the floor and thank my colleague for his yielding for these  brief moments.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4638         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
