 Mr. President, today, once again, I am here to discuss  my constitutional oversight of the Justice Department and the FBI. It  surely has been a very busy year thus far for congressional oversight,  and let me say rightly so. That is the way it should be because we  know, first, Congress passes laws, but Congress can't stop there. We  have got to make sure that Congress follows up to guarantee, under our  checks and balances of our Constitution, that a President will  faithfully execute the laws.   In many of my speeches on the topic of oversight, I have discussed  how political infection has taken root in the Biden Justice Department  and FBI. Such a political infection is catastrophic to the trust the  American people must have in these institutions in order for those  institutions to have any legitimate effect.   To restore this country's confidence in the Justice Department and  the FBI, these Agencies must come clean with a 1023 document that  whistleblowers have approached me about.   An FBI 1023 document is used to collect information from what the FBI  calls a confidential human source.   A confidential human source is not--I want to emphasize--is not a  mere walk-in or a mere tip like some journalists have reported.  Confidential human source purpose is to advance investigative activity,  and the FBI takes great care to make sure that they can vet these  people and know that they serve a useful purpose.   The 1023 that I sought from the FBI references a criminal scheme  involving then-Vice President Biden and his alleged receipt of $5  million for a policy decision. Now, at first, the FBI refused to even  admit that this document existed, let alone admit that this document  was marked ``unclassified.''   Then I told Director Wray last week that Chairman Comer and I have  reviewed the 1023. I told Director Wray that this 1023 is marked  ``unclassified.'' I told him that it was dated June 30, 2020, and I and  Chairman Comer demanded that he produce that document.   Director Wray made one excuse after another to not produce it. I  reminded Director Wray about how the FBI has a penchant for leaking  classified information to the media and producing documents to the  media. In fact, we all know that the FBI did exactly that in a May 18,  2023, New York Times article. The FBI, therefore, has no legitimate  basis to refuse production of a nonclassified document to the Congress  of the United States.   Let's keep in mind that Congress has received 1023 documents in the  past, and now the FBI is subject to a legitimate subpoena for that very  document. In last week's phone call with Director Wray, I also asked  him if the 1023 is part of an ongoing investigation. He answered that  it is relevant to an ongoing investigative matter.   From that vague answer, it is reasonable to conclude that it is part  of an ongoing investigation, otherwise it wouldn't be relative to one.  It is also reasonable to conclude that the FBI finds it reliable enough  to continue using it several years later.   Still--still--that doesn't preclude Congress from running a parallel  investigation pursuant to our constitutional oversight  responsibilities.   You may remember that this Senator did the same thing during  Crossfire Hurricane. If anything, this entire process is a lesson for  the executive branch with respect to Congress's constitutional power of  oversight.   Now, remember, Congress funds the executive branch, not the other way  around. Remember, the document referenced other details that I believe  will be made public in time. We have duties to the whistleblowers who  have provided legally protected unclassified disclosures to us. These  whistleblowers are patriots and must be protected.   Partisan media, most likely in conjunction with the Biden FBI, has  misleadingly reported the 1023 is from a tranche of information  provided by Rudy Giuliani. News reports last week dispel that notion  and make clear that 1023 information that we request is independent of  Giuliani.   Those news reports also show that the source who formed the basis of  the 1023 is a long-serving FBI source. The source reportedly received  numerous validations from the FBI. The source reportedly operated even  during the Obama administration. Based on what I have been told about  yesterday's meeting, the FBI didn't contradict these findings.   Today, I can say that based upon unclassified and legally protected  whistleblower disclosures, the FBI source in the 1023 has been paid at  least $200,000 by the FBI since the source was opened and operational.   High-dollar payments obviously mean the FBI believes the source to be  credible and reputable. That makes sense, since Director Wray said the  1023 is relevant to an ongoing investigative report.   So is the FBI looking at bribery allegations against members of the  Biden family? Is U.S. Attorney Weiss looking into this? Did the FBI  follow normal investigative processes and procedures or did they just  sweep this under the rug?   For example, did the FBI try to improperly use the August 2020 Brian  Auten assessment to shut down the 1023 reporting by falsely labeling it  ``disinformation''? What exactly is the FBI doing with the information  in this 1023 document that we request?  [[Page S1970]]    A vague pronouncement that the 1023 is relevant to an ongoing matter  is certainly not even close to enough information to satisfy Congress  as well as the American people about what is actually being done with  the information on this 1023 document.   The Justice Department and the FBI no longer deserve the benefit of  the doubt. Just read the Durham report and its example after example of  Justice Department and FBI failures that the Durham report points out.   And since July of last year, I have raised one whistleblower  allegation after another to Attorney General Garland and to Director  Wray of the FBI relating to the Biden family investigation.   Now, just remember this: The Justice Department and the FBI have  failed to dispute a single whistleblower allegation that I have made  public. They have also failed to provide any records that I have  requested from the FBI or the Department of Justice.   Here, with this 1023 document that I have been referring to  throughout my remarks, the Biden Justice Department and FBI must  explain to Congress and the American people what, if anything, they  have done with this information. And they need to show their work. We  are not accepting their word anymore. We are seeking documentary proof  of what they did to investigate the matter or their failure to so do.  Given the gravity of the issues at stake, the American people deserve  nothing less.   So to the Justice Department and the FBI: Quit playing games and  recognize whom you work for. You are not working to protect the  corporate interests of the FBI; you are working for the American  people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in recognition of Short Line Rail  Advocacy Day, which was on May 17, I want to speak about the important  services short line railroads provide to their customers and the entire  economy. I also want to highlight the importance of the railroad track  maintenance credit, otherwise known as the short line credit, for  maintaining a robust network of short line rail.   The short line credit is available to what are known as class II and  class III railroads, which are categorized based on revenue thresholds  set by the Surface Transportation Board. This tax credit is not  available to the large national and international railroads most people  are probably familiar with. While the short line railroads generally  operate in a relatively small area, they have a massive impact.   Short line railroads serve a key role in transporting manufactured  goods and agricultural products from factories and farms to markets in  the U.S and beyond. They often serve as the ``first and last mile'' in  our Nation's freight transportation network. These links to the rest of  the world are crucial to Iowa's economic competitiveness and  communities across the country. Nearly half of Iowa's railroad miles  are operated by 13 small railroads that transport more than 300,000  carloads of material a year.   Support of short line railroads has been a long-standing bipartisan  priority. Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the short line  credit. Though the credit has spent most of its existence as a tax  extender, as then chairman of the Finance Committee, I helped to create  the credit and later led a successful effort to make the credit  permanent in 2020. I had a lot of support, which is reflected in the  fact that legislation that was sponsored by Senator Crapo, current  ranking member of the Finance Committee, to make the credit permanent  had 62 cosponsors.   The short line credit provides smaller regional and local railroads a  tax credit for a percentage of amounts spent to upgrade and maintain  miles of railroad track. However, these small railroads operate on  tight margins, and many have insufficient tax liability to claim the  credit against.   To address this issue, the law allows short line railroads to assign  the credit to another short line, or to a customer. The assigning  railroad typically recognizes income for cash received and the assignee  deducts payments made. This arrangement ensures that all short line  railroads are able to fully utilize the credit.   This year on Short Line Rail Advocacy Day, many of the Nation's 600  short line railroads visited offices on Capitol Hill to remind us of  the critical role they play in the industry. According to the American  Short Line and Regional Railroad Association, nearly 30 percent of our  national rail network, or roughly 50,000 miles of track, is operated by  short lines who at some point handle a quarter of all rail cars moving  through the national rail system.   It is important we understand and appreciate what these local and  regional railroads do for our communities, and our whole economy.                            ____________________
