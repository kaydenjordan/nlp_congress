 Mr. Speaker, last week, families across  America sat down to enjoy Thanksgiving meals. Unfortunately, this week,  as a result of irresponsible policies of Biden and Democrats, families  are paying massive costs.   Americans are experiencing inflation at a 40-year high with families  in South Carolina paying nearly 15 percent more for goods and services  in the last year.   Average national costs have increased. Turkey is up 21 percent. Pie  crusts and whipping cream are up 26 percent. Dinner rolls are up 22  percent. Milk is up 16 percent.   According to the recent Morning Consult poll, 41 percent of  Thanksgiving shoppers were planning to cut side dishes to save money.   Our country is in a crisis, and Americans need relief, which is why  voters elected a House Republican majority. Republicans will fight  inflation with fiscal sanity.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
