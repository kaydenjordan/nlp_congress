 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed to the bill in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mrs. Demings moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5 to the       Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the       same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page       37, line 9.        Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page       39, line 12.        Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the       table of contents accordingly):     TITLE VII--PROTECTING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR                        AMERICANS OVER THE AGE OF 65       SEC. 701. PROTECTING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS                     FOR AMERICANS OVER THE AGE OF 65.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in       section 551 of title 5, United States Code), pertaining to       the provision of health and financial security for persons       ages 65 and over by significantly reducing out-of-pocket       medication costs for prescription drugs for plans under the       Medicare program under part D of title XVIII of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-101 et seq.), regardless of the       person's income, medical history, or health status. The       provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the       day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply       to such rules.    Mr. MARINO (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, throughout my 27 years of law enforcement experience, I  protected and served my community, and I stand here today to protect  the most vulnerable of seniors in central Florida, and seniors all  around this Nation.   We have a responsibility to see that seniors are not put in a  position where they will have to choose between buying food or buying  their medication, which was the case before the Affordable Care Act. We  must resist all efforts to reopen the Medicare part D prescription drug  coverage doughnut hole. This doughnut hole required seniors to pay full  price for their prescription drugs after they reach their catastrophic  threshold.   Research found, because of this doughnut hole, seniors would put  their health at risk because they could not afford to pay the  prescriptions, which ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, this doughnut hole is being  completely phased out of the Medicare part D prescription drug program  by the year 2020.   Since the ACA passed in 2010, closing the doughnut hole has saved our  seniors more than $23.5 billion on their prescription drugs. We know  this is working. Florida seniors enrolled in the program are now saving  an average of $987 a year because of closing the loophole.                                time  1830    We know what $987 means to the average senior on Medicare. We also  know that if these coverage gap discounts disappeared, part D enrollees  would have to pay $3,725 for the time period they are in the doughnut  hole. This $3,725 represents nearly 15 percent of a Medicare enrollee's  income.   With too many Floridians and seniors across the Nation struggling to  make ends meet, I strongly believe that Congress can do more to make  sure we do not go backwards and reopen this doughnut hole. No one  should ever have to choose between food or medicine.   I urge my colleagues to consider the livelihood and dignity of our  most vulnerable seniors and vote for my amendment to protect access to  affordable prescription drugs for older Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute  vote on passage of the bill, if ordered.
