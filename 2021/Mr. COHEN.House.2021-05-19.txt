 Madam Speaker, there is hardly anything this Congress can  do that will be more important than having a bipartisan commission to  look at the insurrection that occurred in this Capitol on January 6.  There was an attempt to overturn our Constitution and to displace the  electoral college and the peaceful transition of power that makes our  country unique and special among the countries of the world.   This wouldn't have happened but for the President at the time telling  people to come to Washington on January 6--no other date but the day of  the electoral college--to fight like hell or you won't have a  government anymore and telling them he would walk with them to the  Capitol and told them where to go.   This cannot happen again. If we don't have this commission and reveal  the truth, it will happen again. There is only one reason you wouldn't  vote for this, Madam Speaker: if you can't handle the truth. Get the  truth out.
