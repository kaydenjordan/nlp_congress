 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of President  Trump's request for border wall funding.  [[Page H582]]    Yes, we are a nation of immigrants. I know firsthand. My grandparents  emigrated from Sweden to the Upper Peninsula to start a new life in the  1890s, but Congress has a constitutional duty to provide for the safety  and security of our citizens. Right now, our immigration system is  broken, making illegal entry into the U.S. a common occurrence rather  than a random act.   President Trump is right to call this a crisis. It is a crisis of our  own making, and it is time for Congress to do our job.   We are on day 25 of the longest and most avoidable government  shutdown in U.S. history. Those most vital to protecting our borders,  coasts, and ports have now missed at least one paycheck, with little to  no progress being made in Washington.   It is time to end this shutdown, secure our borders, and get our  government open and working for the people. Madam Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting efforts to build a wall.                            ____________________
