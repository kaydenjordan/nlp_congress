 Madam Speaker, I rise today to hold Donald John Trump  accountable for his repeated abuse of power, his deliberate obstruction  of the House's constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities,  and his unprecedented misuse of the Presidency to weaken the separation  of powers and subvert our Constitution by dangling $391 million in  congressionally appropriated tax dollars over the head of an embattled  ally in order to coerce a fraudulent investigation into a potential  political opponent.                                time  1115    Our Founders feared a lawless, amoral President would willfully put  national security at risk for his own personal gain.   In 1974, Republicans made it clear that their ultimate loyalty was  not to one man, but to upholding the Constitution. Today, the  uncontested evidence shows Donald Trump violated his oath of office. My  friends on both sides of the aisle can either defend him or defend the  Constitution. History will not permit you to do both.
