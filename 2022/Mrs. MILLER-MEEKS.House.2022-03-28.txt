 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of several young men from Iowa's Second Congressional  District.   Earlier this month, the Iowa high school basketball State  championships were held in Des Moines. It was a weekend of competition  and sportsmanship. While no school from the Second District won the  championship, several young men recently earned all-State honors from  the Des Moines Register.   Dayton Davis of Fort Madison and Shawn Gilbert of Central DeWitt were  named to the Class 3A team. Eric Mulder of Pella Christian was named to  the Class 2A team, and Maddox Griffin of Wapello was named to the Class  1A team.   In addition, Kaden Hall of English Valleys, Carter Harmsen of Mid- Prairie, Karl Miller of Pella, Pete Moe of Iowa City West, and Blaise  Porter of New London earned honorable mention recognition.   Congratulations to all of these young men, teams, families, schools,  and communities on achieving these honors. They are all well deserved.   Madam Speaker, I also knowledge that tomorrow, March 29, my daughter,  Taylor Miller-Meeks, was born, which was one of the best days of my  life.                            ____________________
