 Mr. Speaker, recall President Trump's promise on the  campaign trail: we will build a wall and have Mexico pay for it.   Not only is it costly and unnecessary, but it will do more to divide  America than it will to keep us safe. First, taking the fact that  Mexico is not paying for it, nor would anybody in their right mind  think that Mexico was ever going to pay for it, now he is asking for  $1.6 billion of Americans' hardworking taxpayers to pay for it.   We already have 650 miles of border fencing, but representing the  Sunshine State, with over 1,000 miles of coastline, this isn't going to  make us safer. It is not going to help us at all. And then you look to  how there are racial undertones to this.   Notice how there is a focus on the Southern border, but not the  Northern border?   While I would not support that, we can't help but notice that this is  focused on dividing America on racial lines, on making us less safe and  on wasting taxpayer dollars.   It is time to unite America. It is time to look forward to a safer  America, and spend our money on the Coast Guard, on custom border  control, and other works that will make us safer.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage  of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018.  Specifically, I would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto  Number 20, to Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,  2018. My amendment moved $10 million from the Operation and  Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to the Defense Health Program's Peer- Reviewed Prostate Cancer Research Program.   Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is  the second most common cause of male death. In 2017, approximately  161,360 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and an  estimated 26,730 will die from it.   The Prostate Cancer Research Program is a unique research program in  that it prioritizes research that will lead to the elimination of death  from prostate cancer while enhancing the well-being of men experiencing  the impact of the disease.   I support funding prostate cancer research and thank my colleagues  for their support of my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage of H.R.  3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Specifically, I  would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto Number 19, to  Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018. My  amendment moved $1 million from the Operation and Maintenance, Defense- Wide account to the Defense Health Program's Peer-Reviewed Gulf War  Illness Research Program.   If we are going to spend money on medical research within the  Department of Defense, the Department must adequately fund research on  those diseases that originate in war and wholly affect our servicemen  and women. Over a quarter of a million veterans display symptoms of  this disease, and the time has come to find, and fund, a cure for it.   I support funding Gulf War illness research and thank my colleagues  for their support of my amendment.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and  Ranking Member Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor  and for their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who  risk their lives to keep our nation safe and for their work in ensuring  that they have resources needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest  fighting force for peace on earth.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the  national goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on  earth.   The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 is to provide the  Secretary of Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to  provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women  in other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism,  human trafficking, narcotics trafficking.   Mr. Chair, the United States is committed to combating violent  extremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of  terrorism.   The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and  technological capability that will aid not only in combating and  defeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent  persons, especially women, girls, and the elderly.   But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary  technical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very  quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or  norms of morality and decency.   Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant  terrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai  Peninsula which poses a threat to Egypt.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 helps provide the Department of Defense  with the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries  on innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources  that promote the security of the American people and allied nation  states.   Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact  on women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on  us all.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by  terrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war,  affecting over twenty thousand women and girls.   Looking at the history of terrorism highlights the importance of  providing technical assistance through our military might, as this  enables us to combat terrorism which now can plague us here in the  United States.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 will help curb terrorism abroad by making  available American technical military expertise to military in other  countries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their  country and to keep those terrorists out of our country.   Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of  terrorists.   These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care  providers, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the  diplomatic corps and the Armed Services.   This is why the technical assistance offered by our military  personnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local  forces to combat terrorism.  [[Page H6496]]    Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and  cannot be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to our  national security and the security of the world.   Mr. Chair, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and the  Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of our  highest national priorities.   Collectively, helping our neighbors and their military build capacity  to combat terrorism, eradicate human trafficking, stop narcotics  trafficking and negate their impact on women and girls across the globe  serves our national interest.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted last  year to the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2017 (H.R. 5293).   My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's  research and development by $10 million.   These funds will address the question of breast cancer in the United  States military.   The American Cancer Society calls several strains of breast cancer as  a particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates;  in this instance, it is a triple negative.   But I raise an article: ``Fighting a Different Battle; Breast Cancer  and the Military.''   Breast cancer can affect both men and women.   The bad news is breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women  in the military as combat.   Let me say that sentence again.   Breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military  as combat.   More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan,  according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with  breast cancer just between 2000 and 2011.   And according to that same study, more are suspected. It grows.   The good news is that we have been working on it, and I want to add  my appreciation to the military.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25, however, will allow for the additional  research.   That research is particularly needed since women are joining the  Armed Services in increasing numbers and serving longer, ascending to  leadership.   Within increased age comes increased risk and incidence of breast  cancer.   Not only is breast cancer striking relatively young military women at  an alarming rate, but male service members, veterans and their  dependents are at risk as well.   With a younger and generally healthier population, those in military  tend to have a lower risk for most cancers than civilians--including  significantly lower colorectal, lung and cervical--but breast cancer is  a different story.   Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, are  at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer,  according to Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston  University who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  on military breast cancer issues.   Dr. Clapp notes that life in the military can mean exposure to a  witch's brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of  getting breast cancer.   So, I am asking that we do the right thing.   We are on the right track, we're on the right road.   But with the expansion of women in the military, it is extremely  important to move forward with this amendment to help ensure that the  men and women who risk their lives to protect our freedom can live  longer, healthier lives.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the En Bloc Amendment also includes  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 that was made in order under the Rule.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 increases funding for the PTSD by $5  million.   These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard  to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in  underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature  wound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.   For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm's way, it  is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen  and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see  on a daily basis.   In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can  obliterate your best friend and right in front of your face.   Yet, you are trained and expected to continue on with the mission,  and you do, even though you may not even have reached your 20th  birthday.   But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the  stress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your  thoughts and memories.   And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the  enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep.   These are called flashbacks; a person having a flashback may lose  touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening  all over again.   Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD  also have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD.   These veterans have co-occurring disorders, which include depression,  alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety  disorders.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 recognizes that these soldiers are first  and foremost, human, who live their experiences.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 will help ensure that ``no soldier is  left behind'' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward  hard to reach veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are  homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee  Amendment No. 50 in the En Bloc Amendment and urge my colleagues to  support the En Bloc Amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                   Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Langevin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.
