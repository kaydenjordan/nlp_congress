 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the young  people from North Carolina who have joined us and to introduce the  Restoring Communities Left Behind Act.   During my years as a city planner before coming to Congress, I  witnessed firsthand that fostering economic development in our  communities requires strong local leadership. The involvement of  neighborhood champions who know their neighborhoods block by block is  essential.   This legislation would direct $5 billion toward programs for  homeowner rehabilitation assistance, weatherization, improved  accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities, refinancing,  and property tax relief.   It will help restore quality housing, including in the rural  communities and the cities that I represent, such as Toledo, Sandusky,  and Defiance. These locations have suffered from decades of job losses,  outsourcing, recessions, and chronic underinvestment.   Congress must serve as the partner to our on-the-ground  organizations. Local leaders know what resources are needed and where  and how best to deploy them to revive their neighborhoods. That is why  the Restoring Communities Left Behind Act promotes local control and  capacity building for economic development.   These investments will repair homes, stimulate economic growth, and  revitalize communities at a time when our Nation needs affordable  housing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Restoring  Communities Left Behind Act.                            ____________________
