 Mr. Speaker, in 2017, Republicans handed out tax breaks  for the largest corporations and the ultrawealthy, including Donald  Trump, who paid zero Federal income tax in 2020 and left the Presidency  without a single audit.   What we were trying to do was make it a fairer tax system where the  ultrawealthy were actually paying their fair share, which, as we saw  through the simple release of those tax returns for the President of  the United States, there were some years he paid zero. He was less  likely to be audited than somebody getting the earned income child tax  credit.   This is something that we need to fight against.   We want to make sure that our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle understand that it is not just about the ultrawealthy. It is  about working-class Americans. It is a shame that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle care more about those who have higher income,  those who can hire lawyers that can get them out of paying taxes, but  we should really have a tax system that benefits everybody.
