 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Paycheck Fairness Act and my amendment to this bill.   On average, full-time working women need to work well into the next  year to catch up to the salary our male counterparts earned the  previous year. March 24 marked the day that women's salaries, on  average, caught up to the salaries of our male counterparts in 2020.  For several subgroups of women, this date won't come until later this  year. For example, as a Black woman, it will take until August--an  additional 8 months--to make the same salary of our male counterparts  as they did in 2020.   The American people look to Congress to be a force for economic  justice and create policies that are fair and just. It is simply wrong  that in the 21st century women still face pay inequity. That is why I  am proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will strengthen  existing laws to ensure that women are getting the pay that they  deserve.  [[Page H1822]]    My amendment will build on this crucial legislation by reestablishing  the Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. This task force, which previously  existed during the Obama-Biden administration, will ensure Federal  agencies are working together to limit any potential gaps in  enforcement of equal pay laws. Putting this task force back in place  will bring us one step closer to ensuring that women finally receive  equal pay for equal work.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  bill before us today to ensure that women are paid fairly.
