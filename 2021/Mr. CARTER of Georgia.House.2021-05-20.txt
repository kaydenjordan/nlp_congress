 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Hank Huckaby, who passed away on April 14 at the  age of 79.   Hank was a lifelong public servant who served the State of Georgia in  numerous capacities for more than 50 years. He held a number of top  roles in Georgia government and education, including chancellor of  Georgia's public colleges and universities, executive director of the  Georgia Housing and Finance Authority, director of the Office of  Planning and Budget, and in the Georgia House of Representatives.   Put simply, Hank was devoted to serving the people of Georgia. His  public service extended out of the workplace, volunteering his time and  leadership in various civic and religious organizations throughout his  life.   Madam Speaker, Hank Huckaby was a graduate of Young Harris College,  and I had the privilege of serving with him on the board of trustees of  Young Harris College. He loved Young Harris College, and Young Harris  College loved him.   Hank was a strong leader, a source of strength, and a true friend to  all who knew him. He will be greatly missed.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
