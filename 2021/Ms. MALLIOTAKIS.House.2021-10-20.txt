 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary sacrifice by a resident of Brooklyn, New York.   Private First Class Raymond Andrew Smith was 18 years old when he  made the ultimate sacrifice for our country during the Battle of Chosin  Reservoir, in the Korean war.   Growing up, Raymond and his sister Helen experienced a difficult  childhood in foster care, forcing them to take on responsibilities far  beyond their years. And despite the challenges he faced, at the age of  14 Raymond joined the Navy.   Once Raymond's age was discovered by his superiors, the Navy granted  him an honorable discharge, but that wouldn't stop Raymond's drive for  service. Four years later, Raymond enlisted in the United States Army,  and after 6 months, he was shipped off to fight in the Korean war.   The Korean war began in June of 1950 when General Douglas MacArthur,  alongside South Korean and U.N. forces made significant progress into  the north with hopes of uniting the two countries again.    However, Communist China under Mao Zedong had other plans, and sent  roughly 100,000 troops to the Chosin Reservoir to counter progress made  by America and our allies, leading to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.   With the 7th Infantry Division, Raymond fought in this battle, a  battle many military experts and scholars consider to be one of the  most brutal conflicts in modern history due to the sheer fierceness of  our opponents and severe weather elements.   For 17 days, the Battle of Chosin Reservoir raged on. In that  timeframe, it is estimated that the United States suffered 18,000  casualties, while the Chinese suffered upward of 50,000 casualties,  30,000 just from the freezing cold alone. During the battle,  temperatures were said to have dropped to a chilling negative 35  degrees Fahrenheit. Medical supplies froze solid, rendering them  useless, weapons seized and failed to function, and digging foxholes  was nearly impossible without the use of machinery. At negative 35  degrees Fahrenheit, the human body sets into hypothermic shock in only  5 to 7 minutes.   Private First Class Raymond Smith was one of the first to make  contact with the enemy. Raymond and his peers were vastly outnumbered,  and while they fought valiantly, he was sadly reported missing on  December 2, 1950, presumed to be dead.   On July 27, 2018, following a summit between then-President Donald  Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea returned  55 boxes that contained the remains of American servicemembers killed  during the Korean war.   And on March 25, 2021, Raymond's family received closure when his  remains were finally identified and accounted for after 71 unbearable  years for his family. Raymond's remains  [[Page H5683]]  were returned to New York City, where his sister Helen, her children, a  full U.S. military honor guard, and the Port Authority Police were  there to welcome him home.   I am taking this time today to ensure Raymond's memory lives on and  his sacrifices will not be forgotten. Currently, there are more than  81,600 Americans that remain missing from World War II, the Korean war,  the Vietnam war, the Cold War, the Gulf wars, and other conflicts. Let  this give us hope that we can return them all home.   I urge the administration and my colleagues to work toward the return  of all prisoners of war and a full accounting and the repatriation of  our fallen servicemembers' remains.                            ____________________
