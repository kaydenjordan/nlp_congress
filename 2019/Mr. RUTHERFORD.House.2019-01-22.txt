 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  Knights of Columbus, a fraternal Catholic organization dedicated to  charitable action.   Some of my colleagues have recently made disparaging comments about  the mission of the Knights of Columbus, and I want to be clear: As a  member of that proud organization, I am very proud of their  humanitarian mission.   In 2017 alone, the Knights of Columbus raised $185 million in  charitable contributions and contributed 75 million hours of service  worldwide.   The Knights of Columbus stand firmly for protecting life in all its  forms, most especially the unborn. They recently donated their one  thousandth ultrasound machine to women's pregnancy centers in the U.S.  and around the world.   Studies have shown that women who view these ultrasounds of their  unborn child are much more likely to carry that child to term.  [[Page H984]]    So on today's anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision; let's listen  to the words of Carl Anderson, leader of the Knights of Columbus, who  said:   ``What greater legacy can a person have than to save a child's  life?''                            ____________________
