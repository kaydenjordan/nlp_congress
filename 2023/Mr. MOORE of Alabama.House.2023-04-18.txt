 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to express my  support for making tax day a thing of the past. Our current tax code is  four times as long as the King James Bible but contains none of the  good news.   Last Congress, Pelosi and the Democrats made it their mission to hire  87,000 new IRS agents. Furthermore, Biden's budget calls for the  highest level of taxation in American history, with $4.7 trillion in  new taxes.   A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation found that Biden's $4.7  trillion tax hike on workers, families, farmers, and small businesses  would destroy over 300,000 American jobs, cut workers' wages by 1  percent, and reduce American economic growth by 1.3 percent.  [[Page H1794]]    President Biden and the Democrats want every day to be tax day, but  today, I introduced legislation that would abolish the 16th Amendment.  I am also a proud supporter of the FairTax Act.   The FairTax Act would eliminate all personal and corporate income  taxes, abolish the death tax, eliminate gift and payroll taxes, repeal  the tax code, replace it with a single national consumption tax, and,  my favorite part, it would abolish the IRS.   This is the gold standard for tax law and would turn the convoluted,  abusive, and biased system into a straightforward code that works for  every American.   Instead of inflating our already-bloated bureaucracy and continuing  to punish those who work hard to succeed, Americans deserve a system  that works for them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Buddy Carter for his work on this  legislation.
