 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for his  leadership in putting this together.   Madam Speaker, I want to invoke a great Republican member of this  body who went on to become President of the United States, Abraham  Lincoln, who spoke of ``government of the people, by the people, for  the people.''   The tax plan that has been presented to us by the GOP in the 21st  century is government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, and for the 1  percent. It was written by a billionaire Cabinet of a billionaire  President for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers in the country.   The same policy experts whose healthcare plan was to throw 30 million  Americans off their health insurance and reduce women's access to  complete reproductive services now have a tax plan to sell America. But  read the fine print first. In fact, you don't even need to read the  fine print. You just have to look at the headlines.   Under this plan, 80 percent of the total tax cut will end up going to  the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans who earn more than $900,000 a  year. Let me repeat that: 80 percent of the money that will be saved in  this tax cut will go to Americans earning $900,000 a year. That is  astounding.   In the meantime, tens of millions of middle class families making  between $50,000 and $150,000 a year will pay higher taxes than they  were paying before. And check this out. The very wealthiest sliver of  Americans, those who make at least $5 million a year, and, on average,  $16 million a year, would get an average tax cut of over $1 million.  That is a $1 million tax cut for millionaires.   The slogan for this plan should be: The Trump tax cut, because the  rich just aren't rich enough and everybody else is doing just fine.   Madam Speaker, if you know anyone who makes $16 million a year,  please ask them to write me and tell me what they are going to do with  their extra $1 million. Maybe they will send it to a Swiss bank account  or to the Bahamas; maybe they will run for Congress; maybe they will  invest it in Australia where a lot of the superrich are apparently now  buying property in order to have a getaway plan from the escalating  crises of climate change in North America.                                time  1630    So the billionaires make out like bandits.   What about the rest of us? How much will this plan cost us?   Well, the bipartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget's  initial analysis shows that the GOP plan would add $2.2 trillion to  deficits over the next decade. This is the result of cutting taxes for  the wealthy by a staggering $5.8 trillion and then adding new tax  revenue of only $3.6 trillion, so we are going to be adding $2.2  trillion in deficits.   What about the deficit hawks?   They are an endangered species, as Congresswoman Pelosi says now.  Actually, they have mutated into a completely new species. We don't  have deficit hawks anymore. We have deficit ostriches. They are willing  to squawk and strut and kick dust like hawks when there is a Democrat  in the White House, but when a budget-busting, deficit-ballooning,  debt-deepening Republican occupies the White House and proposes  inflating the deficit and the debt to unprecedented levels with the  most breathtaking fiscal recklessness anyone has ever seen, they become  deficit chicken hawks and transmogrify into deficit doves, and then  finally turn into fast scurrying deficit ostriches and run away from  everything they have been saying for years about the necessity to  reduce the deficit, they simply bury their heads deep in the sand and  let the debt and the deficits climb up all around them.   Speaker Paul Ryan, when he was campaigning with Mitt Romney, said the  national debt is threatening jobs today, it is threatening our  prosperity today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, while calling  for changes to Social Security and Medicare in 2013, told supporters  only one thing can save this country, and that is to get a handle on  the deficit and debt issue. Well, that was then, this is now, as they  say. Now the GOP leaders are twisting arms to vote for a tax plan that  will blow up the deficit and drive our children and our grandchildren's  generations deeply into debt.   What happened to all of the fine speeches we heard about how we owe  it to our kids not to engage in deficit spending? What happened to all  the magnificent oratory about how the national debt is a moral crisis?   Can any of the Members of Congress, who built their careers on the  principle of deficit reduction and ending the debt, explain why it is  responsible today to add more than $2 trillion to our national deficit?   We await an answer, Madam Speaker.   Why are they doing this to America? Why are they proposing it? Who  wins with this assault on the common good?   Well, let's see. Donald Trump and his family certainly do. The only  President who ever bragged that he would be able to make money by  running for President is showing what a good job he is actually doing  at achieving his objective.   A New York Times analysis shows that Trump and his family could save  more than $1 billion under this plan. That is right, the President and  his family could save more than $1 billion under the tax proposal that  has been sent to us in Congress. Of course, it is impossible to know  precisely how much would be saved because President Trump, despite his  campaign promise to release his tax returns, if elected, still refuses  to release his tax returns, which constitutes not only a radical breach  of faith with the people, but a radical break from past practices of  other Presidents for the last half century, who have opened up their  tax records for the rest of us to see.   But let's see what we can do based on information we know. This  proposal  [[Page H8019]]  would eliminate the estate tax, which would generate massive tax  savings for President Trump and his family. If his assets, reportedly  valued at $2.86 billion, were transferred after his death under today's  rules, his estate would be taxed at around the 40 percent level, still  leaving his heirs with more than $1 billion.   Repealing the Federal estate tax, which they propose to do, would  save his family $1.1 billion, at least, in estate tax costs.   Why would we do this?   The Founders of our country were passionately opposed to hereditary  wealth, just like they were passionately opposed to hereditary  government. They thought it was dangerous to have the intergenerational  transmission of wealth and great fortunes like that. They said that it  would cause idleness and irresponsibility in the heirs to great wealth,  and they would be able to convert their wealth not just into bigger  estates, bigger land purchases, bigger houses, but actually in the  public offices. They had a very profound democratic critique of that  kind of intergenerational wealth inequality, because, at a certain  point, you have bought enough houses, you have bought enough jets, and  now you want a governorship, you want the Presidency, you want a Senate  seat. In a democracy, we need to have much reduced levels of inequality  that are being proposed under this idea of abolishing the estate tax.   They also are proposing to abolish the alternative minimum tax, which  is the only reason that President Trump paid any taxes in the one year  over the last two decades that we know he paid taxes in, in 2005.  Remember, somebody mysteriously leaked information about that year to  the Rachel Maddow show, and it turned out that the President paid taxes  because of the alternative minimum tax which says that you can't push a  good joke too far, you can only use all of your deductions and  allowances, and so on, up to a certain point. If you are at a certain  place, in terms of your wealth, you have got to pay something.   Well, The New York Times now estimates that the GOP tax plan to  repeal the alternative minimum tax would save the President at least  $31.3 million. He would not have had to pay in that one year that we  know where he paid taxes, and we don't know about the rest because he  has refused to release it.   And let's just look at one more provision, which would change the  treatment of pass-through business income. According to The New York  Times, President Trump could save as much as $6.2 million on business  income and $9.8 million on income from real estate and other kinds of  partnerships under changes to the taxation of pass-through income.    Now, look, Madam Speaker, nobody likes paying taxes, nobody loves it,  especially when we know that there are billions of dollars being  wasted, for example, at the Department of Defense in boondoggles,  fraud, and abuse taking place, according to a hearing that we had just  this session in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. So  people don't love the experience.   But just as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, that he didn't mind paying  his taxes because he understood that they were the price of  civilization. It is what we all put in, in order to have roads and  highways and airports and schools and universities. That is what it  means to be a citizen. People don't mind, as long as there is a basic  sense in the public that everybody is participating and we are not  getting ripped off.   And I am terrified that if they succeed in barreling this plan  through Congress, that it is going to spread more cynicism and more  disenchantment and more negativity about the tax system and about the  government, and we can't afford it. Because of the escalating crises of  climate change, which are all around us, our people are suffering. We  have millions of people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands tonight  who have no access to power, no access to electricity or clean water.  We have people in Florida and Texas and Mississippi and Louisiana who  are still recovering from the last hurricanes. We have Californians,  many of whom have died already, who are struggling against the forest  fires out of control.   Now is a point when we need a tax system that brings our people  together, that says that wealthier people can pay more because they are  wealthy, but everybody is going to pay their share, and we are all  going to participate together. That is the tax system we should be  looking for, a tax system where we get rid of all of the special  interest inflected deductions and allowances and loopholes and rip-offs  that are built into the system, where it is simplified.   In the European countries, you can pay your taxes in about 10 or 15  minutes, and you don't have to go to the multibillion-dollar tax  preparation industry, or go find a law firm to do it. We can simplify  our taxes if we decide to get rid of all of the special interest  loopholes. And wealthy people can pay more because they get more out of  being part of this society, and they use more of the infrastructure of  the country, instead of paying less than everybody else, instead of  trying to rip off the system by paying nothing.   Madam Speaker, now is the time when we need the wisest and most  principled leadership to get us through the accumulating crises of the  time. This tax plan is totally irresponsible. I hope that it will be  withdrawn and we can work together across the aisle on a bipartisan  plan that will represent the best values of government of the people,  by the people, for the people.   Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from California for  allowing me this opportunity.
