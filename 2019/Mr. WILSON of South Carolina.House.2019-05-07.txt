 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last Friday's economic  numbers continue to show that policies championed by the President and  Republicans are helping the American people succeed:   The economy added an incredible 263,000 jobs in April;   More than 5.8 million jobs have been created since the election;   The unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent in April, the lowest since  December 1969;   The employment rate for women is the lowest rate since 1953;   The veterans' unemployment rate fell to 2.3 percent, the lowest rate  on record;   The employment rate for Americans with a disability fell to the  lowest rate on record;   Average hourly earnings rose by 3.2 percent over 12 months. Before  2018, wage gains had not reached 3 percent since April 2009.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
