 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of one of my  constituents, Michelle Vo, who lost her life in Sunday's mass shooting  in Las Vegas.   Michelle was described by her friends and family as an ambitious,  hard worker, known for her charisma and fierce independence. She  embodied the American Dream in every single way. Her middle name, My,  means ``America'' in Vietnamese.   Her mother emigrated from Vietnam and raised Michelle and her sisters  near San Jose. Michelle would go on to graduate from UC Davis before  moving to Eagle Rock, in my district, to work as an insurance agent in  nearby Pasadena.  [[Page H7731]]    My heart goes out to Michelle Vo, her family and friends, and the  other victims of the Las Vegas shooting.   I am heartbroken and angry about the events in Las Vegas. These  incidents are far too common in our country, and it is my sincere hope  that Congress takes action to lessen these types of tragic events.                            ____________________
