 Mr. Speaker, I come to the House this evening with several  of my colleagues principally to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte, Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey  Gowdy, and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin  Nunes for their tireless pursuit of the truth.   There is a four-page memo. I have read it. Over 190 of my Republican  colleagues have read it. Some Democrats have read it, and some have  boycotted reading it. It details circumstances that are deeply  troubling to me and that I believe will be deeply troubling to many  Americans.   This memo encapsulates an entire year of work by these committees and  by these committee chairmen, and they are to be commended for the  excellent job that they have done, for the professionalism that they  have undertaken, and for the stunning facts that they have uncovered  that will soon be available for the American people.   I will have more to say on this throughout the hour, Mr. Speaker, but  first I yield to one of my colleagues in the Congress who was one of  the first and loudest voices calling for transparency at the highest  levels and to the maximum extent possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his persuasive  leadership. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) was one of the  first to sign letters to members of the House Intelligence Committee,  and particularly its chairman, expressing the sense of this body that  we supported the transparency that the gentleman spoke of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs), who serves on the Judiciary Committee. He has worked very hard  from the very beginning to ascertain the bases of claims made and is a  true investigator at heart.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his service on the  Judiciary Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold),  another of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  King), a fellow member of the Judiciary Committee, another of the first  Members of Congress to demand the appointment of a second special  counsel to look into matters such as this.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King)  for being a clarion voice for calling this Congress and this  administration to act in a way that is consistent with the values and  the principles of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I will not take that full allotment of time.  I will say, though, that it is worth repeating the great work that  Chairman Bob Goodlatte has done in the Judiciary Committee; the  excellent work that Trey Gowdy has done, the chairman of the Oversight  and Government Reform Committee; and the excellent work that Chairman  Devin Nunes has done. Each of these committees has jurisdiction over a  different component part of the information that is laid out before the  American people that has given rise to so many concerns about bias,  departure from standard practices, familial relationships, and the  potential political corrosion of institutions that we have to rely on  for an effective democracy.   I also want to thank the thousands of people who work in the FBI and  the Department of Justice who are patriots, who go to work every day to  protect us from threats at home and abroad, who really do do a great  job in defense of this country. It is not their work that we question;  in fact, it is their work we hope to empower.   When you have circumstances where folks at the head shed or the  leading bureaucrats can rip investigations away from field offices, can  alter the contents of information that is shared with the American  people, it undermines the work that true law enforcement members are  doing. We want to highlight and honor that work while, at the same  time, exercising our oversight function to go after the bad conduct  and, where we find it systemic, institute reforms so that it does not  happen again.   The FBI and the Department of Justice should never be a political  weapon used to go after adversaries. This is an issue where we ought to  have more bipartisan agreement, Mr. Speaker. While I am grateful that  the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee this evening were able to  carry the day in the fight for transparency, I am disappointed that  these issues led to party-line votes.   The reality is that all Americans--Republican, Democrat, Independent,  Libertarian, or members of the Whig Party--have an interest in ensuring  that we have systems in place that protect our constitutional rights  and liberties. We all have a stake in the action to ensure that, no  matter which party wins or loses an election, the political apparatus  of intelligence won't be used to go after enemies or people we disagree  with.   I believe this was an opportunity missed, but it won't be the last  one. I believe that the President is going to declassify this  information within the 5-day window allowed to him. When he does, all  Americans will see why Republicans have been concerned with the  information we have learned. Then the opportunity will arise to work  together, to take these facts, to take what we know, and to liberate  ourselves from the partisanship of this town and to try to make things  better so that, in the future, you don't have a circumstance where one  investigation is called a headquarter special and taken away from the  Washington field office, as the Hillary Clinton email scandal was.   We certainly don't want cases where people's family members--familial  relationships, spousal relationships--influence the outcomes of  decisions; and we also don't want systems in place that allow leaks to  the media within the apparatus of intelligence to cloud  [[Page H661]]  our mind, to cloud our judgment, to cloud the facts, or to cloud the  review of our courts.   So, again, while I am proud of the work of the people who have spent  a year investigating these matters, while I am confident in the  findings of this report, I still remain disappointed that we don't have  more unity to ensure that these types of abuses never happen again.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the President of the United States will walk  down the center aisle. He will address this floor. There might be a few  more folks than there are here this evening. I hope that the first  thing he does is hand to the Speaker of the House his consent and his  agreement to allow transparency to rein, to declassify this memo, to  put it before the American people, and then let's have a great debate  about its consequences and about the opportunity that it presents to  make things better so that these things never happen again.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
