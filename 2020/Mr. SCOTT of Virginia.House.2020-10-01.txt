 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a co-chair of the  Chesapeake Watershed Task Force in support of the Chesapeake Bay  Provisions within America's Conservation Enhancement Act. I am proud to  represent Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, located near the mouth  of the Chesapeake Bay which President Reagan declared a ``national  treasure'' in 1984, a declaration President Obama echoed in 2009.  Unfortunately, President Trump has not supported the bipartisan effort  to restore the Bay, proposing to slash funding for the Chesapeake Bay  Program, a misguided step that I am proud to have worked with my  colleagues across the aisle to correct.   America's Conservation Enhancement Act represents a crucial  opportunity to support the ongoing restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.  Under the Environmental Protection Agency's Total Maximum Daily Load  (TMDL) mandate, some progress has been made in restoring the Bay.  Current increases in underwater grasses and the blue crab population  indicate these efforts are working, however, more resources and  continued partnership are necessary to ensure that these gains are  maintained and that the Chesapeake Bay is restored. The Chesapeake Bay  provisions included in this bill would make significant progress, not  just in improving the health of the Bay, but also in conserving habitat  and increasing access to restoration throughout its 64,000 square-mile  watershed.   I am especially pleased the America's Conservation Enhancement Act  includes Chesapeake WILD, a bill I introduced with Reps. Wittman and  Sarbanes, fellow co-chairs of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Taskforce,  and Senator Van Hollen. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is well  equipped to leverage their expertise in wildlife and habitat  conservation beyond their reserves and throughout the Chesapeake Bay  Watershed. My bill fosters such partnerships by creating a grant  program for on the ground restoration efforts to be carried out by the  FWS. In addition to conserving fish and wildlife habitat; increasing  access to recreation; mitigating flooding; and improving drinking water  quality, the grant program this bill creates will also contribute to  the precedent-setting effort to conserve the Chesapeake Bay.   America's Conservation Enhancement Act also includes a bill led by  Rep. Sarbanes and Sen. Cardin that would reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay  Gateways and Watertrails grant program. The pandemic has reminded many  of the many benefits of outdoor recreation yet, for far too many,  parks, trails, beaches, and other recreational areas are largely  inaccessible. The reauthorization of this grant program will help  remedy that by increasing access to recreation in the Bay Watershed and  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill.   America's Conservation Enhancement Act also includes critical  legislation, led by my colleagues Rep. Luria and Sen. Cardin, to  reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program. In 1978, my first year as a  member of the Virginia House of Delegates, I was part of a joint  Virginia-Maryland legislative advisory commission focused on  determining what actions were necessary to address Bay issues. We  concluded that restoring the Bay would require more than just Virginia  and Maryland, but rather, the collaboration of the entire watershed.  That remains true today and the level of collaboration required is made  possible by the Chesapeake Bay Program.   I am also proud to have introduced this legislation with my  colleagues which would also authorize an incremental increase in  spending for the Bay Program, reaching $92 million annually by 2025.  Strong funding for the Bay Program leading up to 2025 is essential  because that is the date by which the EPA, along with the six Bay  watershed states and the District of Columbia have committed to making  the Bay fishable and swimmable.   Passage of America's Conservation Enhancement Act is a major step  towards meeting that agreement. As critical as these measures are to  the ecological and economic health of the region, we also recognize  that pollution knows no boundaries. As Wendell Berry, the great poet,  philosopher, and farmer wrote, we all ought to ``do unto those  downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.'' The  restoration this bill supports throughout the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  does more than just improve the health of the Bay--it enhances carbon  sequestration, protects wildlife, improves the quality of water  entering the Atlantic, and sets an important precedent for the  restoration of other large watersheds and multi-jurisdictional  cooperative environmental agreements.   I thank the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on  Energy and Commerce for their work on this essential legislation and  urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill.  And since House Democrats first passed the Heroes Act in May,  congressional Republicans and administration officials have refused to  advance any meaningful COVID-19 relief plan that would help our  community survive this pandemic.   As a result, the American people are continuing to bear the brunt of  an economic and public health crisis that is needlessly dragging on and  getting worse.  [[Page H5419]]    State and local governments are still facing massive budget  shortfalls. Without Federal support, these shortfalls will slash public  education funding and other critical public services.   School districts are starting the new academic year without resources  they need to open safely, keep their staff on payroll, operate high- quality programs remotely, and other things that they need to make sure  that our students can become the best that they can be.   Millions of workers are still unemployed and can no longer access the  enhanced unemployment benefits that kept them afloat before they  expired in July. Those working during the pandemic are suffering from  unsafe working conditions with little protection from COVID-19  infections.   Most significantly, more than 7 million Americans have been infected,  and over 200,000 have lost their lives due to the pandemic, and we  still do not have a coherent strategy to deal with COVID-19.   Moreover, far too many people still do not have access to affordable  healthcare as the virus continues to accelerate in 32 States and in  Puerto Rico, according to ABC News.   The updated Heroes Act offers us another chance to get meaningful  relief into the hands of students, educators, workers, and families.   First, the updated Heroes Act dedicates over $400 billion to help  State and local governments avert massive budget shortfalls. You cannot  evaluate any relief package without first looking at what you are doing  for State and local support. That is because if you don't have State  and local support, there will be massive cuts.   For example, budget shortfalls projected right now for State and  local governments suggest that education budgets for State and local  governments will be cut by hundreds of billions of dollars.   This package protects and expands student access to quality education  by increasing the relief for students, K-12 districts, and institutions  of higher learning by more than $200 billion.                                time  1700    The updated Heroes Act also ensures that no Federal student loan  borrower has to worry about loan payments, interest accrual, or  collections through September of next year.   This package also invests $58 billion to save our childcare industry  from collapse and ensures essential workers will be able to access  affordable childcare and early learning options. The estimates are  that, if we don't put $10 billion a month into the childcare industry,  it will slowly dissolve.   The updated Heroes Act supports individuals and families hit by the  economic downturn of this crisis by putting money directly into their  pockets. The legislation includes a second round of stimulus checks and  extends the $600 weekly enhanced unemployment benefits through next  January, and it also helps in the housing crisis.   To protect workers who have to work during this pandemic, the  legislation directs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  to finally issue enforceable Federal workplace standards that protect  all workers from contracting COVID-19. Presently, in spite of all the  problems in the meatpacking industries, prisons, nursing homes, and  healthcare, there is still no enforceable standard to protect workers  from COVID-19.   This legislation also puts the medical and family back into medical  and family leave, like expanding access to emergency paid FMLA, family  leave protections that were passed in previous relief bills.   The legislation also provides access to healthcare by creating a  broad, open enrollment period so that individuals and families can  obtain coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and offers  enhanced subsidies for many workers who have lost their jobs.   Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, in America, most workers who lose their  jobs also lose their health insurance, and this is a safety net to help  them maintain their health insurance coverage.   Finally, the legislation provides robust investments in some of our  vital community programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  Program, better known as LIHEAP, and the Older Americans Act programs  like Meals on Wheels.    The House first passed the Heroes Act 4 months  ago because we have a responsibility to help our constituents recover  from this global health emergency. Since then, the need has only grown.   Instead of denying the consequences of this pandemic, we must put  politics aside and pass this Heroes Act. The economists have told us,  if we don't spend the money now, the economic downturn will be much  worse in the future, and so we have to pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  urge the Senate to take it up immediately.
