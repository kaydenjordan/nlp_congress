 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3315) to exempt for an additional 4-year period, from the  application of the means-test presumption of abuse under chapter 7,  qualifying members of reserve components of the Armed Forces and  members of the National Guard who, after September 11, 2001, are called  to active duty or to perform a homeland defense activity for not less  than 90 days.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3315         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Guard and       Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF AMENDMENT.         Section 4(b) of the National Guard and Reservists Debt       Relief Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-438; 122 Stat. 5000) is       amended by striking ``15-year'' and inserting ``19-year''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3315.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3315, the National Guard and  Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2023.   The bill before us today is an important piece of legislation. It  will help National Guard members and Armed Services reservists who  serve our country.   Some of these individuals face financial hardships during or after  Active Duty. Bankruptcy may be needed to resolve these hardships.   In 2008, Congress recognized that guardsmen and reservists sometimes  confront unique financial challenges when returning home from Active  Duty.   Congress enacted the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act in  2008 to respond to these challenges and has extended its protection  several times since. Those protections are set to expire later this  month.   Under current law, certain guardsmen and reservists are exempt from  the Bankruptcy Code's means test. This test helps decide whether a  debtor is eligible for debt forgiveness under chapter 7 of the  Bankruptcy Code.   The test looks at recent income and expense data to gauge a  consumer's ability to repay their debt, but the means test can be an  obstacle to debt forgiveness for guardsmen and reservists. Their income  and expenses can change dramatically when transitioning from civilian  life to Active Duty and back.   The means test does not account for these changes in income and  expenses due to Active-Duty service.   The National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2023  responds to this concern. This bill would extend for an additional 4  years the existing means test exemption for certain qualifying National  Guard members and Armed Services reservists.   We continue to call on our guardsmen and our reservists to put their  careers on hold to serve our country. We should ensure that those  military personnel who fall on hard times are not denied access to  bankruptcy because of their Active-Duty status.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, to close, I reemphasize what Mr. Cohen from  Tennessee said.   This is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to protect our guardsmen  and our reservists as they are returning back after having served in  Active Duty. This is an important measure to protect those individuals  who have fallen on hard times financially and need the protections of  bankruptcy court.   This exemption to the means test is important because of the  variations of the income and the expenses that we see coming in and out  of civilian life for these individuals.   As a result of the efforts of both the Democrats and the Republicans  in the House and the Senate, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
