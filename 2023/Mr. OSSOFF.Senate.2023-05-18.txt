 Mr. President, I rise to commend La Raza radio  station for its service to the Latino community in Georgia.   Based in Suwanee, GA, La Raza is the largest Latino radio station in  Georgia, informing more than 1 million Latinos throughout the State.  The station hosts numerous popular radio shows, including Los Hijos de  La Manana, that provide all-day news and entertainment for Latinos  across Georgia. Every year, La Raza also hosts a family-friendly  festival, bringing nearly 50,000 community members together from across  the State to enjoy performances and authentic Mexican food.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend La Raza's 19 years  of service to Latino communities in Atlanta and throughout the entire  State of Georgia.                             ____________________
