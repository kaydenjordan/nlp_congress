 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration  of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I do urge the Speaker,  respectfully, and the majority leader to bring the bill up quickly.                            ____________________
