 Mr. Speaker, Congressman Lewis, Congressman Graves, the  entire Georgia delegation, to all of you, my new colleagues and soon- to-be very good friends, and to my family and friends in the gallery, I  thank you.   Now, I am not sure you have heard enough about this particular race.  No, you really have. I am going to be very brief.   This is an extraordinary honor and the greatest privilege that I  think I have ever had. I look forward to serving the people of the  Sixth District, to serving the people of Georgia, and to being a good  coworker and friend to each and every one of you.   Thank you for this opportunity. Thank you for welcoming me so  graciously. God bless you, God bless the great State of Georgia, and  God bless the great United States of America.                            ____________________
