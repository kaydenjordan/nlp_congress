 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Dr. Michael R. Reich  for being honored by the Center for Global Development for his tenure  as Harvard's Taro Takemi Professor Emeritus of International Health  Policy.   I have had the privilege to know him as a great friend, a man of  science and empathy, a man who believes that health is a human right,  and a man who has devoted his life to creating a healthy global  community.   Dr. Reich has dedicated decades to investigating the inequities in  health services around the globe, understanding the intersection  between healthcare and policy, and advocating to improve healthcare  outcomes for underserved communities all around the world.   As a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Dr.  Reich has empowered his students to learn from and contribute to real- world global health policy scenarios, bringing new perspectives to  cases like health reform in West Africa, malaria control in Zambia,  national pharmaceutical reform, or even reproductive health policy in  Guatemala.   Today, I celebrate him, his legacy, his friendship, and his  outstanding contributions to our global community.                            ____________________
