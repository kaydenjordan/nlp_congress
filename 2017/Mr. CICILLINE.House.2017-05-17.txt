 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the middle of a public  health crisis. Drug overdoses are now killing more Americans each year  than car accidents. And 336 Rhode Islanders died last year as a result  of a drug overdose. That is up from 290 in 2015 and 238 deaths in 2014.   Nationwide, overdose deaths involving prescription and illicit  opioids have quadrupled since 1999. This is a crisis that threatens  Americans of all different backgrounds--young and old, Black and White,  urban and rural. It is a crisis, plain and simple.   All of us who serve the government have a responsibility to stop it.  That is why I was so alarmed earlier this month when I learned that  President Trump is considering slashing funding for the Office of  National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent. Slashing funding for the  lead Federal agency in this fight would have a devastating impact on  families in Rhode Island and all across our country.   Let's work together. Let's work across the aisle, Democrats and  Republicans, to defeat this short-sighted proposal and, instead,  advance real, comprehensive solutions to this public health epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2266, the  ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,'' which authorizes the  establishment of four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and  converts 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status.   I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which  is a necessary response to alleviate the strain on certain bankruptcy  courts that have experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy  filings over the past decade or more.   Importantly, this legislation adopts the recommendations of the  Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policymaking  body of the federal courts, and does not impose additional fees on  ordinary consumer debtors or small businesses.   As the Conference notes in support of this measure, while bankruptcy  filings have decreased nationwide, the bankruptcy courts that would  receive permanent or new judgeships under this legislation ``have seen  weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.''   Furthermore, without this legislation, all 14 temporary judgeships  covered by this bill will lapse later this month on May 25.   Allowing a lapse in these judgeships would have potentially crippling  effects on the bankruptcy system.   For example, five of the six authorized judgeships of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware--the preferred venue for  corporate reorganization under Chapter 11--are temporary.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers, the bill's sponsor, for his  leadership on this bill, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman  Goodlatte and Subcommittee Chairman Marino for their support.
