 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember Marta Macias  Brown, a longtime public servant, community leader, and beloved  constituent of mine.   I had the privilege of knowing Marta way before I took office and  started representing a portion of Marta's late husband's district, the  former Congressman George E. Brown, Jr., whose portrait hangs as a  former chairman in the Science Committee room.   Marta dedicated her career to advocating for social justice, women's  rights, and high-quality education for students. She used her voice to  eliminate barriers and create spaces for marginalized groups.   She was a proud Latina. She co-founded one of the first Spanish  publications in the Inland Empire called El Chicano, to share important  news with our community.   Marta spent her life uplifting and empowering others, and anyone who  knew her or knew of her could easily speak to the love that she had for  her community and the commitment she embodied for equality.   To the Macias Brown family and all those who knew, loved, and  respected her, I offer my deepest condolences. Marta's legacy will  always be cherished.                            ____________________
