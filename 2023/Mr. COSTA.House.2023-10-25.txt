 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks), and the chair for putting together this very strong resolution,  H.R. 771.   The United States unequivocally stands with the State of Israel and  its people.   The world is watching our actions today and tomorrow and by our  actions will determine the future of democracies around the world;  therefore, we must be unified and bipartisan.   Terrorism is never ever justified. Israel has the right to exist and  defend itself against Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist group whose only  purpose is to destroy the State of Israel and its people.   Therefore, Congress and the President must together pass a strong  bipartisan package to support our ally Israel. We must send a strong  message to Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah not to escalate the situation. In  the President's word: ``Don't.'' Don't think about it.   America defends its allies, Israel, Ukraine, and other freedom-loving  democracies around the world. We stand by our word.
