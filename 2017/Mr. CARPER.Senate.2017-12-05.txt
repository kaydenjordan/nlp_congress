 Mr. President, we just concluded a few minutes ago the  confirmation of the President's nominee for the next Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security.   As it turns out, the Presiding Officer is the chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over the  Department of Homeland Security. I have the privilege of being the  immediate past chairman of the committee. The Presiding Officer and I  have worked together on a wide range of issues that actually pertain to  the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.   I don't want to speak out of turn, but I believe both the Presiding  Officer, who is as well the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs, and I believe that one of the most  important ingredients of success of any organization--I don't care  whether it is a football team, a body such as the U.S. Senate, a  hospital, a school, a State, a country--the key is always leadership.  The key is leaders who are always interested in figuring out what is  the right thing to do; people who believe in the Golden Rule, treating  other people the way they want to be treated; and leaders who focus on  excellence in everything they do. They surround themselves with the  best people they can find. They embrace the idea that if a program or  whatever is not perfect, let's make it better. The best leaders with  whom I have been privileged to serve are those who just don't give up.  When they are sure they are right, they just don't give up.   We have had a series of leaders, and I have been privileged to know  every Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security since the very  beginning of time, when I served as Governor and when I served in the  Congress. I served with the first Secretary we had and others who have  succeeded him--most recently, John Kelly, retired Marine four-star  general who came from his command in SOUTHCOM to become Secretary of  Homeland Security. He is now at the White House serving as the Chief of  Staff to the President. We are grateful to him for his service.   Since he has moved on to that post, it has left a vacancy to lead the  Department of Homeland Security. I think Elaine Duke is filling in  quite nicely as the Acting Secretary. She was previously Deputy  Secretary of Homeland Security. Now that Kirstjen Nielsen has been  confirmed, we will see whether Elaine Duke will step back and be the  Deputy. I think a number of us hope that she will, but that is not our  decision to make.   The vote today in favor of Kirstjen Nielsen's confirmation was, I  believe, 62 ayes and 37 nays. Every now and then, we have the  opportunity to vote and it is a close call. Not all of our votes are  easy; some are more difficult than others. But for a number of us, this  was a close call.   I think Kirstjen Nielsen is arguably bright. She is well-spoken. She  has appeared before our committee and taken any number of questions.  She was asked and has answered hundreds of questions from committee  members and questions for the record. She has been good enough to meet  with me not once but twice. I said to her yesterday when we met that I  think she is a person with a good heart and good values--again, well- spoken and bright. She is especially strong with respect to cyber  security.   The real question mark for me--one of the question marks for me,  among others--was, for someone who has at best only led organizations  with maybe a couple dozen people to now be thrust into--or selected to  serve in this position, where she will be leading 240,000 people at the  Department of Homeland Security, spread out all over the world, is a  daunting challenge. As someone who has been privileged to spend 23  years of my life in the Navy as a naval flight officer, then as a  treasurer, a Congressman, a Governor, a Senator, and I led the National  Governors Association--for me, leading an organization of that size  would be daunting. I would expect that the same is true for Kirstjen  Nielsen.   John Kelly, who for 6 months was our Secretary, has a lot of  confidence in her, and I have a lot of confidence in John Kelly. John  McCain and I introduced him as the ranking member and the chairman when  General Kelly was nominated to be Secretary. John McCain sat on one  side of the nominee, and I sat on the other. I think we have taken his  recommendation to heart, and that was maybe the tie-breaker for some of  us.   When I spoke with Kirstjen yesterday, we talked about her core values  and what guides her in making decisions. I think some of it is faith- based, which I find encouraging; the idea of treating other people the  way we want to be treated; the willingness to welcome people to our  home, our country, who are strangers.   So we will see how it plays out. I think it is critically important  that--just as I try to surround myself with people who have strength  and fill in for my weaknesses, my hope is that is exactly what will  happen when she assumes the responsibility to lead the Department of  Homeland Security.   So I would say to Kirstjen Nielsen: Congratulations on your  confirmation, and we look forward to working with you, hopefully  agreeing a lot more often than we disagree. Good luck and God bless.                            ____________________     Next, Mr. President, I have a couple of charts here. I  don't know whether the Presiding Officer can see them from where he is  sitting. I can barely see them from right here.   The first chart we are going to take a look at deals with the--on  this side over here, we have median household income for Americans  since 1987. Over on this side, we have corporate profits in the  billions of dollars.   When we come back here to 1987, we look at the orange line here, and  that is median household income in 2016 dollars. The median household  income in 1987 was just a shade over $50,000. All of these years later,  in 2017, it is just a little bit higher. It has gone up a little bit  but not a whole lot--maybe close to $60,000, but I don't know that it  is any higher than that. It has gone up a little bit, really, over the  last few years.   The green line here on our chart is corporate profits. When we go  back to 1987, corporate profits were equal to about--it looks like  $30,000 billion, and if I am not mistaken, that would be maybe $30  trillion. I hope I have that right. That was 1987. If you look at what  has happened, it has gone up and down. This is during the great  recession when we fell off the cliff and almost fell off the world. In  2007, 2008, we started to climb back out of it. Today, the corporate  profits have roughly doubled in this country since 1987--roughly  doubled--while median household income is growing a tiny bit but  actually not that much.   Let's look at the next chart, and then I will not speak from the  charts. I guess the lesson here again is that corporate profits have  gone up rather nicely. There were some ups and downs because of the  great recession, but they are on an uptick now.   This is a look at the national deficit and debt. I know the Presiding  Officer has a great concern about this.   I came to the House I guess in 1983. I had been State treasurer for a  State  [[Page S7851]]  that had the worst deficit in the country. The State of Delaware tied  with Puerto Rico. We were a mess.   Finally, Pete du Pont, a Republican, did a wonderful job for 8 years  as Governor. I had the opportunity to serve with him in the State  treasury and later on to become the Governor of the State of Delaware,  when we went to a triple A credit rating for the first time in State  history.   I came here in 1983 as a Congressman who was concerned about debts  and deficits. My sense is that here in the Senate and the House, we  don't have a lot of deficit hawks these days. If we do, their voices  are not heard very loudly. We are on a course that is unsustainable in  terms of our accumulation of more debt.   This is an interesting chart because it goes back to really the  beginning of World War II, the war my dad was in and my uncle served  in. There is a lot of red ink here, and it shows the deficit as a  percentage of gross domestic product, and it reached about 30 percent  right in the middle of World War II. After the war, we have the green  down here where we actually had some surpluses in the late 1940s and  the early 1950s. We actually had a surplus in 1968. Then we went from  1968 to about 1998 and never balanced the budget, all of those years at  one time. The last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we balanced  our budget four times. It was a bipartisan deal.   The chairman of the House Budget Committee, if I am not mistaken, was  a Republican from Ohio, John Kasich, who is now the Governor of Ohio.  John and I came to the House together in 1983. He came as a deficit  hawk as well. He and the Clinton administration obviously did a nice  job to help to balance four budgets. We haven't done so well since  then. Since then, we have shown, right from here up to the present,  which would be right around there, one deficit after the other-- deficits that peaked out over the last year of George W. Bush's  administration, when we were again falling into the great recession,  and we have spent a lot of money in stimulus to try to get us out of  recession.   The debt dropped from about $1.4 trillion per year down to about one- third that much, and now it is starting to go up again. The debt last  year--the year that ended on September 30--the deficit had bounced back  up to $666 billion again in 1 year--a lot of money. The prospect going  forward is not encouraging; it is actually discouraging.   The tax cut bill that was passed in this Chamber just a few days  ago--last Saturday morning, in the middle of the night--called for tax  breaks, some for individuals for a while, some for corporations that  tend to be more permanent in nature. But for me, maybe the most  troubling aspect of the tax bill that was enacted last Saturday  morning, aside from the way it was pushed through, is the idea that we  got, right here on the Senate floor, I think sometime around the middle  of the evening last Friday night, a 400-page amendment, over 400 pages  that we had never read, never seen, with scribbling on the side of the  pages. The idea was that somehow we were supposed to read that and  understand it and then vote it up or down in an amendment in like 4 or  5 hours. Good luck. That just doesn't happen. That would be the triumph  of man's hope over experience.   I always ask these four questions when people ask about what we  should do in tax reform. I say, No. 1, it ought to be fair. What we  have actually passed is something where most of the benefits, the  lion's share, go to people who are, frankly, very wealthy. Folks who  are lower and lower middle income may realize some benefits in the  first few years following the implementation of the new tax cut, but  over time--say, by 2025--families with incomes up to $75,000 per family  are going to be realizing not a net gain from the tax cut but actually  a net loss, which is not good.    I always ask: Is it fair? I think it is not fair when you look at the  numbers and see how middle-income folks fare and those who happen to be  wealthier fare.   The second question I always ask is this: Will it foster economic  growth or diminish it? I focus a lot of my time and energy on economic  growth, job creation, and job preservation. Senators, Presidents, and  Governors don't create jobs. We create a nurturing environment for job  creation, job preservation, and workforce, transportation  infrastructure, protection of intellectual property rights, public  safety, access to water and wastewater. There are a lot of things that  contribute to economic growth and so forth. Tax policy is important.  Commonsense regulation is important as well.   But my second question is this: Does the tax reform bill that we  passed foster economic growth? Not really. To a modest extent, some,  but not really. One of the things it does is it suggests uncertainty  and the lack of predictability going forth, which I don't think  businesses really care for.   One area where we, frankly, decided not to spend any money this time  is the area where we could actually get the biggest bang for our buck  in terms of growing GDP. We have a transportation infrastructure that  is woefully inadequate these days, in terrible shape--roads, highways,  bridges, rail, ports, and airports. We have many broad areas in the  country that don't have access to the internet.   We just passed a tax bill that is going to increase the deficit by  $1.5 trillion. Unfortunately, none of that goes to pay for or to make  investments in things that would grow GDP by a lot and would provide  employment opportunities--not just for a couple hundred thousand people  but for millions of people, over the next decade or so. None of that is  there.   The third question I always look at in terms of tax reform is this:  Does it simplify the Tax Code or make it more complex? The new  provision that was adopted is going to increase by this much the  thickness of the Tax Code, or by about another 15 or 20 percent--not  making it simpler or easier to understand, but actually more difficult.   The last piece I consider is this: What is the effect on the deficit?  Pumping up the deficit by another $1.5 trillion is making the situation  even worse.   We are going to go to conference now, the House and Senate. My hope  is that it will be more bipartisan than what we saw here in the Senate.  It needs to be. I quoted last week and I quoted again today an old  African-American proverb: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you  want to go far, travel together. Our Republican friends, at least on  this side of the Congress, for the most part have chosen to go fast and  to go alone. That is unfortunate. The last time we did tax reform, we  did it together. It took 3 years, but it was a more lasting and, I  think, a better outcome.                            ____________________     I want to pivot for just a moment, Mr. President, and  talk about workforce. Most people, when they think of Dreamers and  DACA, think of young people who were born in other countries and maybe  at a very early age were brought here by their parents and maybe have  no recollection of the countries they grew up in. But they have been  here now. They came here, were raised here, and were educated here,  many of them in our public schools. A number of them had the  opportunity to go to college.   Delaware State University is a historically Black university in Dover  and is the home of the Hornets. It is a wonderful land grant school  that I have been heavily invested in as Governor and even now to make  sure they rise and continue to improve. I am very proud of all of the  progress that has been made there. I was invited by their president,  Harry Williams, to come to their campus a couple of months ago. We met  with Dreamers, ``DACAs,'' students born in other countries who were  brought here by their parents years ago.   I have met a lot of college students in my day. I have been joined on  the floor here by Senator Durbin from Illinois. He has probably met at  least as many as I have--probably more, because he is from a bigger  State.   I don't think I have ever been more impressed by a group of college  students in my life than the young men and women I met that day. We  literally happened to be there at 11 in the morning that day, when the  President's administration announced that the time for the Dreamers was  going to expire in 6 months, unless Congress was somehow able to put  together an agreement and pass legislation--which is hard to do without  the support of the administration.  [[Page S7852]]    I was there with young people that day. I will never forget what a  young man said. I think he was born in Central America--either  Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador. This was right on the heels of the  problem of recognizing these young people and celebrating their promise  and potential. Right in the middle, we got an announcement, learning  that the administration had just announced about sending these folks  home in 6 months--not really home, because their home is here, but back  to the places where they were born.   There were about five or six students, all undergrads--freshmen,  sophomores. One young man had come here maybe from Guatemala, and he  stood up and said: As a young person, I honestly don't remember ever  living in my native country. The only country I remember is this  country.   I grew up in public schools. Every day, we would start our school day  in class, in home room, by standing, putting our hands over our hearts,  and pledging allegiance to the United States of America.   He said: This is my home. This is my country. This is the only home I  have ever really known.   He then went on to tell about his aspirations.   Those kids are smart and have parents who are engaged in their  education and have high expectations for their children. A number of  the students are working not one but two jobs to help support  themselves through school. As a Navy ROTC midshipman at Ohio State, I  worked two jobs to help pay the bills. These students are too. They are  taking courses that include math, science, and physics. They want to do  the kind of work that, frankly, a lot of people in this country--some  want to serve in the military, some want to be in public safety, some  want to be educators, some want to be scientists. They want to do all  kinds of things. This is a time when we have across the country some 4  million to 5 million jobs that are literally going unfilled today, and  people who maybe would like to do those jobs don't have the requisite  skills to do them, maybe they don't have the interest in doing the  jobs, or maybe they can't pass a drug test. But at a time when we have  3 million or 4 million jobs that are vacant, unfilled, and employers  are pleading for qualified applicants, that somehow we are going to  send 700,000 or 800,000 Dreamers back to wherever they were born makes  no sense.   One of the loudest voices we have heard in this debate is that it is  not just a fairness argument for the Dreamers, in terms of turning our  backs on their aspirations and hopes, but that it is in our self- interest as a nation, in terms of a stronger economy, to keep them  here.   Why would we educate them here and they learn values here, and then  we ship them off to another country to compete with us, to start  businesses of their own, instead of doing that here?   I suggest that we listen to the employers of this country. We don't  always agree with everything that the U.S. Chambers of Commerce or  State Chambers of Commerce say, but in this case they are absolutely  right.   I have a 3-minute statement that I would like to read, if I could,  from one of our Dreamers. Could I do that, I ask the Senator, our Whip,  from Illinois?   This is about a woman living in Wilmington, DE, which is where my  wife and I live. Her name is Kay-Dean Hayden. This is a portion of a  short email she recently sent to me:         My name Kay-Dean, a community builder who happens to be a       DACA recipient. I was born in Jamaica but I have lived in the       U.S. since I was 7 or 8 years old. I grew up in Delaware and       moved to New York in 2012 and moved back [to Delaware]       recently after 5\1/2\ years [in New York].        I am approaching 30 years old on March 1st, so I've been       here [in the United States] for almost 22-23 years.        My grandmother raised myself and two of my cousins. I grew       up not really understanding my immigration status or the       implications it would have on my reality and dreams. I missed       out on opportunities, but I assumed it was due to our       financial lack. My grandmother worked hard but she couldn't       read or write so this limited her.        After unjustly gaining a juvenile record because of poor       representation and ignorance of my rights, I decided I would       become a lawyer, not fully understanding that my immigration       status would potentially bar me from obtaining that dream.        After that summer, I gained a better understanding of my       status and why I couldn't really get a summer job or travel.       In order to truly cope, I determined that if I worked hard       enough, surely I could attain all my hopes and dreams.        I told my guidance counselor what I understood about my       immigration status and heard nothing but disappointment, I       was discouraged but I remained determined. I believed God       would reward my hard-work and faithfulness. So I saw [a]       different guidance counselor my 12th grade year, in tears,       pleading for help. She looked at my records (grades, SAT       score and activities) and by the grace of God she connected       me with a family member who worked with international       students at the local community college. With God's grace I       had the privilege of attending Delaware Technical and       Community College on a full scholarship.        In 2009, I graduated with my Associates in Business       Administration [with Concentrations in] Marketing Management.       Upon graduating, God opened the door and I was accepted to       Goldey-Beacom College with scholarship assistance . . . I       completed my degrees in 2011, and graduated in 2012 with my       Bachelors in Business Administration [with Concentrations in]       Financial Management.    After graduating from school and living and working in New York, Kay- Dean moved back to Delaware. She wrote:         I currently work with a program that provides mentorship       opportunity for minorities and under-served youth who are       interested in working in the medical field. I have been       absolutely blessed to walk through the doors I have though       they were not the ones I originally pictured. I have had the       pleasure of helping and building up others, especially young       people.        I thought for sure DACA would begin to allow me the chance       to finally not only build up others, but myself as well.        But with Mr. Trump as President and his ending of the DACA       Program and whispers of immigration raids, I fight to hold on       to my dreams. My DACA status ends in March and with it all I       have worked so hard to build over the last 4 years.        I wrote this long email to simply ask that you fight for       people like me. We didn't choose to be here but we are       grateful to be here.        It is here where we've grown, cried, dreamed and worked       hard for our American Dream. Here is where those we hold dear       reside.        It is my prayer that you will fight for me and others like       me. It is my prayer that you will be our voice in congress.       It is my prayer that you will humanize us to politicians who       have marginalized and demonized us. It is my prayer that you       would fight for us as if we were yours because truth be told,       WE ARE.    Your prayer has been heard.   I just want to say to my colleague Senator Durbin of Illinois, thank  you for years of leadership on this issue to do the right thing, to  treat other people as we would want to be treated if in their shoes  and, frankly, to do the right things in terms of strengthening this  economy.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
