 Madam Speaker, there are so many things we all want  to talk about and share, and sometimes, as Members of Congress, we run  in front of microphones and sort of do the shiny, loud object of the  day because, let's face it, that gets us retweets and Facebook and  those things, but they are often trite. So I have a handful of things I  want to walk through, but there is going to be a constant theme here.   I am not trying to be mean, but the thing is--and my facts will back  me up--that the Democrat policies, if you look at particularly the last  12 months, have made life more miserable for Americans, have made the  working class and the poor working class poorer and actually are  crushing hope.   I want to walk through a couple of economic things. I am blessed to  be the senior Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. There is a  handful of economists that work on our side, and there is a handful  that work for left side. We have been digging and digging and digging,  trying to understand the inflation data, the amount of cash chasing  goods, and what is happening in productivity. I hope I am wrong, but I  am starting to see numbers that look like we are on the cusp of a wage- price spiral.   Let's sort of walk through our basic economics. You all remember your  high school economics class, particularly those of us who are old  enough to have been in high school at the end of the 1970s. Businesses  raise prices because their costs are going up. Typically, just like we  were doing right now in the new year, people are getting their wage  hikes. Most of those wage hikes are nothing more than to keep up with  inflation, so you end up with this spike.   There was a handful of folks on the Democrat side that were saying to  look at the December number; it wasn't spiking as much as the previous  months. Wait till you see the January numbers when the wages come in,  and then you end up with this world saying now businesses,  organizations, government, others, have to keep raising their costs,  raising their prices, raising their taxes, others, to keep up because  they just had to raise wages, not for our brothers and sisters that are  out there working to live better but basically just to be able to  purchase the same things.   Except at the end of 2021, Americans were poorer. The fact of the  matter is, the average American fell about 2.7 to 3 percent poorer  because inflation grew faster than their wages did. But there are lots  of things in the economic literature--and I know I am geeking out a  little bit--that you start to end up in this seesaw effect, what they  call a wage-price spiral. Businesses keep having to raise their costs  because now they have to raise the wages, and it becomes a very, very  ugly circle.   A bit of trivia. How many of you here would immediately say to go  back to the 1980s, particularly the early 1980s? It was Paul Volcker  jacking up interest rates to just extraordinary levels that squeezed  out inflation. That is actually only part of the story. If you actually  look at the math during that time, there were the Reagan tax cuts, the  first round of them. They created a great spike in productivity.  Because one of the things inflation is, is I have too much money  chasing too few goods, so raising interest rates, making everything  more expensive, still doesn't do anything to make sure you are making  more goods, more services, to fill up that vacuum to remove that  inflationary pressure.   You actually even see some of that data after we did tax reform here  at the very, very end of 2017, when you saw the spike in productivity.  You saw a pretty impressive spike for 2 years of wages and actually  falling inflation. Why was that? It is because expensing and other  things we did in tax reform, repatriation, getting hundreds of billions  of dollars from around the world coming back into the country, actually  raised productivity and lowered prices. That is the holy grail. Right  now, almost every policy that the administration and, I hate to say,  this body is engaging in is counter to that.   We are going to walk through a couple of things here, and our  argument is really simple. Almost every major policy set being moved  forward--and I don't think it is purposeful; I think it is a  misunderstanding of the most basic economics--that my Democrat brothers  and sisters are doing is actually making life more miserable. I don't  think it is purposeful, but it is economics.   Let's walk through the facts, just the actual math. I know this is  always uncomfortable, but if you actually look at the data that came  in, when you look at the expenditures--because I am using this slide.  This is actually a 2019 slide, but it is important to set the base. Our  brothers and sisters who are in the lowest quartiles--and I hate that  term, but it is what we use in economics--dramatically more of their  income goes to pay for housing, dramatically more goes to pay for their  transportation and food. Those in the upper incomes, that is not where  they live.   Think about what has gone on in this last year. Most everyone who is  in this room, probably most everyone who is watching this, we are the  people who have savings. We have retirement accounts. We have 401(k)'s.  Life has gotten more expensive for us, but how many of you have a home  that has gone up dramatically in value? Think about those lower income  quartiles, that working poor, that middle class, that lower middle  class. Do they have a home? Are they renters? How much of their cost is  their transportation or just trying to provide housing? What we have  allowed to happen inflation-wise is just brutalizing them.   When you actually start to understand what the policies from this  last year have done--and I am going to show a number of these things,  showing that the left's policies are actually crushing the poor, the  working poor, and the middle class.    The difference here, when you see this type of graph, is we are  trying to sort of demonstrate that it is both the effects on  populations where you are income-wise--if you are in this lower income,  how much more the cost of your life is because of inflation. This is  almost just a pure demonstration of who benefits and who doesn't  benefit.   If you are a homeowner, if you are someone with lots of assets and  the stock market has been really good to you, you have come out ahead.  If you are like most in the middle class and lower, your standard of  living has gone down.   There is this rule of thumb from the top line. What are the two  things you do to make the working poor poorer? I have said this dozens  of times behind this microphone. It is inflation, and it is opening up  the border.   There is this economic theory--and this is actually old literature.  It is like 20 years old, and it actually had a number of left groups as  part of the authors who basically said if you look at the working poor,  a population who probably didn't finish high school, what they sell is  their labor, their willingness to work, their willingness to sweat.  What happens when you flood  [[Page H248]]  your society, functionally, in 1 year, with a couple of million people  with similar skill sets? It is just basic math. You functionally have  devalued the value of their labor. You have given them the double  whammy. You have created inflation, which affects the poor and the  middle class more dramatically.   You saw from the first chart how much more of their resources go to  pay for housing, to pay for transportation, and to pay for food. Now  you make them compete against a couple of million people with similar  skill sets. These aren't IT jobs. This isn't someone who is at the top  of the wage scale and creates a multiplier of productivity in society  because they are inventing some new app. This is the person who is  hanging drywall, working their hearts out. It is a tough job. Their  back is aching at the end of the night. Now they look out and there are  a couple of million other people in society with similar skill sets.   It is a level of misunderstanding. Some folks will come behind these  microphones and pretend they are being compassionate, not understanding  the cruelty of inflation and having an open border and how many working  poor are getting crushed by this.   I want to go a bit further. As you start to look at the inflation  level, you have to understand--7 percent was sort of the national  number, right? In markets like mine, in the Phoenix area, we were at  9.7 percent inflation in 2021. A lot of that is because I am from a  growth area. Lots of people are abandoning California and Illinois and  moving into my neighborhood, so much of my inflation is actually  housing.   We have already heard other people come behind the mikes, even today,  and talk about the cost of housing. Well, congratulations. In other  parts of the country, it is not 7 percent. In mine, it is 9.7 percent.  When we look at the charts and the details, it really, really has hurt  the working poor, and they are having trouble finding the most basic  accommodations.   Then we start to dig in more. The economists have made it very clear  that what was allowed to go on in 2021--the economics warns of  inflationary inequity. The details are pretty clear. For those who have  assets, you are going to do okay. If you are part of half of America  who doesn't have those few thousand dollars in the bank or owns a house  or has other assets, you have become poorer. The policies are making  you poorer.   I know this is uncomfortable, but you can't keep campaigning and  doing politics and saying, ``We care about the middle class, and we  care about the working poor,'' and then keep adopting policies that  make them poorer. At some point, the math always wins. Not the virtue  signaling, not the rhetoric, it is the math. We are making half of our  country poorer.   One of the other projects we are working on in the Joint Economic  Committee, and a couple of us on the Ways and Means Committee, is also  trying to understand what other attributes there are.   I can keep coming to the microphone and talking about the open  border, and we have an administration that doesn't seem to give a darn  because it is political. Their base has no trouble with a couple of  million undocumented folks coming into the country.   Inflation is really, really ugly because the math is brutal. Do you  have any sense how high interest rates have to go to squeeze out this  inflation? I think there is this fantasy that four marginal rate  increases this year somehow are going to tap down inflation.   I will make you a crazy--actually, it is not crazy; it is based on  math. At the final quarter of this year, you may be seeing 10 percent  inflation. I hope I am wrong. But I was in front of this mike a year  ago saying I think we will be close to 7, and I actually underestimated  it.   Going back to my opening comments, I really, really, really see in  the numbers that we are on the cusp of a wage-price spiral, and four  marginal quarter-point increases in interest rates ain't going to cut  it unless Congress dramatically starts to think about policies that  spike productivity. Except you have a left that now has an article of  faith that tax reform, that expensing, these things we did in the tax  code to bring hundreds of billions of dollars back into the country to  get organizations to invest in plants and equipment to make workers  more productive so they could be paid more--well, we can't do that.  Except even the liberal economists agree it worked. It turns out, you  need to be doing things like that.   The left's Build Back Better social spending bill, because it delinks  money, transfer payments from work, every dataset basically says it  will continue to spike inflation. At the end of 10 years--I came here  with the paper. It makes it very clear. At the end of 10 years, the  working poor are poorer because of the way the left has designed these  transfer payments without an expectation of participation in society  and work. I thought we learned this 25 years ago, but somehow math is  heresy.                                time  1530    So let's go. What are some of the other attributes that make our  brothers and sisters in that lower middle class, working poor, in many  of our neighborhoods, what else makes them poor?   We have touched on inflation. We have touched on flooding society  with millions of people with similar skill sets. When was the last time  we had someone remind us about the concentration of crime?   For most of the Members in this body, we don't live in neighborhoods  that are going to be subject to crime. How many Members here live  behind a gate? How many Members here have security?   I did a ride-along for 4 hours on Monday through north central  Phoenix in neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood. The  officer I rode with had almost 28 years on the city of Phoenix police  force, and the most disadvantaged neighborhoods had the most crime.   Okay. There is an assault here. You see the person in that apartment,  he is a drug dealer. You are realizing, it is the folks living in  poverty who are in the core of the crime. And then the left takes a  position of basically having verbal violence toward law enforcement.   But we know the data says, if you look at the concentrations of  poverty, one of the attributes that makes someone poor is when someone  comes and steals their stuff. You are trying to work; someone steals  your tools. You are trying to survive; someone breaks into your car or  steals your automobile. It is another attribute that once again the  left's policies are this constant economic violence on the poor.   And then you start to go on another thing we are working on. This one  is much more complex, but it is starting to prove the theory is true.  How many of you have ever heard the discussion about health  disparities? Urban poor, my Native American populations, even rural  poor, there are health disparities, and it is absolutely true.   Our brothers and sisters with renal failure, diabetes, these things,  who are concentrated, we can almost draw data circles around them and  say, look at the income inequality of this neighborhood to a  neighborhood that might be just down the street.   We have been trying to understand what the attributes are. Oddly  enough, some of the attributes aren't race. They are health. They are  crime. They are education. But the one that no one here has focused on  is actually health.   If you ever get a chance--and this is for anyone who is listening-- try to find the data of those who are suffering type 2 diabetes and the  concentration. Go find a heat map. It becomes a really interesting  discussion because what I am making as my fourth attribute is our  brothers and sisters who are sicker.   So the left's attitude is, well, it is good politics, we will just  put up a bunch more clinics. We will help them manage their diabetes.  Okay. That is an honorable thing. Wouldn't it be much more  compassionate to cure, to disrupt?   So we do know, because it came out a year ago, but it is as if no one  actually read it. We actually have the paper that was put together, a  working paper series from the Congressional Budget Office. It was  functionally some of the data within the Democrats' H.R. 3. If you  actually dig through the numbers within their working paper, it makes  it clear that the Democrats--it is great politics--hey, we are going to  lower drug prices. But the way they go about doing it a decade from  now, so many  [[Page H249]]  cures don't come. And as the paper talks about, it is the very cures  for things like potentially diabetes and other ailments that are  concentrated in our poor population.   So it is functionally the left's policy on something like H.R. 3-- because if you think about their pricing mechanism where if a drug  costs more than this amount of money, you can't have it. It is once  again policy that says, we are going to find a way for you to live with  your misery, but we are going to make living with your misery a little  cheaper. Then I think the thing that is loving and more compassionate  is we are going to find a way to cure it. It really is a different  mindset, and that isn't Republican or Democrat. It is just compassion.   But it may not be great politics because the fact of the matter is,  if you look at the mechanics within H.R. 3, the Democrats actually make  Big Pharma more profitable and bigger and more powerful, and they wipe  out the disrupters, the small biologics, the small pharma that is  actual chewing away their book of business because they are curing the  disease whereas Big Pharma over here is just maintaining it.   It is the classic economic irony of this place acts like a protection  racket. We give great speeches about how we are going to do this, and  then--wink, wink, nod, nod--what actually is happening is you are  locking in someone's oligopoly.   Once again, if you go through the paper, it makes it really clear  that the first couple of years there is not much difference because it  is what is already in the disruptive pharmaceutical pipeline. And we  have done presentations here of 100 new are-under-research and only a  few actually succeed. But in about 5 or 6 years you start to see a  collapse of those cures. Welcome to Democrat policy once again.   We have come to the floor multiple times with H.R. 3. We have made a  number of people very angry by referring to it as the Big Pharma  protection act. But the math is the math. And now you still have  additional CBO studies that make it clear we are telling the truth. It  is what it is.   We have actually made proposals to our brothers and sisters on the  left saying, we both are enraged at the price of pharmaceuticals.  Believe it or not there are other ways to get there, and one of the  most magical things we could do for society are also some of the  kickers to make sure there are capital stacks and these other things  that are a little geeky, but ways that that investment goes into the  cures.   So when you have things like a single-shot cure for hemophilia--I did  this presentation back in December. We have a proof of concept of a  cure for type 1 diabetes. Starting out, these are going to be really  expensive, they are going to be really difficult until we functionally  turn it into a biofoundry, and you build the capital stack, the Tax  Code, the incentives to do lots of that. But I can show you in chart  after chart, it saves society, it saves taxpayers a fortune in the  future.    Remember, last year's CBO math said in 29 years we are $112 trillion  in debt in publicly borrowed money in today's dollars. So that is  inflation-adjusted dollars. And we know that number is going to spike  once we get the math from this last fiscal year plugged in there. About  75 percent of that spending is just Medicare, that debt is Medicare.  The other 25 percent is Social Security.   The most powerful thing you can do for U.S. sovereign debt is disrupt  the price of healthcare, and our argument is, the greatest elegance is  actually doing it by making people healthier.   There is one other thing I want to throw in my frustration of  Democrat policy. My expertise is more Arizona and not the rest of the  country. We have seen the debate around here, lots of flowery words,  and almost no detail of the reality of what is underlying the piece of  legislation.   Our friends on the left will come behind the microphones and say it  is a Voting Rights Act. Okay. How is giving a politician six to one--so  you give me $200, and the Treasury is going to multiply it by six  times--defending democracy? Or is that, once again, the left being so  much smarter than Republicans are on how to try to stay in power?   How about some of the other things that are in the Democrats' H.R. 1  and H.R. 4, their Federal election bill?   My theory is a little different than other folks. It is just a  blatant power grab. It is not a power grab for the Federal Government,  which it is that, but it is much more than that. It is a power grab by  a party that basically is trying to design the election code to fit  their fund-raising model, their campaign model.   It does other things. Like down here, my State for functionally 18  years has had voter ID laws. Every dataset out there says you can't  find a differential of populations not being able to vote. Matter of  fact, I think in my State some of the underlying data is African- American females have the highest participation. It is actually White  males, particularly White rural males that have some of the lowest  participation and some of my Native Americans. But that doesn't meet  the folklore that we get from our brothers and sisters on the left.   Think about this--and this is the circle I want folks who are paying  attention to get their heads around--how it works. So the Democrats  push a voting rights bill, but it is really about voting mechanics. And  what they do is they say, Hey, we are going to have same-day, automatic  registration, and then we are going to legalize, industrialize ballot  harvesting, and then at the same time we are going to do this they also  are allowed to have, if you give them money, they get six to one. So  why would you do that?   Well, first off, as in California, the Democrats have built a huge  infrastructure. If you run for Congress, you actually take a  substantial portion of your campaign money and hire firms that go knock  on doors and harvest ballots. It is now a campaign mechanic.   Well, what happens if you hire lots of people to go walk through that  massive apartment building or this and that and knock on the door and  say, Hey, I will register you right here, let's do your ballot. That is  functionally what they are doing in this legislation.   And the beauty of it, it will ultimately be taxpayers who will be  financing it because the left, to their credit, has spent about the  last 15, 20 years building an online contribution system. And here is  the kicker. That online contribution system has trained contributors to  the left, contributors to Democrats who say, don't give one person this  much money, give 10 people this much. And it is as if it has always  been laid out the same, and--wink, wink, nod, nod--one day we are going  to set up a public funding system so your $25 contribution or $200  contribution gets multiplied six times.   You have got to give the left, the Democrats credit for their, just,  audacity. And then to call it a civil rights voting bill when, when you  break through its mechanics, it is about power, it is about power and  control. That is what this is.   The other beauty is handing the bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C.,  the functionality of saying they can tell my State of Arizona what is  allowed and what isn't allowed.   We have a family saying that goes, money, power, vanity, but most of  the time it is about the money. In this case, I have got to give the  left credit. They hit all three in the same piece of legislation. It  becomes about the money, it becomes about them keeping the power, but  reality has almost nothing to do with fairness. It is about the fear  that the public understands how much of the left's policies have been  crappy to them, their families, this country. The mechanism they are  going to try to keep in power is to functionally have us finance their  elections and allow them to industrialize the very bad acts that so  many of us worry about.   Madam Speaker, I think I feel a little better getting some of that  out of my system. I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
