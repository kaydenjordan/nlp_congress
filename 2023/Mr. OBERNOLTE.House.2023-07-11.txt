 Madam Speaker, this week, the House will be debating a  critically important piece of legislation, the Fiscal Year 2024  National Defense Authorization Act.   The bill that we are considering this week provides a much-needed 5.2  percent increase in compensation to our servicemen and -women. This is  of critical importance because we are one of the few countries in the  world that believes in an all-volunteer military force, and the only  way that we are able to attract the best and the brightest into our  military is if we pay competitive wages.   This bill will enact the largest increase to servicemember  compensation in over 20 years. That is a very meaningful gesture in  improving the retention and recruitment of quality men and women into  our military.   Madam Speaker, I also thank the House Armed Services Committee for  including my amendment to perform studies to direct more resources to  remote and isolated military bases like the five that exist in my  district.   Civilian contractor services are critical for providing the services  that make life bearable on bases like the ones that I represent. This  study will be a meaningful improvement in the quality of lives of the  servicemen and -women who serve in my district.   I also urge adoption of an amendment that I have offered to increase  permitting flexibility for the Marine Corps' Twentynine Palms Air  Ground Combat Center for the permitting of a joint exercise that allows  the annual King of the Hammers event to take place in my district.   This is one of the largest off-road racing events in the world. It is  beloved by residents of my district and Marines alike. It brings over  80,000 people annually to the Johnson Valley in my district. It is a  major economic driver.   We want to continue to see this event take place in the future as a  joint exercise between the King of the Hammers event and the Marine  Corps. This amendment will make that possible, and I urge its adoption.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the entire NDAA this year.  This will make some meaningful improvements in the quality of life for  our military men and women. It allocates an additional $15 million to  the U.S. Northern Command to improve drug interdiction like the scourge  of fentanyl that has been affecting my district.   Madam Speaker, this is a good thing for our national security and for  the men and women in uniform who serve our country. I urge its adoption  in Congress this week.                            ____________________
