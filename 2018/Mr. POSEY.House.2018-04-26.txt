 Mr. Chairman, for 7 years, I have been working to provide  American companies with the capability to conduct commercial space  support activities. American companies would like to utilize space  support vehicles to train crews and space flight participants for the  rigors of space flight and research.   Last year, our office worked with the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee to draft language to address this issue. At  the time, we agreed on language that the committee included in the  manager's amendment to an older version of the FAA reauthorization.  Since that time, a whole lot has changed in the commercial space  industry.   Recently, I worked with the industry, in coordination with the FAA,  to create a legislative solution to allow these companies to operate.  My bill, H.R. 5346, was favorably supported from the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee a month ago, and has the support of industry  and the FAA.   We owe it to our Nation's commercial space industry to get this  language right. I am sure you will agree with me that we cannot support  the passage of outdated or problematic language, and I hope you will  commit to working with me, going forward, to provide the industry with  an effective legislative solution.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
