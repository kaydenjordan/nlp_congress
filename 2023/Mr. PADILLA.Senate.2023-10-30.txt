 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Homelessness and Behavioral Health Care Coordination Act of 2023, Which  I introduced today.   On any given night in the United States, more than 582,000 people are  experiencing homelessness. An estimated 20 percent of those  experiencing homelessness also have a behavioral health condition,  including substance use disorders. While we know that the primary  driver of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing units, we know  that these behavioral and substance use disorders and conditions can  further exacerbate homelessness.   In order to ensure that those experiencing these conditions can  obtain and retain housing, we need to ensure that both housing and  social service providers have the resources to work together to  increase access to supportive services. That is why I am proud to  introduce this bill that would establish a grant program through the  Department of Health and Human Services that would award 5-year grants  of up to $500,000 to eligible entities to improve their capacity to  coordinate culturally competent, trauma-informed behavioral health and  homelessness services.   The bill would also create a Federal interagency working group, with  representatives from the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Department of  Agriculture, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to advise on how to  carry out the program. The working group would also develop materials  to facilitate understanding between Agencies offering health services  and homelessness services.   I want to thank Representative Madeleine Dean for introducing this  bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in taking this key  step to addressing the homelessness and behavioral health crises.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Homelessness and Behavioral Health Care Coordination Act of 2023, Which  I introduced today.
