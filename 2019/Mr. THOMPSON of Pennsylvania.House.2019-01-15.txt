 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, I had the  privilege of being in Kane, Pennsylvania, McKean County, Pennsylvania's  15th Congressional District, for a film screening and a panel  discussion about opioid addiction.   The 11-minute film is called ``Eye of the Needle,'' and it chronicles  opioid addiction in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was produced in 2017  for the Light of Life Rescue Mission's annual gala.   Light of Life is a homeless shelter in Pittsburgh whose clients are  homeless, primarily due to addiction and mental health issues. Light of  Life provides a home for the homeless; food for the hungry; and care  for the poor, the addicted, the abused, and the elderly.   Like so many shelters in America, the opioid epidemic has greatly  impacted them. They have been using this film as an educational tool.  It has been screened at Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne  University, Point Park University, and Robert Morris University.   On Sunday, it was the first time the film was shown in a community  setting. About 100 people gathered in the Kane Area Community Center  for the viewing, which also featured a panel discussion.   I proudly participated on the panel, which featured several speakers  from the community, including representatives from law enforcement and  alcohol and drug abuse services.   Mr. Speaker, I know there isn't a ZIP Code in the country that isn't  impacted by the opioid epidemic. We have seen the crippling effects of  this epidemic, and we need to act with unified urgency to help those  who are suffering.   It is considered by many to be the worst public health crisis of this  generation. Overcoming it will not only take a community-wide effort,  but a nationwide effort.   Through treatment and recovery, through prevention, by protecting our  communities, and by fighting fentanyl and other ever-changing synthetic  or foreign illicit drugs, we will overcome this epidemic.   Heroin and pain pill addiction does not discriminate on age, race,  gender, or socioeconomic status. Your neighbor could be using heroin,  and so could their high-honors high school student.   Unfortunately, the people of Pennsylvania have seen some of the  worst. In 2017, the crisis surged when the Commonwealth experienced a  44 percent increase in opioid overdoses.   Addressing this unprecedented rate of opioid-related deaths means  that we must focus on nearly 2.2 million Americans who currently  struggle with opioid addiction.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we are on the front line.  Through community conversations, like the one that took place in Kane  this Sunday, we can continue the conversation on how to end this  epidemic.   Congress has engaged many agencies, including the Department of  Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institutes  of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and Customs and Border  Protection, just to name a few, to help combat opioid abuse.   This crisis has taken lives, torn apart families, weakened our  workforce, and overextended our healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, this is a modern-day plague and the public health crisis  of our lifetime. We need to talk about it. We need to take action. And  we need to find solutions.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  PCN for 25 years of outstanding coverage of the Pennsylvania Farm Show.   Pennsylvania Cable Network, now called PCN, was organized August 29,  1979, as a nonprofit corporation by Pennsylvania cable companies.   PCN marked the first use of cable television for distance education,  and it was the first educational cable television network in the  Nation. PCN was on the air before CNN, ESPN, FOX News, MSNBC, and  nearly all other nationally distributed cable networks.   In November 1993, PCN began providing public affairs programming in  prime time to provide viewers coverage of the Pennsylvania General  Assembly.   In 1994, it expanded beyond government and covered every aspect of  the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show.   This year, PCN exclusively delivered the Pennsylvania high school  championships rodeo, the sale of champions, the celebrity rabbit  hopping contest, the grand champion junior market goat and lamb show,  the draft horse competitions, the mini-horse pull, square dancing  competitions, and much more.   Madam Speaker, I commend PCN on 25 years of exclusively delivering  the Farm Show to viewers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and I  congratulate PCN on this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
