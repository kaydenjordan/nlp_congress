 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of Erick  Silva.   Erick was a security guard at the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1. As soon as gunshots went off, he immediately began  selflessly helping people and was, unfortunately, shot in the process.   Erick's life goal was to help others by becoming a police officer. He  would buy burgers for homeless people, treat relatives to dinner, and  help his mom pay her bills by working long shifts and holding yard  sales in his free time.   Erick was humble, pure, and real. He was known for being funny and  always cracking jokes. He would go above and beyond what was asked of  him and would put others first. He is remembered as being the epitome  of integrity, service, and excellence.   I would like to extend my condolences to Erick Silva's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
