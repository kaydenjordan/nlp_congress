 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following new section:       SEC. 5. EXAMINATION OF LICENSES FOR PROJECTS LOCATED IN                     DISASTER AREAS.         Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may examine the       license issued by the Commission under part I of the Federal       Power Act for any project that is located in an area that was       declared by the President to be a disaster area in 2017.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 607, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Babin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, when a disaster like Hurricane Harvey  strikes, the most important job we have is to assist those in harm's  way.   From the Texas National Guard to the Louisiana Cajun Navy, to  countless volunteers and citizens who have volunteered and contributed  their time, their money, and their prayers, we saw across southeast  Texas, in the immediate aftermath of that storm, nothing less than a  model to which the whole Nation and world can aspire.   I have even compared the rescue of so many Texans by boat to the  miracle at Dunkirk.   But when the storm passes, it is just as important that we look for  lessons, demand accountability, and work to fix whatever went wrong or  may have made this situation worse.   I am pleased to offer this amendment today that will begin to address  such an issue.   When a hydropower station is licensed and regulated by FERC, it is  not just the power plant that falls under Federal control. Decisions  about lake levels, flood storage capacity, and other measurements of  the body of water that powers that station are set forth in FERC  license protocols and guidelines written and administered by folks who  work right here in Washington.                                time  1500    As a former official for the Texas Lower Neches Valley River  Authority, I know that these are tough decisions to make, and sometimes  it is a matter of choosing between bad and worse options of where to  put all of that water.   But in my district, serious concerns have been raised by my  constituents and local river authorities about whether FERC's licenses  for hydropower facilities need to be adjusted to account for the  unprecedented flooding that we just experienced and with the ability to  make commonsense changes in the face of an impending flood event.   My amendment ensures that nothing will stand in the way of FERC going  in and examining the licenses for any facility located in the path of  the terrible disasters that we have seen this year. By passing it with  strong bipartisan support, we will make clear that that is just what  FERC should do.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and introduce someone who is now famous in  Texas, Uncle Fred Upton, now that the Astros have won the World Series.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my next-door neighbor and  cosponsor of this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Estes of Kansas). The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).   The amendment was agreed to.           Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in House Report 115-391.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following new section:       SEC. 5. STUDIES FOR NON-FEDERAL HYDROPOWER.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Federal       Energy Regulatory Commission has in place a memorandum of       understanding with another Federal agency for non-federal       hydropower with respect to a project licensed under part I of       the Federal Power Act (regardless of explicit Congressional       authorization for such non-federal hydropower), the other       Federal agency may fully study and review the potential       expansion of such non-federal hydropower at the project,       including a review of seasonal pool levels and slowing flood       releases.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 607, the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.  [[Page H8635]]    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very  straightforward. It supports the mission of the underlying bill to  responsibly increase opportunities for hydropower across the Nation.   My amendment authorizes agencies with an existing memorandum of  understanding with FERC to study the expansion of hydropower. The need  for this arises from a project in my district in Summersville, West  Virginia. There is what is called a run-of-the-river hydroelectric  project in Summersville. There is an MOU between the town--the city of  Summersville--FERC, and the Army Corps of Engineers.   The Summersville hydro project was actually licensed by FERC in 1992  and constructed in 2001, with the cooperation of the Army Corps of  Engineers. It provides enough renewable energy to power 22,000 homes.  It might be possible to increase hydropower by adjusting the seasonable  pool levels and managing the releases. Even if this is only for just a  few days, it could result in a 15 percent increase in power generation  for the surrounding community.   Unfortunately, I have heard that even to conduct a study requires  explicit authorization from Congress. So that is what we are doing here  today with this amendment. This amendment would provide that authority,  and only in limited cases where there is an existing MOU on the books  between the agencies and FERC.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).
