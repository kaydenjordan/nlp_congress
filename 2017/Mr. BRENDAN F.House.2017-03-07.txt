 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, with exactly zero hearings on the topic, our Republican  friends have now revealed their TrumpCare plan.   Just to remind everyone what President Trump said during the campaign  and promised, he said that his Republican plan would ``have insurance  for everybody,'' and that it would be ``far less expensive and far  better'' than what we have today.   Well, now we actually have the plan out. What does it do?   It kicks 20 million Americans off their health insurance. It sharply  increases out-of-pocket costs for millions of American families. It  rations care for millions of Americans on Medicaid. It includes massive  cuts to Medicaid. It would make maternity care much more expensive.   But don't worry, there is good news. If you are a CEO of a healthcare  company and you make, on average, as they do, somewhere between $13  million and $14 million, the tax increases that were leveled on you 6  years ago will now be repealed. So, congratulations. Those folks  benefit, but 20 million Americans lose their health insurance.   Please join me in saying ``no'' to TrumpCare.
