 Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy  and his leadership.   I am proud to lead this amendment with the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Mast), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), and the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee) to inject some sanity into our medical  marijuana approach.   Veterans in Oregon and across the country have shared powerful  stories with me about how medical cannabis has saved their lives and  given them relief from wounds of war seen and unseen. These veterans  have also shared their fear about what would happen if they worked with  the VA doctors to incorporate their cannabis use into their treatment  plans.   The VA denies veterans access to this care option by preventing  providers from completing forms in compliance with State medical  marijuana programs. This is a shameful disservice to the men and women  who put their lives on the line. The VA is forcing veterans to seek  care outside the VA or self-medicate.   Our veterans are paying the price for Congress' failure to act. That  is why I am proud to join Representative Mast in leading the Veterans  Equal Access Act and why I call on my colleagues to support this  amendment. Simple justice for our veterans.
