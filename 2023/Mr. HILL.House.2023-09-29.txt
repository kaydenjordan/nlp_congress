 Mr. Speaker, this is an important day. This Congress needs  to come together to go back and get our spending under control and also  get our border under control.   Both are of concern to the American people. We hear about it in our  offices every day. The spending is unsustainable, but 200,000 people a  month coming across the border and living in this country illegally is  also unsustainable.   This bill is a product of hard work for weeks to give us time to  complete our appropriations work, to negotiate with the Senate while at  the same time reducing spending, which has been an avalanche of out-of- control spending for the last 2 years, and to secure our border.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of it, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.
