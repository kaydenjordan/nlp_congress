 Mr. Speaker, we are already paying the price for the  elimination by President Trump and the Republican Congress in 2018 of  both the office and the emergency funding that President Obama created  to address outbreaks like the coronavirus we are now experiencing.   Starting on empty, Trump's request for $2.8 billion in emergency  funding is not even in the ballpark of what experts say is needed.  Already more than 100 cases have been reported nationwide. A vaccine  will probably not be available for at least a year, yet 11 States are  already reporting cases of the virus.   The World Health Organization says the coronavirus can perhaps be  contained, but, ``the window of opportunity is narrowing.'' It will be  up to us in this House to act quickly this week and for the Republican  Senate to follow suit.                            ____________________
