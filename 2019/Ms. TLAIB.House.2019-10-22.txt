 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our chairman, Elijah  Cummings.   He was my first chairman. Chairman Cummings believed in the  possibility of better from this institution. He understood that our  squad was big and embraced the new era of social justice movement in  our country. Congressman Cummings' presence was iconic, and I am  humbled and honored to have served with him.   I pray that Congressman Cummings' wife and family find peace during  this very difficult time in knowing that he has left a powerful legacy  that has been centered on truth and justice.   I have a picture of my son with Congressman Cummings. He always said  that children are the messages we send in the future. And so I wanted  to honor Congressman Cummings by showing and displaying just the  beautiful smile I remember that he provided for my 14-year old boy.                            ____________________
