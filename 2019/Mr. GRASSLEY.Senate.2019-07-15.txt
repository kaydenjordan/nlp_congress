 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30  seconds as in morning business, please.    Mr. President, 24 years ago radical Serb forces  committed the worst genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. In  and around the hallowed grounds at Srebrenica, over 8,000 Bosnians were  murdered out of ethnic and religious hatred.   Iowa, my State, is now home to many Bosnians who bore witnesses to  those atrocities. I pray that they and their families find peace, as  well as justice. Ethnic and religious hatred must never be tolerated,  and we must not forget the victims of this crime.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Iowans from the organization Iowa Safe  Schools asked me to note that July 15 is the kickoff of their annual  Pride Camp. They tell me that it is an opportunity to learn valuable  life skills and network with other LGBTQ youth in a supportive and  nurturing environment and that it is a week full of fun and learning  for its attendees.                            ____________________
