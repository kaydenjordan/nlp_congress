 Madam Speaker, when you are a son of the  segregated south, when you have heard your mother called girl, and your  father called boy, when you have had to go to the back door, when you  have had the Klan burn a cross on your property, you know hate when you  see it. You know what a hate crime is when it takes place.   What happened in Georgia was hate personified, it was a hate crime. I  will march with the people who will be opposed to this. I will stand  with them. We cannot allow this kind of injustice to go unchallenged.  It is better to stand alone than not stand at all. This is a hate crime  and we must--we must seek justice for those victims, and we must demand  that these persons who are calling these viruses by names associated  with people, that they ought to stop, and we ought to demand it. I do  so. I demand that they stop.                            ____________________
