 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concerns  with H.R. 228. While the legislation seeks to provide additional  flexibility and support to Indian tribes--a worthy goal--I remain  concerned that it could have the effect of weakening the services  provided to families and children in Indian tribes.   Currently, Indian tribes have the option to consolidate certain  federal funding streams related to work and job training into one  grant. H.R. 228 includes a number of changes to this consolidation  option and expands the number of programs that can be consolidated.   The legislation could be interpreted in an overly broad fashion  resulting in the inclusion of programs that may not be appropriate to  include--programs or services only ``related to'' job training, skill  development, and economic development, or other related goals.   Last Congress, the legislation was given a sequential referral to the  Education and the Workforce Committee, on which I serve as Ranking  Member. However, the legislation was not considered in the Committee  and we have yet to assess its impact on education and training programs  within our jurisdiction.   Specifically, our Committee has an interest in ensuring that program  funds are used for their intended purpose. Whether the TANF program or  Head Start, adequate reporting and oversight protect beneficiaries and  ensure the quality of services. For example, Head Start performance  standards are vital to the success of the program.  [[Page H1331]]    While I do not intend to oppose the legislation, I encourage  continued robust oversight of the programs impacted by this bill to  ensure that quality and effective education and job training programs  remain available to our nation's tribes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 228, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
