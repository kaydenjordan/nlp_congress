 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank all of our veterans  for their service and sacrifice for our great country.   I come from California, the home of the greatest number of veterans  in this great country. On their behalf, I would like to thank Chairman  Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their tremendous job and leadership in  addressing the needs of all of our veterans.   I am pleased that we reached the bipartisan agreement, and I hope the  rest of this place learns from the work the Veterans Affairs' Committee  has done. I hope that tomorrow, when we wake up and open up those  newspapers, this is a front-page story, because it deserves to be.  Democrats and Republicans, everybody coming together to work for our  veterans, that is the way it should be done.   Three years ago, Congress created the Choice Program. This was an  alternative to make sure that our veterans didn't have to wait to get  the health services they needed.   This bill will provide additional funding and short-term  sustainability for this program called the Choice Program. This bill  will also allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to open up more  clinics and to hire additional doctors to make sure that our veterans  get the service they deserve.   Again, I am glad that we are here today and that we could work to  make sure that our veterans get the services they earned. I urge all my  colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.
