 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to  dyslexia, a learning disability that affects as many as one in five  people.   October is Dyslexia Awareness Month, which is why I will be  introducing a resolution this week calling on Congress to formally  recognize it.   Those who have dyslexia struggle with language skills, making reading  significantly more difficult.   While this is a serious problem, it is a solvable one. If educators  identify dyslexia early on and teach children proper techniques,  students can use these tools to succeed. Reading is foundational to  education, as we first learn to read and then read to learn.   Dyslexia affects students equally regardless of intelligence,  socioeconomic status, or gender. Many famous people, including Albert  Einstein, Steve Jobs, and George Washington, had dyslexia. They were  able to achieve incredible things despite their learning disabilities.   However, 74 percent of children who are poor readers in third grade  remain poor readers by the time they reach ninth grade. This is why, as  co-chair of the bipartisan House Dyslexia Caucus, I am working to  increase awareness. I encourage my colleagues to join the House  Dyslexia Caucus so we can ensure children with dyslexia have every  opportunity to succeed.                            ____________________
