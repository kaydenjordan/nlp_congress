 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, under the ACA, 5 to 6 million Americans were kicked off  their healthcare plans, including 300,000 of my fellow Washingtonians  who lost coverage despite repeated promises they could keep their  plans. A majority of Americans have faced skyrocketing costs, reduced  access to quality care, and fewer choices for their families. I believe  we can and we must do better.   Under this bill, Americans will have health care that fits individual  and family needs instead of federally mandated, one-size-fits-all  coverage that is simply unaffordable for far too many people. This bill  strengthens and guarantees access for the most vulnerable in our  communities.   The ACA has failed. I made a promise to the thousands of my  constituents who have told me of the devastation this law has wreaked  on their lives that I would not forget them. Americans in every  election since 2010 have said loud and clear the same thing, and it is  time that we listened.   Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act is the first major step in  keeping that promise, and I think that we need to take it.
