 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks), the chairman of the committee, for yielding. I thank him for  his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor quickly and  effectively. I thank Mr. Wilson, who represents the minority, and also  Mr. McCaul, who is the ranking member of the committee, for bringing  this. I thank Mrs. Spartz for bringing this issue to the personal  attention of all of us, with her personal knowledge of Ukraine and her  love of her native country.   Madam Speaker, in 1940, after the Battle of France had ended and the  Battle of Britain was beginning, Winston Churchill stood before the  House of Commons and declared that the United Kingdom would fight on,  if necessary, for years; if necessary, alone.   Britain would fight by itself for some time, but it was not alone.  Even though America was not at war, we made a strategic and moral  determination that we must help Britain defend itself against fascism.  To do that, we set up the lend-lease program, which cut through red  tape and enabled critical American military aid to reach our Allies  quickly so they could win the Battle of Britain, hold back the forces  of fascism, and begin a counteroffensive in North Africa.   Lend-lease established America as what President Franklin Roosevelt  called the great arsenal of democracy.   Today, the battle for democracy is taking place in another European  nation, Ukraine. The Ukrainian people are the ones engaged in combat  directly. They are at the point of the spear. They are the ones  experiencing death and destruction and displacement. They are directly  in the line of the Russian troops to repel Vladimir Putin's criminal  and unprovoked invasion, an act that recalls the infamous attack on  Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941: unprovoked, unjustified,  unacceptable.   But they are not alone in this fight. Already, the Biden-Harris  administration and our allies have sent billions of dollars' worth of  lethal military aid to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin's  unlawful and immoral aggression.   I heard the words of my friend from South Carolina that Putin has  brought us together, has unified us, unified us as a NATO alliance,  unified us as a European Union and the United States of America,  unified us as a Congress, that this shall not stand. Already, the  Biden-Harris administration and our allies have sent billions of  dollars' worth of lethal military aid to help Ukraine defend itself  against Putin's unlawful and immoral aggression.   Putin, of course, meant the battle for Kyiv to be short-lived, to  last days, and to see Ukraine's democratic government overthrown and a  quisling regime installed.   The battle of Kyiv, however, was won by the forces of freedom, thanks  to the extraordinary heroism and courage of Kyiv's defenders and the  antitank weapons and other equipment supplied by America and its NATO  allies. They are not alone.   Now, with war raging in Ukraine's east, we are rapidly sending  additional arms to the Ukrainians that will help them hold the line  against Russian forces and engage in the kind of counteroffensive that  will defeat Russia's invasion.   How extraordinarily ironic it is that Putin urges us not to escalate  the war as Putin escalates it hourly, unjustifiably, criminally,  despicably. Every negative adjective you can find applies to the  unwarranted, unprovoked, and unacceptable aggression Russia has made on  its neighbors.                                time  1500    As I told The Danish Foreign Policy Society when I was visiting with  our allies earlier this month, the invasion of Ukraine must end in a  strategic defeat for Putin and global criminality. Anything less would  send a dangerous signal to other dictators around the world that wars  of aggression could yield net gains. That must not happen.   America and our allies must ensure that the only thing Putin gains  from the invasion of Ukraine is a hard lesson learned through bitter  defeat and loss. Let there be no mistake; that is the only outcome we  can accept.   The lend-lease bill we will pass today is a bipartisan expression of  the House's support for Ukraine and the continued provision of the  lethal arms it requires to defend its freedom, its sovereignty, and its  people.   I thank, as I said earlier, Chairman   Gregory Meeks, Ranking Member    Michael McCaul, Representative   Joe Wilson, and staff members of the  Foreign Affairs Committee for their work on this bill.   The Senate passed this legislation unanimously earlier this month. I  urge my colleagues: This is not a partisan issue. This is about  freedom. This is about democracy. This is about morality. This should  not be an issue that is at all dividing the 435 of us who have the  honor to serve in this body.   Once this legislation is enacted, the Biden-Harris administration  will have another tool to ensure that military aid reaches Ukraine  quickly and efficiently so that it can be deployed to the front lines  and defend democracy. We owe freedom nothing less than that.   The White House has already requested additional funding for military  and humanitarian aid, and the House will stand ready to take action  once there is agreement on the path forward.   I tell Chairman Meeks of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I tell  Chairman Smith of the Armed Services Committee, as soon as that is  ready to move, I will move it as soon as it is possible.   The White House has urgently requested the resources that Ukraine  needs. Can we do any less than that? In the meantime, I urge all of my  colleagues to support this bill, as I said, unanimously. Let us show  Vladimir Putin, let us show the dictators and autocrats of the world,  let us show them what happens when democracy is attacked.   Hitler thought when he took Sudetenland and the free world did little  that he could then go to Poland, and he could go to Russia, and he  could go to Africa, and he could go to France, and he could go  someplace else.   The free world led by America must make it very clear that it will  not stand for this, that America will be part of an extraordinary  alliance of free nations, moral nations, who believe in law, not might  makes right.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to unanimously and decisively  approve this legislation.
