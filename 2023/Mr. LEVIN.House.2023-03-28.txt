 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1,  the polluters over people act.   Although energy independence and lower costs are laudable goals for  any energy legislation, unfortunately, this bill achieves neither.  Instead, H.R. 1 is a giveaway to Big Oil and their lobbyists, who want  to be able to set their own rules at the expense of working families.  Instead of putting the needs of the American public at the center of  this bill, my friends across the aisle drafted an industry wish list.   First, H.R. 1 undermines landmark environmental laws and protections  like the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act that  safeguard public health and keep our drinking water and air clean. It  also repeals the methane emissions reduction program, which helps  companies reduce their methane pollution.   This bill makes it easier for polluters to set their own standards  and roll back reforms, and it lets Big Oil rubberstamp their own  projects with minimal oversight. Environmental disasters are far too  common, and unfortunately, H.R. 1 would make it easier for future  disasters to happen.   Second, the polluters over people act worsens the climate crisis by  empowering the fossil fuel industry instead of strengthening the  foundation for a clean energy future, which is so important.   During the last Congress, the 117th Congress, we passed policies-- many bipartisan policies--like the bipartisan infrastructure law, the  CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, that invested  in climate action at a scale matching the challenge that science tells  us that we face.   This bill that we have before us today not only ignores the  additional steps we need to take to reach our climate targets, but it  actively takes us backward on climate action by rolling back key  provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was and is the most  significant environmental and climate bill that has ever been passed in  the United States or anywhere else.   We know that data is alarming. A new U.N. report found that global  warming could increase by 3.2 degrees Celsius and cause 7 feet of sea  level rise by the end of the century if immediate actions are not  taken. This is an existential crisis.   Climate change is real. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle  know it is real, and we cannot continue to deny this and put our planet  at risk with this type of legislation.   Instead of wasting time on this Big Oil wish list, I would like for  us, instead, to focus on actions that will actually expand the  employment of clean energy, reduce costs, expand high-capacity  transmission, reform the interconnection process, and build on the $1  billion that we secured in the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure that  Federal agencies have the resources and expertise to conduct efficient  environmental reviews.                                time  1445    Third, H.R. 1 adds to the deficit. That is right, it adds to the  deficit by giving handouts to big oil and gas corporations so that  their executives and their shareholders can get even richer.   For a party that is focused--at least, I hear that they are--on  tackling the deficit, I think it is pretty extraordinary that this  legislation, their signature legislation would add to the deficit.   Last year, when Americans were dealing with high costs at the pump,  fossil fuel executives were taking in record profits. In fact, 26 of  the country's largest oil companies made a record-breaking $451 billion  last year, just last year, and they spent over $163 billion on stock  buybacks and dividends to their shareholders.   These same companies donated over $370,000 to my friends across the  aisle, so it is no wonder they want to reward their friends. It is  clear that this legislation, the polluters over people act, is another  giveaway, to keep corporations rich at the American people's expense  without making meaningful reforms. In fact, while making things worse.  For all these reasons and more, I strongly oppose this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I proposed four amendments that would begin to correct  course, but unfortunately my friends across the aisle are only allowing  two of those amendments to come to the floor.   My first amendment that was blocked would clarify that lead Federal  agencies can extend a public comment period or gather further community  input if the Secretary determines that doing so would improve project  results or efficiency.   This would allow agencies to actually streamline the permitting  process by ensuring that potentially impacted communities and local  governments have the ability to fully engage in the process.   Instead, my friends across the aisle chose to block consideration of  this amendment and perpetuate the myth--it is a myth--that community  input somehow slows down project approvals.   My other amendment that was blocked would have banned offshore  drilling off the southern California coast. Californians of both  political parties have made it absolutely clear, overwhelmingly clear  that they are strongly opposed to additional offshore oil and gas  drilling in southern California off the coast.   This amendment would have offered this Congress an opportunity to  respect the will of the overwhelming majority of Californians who  oppose drilling off our coasts.   I strongly urge my friends across the aisle, allow debate on these  and other amendments so that more voices are heard.   As my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have heard me say  before, I am willing to work with anyone--anyone--on either side of the  aisle to meet the goals of lowering energy costs and protecting our  planet, particularly in terms of promoting a more efficient and  transparent permitting process. I hope we can do that.  [[Page H1490]]    We can find common ground on pragmatic solutions. This is not common  ground. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''
