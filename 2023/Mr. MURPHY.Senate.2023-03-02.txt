 Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory  of Mr. Dan Camilliere, who passed away earlier this year. Dan was a  beloved husband, father, grandfather, pharmacist, State senator, and  mayor who spent his  [[Page S635]]  life dedicated to improving his beloved communities of Wethersfield and  Hartford.   Born in Hartford in 1922, Dan spent his childhood there, attending  Hartford Public schools, and graduating from the University of  Connecticut College of Pharmacy in 1943. Shortly after his graduation,  Dan enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was deployed to Paris, France, to the  217th General Hospital where he served on a medical train that carried  wounded soldiers from Germany to France. After his service in World War  II, Dan was honorably discharged in 1946 and returned to Hartford to  continue serving those within his community as a pharmacist.   Upon his return to Hartford, he met his wife Rose DiSilvestro. After  a short courtship, Dan and Rose would go on to marry, forming a  lifelong bond that would continue for 66 loving years and would see  them raise their daughter and son. Wherever he lived, Dan made a  lasting impression. He was always immaculately dressed even when mowing  the lawn, had a knack for building positive relationships with people  from all walks of life, and was a great conversationalist.   In 1948, Dan and his brother-in-law opened their own pharmacy in  Hartford, Rialto Pharmacy. Besides providing his knowledge and  expertise to the public, Rialto Pharmacy turned into a hub for the  area's Italian immigrants. Dan helped explain what each medication was  and provided flexible payment plans for any immigrants that needed it.  Dan's work in retail led him to pursue a second passion: retail  politics. Dan was tapped by the Hartford powerbrokers to run for the  city council. He was elected and became the youngest person to hold the  seat at the time. This began Dan's long career in service to the  community which would continue until his final days.   As a public servant, Dan was truly exceptional. After ably serving on  the Hartford City Council, Dan was elected to the State senate,  becoming public health chair where he championed the fluoridation of  drinking water and screenings for newborns. He later became chief of  the drug division for the State of Connecticut's Department of Consumer  Protection.   The Camillieres moved to Wethersfield in 1970 where Dan and Rose  raised their family. After Dan sold the pharmacy, he ran for the  Wethersfield Town Council, serving as secretary for 17 years and,  later, proudly served for two terms as mayor. Dan's trademark smile  presided over town meetings on building new schools, repairing old  buildings, and setting water rates. He was a regular sight at town  Memorial Day parades and was a mentor to many in politics, serving on  the Democratic State Central Committee.   I count myself as very lucky to have met Dan during my formative  years in politics. I was probably only 16 when I first shook his hand,  and I remember with perfect clarity being put in charge of campaign  lawn sign distribution as a 17-year-old volunteer for the Wethersfield  Democrats. It was in that job where I discovered that no one had more  friends--and more prime front lawn sites--in Wethersfield than Dan  Camilliere. He treated me wonderfully during those early years. To me,  he was the model American man--invested in his community, putting  service over self, modeling responsible entrepreneurship. I think I  decided to go into politics as a profession because of the example Dan  Camilliere set in my hometown.   In reflection of the loss of a decorated public servant, veteran,  husband, father, grandfather, and advocate for the communities of  Hartford and Wethersfield, CT, I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing and honoring the life of Dan Camilliere.                            ____________________
