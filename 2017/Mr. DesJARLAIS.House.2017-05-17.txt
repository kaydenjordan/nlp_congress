 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week and the courageous law enforcement officers who protect the great  State of Tennessee.   This week, we have thousands of police from across the country here  in Washington, D.C., to honor the valiant men and women in blue.   Among the 145 heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty in  2016, six hail from the Volunteer State. I would like to recognize  Special Agent Frazier with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation,  Sergeant Allred with the Livingston Police Department, Deputy Sheriff  Larnerd with the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, Officer Moats with  the Maryville Police Department, Sergeant Smith with the Memphis Police  Department, and Deputy Sheriff Sturgill with the Humphrey County Police  Department. I stand today to recognize their service and extreme  sacrifice.   Tennessee law enforcement officers often risk their own lives to  protect the safety of others. I honor and respect these brave men and  women, and I pray for them and their families.   Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, and throughout the year,  let us all remember to ``Back the Badge.''
