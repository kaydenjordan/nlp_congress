 Madam Speaker, since the Supreme Court overturned  Roe v. Wade last month, I have been overwhelmed with powerful  testimonies from my colleagues, family, and friends about their  reproductive health journeys.   They have shared their fears and concerns for their daughters,  granddaughters, and nieces now living in a post-Roe America. They  offered firsthand, intimate accounts detailing some of their personal  and sometimes painful experiences, wanting me to know  [[Page H6890]]  how critical it is for Congress to make Roe the law of the land.   These moving, shared memories spoke of very private life situations,  from sexual assault to personal family planning decisions. Yet, they  still told me in hopes of uniting in our fight against attacks by far- right extremists, extremists who are determined to strip women of their  reproductive rights and criminalize abortion care in all 50 States.   To these women, I say thank you. Thank you for your bravery, your  honesty, and your courage. Your stories were not told in vain and will  serve as inspiration to continue our fight to protect, defend, and  restore the right to decide.   Madam Speaker, a woman's fundamental healthcare decisions are hers  alone to make and should never be mandated by politicians.   This week, I stand proudly with my fellow House Democrats to reaffirm  my support, and I will vote for the Right to Contraception Act.   Reproductive healthcare should be available to everyone regardless of  where they live. This week, we are another step closer to restoring  critical access for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. These inalienable rights have served as a compass in guiding  us as we strive to create a more perfect Union.   Yet, recently, these rights have been the target of relentless  political attacks by a Supreme Court that has seemingly abandoned the  promises of our Constitution and by far-right extremists with a radical  agenda to dismantle decades of progress to take us back, back to a time  when people were ashamed and murdered because the person they chose to  love didn't have a certain skin color or was of the same gender and  back to a time when women could not access legal and safe reproductive  healthcare measures.   Today, I stand in solidarity with the millions of Americans who have  been angered by these disgraceful acts to say that I refuse to be taken  back because we have come much too far.                            ____________________
