 Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of seersucker  manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I wish everyone  a Happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American fashion has a  storied history dating back to 1909. Louisiana is proud to have played  an important part in introducing the country to seersucker apparel. The  first seersucker suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street  facility in New Orleans, LA.   This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has  been worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot  summer months. Mr. Haspel said it best, ``Hot is hot, no matter what  you do for a living.'' In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by  Members of this Chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I  proudly resumed this tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of  Representatives by designating Wednesday, June 11, as National  Seersucker Day. I have continued this tradition in the U.S. Senate and  wish to designate Thursday, June 13, as the sixth annual National  Seersucker Day. I encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to  commemorate this iconic American clothing.                            ____________________
