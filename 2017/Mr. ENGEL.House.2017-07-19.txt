 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, since 1968, oil pipelines that cross  international borders have been reviewed and authorized by the  Department of State. That is nearly 50 years. This is common sense.  After all, the State Department handles diplomacy, the State Department  manages treaties related to our international boundaries, and the State  Department is responsible for the security of pathways for our  pipelines.   But the bill we are considering today would shift decisionmaking  authority for those pipelines from the State Department, which is  equipped to handle all aspects of this issue, to Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, which isn't equipped.   So it just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. Chairman. It seems quite  arbitrary and quite foolish and moving in the wrong direction. This is  change for change's sake, and it wouldn't improve the process.   My amendment would prevent this mistake. It would simply ensure that  permitting authority for cross-border oil pipelines remains with the  Department of State. That is the permitting authority for cross-border  oil pipelines to remain with the Department of State.   In each of the past two Congresses, my friends in the majority  agreed. They passed substantially similar legislation to change the  cross-border pipeline permitting process, but they kept the final  approval authority where it belongs, with the Department of State.   Cross-border oil pipelines are matters of international diplomacy and  national security, and oversight should remain with the State  Department. The old adage, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' I don't  know what we are trying to do here. So I urge support for my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
