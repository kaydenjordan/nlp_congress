 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Protect and Serve Act, while rooted in laudable  goals, will not strengthen protections for law enforcement officers,  and it fails to make meaningful reforms that would improve police- community relations. Although I will not oppose the bill, I believe  that its consideration today reflects a wasted opportunity.   This legislation would create a new offense under title 18 of the  U.S. Code for the crime of targeting law enforcement officers. Current  law, however, at both the Federal and State level already makes it a  crime. It is not clear why this bill changes the law in any meaningful  way.   No Member of Congress questions the difficulty, danger, and stress  associated with being a police officer. A white paper commissioned by  the Ruderman Family Foundation reported that, last year, 129 peace  officers died in the line of duty--46 from shootings--with an  additional 140 reported officer suicides. Since the start of this year,  2018, at least 36 law enforcement officers across the United States  have died while on duty, with 24 of the deaths caused by gunfire.    Our hearts go out to the families of those officers who have lost  their lives in the line of duty.   As a result of the risk inherent to policing, there is no profession  more widely protected under Federal and State law than working in law  enforcement. All 50 States have laws that enhance penalties for crimes  against peace officers and, in some instances, crimes against the  broadly defined category of first responders.   In fact, section 2 of the bill clearly acknowledges that States have  primary jurisdictions for attacks on State and local police officers  and lays out very narrow circumstances where a Federal nexus would  exist. This presents an open question as to whether there would be any  instances at all in which the Department of Justice would exercise  jurisdiction under this legislation.   I would note that my own State of New York has four separate criminal  statutes addressing attacks on law enforcement officers. Moreover,  Federal laws already impose a life sentence and, in some circumstances,  even the death penalty on persons convicted of killing State and local  law enforcement officers or other employees assisting with Federal  investigations.   Simply put, the legislation under consideration today does not  improve upon this existing legal framework and does not provide any  more stringent punishment for anyone under existing law.   I want to be clear about the respect that we have for the difficult  work undertaken by our law enforcement professionals. While attacks on  law enforcement officials are completely unacceptable, the existing  framework for prosecuting these crimes is more than adequate at both  the Federal and State level. If it were not, I would be an ardent  supporter of this legislation.   Rather than advancing a bill that amounts to an empty gesture during  Police Week, the Congress should instead be focusing on real reform  measures that would actually protect law enforcement officers and first  responders.   We should act on the related problem of well-documented  unconstitutional policing practices in communities of color across the  United States that have eroded trust between those communities and the  law enforcement officials sworn to protect them.   The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department currently has 19  consent agreements with troubled police departments nationwide. Dating  back to the mid-1990s, every region of the country has suffered some  kind of high-profile incident.   Adding to community concerns are the increasingly well-documented  incidents of unjustified deadly force against unarmed victims in  police-civilian encounters. More than 50 percent of the unarmed victims  in these fatal encounters with police were people of color.   The goal of protecting police officer safety would be well served by  working to foster law enforcement reforms aimed at helping local  jurisdictions meet their constitutional obligation of fair and unbiased  policing and the resulting better trust between the communities and the  police in their midst.   As we have debated the Protect and Serve Act, I have been encouraged  by the expressed commitment by Chairman Goodlatte and the bill's  sponsor, Representative Rutherford, to work with me on bringing the  Judiciary Committee's balanced work on law enforcement accountability  out into the open with hearings and the introduction of legislation. We  should care equally about harms by and against police officers and  their impact on local communities.   We should care about the harms on local communities because of that  harm and also because of the fact that it undoubtedly leads to  distrust, which in turn leads to greater violence against police  officers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is the distinguished ranking member of the  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I stated at the outset of debate today, I will not  oppose this bill, although it merely duplicates existing law. It does  not add any protection for the police and does not increase any penalty  for someone who assaults a police officer. I am not interested in  falling into the trap of opposing what amounts to a messaging bill  brought forth during Police Week.   But I want to be clear that I believe H.R. 5698 represents a wasted  opportunity and appears tone-deaf to some of the real struggles  happening in communities across our Nation. This bill is being  contemplated at a time when our country is in the throes of a national  policing crisis, with a never-ending stream of police shootings of  unarmed African Americans captured on video.   Creating a new, yet superfluous crime for offenses committed against  law enforcement is not a great idea because it doesn't do anything. It  is particularly not a great idea when we are ignoring the other problem  that adds to the danger for police officers, which is the  disconnectedness and estrangement of many police forces from the  communities they serve.   I hope this Congress will now get back to the difficult work of  legislating meaningful solutions. I am encouraged that my Republican  colleagues have made a commitment to pursue balanced law enforcement  accountability reform with hearings and, hopefully, the introduction of  legislation. There is much work to be done.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from various civil  rights and civil liberties groups relative to this bill.                                   U.S. House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 15, 2018.      Re Coalition Opposition to H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve           Act of 2018.         Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the 28 undersigned       civil rights, civil liberties, faith-based, and government       accountability organizations, we write to urge you to oppose       H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018, which creates a       new crime for offenses that target law enforcement officers.        First, police already have substantial protections under       federal and state law, rendering this bill superfluous.       Second, this bill signals that there is a ``war on police,''       which is not only untrue, but an unhelpful and dangerous       narrative to uplift. And finally, bills similar to Protect       and Serve that have been introduced in states around the       country--so called ``Blue Lives Matter'' bills--appear to be       a political response to the growing national movement for       police accountability in the face of continued killings and       assaults of unarmed African Americans; therefore, this bill       is divisive and will have a negative impact on the       relationship between law enforcement and the communities they       serve.        i. Federal and state criminal laws already offer ample       protection to police officers.        Federal law already has extremely strong penalties for       people who commit crimes against law enforcement officers and       other public officials. For example, federal laws impose a       life sentence or death penalty on persons convicted of first-      degree murder of federal employees or officers, killing state       and local law enforcement officers or other employees       assisting with federal investigations and killing officers of       the U.S. courts. All fifty states have laws that enhance       penalties for people who commit offenses against law       enforcement officers, including for homicide and assault.        Moreover, there is no record that crimes against law       enforcement go unprosecuted or are otherwise treated       frivolously There is no record to suggest that prosecutors       are unwilling or unable to charge individuals with crimes       against law enforcement. In fact, crimes against police       officers are treated as among the most heinous criminal acts,       given the high degree of culpability and punishment attached       to such crimes.        II. The Protect and Serve Act does not advance any stated       policy goals, because law enforcement is not subject to       increasing or widespread attacks.        There is no doubt that police work is a dangerous       undertaking, but the reality is that there has been a       continuing decline in the number of officers killed or       assaulted in the line of duty over the last several decades.       In the past ten years, the number of officers feloniously       killed has fluctuated, yet not significantly increased or       decreased, as have ambush-style killings of officers. Given       these facts, this bill perpetuates a false narrative that       police are under increasing attack by their communities. Such       a message is unhelpful and unsupported.        Furthermore, the Protect and Serve Act does nothing to       meaningfully improve officer safety and wellness if that is       an intended policy goal. For example, it does not call for       support services, better training, improved safety measures,       increased supervision, or any of the other multiple measures       available to law enforcement that are widely accepted as       promoting officer safety and wellbeing.        III. Protect and Serve Act is polarizing and harms       community-police relations.        This bill is being contemplated at a time when our country       is in the throes of a national policing crisis, with a never-      ending stream of police shootings of unarmed African       Americans captured on video. Creating a new, yet superfluous,       crime for offenses committed against law enforcement is a       particularly disconnected and non-responsive policy choice.       Unfortunately, the Protect and Serve Act is similar to other       ``Blue Lives Matter'' type bills that create new criminal       offenses and penalty enhancements for crimes against police.        Collectively, these policy efforts, which have sprung up       amid the national call for police accountability, appear to       be a political response to the powerful activism of       grassroots movements that demand fair and constitutional       policing. Rather than focusing on policies that address       issues of police excessive force, biased policing, and other       police  [[Page H4014]]       practices that have failed these communities, the Protect and       Serve Act's aim is to further criminalize. This bill will be       received as yet another attack on these communities and       threatens to exacerbate what is already a discriminatory       system of mass incarceration in this country. Continuing to       undermine police-community relations in this manner sows       seeds of division, which ultimately threatens public safety       and undermines the work of law enforcement.        For the reasons summarized above, we urge you to vote       against the Protect and Serve Act as it comes before the U.S.       House of Representatives. There is no justification for       creating a new crime for offenses committed against law       enforcement. At a time when we need to foster healing between       law enforcement and our communities, we should not be       considering legislation which not only does nothing to       advance the goal of officer safety, but will further erode       the relationship between police and communities.
