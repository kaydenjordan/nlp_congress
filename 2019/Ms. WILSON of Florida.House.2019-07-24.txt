 Madam Speaker, as chairwoman of the Education  and Labor Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, I  rise today to urge my colleagues to unanimously pass the Butch Lewis  Act of 2019.   Failure to do so will have dire consequences for at least 1.3 million  Americans who did everything right. They put in decades of hard work to  ensure that their retirement years would be secure, so many of them in  physically grueling jobs in mining and construction and on ships and  the Nation's highways.   They often sacrificed wage increases, choosing instead a contribution  to their pension plans so that they could live in their golden years  with dignity and peace, a life well planned. Yet, after all of that,  retired people and future retirees are now living in fear of losing  everything they worked so hard for, and that is a shame.   Failure to pass this legislation also will have dire consequences for  tens of thousands of current workers and regional economies and could  cost American taxpayers between $170 billion and $240 billion.                                time  1715    There is a huge risk, so we must act now. This is an issue on which  both Democrats and Republicans should agree. This issue has no party,  no race, no religion. We are all in the same boat, and we are running  out of time.   Our failure to take action to protect retirees and American  taxpayers, our constituents, is not an option. It is a necessity, and  we must act now. There is no time to waste. Let's do the right thing  and pass the Butch Lewis Act of 2019 today.
