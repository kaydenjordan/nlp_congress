 Madam President, as I come to the floor today, we are  facing the prospect of a government shutdown. At midnight tonight,  funding runs out, the lights will go dark, and when that happens,  everyone suffers. No one wins; everyone suffers. I know that, and you  know that. Republicans know that, and we have offered a solution that  keeps the government open and extends the Children's Health Insurance  Program. As a doctor, I will tell you how valuable that program is for  children all across the country.   The House has already passed this legislation. Democrats in the  Senate have promised to block it, to stand in the way. Some have  actually been bragging that they can shut down the government and that  they want to shut down the government. Why would someone want to do  that? Well, here is what the New York Times said on its front page this  morning: ``Senate Shutdown Looms As Spending Bill Advances. House  approves a stopgap measure while Democrats dig in on immigration.''  That is the reason the Democrats want to shut down the government of  this entire country--over the issue of immigration. That is the New  York Times. Here is the Washington Post this morning: ``Shutdown looms  despite House action. Democrats tie `dreamers' to passage of budget  deal.''   There it is--the New York Times and the Washington Post. The minority  leader is forcing a shutdown over the issue of illegal immigration.  Democrats are ready to set aside all other issues, all other deadlines,  all other priorities.   Republicans have written and passed legislation that funds the  government. That means funding for our military, funding for our  veterans. It means funding for opioid treatment. It means funding for  everything that our Federal Government does now, and it funds the  Children's Health Insurance Program--not just for a week or a month, it  funds it for the next 6 years. This is a program that helped provide  medical care for almost 9 million children and needy families across  this country. There are more than 7,300 people in my home State of  Wyoming who benefit from this program. The money for this program is  going to start running out in some places very soon. The funding has  been in limbo since last fall. Some States are getting ready to send  letters to families--letters that tell those families their coverage is  going to be discontinued because this Senate didn't act.   States have been asking for certainty, and that is what we are doing  with this legislation. We are providing that certainty. We are taking  care of this program, which is so vital to families across every State  in this country, for the next 6 years. Democrats are blocking it. It  does seem to be that what they really want to do is make a political  point at the expense of everything else and everyone else. They are  willing to hold 9 million children and their families hostage to do it.  They are willing to hold hostage more than 300 million Americans who  could be harmed by a prolonged government shutdown. And it is all over  the immigration issue, as they talk about in the Washington Post and  the New York Times, an issue known as DACA, which stands for ``deferred  action for childhood arrivals.'' It was intended as a temporary program  to deal with the problem of people who were brought to this country  illegally when they were just young children. The program was set up by  an Executive action by President Obama. It wasn't done by law. It  [[Page S332]]  wasn't a bipartisan program. It was a Democratic President acting on  his own to kick the can down the road on this issue.    These issues related to immigration--and specifically illegal  immigration--are very tough, and we need to keep working toward a  solution. There are discussions going on every day within the Senate-- Republican and Democrat--between the House and the Senate. Why do  people want to risk blowing up these discussions?   Well, it seems that whatever we agree to needs to include important  matters of border security because, to me, border security is national  security, and that has to be included in that discussion and  deliberation. Any solution is going to have to include real fixes to  our broken immigration system so that we are not just having the same  argument again in a couple of years.   I think coming up with a solution like this does continue to take  time. Certainly, it is not something we can do by midnight tonight.  There is not even a good reason we need to rush to solve this problem  in a few hours. The fact is, no current DACA recipients are going to  lose their benefits under the program for 6 months.   Democrats are setting an arbitrary deadline of midnight tonight, and  they are threatening to shut down the government if their deadline is  not met. The legislation Republicans have offered takes care of one  emergency, and it gives negotiators time to reach consensus on this  separate and unrelated subject.   The continuing resolution already passed by the House provides  certainty to the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it allows us  the chance to work out some certainty on the DACA issue.   Some Democrats are saying that they refuse to do that. Well, it is  interesting because in 2013, the minority leader, Senator Schumer,  thought that a government shutdown at that time was a terrible idea. He  said:         No matter how strongly one feels about an issue, you       shouldn't hold millions of people hostage. . . . That's       wrong, and we can't give in to that.    He even spelled out the exact situation we are facing today. He did  it not just on the Senate floor; he did it on television in 2013. On  ABC's ``This Week,'' October 6, 2013, he said:         We believe strongly in immigration reform. We could say,       ``we're shutting down the government, we're not gonna raise       the debt ceiling, until you pass immigration reform.'' It       would be governmental chaos.    He is right. It would be governmental chaos. That is what Senator  Schumer said in 2013. Now he is trying to create exactly that same  governmental chaos that he described back then. It is for the exact  same reason that he talked about in 2013--the exact same reason that  the Washington Post cites as the reason on today's front page:  ``Democrats tie `dreamers' to passage of budget deal.'' In the New York  Times: ``Democrats dig in on immigration.''   What is different now is that Democrats have decided to stake all of  their political hopes on this one issue. They are holding America  hostage to do it.   Nobody benefits from the Democrats shutting down the government.  Nobody benefits from the game the Democrats are playing with the  security and the safety of American families. To me, it is  irresponsible for them to seek this shutdown over their agenda on this  issue of immigration.   We should pass the resolution that we have before us today. It is  time for Democrats to step back from the damage this shutdown will  cause to children, to our military, to our veterans, to our economy,  and return to the table to discuss the issues in which they are  focused.   I would recommend to my colleagues across the aisle that they follow  the advice from Senator Schumer in 2013: Don't play politics with  people's lives and create ``governmental chaos.''   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
