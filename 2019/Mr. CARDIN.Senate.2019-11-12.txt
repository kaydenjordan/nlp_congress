 Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce new  legislation called the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act. This legislation  sets an ambitious goal for accelerating the National Aeronautics &  Space Administration's (NASA) important, ongoing work on electric  aircraft propulsion and other technologies to be integrated on new  aircraft that are both cleaner and quieter. It challenges us to bring  about a transformational shift in our aviation industry to airplanes  that produce less greenhouse gas pollution and less noise: 50 percent  less by 2030 for regional transport aircraft and by 2040 for larger  aircraft serving transcontinental markets.   To achieve this goal, this bill proposes $1.2 billion in funding for  NASA over six years, with a ramp-up and then a decline in the annual  amounts. This funding will push NASA to accelerate its work and to  expand its collaboration with industry partners to get this done.   A growing number of Maryland citizens have expressed concerns about  airplane noise in their communities. We all want a thriving aviation  industry. Air travel is important to our way of life, and it is a key  sector of our economy, accounting for more than 5 percent of our total  gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014 and supporting more than 10  million jobs.   As air traffic volumes increase, however, we are increasing our  communities' exposure to noise pollution that has an adverse impact on  our quality of life. We need to find new solutions for supporting our  need for air travel while addressing these concerns about noise.   This legislation is also about finding new and innovative ways to  fight climate change. Today, transportation is the leading source of  greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Aviation accounts for  approximately 3 percent of all emissions. Three percent may not sound  like much, but consider that emissions from aviation are expected to  triple by 2050 and could account for as much as 25 percent of global  emissions. If we want to continue flying as we do now while protecting  ourselves from the perils of climate change, now is the time to act.   There is some exciting innovation happening right now, with companies  working on new, electric aircraft technologies--including work by  large, established companies and by smaller start-ups. We have heard  from some of them, and two things they have said stand out.   The first is that government-funded research undertaken by NASA is  critical to the development and testing of new technologies in electric  aircraft. The work that NASA does in collaboration with industry  partners addresses a wide array of technical challenges, like how to  make certain electrical components work at high altitudes and what  sorts of air frame designs might best enable new kinds of propulsion.   The second thing we hear is that if we do not act with greater  urgency, we risk allowing other countries to pass us by in a critical  industry. Europe, in particular, is moving quickly with strong  government investments in research, development, and demonstration of  new, electric aircraft technologies.   If we fail to match this ambition and build these skills at home, we  will be left out of this drive to innovate and our businesses and  workers will be at a competitive disadvantage. This will become even  more difficult as other countries embrace new, stricter standards for  aircraft noise and greenhouse gas pollution.   So there are a few reasons for the urgency behind this legislation.  It responds to the need to support research and development in our  aviation industry to remain competitive with other countries. It  responds to the need for new ideas to combat climate change. And it  responds to our need for air travel with fewer noise impacts on our  neighborhoods. This legislation calls on our innovative spirit to  produce a new generation of airplanes that are cleaner, quieter, and  ultimately more sustainable, both for our environment and our economy.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce new  legislation called the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act.
