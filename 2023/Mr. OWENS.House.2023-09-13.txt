 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of the House  Republicans' formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.   Several months ago, House Republicans returned oversight to the  people's House. We worked consistently day after day to make our  government more accountable, as promised in our Commitment to America.   Since January, concerning and credible allegations against President  Joe Biden have emerged, including abuse of power, obstruction of  justice, corrupt foreign business dealings, and influence peddling  schemes that led to tens of millions of dollars in the pockets of  several members of the Biden family.   I think we can all agree: Americans deserve accountability from our  President. Our impeachment inquiry is not a political ploy. It is an  opportunity for Congress to continue its duty, digging into the  potential of corruption and bringing facts to light.   The evidence is deeply troubling. Our witnesses have testified to  President Biden's involvement in phone calls, interactions, and dinners  that resulted in significant financial gains for his son and his son's  business partners.   The Treasury Department alone has more than 150 transactions  involving the Biden family and other business associates that were  flagged as suspicious activity by U.S. banks.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding me the time.   I rise today in full support of House Republicans' formal impeachment  inquiry into President Joe Biden.   Seven months ago, House Republicans returned oversight to the  people's House. We have worked consistently day after day to make your  government more accountable as promised in our Commitment to America.   Since January, concerning and credible allegations against President  Joe Biden have emerged, including abuse of power, obstruction of  justice, corrupt foreign business dealings, and influence-pedaling  schemes that led to tens of millions of dollars in the pockets of  several members of the Biden family--so far $20 million in profits to a  family that has nothing to do with our government at this point.   I think we can all agree Americans deserve accountability from our  President. Our impeachment inquiry is not a political ploy--it is an  opportunity for Congress to continue its duty, digging into the  potential of corruption and bringing facts to light.   The evidence is very troubling. Our witnesses have testified about  President Biden's involvement in phone calls, interactions, and dinners  that resulted in significant financial gains to his son and his son's  business partners.   The Treasury Department alone has flagged more than 150 transactions  involving the Biden family and other business associates as suspicious  activity by U.S. banks.   Even a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.   There is evidence that President Biden used his official office to  coordinate with Hunter Biden's business partners regarding Hunter's  role with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.   These actions, and more, raise serious questions about the integrity  of our highest office. Our government serves the interests of all  Americans, not just a select few.   Rest assured, House Republicans will follow the evidence wherever it  leads, and the truth will come to light.   I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Johnson, for yielding and  for bringing this team together tonight.
