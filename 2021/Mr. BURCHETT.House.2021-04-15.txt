 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Captain Patrick C.  Polis as Tennessee's Second District Veteran of the Month.   Captain Polis was drafted into the United States Army in 1966 as a  private, then attended Officer Candidate School and earned the rank of  second lieutenant. He served two combat tours of duty, Madam Speaker,  during the Vietnam war, rising to the rank of captain during the war.  He was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Army Commendation Medal  for his service.   He left the Army in 1974 and, regrettably, he attended the University  of Alabama, being we are from Tennessee, but he did graduate magna cum  laude in 1981.   Following a career in business management, he returned to school at  the Asbury Theological Seminary and earned a master's degree in  divinity in 1993. He used his religious education to serve as a pastor  at the United Methodist Church in Knoxville from 1993 to 2019. He also  served as chaplain for the Knoxville Police Department.   In 2019, he was inducted into the Army Officer Candidate School Hall  of Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia.   Captain Polis and his wife, Sandra, still reside in Knoxville. He  remains active in the veteran community through the Vietnam Veterans of  America, serving as president of the Captain Bill Robinson Chapter  1078.   I thank Captain Polis so much for his service to our country. It is  my honor to recognize him today on the floor of the House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, he is just an outstanding individual.                            ____________________
