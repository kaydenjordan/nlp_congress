 Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to  support H.J. Res. 37, a resolution disapproving of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation issued by the Department of Defense, the General  Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.   As is the case in so many of these rules and regulations, it has a  really nice name. It sounds really good--the fair pay and safe  workplaces rule--but the bottom line is, because of the substance of  this rule, it has become commonly known as ``the blacklisting rule.''  Had it been up to me, I would have called it ``the blackmailing rule.''  Let me explain why.   It requires contractors and subcontractors submitting bids on Federal  Government contracts to disclose any proven or alleged violations  within the last 3 years of 14 different labor laws, plus ``equivalent  State laws.''   Now, that may sound reasonable, but it is not. And it is entirely  unnecessary. Any competent purchasing manager--again, I come from the  private sector, and there are a lot of competent purchasing managers-- could readily obtain the information required by this regulation. And,  of course, any competent purchasing manager should also always be  evaluating the qualifications, integrity, and the past performance  record of any kind of potential suppliers.   This rule also has the very real potential of subjecting perfectly  innocent contractors to blackmail and extortion tactics during union  contract negotiations.   In case anyone thinks I am overstating this threat, listen carefully  to the following quote from one union describing an ``ideal message''  their union president should convey to a general manager of a business  negotiating a union contract:         Putting it plainly: unless you settle this strike within       the next few days, and the union withdraws its charges--    Those would be those allegations; unless the union withdraws those  charges--       you are likely to be marked as a ``repeat labor law       offender,'' one of the highest categories of wrongdoing under       the President's Order. Check this out with your hotshot legal       team.    This union message goes on:         Counting all of its divisions, this corporation has federal       contracts in the hundreds of millions. Do you really want to       jeopardize this pot of gold to save a few hundred thousand       dollars to the union contract?    This is the kind of negotiating tactic that illustrates exactly how  this regulation would be used as a form of federally sanctioned  blackmail. There would be no due process for contractors wrongly  accused. There would be no way for them to defend themselves or avoid  being blacklisted.   As if the blackmail potential of the rule isn't bad enough, the Obama  administration admitted that the final rule would cost at least $398  million to comply with every single year. And except for the benefit  that extortion leverage provides to unions, I can think of no financial  benefit to taxpayers or our economy--and neither could the Obama  administration, as they were unable to quantify any financial benefit  for this rule in their regulatory filings.   In addition to the $398 million annual regulatory cost, the agencies  themselves detailed the following regulatory burdens:   The rule will affect over 24,000 contractors. Industry estimates are  even higher.   The rule imposes costly reporting requirements on small businesses  that many simply cannot bear.   And it also reduces the availability and increases the price of much  needed supplies and services, including to our military.   Others have pointed out even more problems with the rule. For  example, it does not define what the ``equivalent State laws'' are that  have been included in the disclosure requirement. Also, the definition  of a violation that is reportable is incredibly broad. It is not  limited to government contracts and includes pending and other nonfinal  disputes--in other words, mere allegations of wrongdoing.   This, in particular, is a slippery slope. For example, in fiscal year  2016, the National Labor Relations Board received over 21,000 unfair  labor practice charges, but more than half of those were withdrawn or  dismissed, and less than 6 percent resulted in a formal complaint by  the NLRB. Also in fiscal year 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission received over 91,000 complaints but issued a ``determination  of reasonable cause'' in only 3,113--about 3.4 percent of those--and  filed enforcement suits in only 114--about 0.1 percent of the 91,000  complaints that were filed.   Various studies report that it costs $2 trillion per year to comply  with Federal Government regulations. That is $14,800 per family per  year. Of course, no one writes a check for $14,800. Instead, those  costs are realized in reduced opportunities, higher prices to  consumers, and stagnated wages and benefits for hard-working Americans.   Economic growth is the primary component of a solution for many of  our country's problems, yet Washington continues to stifle growth by  adding layer upon layer of regulation. The blacklisting rule is just  one harmful example.   Fortunately, last October, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern  District of Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction the day  before this rule was set to go into effect. The judge issuing the order  noted there was merit to the claims that this rule violates statute,  exceeds Executive authority, and is unconstitutional. The court found  that letting this rule go into effect would cause ``irreparable harm.''  But the case is still pending. Until we act to decisively repeal this  rule, a significant burden hangs over our country's contractors and  suppliers.   Through the use of the Congressional Review Act, we have the  opportunity to reduce that regulatory burden and repair a small portion  of the damage done by President Obama's regulatory overreach.   We owe it to the American people and American businesses to start  providing them with regulatory relief.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes to disapprove and repeal this very  harmful, very costly, and completely unnecessary rule.   With that, I yield the floor.
