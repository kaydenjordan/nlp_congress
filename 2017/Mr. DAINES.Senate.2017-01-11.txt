 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, today is the day when we will begin to  repeal and replace ObamaCare. Repealing and replacing this disastrous  law is one of the top jobs that citizens elected us to get done. In  many ways, it is why Donald J. Trump will be sworn in next week as the  45th President of the United States.   I think what is most helpful is to recap why repealing ObamaCare is  so important to so many American families. Montanans were promised that  with this bill you could keep the health plans that you liked. That was  wrong and millions of Americans lost their plans.   Montanans were assured that coverage under ObamaCare would be  affordable. For millions of Americans, for thousands of Montanans,  nothing could be further from the truth. Montanans were guaranteed that  ObamaCare would lower health care  [[Page S247]]  costs. We witnessed premiums skyrocket since ObamaCare's  implementation.   Finally, Montanans were assured that ObamaCare would create more  competition in the marketplace, but now Americans in one-third--one- third--of the counties across our entire country have but one plan to  choose from. Let's not forget, supporters of ObamaCare paid for these  failed programs by raiding Medicare of over $700 billion. Seniors and  people with disabilities in Montana and across our country deserve much  better.   Over the past several years, I have heard from countless Montanans  about how ObamaCare has failed them. Take, for example, Terry from  Choteau, MT, who wrote:         We just got a letter from Pacific Source that our premium       is going up $260 per month and our deductible is going up to       $1000. This is $1025 per month and a $7500 deductible for 2       healthy adults [with] (no preexisting conditions). For a       ranch family this is a huge hit, especially in these times       with low commodity prices. Something needs to change.    Jeff from Kalispell, MT, said this:         I am married with 5 children. I live in Kalispell. I bought       Blue Cross Blue Shield of MT PPO Gold insurance plan #104 for       the 2016 year. My premium was $1,477.28 per month. In early       November 2016 [2 months ago] I received notice that my same       plan would increase to $2,820.00 per month. That is a 91%       increase. . . . If keeping the same rate hikes, my insurance       will be $5,500 in 2018, then $10,000 per month in 2019.    That was from Jeff in Kalispell, MT.   I have Anthony from Bozeman. That is my hometown. I went to college  in Bozeman. A fellow Bozemanite writes this to me. He says:         I have never been able to afford Obamacare insurance. With       quotes of over $400 a month for a single healthy male I found       it easier to pay the penalty. So now not only can I not       afford to have medical insurance but I am getting fined for       not making enough money to pay all of my bills and give a 20%       tithe to the medical insurance industry.    Here is another Bozemanite, Kenneth. He writes this:         For 2014 we had med insurance from Pacific Source for my       wife which was adequate and filled our needs. For 2015       Pacific Source canceled that policy, citing Obamacare rules,       and best alternative was 150 percent more expensive.        We did it for 6 months and then canceled; it just took too       much from our budget. The IRS fined us $584 for missing       insurance for 6 months. We are doing without coverage for       2016 again because of the outrageous costs for this high-      deductible policy. Our IRS fine will probably be about $1500.    The list and the heartfelt stories go on. They all share one common  theme: ObamaCare is not working. This ObamaCare hardship did not just  impact Terry, Jeff, Anthony or Kenneth. Montanans, on average, face  premium increases between 27 and 58 percent just this last year. This  is year-over-year numbers.   Last evening, I had a telephone tele-townhall meeting where thousands  of Montanans joined me, thousands across the entire State. Every corner  of our State was on the call last night. I asked a simple question. I  asked: How many of you would want to repeal ObamaCare? An overwhelming  82 percent said they support the repeal of ObamaCare.   The reason why is quite simple. They did not get what was promised to  them on this very floor of this Chamber back in 2010. ObamaCare is  failing because it is a massive intrusion by the Federal Government. It  is centered on raising taxes, huge spending increases, and heavy  regulations from Washington, DC. It is straight from the Big  Government, Washington-knows-best playbook, and that is what happens  when Congress doesn't listen to the American people.    You know, Montanans have very good horse sense. They know when  somebody from Washington, DC, shows up and says: We have this 2,700- page bill from Washington, DC, led by Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and  President Obama--Montanans know better. They know they should run for  cover.   And that is exactly what ObamaCare is and what is happening now to  the American people.   ObamaCare can't be tweaked. It has to be repealed. It needs to be  replaced with better reforms. And we need to make sure that we do as  much as we can as soon as we can so folks aren't having to deal with  ObamaCare for much longer. People are hurting. It is time to replace  it.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with us. Don't use scare  tactics.   Unlike 2009, we are focused on a path forward that conveys practical  benefits, not hopeless ideology. I ask them to accept the reality that  ObamaCare is irreversibly flawed, it must be repealed, and it must be  replaced with effective policies.   I know there are comments out there about a plan and what is next.  Well, for me, it is not that complicated. It is getting the costs down.  You have heard the stories. The American people are asking for relief.   For the generation of Americans just now entering the workforce--and  that would be my kids; they are just entering the workforce--health  care costs have increased by 77 percent. This is outrageous. It is  unacceptable. These are supposed to be the easiest people to insure,  yet ObamaCare seems intent on placing health care out of their reach.   I believe there are policies that are fundamental to any health care  system, and it will be working and fighting for provisions that provide  access to affordable insurance, that protect people with preexisting  conditions, that allow young adults to stay on their parents' coverage  until age 26, that return decisionmaking authority back to the States,  that will eliminate these harmful Washington regulations and mandates,  that will empower the American people with greater access to health  savings accounts.   That was part of the health care system that was actually working  pre-ObamaCare, and ObamaCare moved in and slashed health care savings  accounts.   We need to make it easier to purchase health insurance across State  lines, encourage and incentivize work among able-bodied Americans, and  uphold fiscal responsibility by preserving and protecting Medicare for  our seniors.   I very much look forward to working with the nominee for the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. I served with  Dr. Price in the House. There is not a better leader at this point in  time in our Nation's history to assume the leadership of the Department  of Health and Human Services. He is a doctor, has served in Congress,  and will be able and ready to lead from day one.   We will work together to find the best solutions, Montana solutions,  solutions that work for our respective States, for people like Terry,  for Jeff, for Anthony, for Kenneth, and for the thousands of other  Montanans who have been harmed by this law.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
