 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  several of my constituents who have gone out of their way to make a  positive impact during the coronavirus pandemic.   Over the past few months, it has been easy to feel surrounded by  nothing but negative news. In an effort to highlight the good news that  we weren't seeing enough of, I started a social media campaign called  PA-15 Cares. PA-15 Cares highlights all of the volunteers who have gone  above and beyond during this pandemic to lend a helping hand, to help  their neighbors in need, and to brighten the spirits of all those  impacted by COVID-19. Today, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a few  examples of those who rose to the occasion during this pandemic.   Many chose to make masks for frontline workers, including high school  student Morgan McConnell of Cambria County. While her school was  closed, Morgan made good use of her time and made more than 500 masks  in just the first week. It is her way of helping others, and she has  given many of the masks to local hospital employees free of charge.   Selfless small business owners, even those who may be struggling  financially as a result of the pandemic, have stopped to ask: How can I  help?   Rick Ardini, owner of Rik-N-Nik's restaurant in Ebensburg, has  provided countless meals for those out of work, children, the elderly,  and anyone else who needed them. He also gave great advice: ``Talk to  each other, learn about each other, spend some time, and play some  games. Be a family. Slow life down.''   Another small business which also happens to be in Ebensburg has been  providing a critical service for the first responders. SERVPRO  partnered with the Dauntless Volunteer Fire Department to provide free  cleaning and sanitation services for emergency response vehicles.   The Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania have also stepped up to give  back to their community. They have started a Hometown Heroes program to  give free cookies to frontline workers, including medical  professionals, first responders, nursing home staff, the Army National  Guard, and more.   Lastly, I would like to highlight Samantha Schrecengost of  Punxsutawney. Samantha, a Senior Corps volunteer, and the folks at  Community Action started a Phone-A-Friend program for seniors. Due to  COVID-19, many elderly Americans have been cut off from loved ones, and  isolation can take a mental and emotional toll. Volunteers of the  Phone-A-Friend program call seniors two to three times a week to check  in, see how they can be helpful, and just share a few minutes of  friendly conversation with our seniors.   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged to see how the communities in my  district have come together in such an unprecedented time of crisis to  find a way to support one another.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the  30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark  piece of legislation for people with disabilities.   More than 55 million Americans have a disability, whether it is  physical, learning, cognitive, or other.   There are many ways we can support this community and providing job  opportunities is a great place to start. Many Americans with  disabilities struggle to find employment, despite the wealth of skills  they have to offer, and a job can provide independence, economic self- sufficiency, and pride.   We must also support students with disabilities. I am proud to be a  cosponsor of the IDEA Full Funding Act, a bill that creates a 10-year  plan to hold the Federal Government accountable for the full 40 percent  of funding for special education promised by Congress in the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975.   Mr. Speaker, the Americans with Disabilities Act is an incredible  milestone for legal protections for Americans with disabilities, but we  can still do more to fight stigmas, defy prejudice, and empower those  with disabilities in our everyday lives.                            ____________________
