 Mr. President, this week is a great week for the State of  Texas and for the Federal judiciary because this week we will be  confirming two exemplary judges from the State of Texas to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit: Texas Supreme Court Justice Don  Willett and former Texas Solicitor General Jim Ho. These will be the  11th and 12th court of appeals nominees who we will have confirmed this  year--a modern-day record.   Indeed, I looked up just the other day the number of assigned slots  on the Federal courts of appeals. It is 179. This means the 12 that  have been nominated and confirmed this year represent roughly 7 percent  of the appellate bench. That is a powerful accomplishment for the first  year of this Presidency, a powerful accomplishment for this Republican  majority in the Senate, and a powerful legacy that will extend decades  into the future, protecting our constitutional rights, protecting the  Bill of Rights, protecting the First Amendment, free speech, religious  liberty, protecting the Second Amendment, and protecting all the  fundamental liberties we enjoy as Americans.   With respect to Don Willett and Jim Ho, I have known both of them for  decades. Both are close friends. Both are brilliant lawyers. Both have  spent decades earning a reputation as principled constitutionalists who  will remain faithful to the law and will not impose their own policy  preferences from the bench.   Beyond that, both Don and Jim are testaments to the American dream.  They have both taken different paths to the Fifth Circuit, but both of  their stories encapsulate what is so incredible about this great  Nation.   Justice Willett was born Donny Ray Willett--his birth certificate  doesn't say Donald; it says Donny Ray--in July of 1966, to an unwed  teenage mother. He was a sickly and frail newborn who was not even  expected to survive until Christmas. But he was nursed back to health  and then adopted by an incredible couple who were unable to have their  own children.   Justice Willett grew up in a double-wide trailer in a small town of  just 32 people, surrounded by cotton and cattle. His town had a cotton  gin and a Catholic church. That is about it.   Justice Willett suffered heartbreak early in life. His father passed  away at age 40, just 2 weeks after Justice Willett turned 6 years old.  He was  [[Page S7992]]  raised by his widowed mother, who waited tables at the local truck  stop. She would leave the trailer for her 6 a.m. shift before Justice  Willett even woke up in the morning. He would wake himself up, get fed,  dressed, and then catch the bus to a neighboring town to go to school.   Justice Willett was the first person in his family to even finish  high school, let alone go to college and then to law school. He has  four degrees. He got his bachelor's from Baylor with a triple major in  economics, finance, and public administration. He then received a  master's degree in political science, a law degree, and an LLM degree  from Duke.   After law school, he clerked on the Fifth Circuit--the court on which  he will soon be serving--for Judge Jerre Williams. Then, after 2\1/2\  years at a large law firm, he decided to dedicate his career to public  service. He worked for Gov. George W. Bush in Texas and then for  President Bush in DC. He and I worked closely together in that regard.  After his time in DC, he happily returned to the great State of Texas  to serve as the deputy attorney general for legal counsel. Don served  alongside me, working under Greg Abbott, then the attorney general. We  had offices just down the hall from each other.   In 2005, he was appointed by Gov. Rick Perry to serve as an associate  justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and he was reelected by the people  of Texas to that court in 2006 and again in 2012.   I can't tell you how proud I am to see Justice Willett confirmed as a  judge on the Fifth Circuit and to see his lifetime of service continue  in this new arena.   Jim Ho took a different path to the Fifth Circuit, but his story is  just as powerful as an example of the American dream.   Jim was born in Taipei, Taiwan. He immigrated to the United States  with his family when he was just 1 year old. For the first few years of  his life, his family lived with relatives in Queens, NY. Jim learned  English watching Sesame Street. His family then moved to Southern  California, where he attended high school and then went on to college  at Stanford University.   In 1996, Jim enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where  he graduated with high honors in 1999. He then moved to Texas for the  first time in his life, accepting a clerkship in Houston with Judge  Jerry Smith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit--again,  the same court on which he is preparing to serve. It was during the end  of his clerkship in Houston that he started dating his law school  classmate, now his wife Allyson, a Houston native and another dear  friend of mine.   In 2000, Jim moved to Washington, DC, to join the law firm of Gibson  Dunn & Crutcher. In 2001, he joined the U.S. Department of Justice as a  Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,  working under now-U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. Later that year, he  joined the Department's Office of Legal Counsel. After 2 years at OLC,  he came here to the Senate, where he served as the first chief counsel  of my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, John Cornyn. After 2  years as Senator Cornyn's chief counsel, Jim went to clerk at the  Supreme Court for Justice Clarence Thomas.   At the end of the clerkship, Jim and Allyson finally fulfilled their  dream of going back to Texas, where Jim rejoined the law firm of Gibson  Dunn & Crutcher in Dallas.   Then, in 2008, my tenure as solicitor general of Texas was coming to  a close. Attorney General Abbott had told me that if I were going to  leave, I would have to find my successor. I picked up the phone and  called my longtime friend, Jim Ho. I talked to Jim about coming to  succeed me as solicitor general. Jim agreed to take on the job and did  a remarkable job as the chief appellate lawyer for the State of Texas,  representing Texas before the U.S. Supreme Court and all the State and  Federal appellate courts.   Jim served as solicitor general from April 2008 until December 2010,  when he returned to Dallas and once again rejoined Gibson Dunn as a  partner. A few years later, he became cochair of the firm's appellate  and constitutional law practice group. Jim has done many extraordinary  things, but nothing more so than marrying his wife Allyson, who is,  like Jim, a Supreme Court advocate and one of the most talented  constitutional lawyers in the country.   Allyson is my former law partner. When I left the job of solicitor  general and went to the Morgan Lewis law firm, I promptly recruited  Allyson to come lead the Supreme Court practice with me. I am proud to  say that over the past 5 years, Jim's wife Allyson has argued more  business cases before the U.S. Supreme Court than any lawyer in Texas.   Jim has become a pillar of the legal community in Texas, and the  outpouring of support he has received demonstrates that. To take just  one example, I have a letter from Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas  and a former member of President Obama's Cabinet and, incidentally, the  Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate who Senator Cornyn defeated in  2002. By any measure, he is a strong and prominent Democrat in the  State of Texas. Mr. Kirk writes:         The last time Texans got to fill a seat on the Fifth       Circuit, it was Judge Gregg Costa, who this body confirmed by       a well-deserved unanimous vote. As a lifelong Democrat and       devoted member of the Obama cabinet, I ask you to give Jim Ho       the same unanimous consent.    I agree, and I hope our Democratic friends in this body will set  aside the partisan rancor that has so characterized this year and will  listen to the words of one of their own, a member of Obama's Cabinet,  and a prominent Democrat from Texas, urging that Jim Ho be confirmed  unanimously.   Sadly, Senate Democrats insisted on and provided a party-line vote in  the Judiciary Committee. It is my hope that this full body will  demonstrate more wisdom and less partisan animosity than the Judiciary  Committee Democrats demonstrated.   Both Jim and Don, I am convinced, will make excellent judges on the  Fifth Circuit. They are brilliant. They are principled. They are humble  men of deep character. They love their families. They are wonderful  fathers. I am confident that not only will they faithfully follow the  law in the court of appeals, but I predict Jim Ho and Don Willett will  become judicial superstars. They will become jurists to which other  Federal judges across the country look. Their opinions will be cited  heavily. They will be followed in other courts of appeals. Their  careful and meticulous analysis and their fidelity to the law will be  held up as exemplars for judges across the country to follow. That is a  great accomplishment for the Federal judiciary, a great accomplishment  for the Senate, and a great week for the State of Texas.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Wyoming.
