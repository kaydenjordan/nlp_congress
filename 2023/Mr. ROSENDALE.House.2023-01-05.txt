 Madam Clerk, I rise to nominate the name of Byron  Donalds as Speaker of the House of Representatives.   Let me begin by stating that it is an absolute privilege to be here,  standing and serving with each and every one of you. I know we have  differences of opinions, and I know we have differences of agendas that  we would like to pursue, but I will tell you that we are all  representing the United States of America in the best fashion that I  know that we truly believe in. So thank you, and it is a privilege.    When I walk out every evening from the Longworth Office Building, I  will tell you that as I look back on the Capitol with the lights  gleaming upon it, that I recognize the honor, the privilege, and the  responsibility that each one of us has taken on to be in this place  that we are right now and the obligations that we have to the districts  that we represent back home.   It is an incredible privilege, but it is also an incredible  responsibility. I do not take it lightly, and I know that no one in  this room does.   We are participating in a system that has endured 247 years, through  drought and through flood, through world wars and through a civil war.  In some way, we return to this place year after year to serve the  people of the United States of America. Unfortunately, over the past 15  years, the process that we use has been dramatically broken.   The voices that were sent here to equally--equally--represent each of  the 435 districts across this Nation have become diminished. This  through the consolidation of power into the hands of the Speaker and a  fortunate few who happen to serve on the Committee on Rules which  controls every aspect of legislation that travels through this body.   The debate and the discussion have been all but eliminated, and the  balance of us are left to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' Those are our  options. That is what has led to the disintegration of the  relationships that we see across this floor. That is not equal  representation which is guaranteed by our Constitution and expected by  our constituents.   We have had more discussion and debate over the last 3 days than I  have participated in on this floor for the last 2 years. It is healthy.  It absolutely promotes the collegiality that everyone is striving to  obtain. We are having discussions not just within our own party, but  amongst each other as we walk around and start planning for the  legislation that we will need to address over the next 2 years in the  118th Congress that sooner or later--yes, sooner or later--we will  begin to function as.   Those are the good days. And guess what? Our constituents think, as  they watch us on C-SPAN today, that this is how every day functions.  They think that this is how every bill gets addressed in this body.   They will be shocked to learn, the ones that you have not disclosed  this little nasty secret to, that unfortunately, that is not how it  works around this place. That under the current rules and under the  current leadership construction, that on fly-in days, typically Monday,  at the beginning of the week, the leadership on both sides of the aisle  negotiate a number of bills, 15 to 20 pieces of legislation, that one  Democrat and one Republican stand on this floor, they discuss  momentarily, and then they say the magic words, Without objection, we  will pass this by unanimous consent.                                time  1530    There are two people standing on the floor passing pieces of  legislation that oftentimes are the naming of buildings that don't  really bother anybody or affect one's life but, in many circumstances,  spend millions and tens of millions of dollars that the taxpayers are  obligated to cover, and their Representative was not even here to vote  upon it.   That, my friends, is wrong. It is wrong. So, yes, we need to have  change. We need to fix this broken system.   Several of us have taken it upon ourselves to fly in and object to  those very bills, not because we are objecting to the bill, but just to  force them to be brought out into the daylight so that everyone can  hear about those bills, to force people to come out and vote up or down  for those bills as their constituents believe that they are doing right  now.   That is just one of the little secrets, and it demonstrates again how  broken this system is.   Last summer, we began to negotiate, a group of us, in good faith, a  list of changes, amendments to the rules of this body, not to empower  ourselves, not to bring personal benefit to ourselves, but to empower  you and you and you, Maxine, and you and you and everyone sitting in  this Chamber equally.   There are no rules. I did not use anyone's name. Everyone should be-- excuse me. Maxine.   The CLERK. Members direct your remarks to the Chair, please.    I will, Madam Clerk. Thank you.   So that everyone will have equal representation, equal representation  for the districts that elected them. These are not radical deviations  from the norm. These are a restoration of the rules so that this place  can function properly.   Things like single-subject legislation that most statehouses utilize  right now so that we don't have 4,000-page documents that we are given  a matter of hours to review that are filled with many subject matters  that are trillions of dollars in cost; rules like germaneness so that  you can actually bring an amendment forward on the floor as long as it  pertains to the bill that was originally being addressed; an open rule  process, again, so that each individual here can participate in the  thing that we were sent here to do, to help collaborate and craft  legislation and work together, that is what we were sent here to do.   These are commonsense amendments that would restore the process and  give each of us an equal voice.   This is how we are going to secure the border that everyone now, I do  believe, has recognized that there is a problem with.   This is how we are going to regain energy dominance again, which is  not just an economic issue. It is a national security issue.   This is how we are going to reduce the inflation rate, by working  together, but we cannot call it working together if you cede all of  that power to the hands of a few.   Hoping for this change will not create this change. Change is  uncomfortable. We understand that. It is not unachievable, and we must  make change in this broken system. We must.   The current leadership that is in place will continue and support the  use of earmarks in this body, and that is the golden trail to  corruption. It is a way to buy votes and spread money around this body  from places outside of this city that leads to bad legislation and bad  decisions.   The current leadership, I was told, I should not be so concerned with  these suspension bills that get passed every week because now they have  made an amendment. We keep hearing about these amendments and the  concessions that were made. The concession was that they will not ask  for anything to be suspended that costs more than $100 million.   Now, I don't know about the neighborhoods that you live in, but in  the neighborhood that I live in, $100 million is a lot of money.   My constituents expect me to vote upon $100 million bills and $80  million bills and $10 million bills so that they know what in the world  is in them and what is going on, and they do not expect them to be  passed by unanimous consent with no one on the floor.   I made a living developing property, and as many of you probably  know, it takes a while to take a piece of ground from bare earth to a  community.   My mother, God rest her soul, came out to one of my projects. I had  just opened it up, and it had been 2 years since the time I had bought  the property. By the time we went out, I had a nice entrance built. The  streets were built, and the streetlights were there. They were just  starting to build homes.   She said: My goodness, Matthew. You must really be pleased to finally  see  [[Page H26]]  your project coming up out of the ground.   I said: No, Mom. Actually, I am pleased that everyone else can see it  because I saw it 2 years ago when I first walked out there.   Well, I have a vision for this place, that we can restore regular  order so that each of us may have the ability to represent our  districts and our constituents equally as we move through this process.  Then, at that time, we will be able to call it truly the people's House  again.   I have been here just 2 years, and I have watched Byron Donalds  during that time and previously as he proudly served in the Florida  Legislature. I can tell you this: He is a man of intellect; he is a man  of integrity; and he is a man that I am proud to nominate as the next  Speaker of the House of Representatives.   The CLERK. The gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) is  recognized.
