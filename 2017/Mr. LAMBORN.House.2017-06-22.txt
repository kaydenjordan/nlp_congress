 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gosar). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 392 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1654.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) to preside over  the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1440                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1654) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to coordinate  Federal and State permitting processes related to the construction of  new surface water storage projects on lands under the jurisdiction of  the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture and to  designate the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency for permit  processing, and for other purposes, with Mr. Poe of Texas in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, the House meets for the second day in a row to consider  another infrastructure bill that has come from the House Natural  Resources Committee and its Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans,  of which I have the honor of chairing. My subcommittee has a strong  infrastructure agenda, already hearing testimony on a number of bills  aimed at improving our Nation's infrastructure and advancing an all-of- the-above energy and water strategy.   Many of our bills, including H.R. 1654, which we are considering  today, apply simple solutions to expedite maintenance or construction  of water and power infrastructure throughout the Nation. It is vital to  rebuild our Nation's infrastructure, and one of the biggest roadblocks  is the excess of regulatory red tape that applicants have to wade  through before they can even move one shovel of dirt.   In Colorado, where I live, a water project was recently completed  where water owned by the city of Colorado Springs was taken from a  reservoir 60 miles to the south to the city of Colorado Springs for  treatment and distribution. The project took 6 years to build. But  before that could happen, there were over 200 permits and applications  that had to be granted, any one of which could have stopped the whole  thing, and that cost $160 million in application fees, lawyers' time,  and mitigation. That took 8 years. That took longer than the project  itself.   Congressman Tom McClintock's Water Supply Permitting Coordination  [[Page H5083]]  Act seeks to cut regulatory red tape by creating a one-stop-shop  permitting process to the Bureau of Reclamation in order to streamline  the current multiagency permitting processes for new or expanded non- Federal surface storage facilities.   However, this bill is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Mr.  McClintock's bill allows water storage project sponsors the flexibility  to opt out of this process and, instead, choose the agency and process  that works best for them.   While the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act will allow for  much-needed relief in the sponsor's State of California, this bill will  benefit States throughout the West, including my own State of Colorado.   Mr. McClintock's bill goes hand-in-hand with language in the WIIN  Act, which was signed into law last year, that supports additional  water storage capacity across the West.   I commend my colleague, Mr. McClintock, for bringing up this  commonsense piece of legislation that simply looks to cut regulatory  red tape for water storage projects that are essential to survival in  the West.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my House colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from the great State of California (Mr. McCarthy), our  majority leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work on this.   Mr. Chairman, I always get excited when I hear people speak on the  floor, especially when they come from California. Mr. Chairman, it is  always interesting when people want to tell us what is the best way to  make things happen.   It is interesting, in California, when the legislature was controlled  by Democrats, they did waive CEQA, but it wasn't for a dam. It wasn't  to prepare for a drought we were going through. But they waived it  twice, all for sports. One was in San Francisco, and one was in L.A. It  seems odd, but sometimes people have their priorities, I guess, not in  the right place.   Now, Mr. Chairman, California and the West recently endured the worst  drought in our century. Though it was the worst drought, this was not  our first. We have faced droughts for generations, and each time the  rain and snow came back and delivered the water that we needed to  survive.   Just like previous years, this past winter was a godsend to  Californians; the wettest on record. Living in the naturally dry region  that we do, you would think it would be common practice to prepare for  inevitable times of drought by capturing water when Mother Nature  blesses us with the rain and snow. But the fact is that we aren't doing  enough to store the water we do get for the times we don't get it.   So what can we do now? What would help the people in our district and  across California and across the West to prepare for future droughts  that we know are coming?   We should start by building more dams and reservoirs.   So what is stopping us?   Well, some is a ridiculous permitting process that forces us to wait  and wait and wait when actually we should be acting.   Just look at history. Take the High Savery Dam in Wyoming. It took 14  years to permit the project but only 2 years to build it. It was  finished in 2004. Think about how much the world has changed in those  14 years of time.   In 1990, somewhere around 5 million people had cell phones and only  about 15 percent of Americans owned a computer. By 2004, when the dam  was finished, about 180 million people had cell phones and 62 percent  of Americans owned a computer. In 1990, the most popular movie was  Total Recall. By 2004, we were already on to Shrek 2.   Looking forward to my home State, we can't wait 14 years after  starting the permitting process to finish our projects. The Temperance  Flat Reservoir, once fully operational, can provide enough water to  meet the needs of 172,000 households for an entire year. Finishing the  Sites Reservoir proposal could provide 2 million California homes with  enough water for a year. That is an astounding number. But, Mr.  Chairman, I am sure on this floor we will hear those 2 million should  actually wait. But I guess for a baseball stadium, no need to wait.    So fixing the process isn't just about saving some headaches or a few  hours of time. This is about making sure millions of people in  California and across America have the water they need and deserve.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Tom McClintock for this  legislation. Fixing this permitting process for water storage is more  than just common sense. It is about making us a nation of doers again  to get the American what they actually need.   Mr. Chairman, Mr. McClintock has worked. He has tried to work with  both sides of the aisle. He has been through this process.   But you know what?   Mr. McClintock has been home. He has been listening to his  constituents on both sides of the aisle that don't have water. We have  been through these droughts. We know these droughts will come again,  and they have only been worse in the last couple of years.   Why?   Because of what has been imposed by the Federal Government. Even in  the years where we have more than 170 percent of snowpack, we don't  keep the guarantee of 100 percent of the water.   So as the environmental laws continue to take water away and put it  out to the ocean instead of providing for the fruits to be grown and  the fiber across our country and provide the water for the citizens of  California, we should build more dams, and they should not have to wait  14 years with only 2 years to build it. We can do better, we should do  better, and we will do better when we pass this bill.                                time  1500     Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership on the Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee.   Mr. Chairman, droughts are nature's fault; they happen. But water  shortages are our fault. Water shortages are a choice that we made a  generation ago when we stopped building new reservoirs to meet the  needs of a growing population.   The unvarnished truth is we will not solve our water shortages until  we build more reservoirs, and we cannot build new reservoirs until we  overhaul the laws that have made their construction endlessly time- consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive.   For years, the Natural Resources Committee has heard testimony from  frustrated water districts unable to navigate the Byzantine maze of  regulations and the phalanx of competing, overlapping, duplicative, and  often contradictory Federal agencies.   After years spent trying to satisfy one agency, another suddenly pops  up to claim jurisdiction with an entirely new set of demands in an  often endless permitting process, despite the fact they are studying  the same project in the same location with the same data. The burden  this places on our ability to deliver water for the next generation is  crushing.   The leader mentioned the High Savery Dam in Wyoming--14 years to  permit, only 2 years to actually build. The Federal Government has  literally studied four storage projects in California nearly to death.  One project, the Sites Reservoir, had over 50 alternative  [[Page H5085]]  locations studied, and there is no end in sight for the feasibility  process on that potential reservoir. Similar delays have prevented the  expansion of the Shasta reservoir for 39 years.   Mr. Huffman tells us that no dam permits have been denied because of  this. The problem is very few dam permits have been approved because of  this. And the costs are caused by cost-prohibitive delays in time that  run up millions and millions of dollars in costs until the agencies  simply throw up their hands and give up.   H.R. 1654 will bring order from this bureaucratic chaos. It  establishes a framework in which Federal agencies with permitting  responsibilities for the construction of new reservoirs must work  together, coordinate their schedules, share data and technical  materials, and make their findings publicly available. The end result  will be fewer delays, more efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and,  ultimately, more abundant water supplies.   It is modeled on the Obama administration's approach to constructing  new electric transmission lines to accommodate its reliance on wind and  solar generation. There is nothing new in this process. In October of  2009, the administration formed the Interagency Rapid Response Team for  Transmission, a consortium of nine Federal agencies to coordinate a  single unified environmental review document for each project analysis.   It is also modeled on provisions sponsored by House Democrats that  expedited improvements on the Hetch Hetchy dam serving the San  Francisco region. This bill simply says, if there is a potential  project on Interior or Agriculture Department lands, then the Bureau of  Reclamation will be the coordinating agency for the permits. That is a  one-stop permitting agency.   It will call together all of the agencies, the local and State  jurisdictions and tribal governments of our Indian nations, establish a  timeframe for studying decisionmaking, and then coordinate all the  reviews and analyses and opinions and statements and permits or  licenses and other Federal approvals required under Federal law.   It also requires transparency, assuring that all data is available to  the public online so the science guiding these decisions can be  rigorously scrutinized by all interested parties.   It also allows water agencies to fund the review process if Federal  funding isn't provided, removing one of the excuses that Federal  agencies have made in slow-walking or stalling project reviews.   I want to make this very clear: It does not bypass or alter or waive  any environmental or safety laws. It doesn't waive CEQ or ESA or NEPA  or any other law. It simply says the process needs to be more  efficient, and the government agencies should coordinate and cooperate  with each other rather than talking past each other as isolated and  often inscrutable fiefdoms.   Five years of drought in California brought entire cities within  months of exhausting their water supplies. The epic drought has now  been followed with the wettest year on record, and we have helplessly  watched our dams spilling millions of acre-feet of water to the ocean  because we have no place to store the excess for the next drought.   Perhaps that is nature's way of reminding us that, if we didn't store  water in wet years, we won't have it during dry ones, and the economic  and social devastation have been immense.    The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  California.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, if you want to misuse our environmental  laws to block any new water storage, well, then you should vote against  this bill. We will continue to see increasingly severe water shortages  and spiralling water and electricity bills.   But if you want to preserve our environmental laws, you ought to be  supporting this bill because it places those laws back within a  workable and practical framework, and it places our society back on the  road to an era of abundance where our children can enjoy green lawns  and gardens, brightly lit homes, and abundant and affordable groceries  from America's agricultural cornucopia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Gosar), who is also a subcommittee chairman on the  Committee on Natural Resources.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I close, I do want to point out a bit of circular reasoning that  my friend from California is using. He says that it is not the  environmental regulations or the red tape that slows down the  construction of dams, it is the high cost. But what he doesn't  recognize or is not willing to admit is that the high cost is caused by  all the red tape and environmental regulations. So that is arguing in  circles, and I don't accept that.   Again, I commend the bill's sponsor for this bill that looks to  promote additional and much-needed water storage throughout the West.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  part B of House Report 115-186.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment made in order under the  rule.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Page 4, line 2, after the period insert ``Such term shall       also include State-led projects (as defined in section       4007(a)(2) of the WIIN Act) for new surface water storage       projects in the States covered under the Act of June 17, 1902       (32 Stat. 388, chapter 1093), and Acts supplemental to and       amendatory of that Act (43 U.S.C. 371 et seq.) constructed on       lands administered by the Department of the Interior or the       Department of Agriculture, exclusive of any easement, right-      of-way, lease, or any private holding, unless the project       applicant elects not to participate in the process authorized       by this Act.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank my subcommittee  chairman, Mr. Lamborn, for his leadership on this, and Mr. McClintock  for bringing the bill in chief forward here that I am asking to amend  today.   This amendment ensures that State-led projects can also enjoy the  coordination that the bill itself will do, State-led surface storage  projects such as Sites Reservoir. These will be defined in the WIIN Act  and they will be eligible under H.R. 1654's permitting.   Doing so enables States to direct their own resources towards  infrastructure needs at lower cost and improves States' ability to  partner with the Federal Government on projects that provide both State  and Federal benefits.   Adopting this amendment to include State-led projects will allow the  development of more water infrastructure more rapidly and at no  additional cost to the Federal Government. For example, in my home  State of California, the voters have approved billions of dollars  toward infrastructure projects such as Sites Reservoir--not too far  from my neighborhood--which will include enough water storage for  millions more people in our State.   Now, if you know the saga of Sites Reservoir, the locals there will  tell you they have been talking about it, studying it, poking it,  prodding it for about 40 years. Bureaucracy plays a major role in that.   So the bill in chief is not looking to change environmental laws or  get rid of environmental laws. Indeed, my colleague on the other side  of the aisle talked about having an honest discussion in this area.  Well, an honest discussion would show that the bill in chief is one  that is merely coordinating. It is not changing the Water Quality Act.  It is not changing NEPA, CEQA, or anything else, other than getting  these people all in one room to coordinate at one time.   Yes, we, indeed, have costs involved, because people give up, whether  it is  [[Page H5089]]  private sector money or the people that pass bonds as State voters give  up after a while because they don't think their dollars are actually  getting to the projects, when they hear needless, endless delays, when  we have this game of bureaucratic badminton being played by various  agencies knocking one idea to another, taking years of time and  additional costs, especially those surprise ones at the last minute.   Lake Oroville is in my own backyard. Now, what we have seen there  since the crisis happened with the breakage of the spillway is that  coordination under an emergency, where, even though there are some  trying to throw roadblocks in there, people recognized coordination was  needed, because when 188,000 people have to evacuate an area due to  some unknown factors with how the infrastructure is holding up, then  they saw the need to fix it.                                time  1530    And the spillway at Lake Oroville is going to be fixed pretty rapidly  over a 2-year period and made usable in this short amount of time. So  that is how coordination can work to get a needed project done when it  can be an emergency.   What we need to quit doing is waiting for emergencies like this and  on levee projects when we know for years and years that levee  projects--highways, bridges, other infrastructure that have this  bureaucratic badminton played when people are trying to get these  projects done--need to be coordinated. That is what this bill does.   My amendment adds to it, again, an important ability for State  dollars under State-led infrastructure projects to be included in that.  So I think it makes a heck of a lot of sense and will help our voters  like in California and others around the country to be able to enjoy  that coordination.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. LaMALFA. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. LaMALFA. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    We support the amendment. It improves the bill by  expanding opportunities for increased water storage across the West. I  urge its adoption.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
