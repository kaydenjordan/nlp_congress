 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy  of a friend and one of Alaska's truly unique individuals, the mayor of  Nome, Richard Beneville. We lost the mayor last month when he succumbed  to pneumonia in the town he called home for more than 32 years.  Richard's life story was colorful. He left New York City as a young man  struggling with alcoholism and searching for a new life. Alaska was as  far away as he could go, and he often said Alaska saved him. He spent a  few years in Barrow before moving to Nome in 1988, and I think it is  fair to say that the town has never been the same since. His career  began on Broadway, and Richard channeled his creative energy to inspire  youth and adults in Nome through the Nome Arts Council. He directed  more than three dozen plays, including ``The Sound of Music,'' ``Music  Man,'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' and inspired generations in the  community to appreciate the stage.   Ever the showman, Richard was a tireless ambassador for Nome and  Arctic tourism. He founded Nome Discovery Tours in 1994, and he never  missed an opportunity to promote Nome and the surrounding region and  its rich history. Watching him entertain a tour group with tales of  Nome's early gold mining days, while he demonstrated how to pan for  gold, audience captivated, was a real treasure.   For the past 4\1/2\ years, he served as mayor of Nome, and there was  no better cheerleader for this remote community. Some of my colleagues  may recall running into him in the halls of the Hart and Dirksen  Buildings, wearing his signature ``Hello Central' knit hat, a Port of  Nome, vest and always sporting his I love Nome! button. Never shy,  Richard would greet Senators, staff, and visitors alike, quickly asking  them how their day was and what they were up to as he worked the halls  and made new friends. His friendly banter and genuine interest in  people was refreshing in an environment all too often filled with  hustle and tension.   For those of you who have never had the fortune to visit Nome, there  are only three ways to get there from Anchorage--airplane, boat, and  dog sled. Nome is 2000 miles closer to the North Pole than to New York  City, and in 2016 when the Crystal Serenity called on the Port of Nome  during its maiden voyage from Seward to Manhattan, the mayor was there  to greet these intrepid Arctic adventurers. I had the privilege to  travel with Richard to many Arctic conferences, and it was a joy to  watch as he shared his vision for Arctic tourism and a positive future  for this fascinating and challenging part of the world.   The mayor was a passionate champion of the Iditarod and I last saw  him on Saturday, March 7, in Anchorage at the ceremonial start of the  race. He had just been released from the hospital, having persuaded his  doctors and nurses that the ``show must go on'' to be there for the  festivities.   He loved people, the arts, flowers, and above all, Nome to the end.  His passing is a true loss for my State. I will miss his boundless  enthusiasm and his trademark greeting to all he ran into, ``Hello  Central!''                            ____________________
