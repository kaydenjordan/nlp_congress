 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have been working incredibly hard  alongside my colleagues to make sure we have an open, bipartisan  appropriations process and to keep this process moving, which is why I  am glad to say that in a moment, I will call up and ask for unanimous  consent to adopt by voice vote the first series of amendments to the  appropriations minibus.   These are amendments that will further strengthen a package of  bipartisan appropriations bills--bills, I should mention, that passed  our committee unanimously. We worked hard in committee to ensure this  package reflects input from Members across the aisle and across the  country.   While we may not agree on everything, the votes we are taking now are  an opportunity for Members on both sides to provide additional input on  this bipartisan package, debate those ideas, and put them up for a  vote. This is an important step forward as we work to pass this package  in the Senate, keep the appropriations process moving, and in the  coming weeks, deliver absolutely essential supplemental funding as  well. I am delighted that we are going.  [[Page S5160]]    I will turn it over to my vice chair who has been working alongside  of me to get this moving.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to commit H.R. 4366 and amendment No. 1205 be withdrawn.    Mr. President, as provided under the order of October  24, I call up the following amendments to Murray-Collins substitute  amendment No. 1092 en bloc: Moran No. 1250, Daines No. 1185, Sullivan  No. 1216, Sullivan No. 1221, Peters-Cornyn No. 1283, Rosen No. 1117,  Schatz No. 1120, Booker-Tuberville No. 1175, Tillis-Welch No. 1264,  Reed No. 1202, Britt No. 1270, Kelly-Tillis No. 1116, Hirono-Moran No.  1113, Warnock-Cornyn No. 1351, Smith-Rickets No. 1134, Rosen-Crapo No.  1220, Cardin No. 1277, Padilla No. 1140, Shaheen No. 1131, Klobuchar- Moran No. 1203, Kelly No. 1133, Padilla No. 1139, Ossoff-Braun No.  1255, Merkley-Crapo No. 1352, and Stabenow No. 1115.    I know of no further debate on those amendments.   Vote on Amendment Nos. 1250, 1185, 1216, 1221, 1283, 1117, 1120, 1175,  1264, 1202, 1270, 1116, 1113, 1351, 1134, 1220, 1277, 1140, 1131, 1203,                      1133, 1139, 1255, 1352, and 1115     With that, I ask that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I now ask that following disposition of  the Looman nomination, the Senate vote on Vance No. 1210 and, finally,  that there be 2 minutes for debate, equally divided, prior to each  amendment vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, this amendment would create an  automatic CR, which would make it way harder for Congress to actually  get its job done and fund our government. It would allow Members,  particularly those who are fine with obstructing, to ignore their  responsibility to fund our government and deliver for the communities  that they represent; it will hurt Agencies and programs people count on  by freezing funding levels; it will weaken our ability to deliver  funding for Ukraine and Israel, for childcare and so much else; it will  allow critical laws to lapse and potentially create chaos on this  floor.   Let's be clear. No one wants to avoid a shutdown more than I do. But  the way that we avoid a shutdown is by Members of Congress sitting down  and working together to prevent one, responsibly, by funding our  government, not by abdicating Congress's responsibility to control the  powers of the purse and avoiding the hard work of compromise by putting  funding on perpetual autopilot.   But I am afraid that is exactly what this amendment would do, and it  would create a new, unproven fast-track process, allowing six Senators  to completely ignore our committee process, completely ignore regular  order, and take over the floor and force the Senate to consider  appropriations vehicles of any and all sizes with little or no scrutiny  or input.   We need to get our jobs done. We need to pass our appropriations  bills. That is what we are working on, not set ourselves on a path to  endlessly kick the can down the road. I strongly urge my colleagues to  vote no on this amendment.   I yield the floor.               Vote on Amendment No. 1232 to Amendment No. 1092
