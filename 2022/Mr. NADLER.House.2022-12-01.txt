 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1499, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6878) to address the health needs of incarcerated women  related to pregnancy and childbirth, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 6878.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6878, the Pregnant Women in Custody Act, is  bipartisan legislation that would help ensure that women receive the  pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care that they need while in  Federal custody.   The number of women incarcerated has grown significantly in recent  decades, and most women are incarcerated during their reproductive  years. There are an estimated 58,000 admissions of pregnant women into  jails and prisons every year.   It is vital for the health of these women and their newborns that  they have access to appropriate healthcare, nutrition, and postpartum  recovery support.   In addition, research shows that Black women already have a 43  percent higher risk of miscarriage than White women. Since women of  color are disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system, a  lack of support and care for pregnancy and reproductive health while  incarcerated can lead to increased risk of negative pregnancy outcomes.   By establishing a national standard of care for incarcerated pregnant  women, as well as by prohibiting the use of restrictive housing and  providing for transfers to residential reentry centers for women with  high-risk pregnancies, this bill will help protect the health and  safety of pregnant women and their newborns. Restrictive housing and  solitary confinement have been called psychological torture, and the  use of solitary confinement can further damage the physical and mental  well-being of pregnant women.                                time  1315    In addition to setting a national standard of care, this bill also  requires the Government Accountability Office to study the services and  protections provided to pregnant women incarcerated at the State and  local levels.   The impact of incarceration of pregnant women is complex and far- reaching. The reality of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum recovery  while incarcerated requires significant mental and physical health  interventions and broader protections in order to address the trauma  both mothers and newborns experience.   This bipartisan bill is supported by a broad range of organizations  across the ideological spectrum, including the  [[Page H8690]]  American Psychological Association, the National Alliance on Mental  Illness, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, Dream  Corps, the Vera Institute for Justice, R Street Institute, and the  American Conservative Union.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague, Representative Karen Bass, for  her leadership on this issue and on so many criminal justice issues  throughout her career in Congress. I thank her bipartisan cosponsors  for introducing this important legislation with her.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6878 is bipartisan legislation that would support  the health and safety of women in Federal custody by establishing a  national standard of care and prohibiting the use of restrictive  housing for incarcerated pregnant women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation. I also want to take this opportunity to express my dual  feelings--on the one hand, the sponsor of this legislation, Ms. Bass of  California, will no  [[Page H8693]]  longer be with us in the next Congress, which is, on that level,  unfortunate. On the other hand, the reason she won't be with us is  because she is the mayor-elect of Los Angeles, and that is not  unfortunate. I am very happy about that, but I have mixed feelings  because we won't be seeing her here again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
