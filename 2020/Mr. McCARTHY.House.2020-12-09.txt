 Mr. Speaker, having served as both the majority and  minority floor leader, I have understood the pressure of the job.  Scheduling the floor, handling procedural fights, and getting  legislation passed is truly 24-hour, 7-day-a-week work. And on the  other side of the aisle, no one knows that better than Shuwanza Goff.   It has been my privilege to get to know her during her 12 years on  the Hill, the last 7 of which as floor director for Leader Hoyer.  Without a doubt, she has done this job as well as or better than any  staffer I have ever known. She has put in her time and effort to build  strong working relationships with Members and staff on both sides of  the aisle.   Shuwanza has earned our respect because of her skills, her work  ethic, and her expertise on the floor. There are times I have lost the  debate because of her expertise.   I certainly like to think that we have tested her abilities over the  past 2 years with some of our motions to recommit. There are times that  I have heard, and it has been conveyed to me, the differences of  opinion with me in the strongest of terms, but never did she ever do it  in a personal way.    The House is better because of her service.   But even if we haven't made her job easy, we always knew we had to be  prepared, because we saw the impact that her expertise could have.   Many a time to many of us, people across this country ask if we have  friends on both sides of the aisle. I refer to Shuwanza as my friend.  She will be my adversary, but she is my friend. She has my respect  because she earned it. She has my friendship because she has earned it.  She has respect from both sides of the aisle because of the way she  carries her life and the character of who she is.   She has left an impression on this side of the aisle, and I can tell  you she has certainly left an impression on this institution.   We get elected and we come here, but her character is one of having a  servant's heart and of caring for this Nation. There are things that  divide us in our philosophy, but we are not divided because we are  Americans. We do not divide ourselves because we care to serve.   I know Shuwanza believes in a more perfect Union because of the  devotion that she has had and despite the times and frustration that  this body can give, but she does it because of what she believes in.   Finally, Shuwanza, speaking as a father, I know that you have brought  immense joy and pride to your parents and to your sister along the way.  I know they have rooted for you and watched every step of your career,  a career that has seen you walk in the well of the House of  Representatives on a daily basis and serve as a trusted adviser to our  Nation's leaders, and you have done it well. My hope for you is that  you do not give that up, that you continue to serve the Nation that you  love so greatly.   On behalf of myself, my team, and the Republican Conference, I want  to  [[Page H7061]]  say thank you. There are times I wouldn't say thank you that you beat  me on the floor, but I respected how hard you worked at it. I am a  better Member because you made me prepare more, knowing you were on the  other side.   I thank you for your counsel and for your friendship. You will be  missed on this floor, but we will still be friends.                            ____________________
