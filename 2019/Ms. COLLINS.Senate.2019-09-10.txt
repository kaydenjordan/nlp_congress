 Madam Speaker, in 1819, young Henry Bailey opened a  general store on Ingraham's Wharf in Portland, ME, and began auctioning  salvaged goods. Two hundred years later, the F.O. Bailey Company is  still going strong, and I am delighted to congratulate this outstanding  Maine business on its bicentennial anniversary.   The company was purchased in 2014 by the husband and wife team of  real-estate broker David Jones and antiques professional Nancy McInnis- Jones, who continue the two-century tradition of integrity, expertise,  and experience.   Founded 1 year before Maine achieved statehood, F.O. Bailey  exemplifies the traditions of entrepreneurship, innovation, and hard  work that define our State. In 1827, the Bailey Company diversified by  manufacturing rolltop desks and display cabinets and moved to a larger  facility on Exchange Street. Despite national and local economic ups  and downs and the disruption of the Civil War, the auctioneering  business was a solid foundation for growth.   In 1866, the booming city of Portland was devastated by the Great  Fire, the worst urban fire in America to that date. Among the many  impressive buildings destroyed by that catastrophe was the Bailey  store.   Henry Bailey died the following year, and the company was carried on  by his son, Frederick Orville Bailey. As Portland rose from the ashes  with a new downtown of brick, stone, and cast iron, F.O. Bailey led the  family business into a new era of growth.   Today, under the leadership of David and Nancy, F.O. Bailey's real  estate and antiques and auction divisions provide 38 good jobs. It is  significant that, in addition to antiques, the company promotes  contemporary Maine art and quality handcrafted furniture.   The F.O. Bailey Company was founded when Maine was just coming into  its own. The optimism and confidence of that time continue today, and I  wish this remarkable company great success in the years to come.                            ____________________
