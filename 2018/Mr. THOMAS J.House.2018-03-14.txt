 ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my district is home to  over 75,000 veterans, and I am proud to represent an area that has one  of the highest concentrations of veterans in the country.   With that distinction comes a duty to fight on their behalf to ensure  that the VA is functioning and funded at levels deserving of their  sacrifice. As a member of the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee  on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, I am  proud that we have secured increases in funding for VA programs that  are important to my constituents.   On a daily basis, my staff and Members of Congress' staff across this  country try to help veterans navigate the VA bureaucracy. It is no  secret that the claims process at the VA is far too slow, so we all try  to help veterans with their claims and expedite the process when  possible. We have won countless battles against the system, and we have  helped constituents far and wide to get the care and benefits they  deserve.   One of our responsibilities as Members of Congress is to listen to  these veterans when they tell us there is still more work to be done to  help fix the system. In 2016, a group of veterans brought a disturbing  problem to my attention concerning individuals who were deliberately  stealing money from veterans and the VA without fear of criminal  punishment. I started to hear story after story about people  advertising their so-called services to veterans, claiming that, for a  fee, they can help veterans obtain certain VA benefits or expedite  existing claims with the VA.                                time  1530    There are two problems with this. Number one, it is illegal for  anyone who isn't approved by the VA to charge fees for helping veterans  with their claims or appeals; and two, often times these promises of  assistance are empty and never followed through with. Unfortunately,  there are no penalties for breaking this law.   One local VSO explained to me at length how these scammers  specifically target senior veterans in low-income housing communities,  almost as a rule, because they consider those veterans to be the most  vulnerable and most likely to fall victim to their schemes. I have  heard countless accounts of these con artists going into assisted  living facilities, rounding up all the veterans and coercing them all  to apply for benefits they don't even qualify for.   When I hear people are taking advantage of these heroes and making a  quick buck off of them, it makes me sick, as I am sure it makes all of  us sick, because it is wrong and it needs to stop.   The reality is that this isn't just happening in my backyard. It is  happening in every one of our districts. These con artists are getting  away with it. I refuse to let this fraudulent scheme against some of  the most respectable people in our Nation continue.   Without a Federal criminal penalty, we have been unable to prevent  these financial predators from preying on our veterans and defrauding  the VA.   My friend and fellow Congressman, Democrat Ted Deutch from south  Florida, joined me in introducing this bipartisan bill to penalize  these scammers who make their living stealing from our veterans. Our  bill would give prosecutors and law enforcement the tools they need to  appropriately penalize these predators by imposing a hefty fine,  imprisoning them for up to 5 years, or both.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this commonsense,  bipartisan bill, and I hope that the Senate will act quickly to send it  to the President's desk.   These criminals need to pay the price for these actions. Our veterans  have done everything to protect us and our way of life. Now it is our  duty in Congress to make sure that they are protected as well.
