 Mr. Speaker, there is a saying: No man left behind; no  woman left behind. That is the commitment and that is a promise that we  made to the interpreters, to our Afghan partners, that we would not  leave them behind in the dust to be slaughtered by the Taliban. They  have a bull's-eye on their back. I have talked to them. I have talked  to our Special Forces whom they protected in this 20-year war. They  will be killed if we don't get them out of there.   Our Defense Department is on a fast track. That entire country--the  Taliban is on the offensive--is likely going to fall to the Taliban.  The decision to withdraw completely has been made, but we have to be  prepared for the aftermath. A refugee crisis and humanitarian crisis  will occur. The women in Afghanistan will be tortured and will not be  educated. We had a school of 200 women--girls--that were blown up.  Little girls were blown up. That, Mr. Speaker, is the Taliban. That  will be the same fate for our Afghan partners if we don't get them out  of there now.   They have 700 now coming to Fort Lee in Virginia. I urge the  administration to get the rest of them. There are 9,000 interpreters,  probably 20,000 total when it comes to our Afghan partners. I ask the  President to please get them out before they are killed by the Taliban.    Our ISR, or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance,  capability is wiped out. The Bagram air base fell to the Afghans in a  very sloppy transition, and the Taliban is going to take that over,  too. Now we can't see what China, Russia, and Iran are doing. We can't  see what ISIS and al-Qaida are doing. We are going dark, Mr. Speaker,  because we can't see anything on the ground.   But I can tell you this: The moral obligation we have to save those  whom we promised we would protect has to be fulfilled, and that is  precisely what this bill does, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Judiciary Committee for bringing  this forward.
