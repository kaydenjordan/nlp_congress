 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding me time.   Mr. Blumenauer and I have jointly led and sponsored this bill for  four Congresses. Although we disagree about recreational marijuana--he  supports it; I oppose it--as a physician, I realize that if we are  going to have medical marijuana legal, as the gentlewoman from Michigan  says, in over three dozen States, we really ought to do research on it  to see what it is used for and what it can't be used for because, Madam  Speaker, many claims are made about it. Some are legitimate; some are  illegitimate.   The American public, if we are to have this product legal in 37  States now, they deserve to know whether it works for what the claims  are made.   What this bill does is simple. It makes it easier to do rigorous  medical research, the same type of research we expect to be done on any  of the drugs that are sold as medicines in this country. That is what  this bill does.   It has been a long time coming. I thank the chairman for bringing  this bill out. Hopefully, it gets across the finish line in both Houses  and goes to the President's desk for signature.   Madam Speaker, the American public deserves to know what medical  marijuana is useful for because, again, for anyone who has one of the  conditions that it might be useful for, this could be a godsend. For  other conditions where it is claimed, it will be found to be not  effective, but the American public needs to know.   The Medical Marijuana Research Act is the way to get this done.  Modernize our research methods. Bring them up to the scientific  standards we use for every other type of medication in this country  that is sold as a drug.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 5657.
