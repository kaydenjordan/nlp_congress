 Mr. Chair, credit is one of the most powerful devices of  our financial system. It was designed over time by modern societies. In  some countries, credit is simply not available to those who need it the  most: people at the bottom of the ladder.   In the United States, we have got a well-developed system where  credit is available no matter how bad their credit rating might be.  That is, it was available until the Dodd-Frank regulation created the  CFPB.    In the Second District of New Mexico, 50 percent of the homes are  mobile homes or manufactured housing. Dodd-Frank immediately began to  show that they had no clue about how rural societies worked, and put  into place regulations that choked off the access of most of our  homeowners to manufactured housing.   That wasn't enough for the CFPB. They began then to set forward  qualified mortgages, which then choked off traditional mortgages to  many people in the Second District of New Mexico.   Many people in New Mexico will buy their first mobile home and they  will live in that. Then, over their life, they will buy 8 or 10 more.  Then they sell those one at a time, usually to people who can't get  credit any other way. The CFPB simply shut that down. Now, seniors with  less income, but people who need the loans the most, have one more  source of credit dried up to them.   The rules that affect the rural mortgages and small businesses were  so punitive that the economy in New Mexico has never come back. It is  not just that the Financial CHOICE Act is the right choice in the rural  areas, in our areas; it is the only choice.   I support H.R. 10, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  bill.
