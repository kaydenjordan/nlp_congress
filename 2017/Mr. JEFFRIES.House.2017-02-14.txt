 Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is a separate  and coequal branch of government. And yet, House Republicans refuse to  investigate the swamp of corruption that is percolating at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue.   Michael Flynn has resigned in disgrace. And yet, the Trump  administration has jeopardized our national security by continuing to  play footsie with Vladimir Putin and the Russians. House Republicans  have done nothing.   It is impossible to figure out where the Trump family business ends  and the White House begins, yet House Republicans have done nothing.   Seventeen different intelligence agencies have concluded that the  Russians interfered in the election to help Donald Trump, yet House  Republicans have done nothing.   It is time for House Republicans to investigate this White House and  stop acting like puppets of the Trump administration. The American  people deserve answers. What exactly did Donald Trump know, and when  did he know it?                            ____________________
