 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen  and Congressman Albio Sires for their incredible work on this issue and  all of their passion. I also thank the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee  chairman, Congressman Duncan. I know how much he has worked on the  issue of Venezuela, and Latin America also.   The people of Venezuela are in dire need of humanitarian assistance  to endure critical food and medicine shortages. The desperation,  oppression, and violence in Venezuela really are reaching a breaking  point.   Three out of four Venezuelans have lost significant weight during the  last year due to food shortages.   In 2016, the nation suffered a homicide rate of 91.8 per 100,000  people, making Venezuela the second most violent country in the world  outside of a war zone.   We have reason to believe more than half of Venezuelans want to leave  their home country.   Last year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said  Colombia should expect an ``avalanche'' of Venezuelan refugees, an  influx that  [[Page H4500]]  could complicate this critical time for Colombia's own peace agreement.  Meanwhile, President Maduro's government is taking increasingly  antidemocratic actions in violation of Venezuela's own constitution.   Since Venezuela's supreme court attempted to dissolve the country's  legislature in March, the Venezuelan people have sustained massive  protests, leading to a brutal crackdown from government security  forces. The best outcome for this political crisis is a Venezuelan  solution: a peaceful return to free and fair elections.   At the same time, the United States has a responsibility to work  alongside our allies at the Organization of American States and the  United Nations to hold Maduro's government accountable and to provide  humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela.   Last week, President Trump authorized sanctions against the members  of Venezuela's supreme court who attempted to shut down the  legislature. While U.S. sanctions against individuals in the Maduro  regime are justified, sanctions work best when implemented  multilaterally. More importantly, unilateral actions are no substitute  for collective, coordinated pressure.   The OAS has scheduled a meeting of foreign ministers on the situation  in Venezuela to take place on May 31 here in Washington, D.C. This  meeting presents an opportunity to work with our partners and  Venezuela's neighbors to support a return to democracy and respect for  human rights. I hope Secretary Tillerson will represent the United  States at this meeting and demonstrate our Nation's support for the  Venezuelan people.   One of the reasons that I chose to join the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee when I was already part of the Foreign Affairs Committee  is because I believe that there are many things that happen in Latin  America that don't get the attention that they deserve here in the  United States.                                time  1945    It is amazing to think that there is a human rights crisis going on  right now in our own Western Hemisphere. Of course, there are many  challenges around the world. We know that because of the war in Syria  and the unrest in the region, Europe, over the last few years, has  faced its largest migration crisis since World War II.   There are challenges with human rights and freedom in every continent  just about. But we have to make sure that we attend to the things that  are happening in our own backyard, so to speak.   So I thank each of you for being here tonight to speak up on this  issue of human rights in Venezuela and the crisis that they are going  through.
