 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nadler  for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on this issue.   Also, I have just got to acknowledge and thank Congressman   David  Cicilline for his steady and strategic leadership in bringing this bill  to the floor. I, too, was at the first press conference with our great  warrior,   John Lewis, and it has been so exciting and uplifting to see  the progress and the process in bringing this bill to the floor.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, as a cofounder of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, along with  our dear former colleague Congressman Barney Frank, I rise today in  support of H.R. 5, the Equality Act. This critical bill, of course,  would end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans once and for all.   Now, as an African American woman, it is my moral responsibility to  fight discrimination wherever and against whomever it raises its ugly  head. The Equality Act will ensure that there is clear, lawful  protection for LGBTQ Americans under the Civil Rights Act. What is  more, this bill will ensure that no one lives in fear because of their  gender identity or sexual orientation.  [[Page H3945]]    Let me be clear. It is un-American that in 30 States it is still  legal--mind you, legal--to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans in  employment, in housing, in education--in every aspect of their lives.    Mr. Speaker, this discrimination  disproportionately affects LGBTQ people of color. This is a shame.  Discrimination must end against everyone.   And, yes, Mr. Speaker, as a person of faith, my religion teaches me  to love thy neighbor as thyself and to do unto others as you would have  them do unto you. So let's pass the Equality Act today so there will  be, truly, liberty and justice for all.   Again, I thank Congressman   David Cicilline for this today.
