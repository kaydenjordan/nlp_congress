Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of two important measures, which  would overturn two significant onerous regulations finalized in the  waning days of the Obama administration.   First, the resolution provides for the consideration of H.J. Res. 36,  providing for congressional disapproval of the so-called BLM methane  rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee and provides for a motion to recommit.   In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.J. Res.  37, providing for congressional disapproval of the so-called  blacklisting rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee and provides for a motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, burdensome regulations are crippling our businesses. The  Obama administration finalized 38 major rules between election day and  inauguration day. It is estimated those rules will cost our economy  $41.2 billion. Sadly, this was just par for the course with the  previous administration. In 2016, the Obama administration finalized  over 400 regulations at a cost of over $160 billion to the economy.  Over the entire Obama Presidency, over 3,000 regulations, at a cost of  $873.6 billion, were finalized.   I am heartened by President Trump's regulatory freeze, which has been  estimated to save over $180 billion in regulatory costs, followed by  his executive order which aims to revoke two regulations for every new  regulation put forward.  [[Page H889]]    Specifically, H.J. Res. 36 overturns the BLM methane rule. The rule  is a significant regulatory overreach by the Bureau of Land Management.  Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has the  authority to regulate methane emissions, which it currently does.  Instead, the BLM has decided to also assert authority over methane in a  way that is both duplicative and unnecessary, yet has significant  negative impact on jobs, energy production, and Federal, State, and  local revenues.   Mr. Speaker, this is a regulation in search of a problem. According  to a 2015 EPA study, methane emissions from both natural gas systems  and crude oil production have fallen by significant margin, even while  oil and natural gas production have exploded. The BLM flaring rule is  both costly and unnecessary.   The second rule considered by this resolution is similarly a solution  in search of a problem. For decades, the Federal Government has had a  suspension and debarment process in place to deny Federal contracts to  bad actors who violate basic worker protections. However, President  Obama signed an executive order directing various agencies to add  another layer of bureaucracy onto the Federal procurement system. Prior  to awarding a contract, each agency's contracting officer and a newly  created labor compliance adviser will be required to review both  violations and alleged violations to determine whether an employer  should be awarded a Federal contract. Even the courts have agreed this  is overreach. In October of 2016, a Federal district judge blocked  enforcement of these rules, citing concerns with the violation of due  process rights and executive overreach.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we prevent  implementation of these rules which are unnecessary and add even more  regulatory burdens to our struggling businesses and anemic economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying  legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Not surprisingly, my friend and I have a number of disagreements on  the wisdom of getting rid of these particular regulations. We do agree  on the importance of actually capturing methane gases. Frankly, my  friend is right. That is a profitable thing, and most companies try to  do it on their own.   We do, frankly, need more infrastructure in this area, no question  about that. The BLM has been less than cooperative in allowing that  infrastructure to be built on Federal land, and that has made this  problem more difficult than it needs to be.   But it is important to recognize, overall, the amount of methane gas  that actually escapes has gone down steadily and, frankly,  dramatically, even as production has moved up. So additional regulation  is unlikely to change that process. It may actually complicate it.   In terms of where the appropriate authority lies, again, I would just  remind my friend, as he knows, the Environmental Protection Agency has  the authority to do this. So if it felt like it needed it, it could.   The BLM has actually moved into a new area beyond its traditional  jurisdiction because it does not have authority, under the Clean Air  Act, to draft these kind of rules and regulations. The Clean Air Act,  again, is already in place. The EPA has the authority. If we need to do  something, let's do it.   In terms of the disbarment procedure for contractors, what we have is  already awfully robust. Almost 2,000 firms, or on 2,000 occasions,  companies were disbarred in 2015 from Federal contracting work. It was  the same in 2014. So there is something in place. We don't need  additional regulatory expense, additional people working for the  government. We can rely on the procedures we already have.   My friend is concerned about the lack of hearings. I would remind  him, while we haven't had hearings on these items in this Congress, we  certainly did on both of them in the last Congress, in some cases,  multiple hearings. There is not any need to rehash and go over the same  ground, in my view.   Finally, in terms of just the process itself, the Congressional  Review Act actually limits the form in which these sorts of things can  be brought forward. If amendments are made in order, frankly, the item  loses its privilege in the United States Senate, which, obviously,  changes the speed at which you can move and perhaps even the number of  votes that are required to actually move forward.   So we think, again, these are items that have been explored, looked  at, debated. The evidence is pretty clear. We think it is important to  move quickly in these areas, and I would urge the body to do so. Adopt  the rule. Support the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to make a couple of good points. Remember, my friends,  disbarment is already a very common procedure. It was invoked over  2,000 times. So having another regulatory hurdle and hoop to jump  through, just simply isn't necessary.   Again, these regulations were, frankly, generated in the final waning  months of the Obama administration. They haven't been in action, and  there is sort of a regulatory fit. It is not, by the way, unusual for  just the last administration. All administrations have this tendency  near the end, and that is one of the reasons why we have the  Congressional Review Act in the first place, so that when  administrations, in their waning days, decide they want to leave  difficult situations or push through things that they didn't see fit to  do over an 8-year period, Congress can expeditiously make sure that  those regulations aren't put in place and businesses are forced to  begin to comply with them.   As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the regulations released by  the last administration--over 3,000 of them in an 8-year period--cost  the economy over $870 billion. The regulations that were issued between  election day and Inauguration Day cost the economy over $40 billion.  That is real money. That is real investment that could go elsewhere and  could hire people.   So I would think that these, along with the other Congressional  Review Act bills that will be coming forward, and have already come  forward, will actually give the economy a much-needed shot in the arm,  will help stimulate job creation and movement, and we have a timeframe  in which we have to operate.   So if we actually followed all of the procedures my friend suggested,  many of these regulations, frankly, would never get reviewed before  they went on the books.   So it is better to act quickly. I think it is better for American  business.   Again, I urge the support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    I am certainly prepared to close.    I am certainly prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my friend. As always, he is always thoughtful, always  a good person to hold a debate and a conversation with.   On this one, we simply disagree. My friend referenced some of the  ``conservative groups'' that are supporting the maintenance of the  flaring rule, the BLM.   Just for the record, I want to add some that I am actually more  familiar with: the Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against  Government Waste, Americans for Prosperity, and Taxpayers Protection  Alliance. All of those are in favor of the repeal of this regulation,  and all of them think it will actually save businesses money and  increase activity as opposed to the regulation which we think actually  discourages economic activity.   Again, these are regulations--in both cases, they were adopted in the  final waning days of the administration. These are things that Congress  had serious doubts against, but, obviously, couldn't override an  administration when they were in office.   The Congressional Review Act itself is done, so we can do this sort  of exercise after an administration leaves, and actually go back and  undo some of the damage that I think is routinely done by both parties  in their waning days, when they would actually be better off to just  simply let the new people get into their jobs and actually go about  their business.   We have appropriate regulatory authority in both of these areas.  Again, the Environmental Protection Agency has the power under the  Clean Air Act to issue whatever regulations it cares to on methane. And  here, frankly, we ought to pat business on the back because, as we have  increased production of both oil and natural gas, methane has  consistently gone down dramatically and steadily over the years.   I suspect that process will continue with or without the regulation  of the Federal Government because, quite frankly, it makes good  business sense. And, quite frankly, most people in private business  want to be good stewards to the environment. They are not out to try  and damage our air or our water.   The same thing is true in terms of bad actors--and there certainly  are some bad actors--that engage in activities that are inappropriate  for Federal contractors who violate the law. That is why, under current  law, almost 2,000 companies were disbarred in 2015; a similar number in  2014.   So, again, what we have in place appears to be working. Why we would  create an additional hurdle, hire additional people, and force  companies to do additional paperwork is beyond me. I don't think it is  the wise thing to do; I don't think it is the necessary thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support  the rule.   H.J. Res. 36 and H.J. Res. 37 both undo regulations that should never  have been made in the first place. By preventing the implementation of  these onerous, duplicative regulations, we will relieve the burdens  faced by American small business.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 74 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled       ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States'' (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or       effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the       Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 724.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's  [[Page H893]]       ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal       of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question       passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in       order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of       the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House       defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition       rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
