 Mr. Speaker, some of us have been here for some period of  time. Some of us have heard this debate before. My friend, Mr. Reed,  from New York, opined, and others have opined, about how we passed  a number of bipartisan bills, five to be exact. March 4, March 14,  March 27, April 24, and then we had a hiatus, because the majority  leader of the Senate said we ought to take a break and see what  happens, and the minority leader of the House said the same thing. So  we didn't take any action. Frankly, tens of thousands of people died-- hundreds of thousands of people died.    Now, I point out that we have acted five times: 415-2, 363-40--a  voice vote on the CARES Act, $2 trillion--388-5, and 359-53.   Now, if you include the CASH Act, which we passed, because the  President, i.e., Mr. Trump, said we needed more money for people, so we  passed the bill and 44 Republicans voted for that one as well.   Now, there is only one thing that has changed since we passed those  first five bills. We now have a Democratic President and not a  Republican President. That is the only thing that has changed.   The need is there. The virus is still with us. The economy is  struggling. But now we have a Democratic President, so I expect zero of  you to vote for this.   Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I expect zero Republicans to  vote for this bill.   Why do I expect that? Because I was here in 2009 when, under George  Bush, we went into the deepest recession this country has seen since  the Great Depression.   Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, we passed two major pieces of legislation  to deal with that recession. One was called TARP, the Troubled Asset  Relief Program. A Republican President and Democrats passed that bill.  Only a third, Mr. Speaker, of the Republicans would support President  Bush.                                time  1230    You can shake your head, but you look at the Record, that is the  fact. That is the fact.   Democrats supported the request of a Republican President because we  thought it was in the best interests of the country and our people. And  the only reason it passed this House is because Democrats, 172 of us,  stood up with George Bush and voted for that program. And it was a bad  vote for us. It was the right thing to do, but politically it was a bad  vote.   How sad, Mr. Speaker, I think it is that we passed five bipartisan  votes with a Republican President. Now the President is different, and  we don't want to give him any credit, so we are going to cut off the  nose of the American people to spite the face of America.   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority in the Senate has taken action,  passing an amended version of the American Rescue Plan that this House  approved on February 27. The version they sent us back reflects the  same commitment demonstrated by this House to take the big and bold  action demanded by the American people and overwhelmingly supported not  just by Democrats, but by Republicans.   The Republicans outside this House support this bill. Only the  Republicans inside this House, unanimously apparently, oppose this bill  while some 60 percent of the Republicans in America polled say, ``We  are for this bill.''   But we have a Democratic President, I get it. President Biden's plan  is reflected in this legislation. It says President Biden's plan, but  this is our plan. This is a plan we built over a year of tough debate,  long debate, substantive debate and discussion on both sides of the  aisle, and in a bipartisan fashion passed those five bills.   This bill is consistent with the measures we passed last year to  confront the challenges to our public health and economic well-being.  It achieves a number of critical goals: It puts vaccines into  Americans' arms; it will put money in Americans' pockets; it will put  children back in classrooms; it will put millions of Americans back to  work and reopen businesses safely; and it will put at ease the  frontline and essential workers who are in the public sector, like  teachers, the first responders, by ensuring that State, local, Tribal,  and territorial governments can keep them employed.   Mr. Speaker, the American people overwhelmingly support this  legislation, with more than three-quarters in favor of its enactment,  according to a Morning Consult poll from March 3rd. I would like to see  some of the NRCC polls because I think they give the same message. But,  of course, maybe those people polled didn't realize there was a  Democratic President. Heaven forbid that we vote for something that a  Democratic President wants.   Mr. Speaker, I put our party up to any kind of analysis in terms of  our bipartisan support for Republican Presidents when we thought it was  in the best interests of the country. Nearly 6 in 10 Republicans want  to see this bill passed.   Listen to your people. I am surprised that more of our Republican  colleagues are not planning to vote for this legislation. I hope they  will do so. I hope they will do so because I think it is in the best  interests of our Nation, of our families, of our individuals, of our  businesses, of our economy. I hope they will join Democrats in taking  action to help the nearly 10 million Americans who are out of work  compared to this time last year.   We waited. This is what happened. I hope they will also join  Democrats in voting to extend expanded unemployment insurance benefits  that would otherwise lapse for more than 11 million families this  weekend and to make good on our promise to send another round of $1,400  stimulus checks to most Americans.   What are they going to do with that check?   They are going to put it in the economy, and it is going to grow the  economy and create jobs.   And I hope they will join us in supporting a massive effort at  deploying vaccines and testing so we can defeat this virus.   The American Rescue Plan means an end to the failed approach of  hitting the pause button. It didn't work. It is time to hit the start  button. It is time to start Building Back Better through bold action.  That is a political slogan. I like it. I have a Make It In America  slogan myself.   But this is not about slogans. It is about investment in our country,  in our economy, and in our people, our families, our children, and,  yes, the most vulnerable among us. That is what my faith teaches me to  do. This is a vote to face our challenges with all of our strength and  resolve. This is a vote to have each other's backs as fellow Americans  in this time of difficulty.  [[Page H1276]]    Mr. Speaker, with our votes today, we can send this legislation to  President Biden so he can sign it into law and get the help that  America and Americans need.    Mr. Speaker, well, that is an interesting speech to  follow. Mr. Massie was very energized. I haven't seen, of course, that  which he submitted for the Record, but 90 percent of America thinks  this bill makes sense, 90 percent. Take your own polls. Poll after poll  after poll shows overwhelming support of this legislation because it is  common sense. It is common sense that you want to assure the community  that those who buy weapons that can be used with deadly force, as the  gentleman just indicated, are not a danger to themselves or to others.   Mr. Speaker, according to the database from the Associated Press, USA  Today, and Northeastern University that tracks mass shootings, which  they define as four or more victims, not including the shooter, 2020  was a standout year. After years of setting new records for mass  shootings, 2019 had the highest number recorded, 33 mass shootings in  one year. But in 2020, there were only two mass shootings: one in  February and another in early March.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, those numbers don't count the hundreds of  shootings each year in which there are fewer than four victims, with  tens of thousands killed or maimed by gun violence annually. The  contrast in the number of mass shootings from 2019 to 2020 is stark.   Mr. Speaker, I don't have to explain to my colleagues why mass  shootings suddenly came to a halt last year, but it shouldn't take a  deadly viral pandemic--which took us out of group meetings, which took  us off the streets, which kept us at home--to stop a deadly epidemic of  gun violence.   With the arrival of vaccines and passage of President Biden's plan to  help make it safe to reopen businesses and schools, we will soon be  gathering in groups once more, but nobody wants to see a return to mass  shootings, Mr. Speaker. Nobody wants to see a return to deadly school  shootings that terrorize America's students.   We shouldn't need a pandemic to reduce gun violence in this country.  The way to do that ought to be through passing commonsense gun safety  legislation through Congress to make it harder for deadly firearms to  get into the hands of those who cannot bear them responsibly. That is  what H.R. 8,  [[Page H1289]]  the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, would do.   Nine out of 10 Americans support the reforms in this bill. Now, I  know I have seen some people, Mr. Speaker, shake their head, no, no,  that is not the case. Show me a poll that has less than 80 percent of  Americans thinking that terrorists should not be able to buy guns, that  felons should not be able to buy guns, that domestic abusers should not  buy guns, particularly in an accelerated way. You get mad at a partner,  you get mad at a girlfriend, a boyfriend, whatever, go down to the  store, boy, get a gun, bang.   It is one thing to have a thoughtful purchase: I want to have a  hunting gun; I want to have a handgun for target practice; I want a  handgun for safety in my home, in my business, in my car. But if you  are a person who has shown that you are not somebody who is a  responsible person--sort of like driving a car, if you are not  responsible, you are a reckless driver and you have been guilty of  manslaughter by automobile or something of that nature--people have a  right to know that what you do is going to be not a danger to them.   This is one of the greatest examples of legislation that truly  reflects the will of the American people. That is why I hope we can  come together to pass it with bipartisan support. I don't know that  that is going to be the case. But if it is not the case, it will not  reflect the will of the American people who would like to see this on a  bipartisan basis. Republicans and Democrats polled support this  legislation.   Now, if somebody wants to show me a poll that says, no, that is not  the case, that is one thing, but I haven't seen a poll that doesn't  reflect that. Just as I believe we ought to do this week with  Representative Clyburn's bill as well, which could close the loophole  that contributed to the reprehensible and racially motivated mass  shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South  Carolina, in 2015. Nine people in church slain by somebody who got a  gun; who, if the report had come back in a timely fashion, wouldn't  have been able to get that gun.   I hope that Senate Republicans will not filibuster this bill. At some  point in time the majority ought to rule.   Now, the Second Amendment correctly protects gun ownership. I don't  have an argument with that. But the Supreme Court itself said that  there could be responsible restraints and items for protection  consistent with that amendment. That is what this bill does.   I hope our friends will listen to the voices of parents, children,  siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends of those who were killed by  gun violence in recent years; and I hope they will remember the names  that bring tears to many eyes and pain in so many hearts. Parkland.  Some believe Parkland didn't happen. They are wrong, of course. Sandy  Hook; Charleston; Las Vegas; Orlando; Pittsburgh; Annapolis; San  Bernardino; Washington Navy Yard, just a few blocks from here; Oak  Creek; Tucson; Virginia Tech; and the list could go on and on and on.   I say to the ladies and gentlemen of the House, let's not add more  names to this register of grief. Let's not rely on a pandemic to do  what we ought to have done so long ago. Let's pass these bills and  reduce gun violence the right way, with our votes.   Is this a perfect bill? Will it establish or accomplish the absolute  safety?   It will not, but what 90 percent of Americans say is that it is a  step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, let us take that step.
