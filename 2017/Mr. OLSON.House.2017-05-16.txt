 Mr. Speaker, it all started 11 years ago: The Lady Eagles  from Fort Bend Baptist Academy won their first Texas State softball  title. Years later, the name was changed to Fort Bend Christian  Academy, but the dynasty had been born. The Lady Eagles won their sixth  Texas title last week by defeating Dallas Christian School with a score  of 6-2.   One word can describe the Lady Eagles' playoff run: domination. In  the last four games, they scored 37 runs, their opponents only 2. Our  four seniors--Claire, Lauren, Danielle, and Kendall--have set us up to  make history: our third straight Texas title in 2018.   We will honor them as we honor the Lord.   Congratulations, Eagles.                            ____________________
