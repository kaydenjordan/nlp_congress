 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, we are going to be  voting to pass the Great American Outdoors Act, and before this bill  crosses the finish line, I thought it would be a good opportunity to  reflect upon all the work that it took to get us here today.   You see my colleagues around. This has truly been a labor of love  from all of us who love the outdoors. If there is one thing we have  found about the outdoors, it is no matter whether you are a Democrat or  a Republican, you love it. We all participate in it; we all enjoy it;  and we want to pass it on to our children and grandchildren and next  generations to come.  [[Page S3036]]    I am proud to be joined by every Member of the Democratic caucus in  supporting this legislation to permanently fund the Land and Water  Conservation Fund and to put $9.5 billion toward maintenance backlogs  on our treasured public lands, and I am very appreciative and very  proud to be working with our Republican friends who are joining us to  support the Great American Outdoors Act. It truly has been  bipartisanship at its best, and it is something we need so much more  of.   Passing permanent LWCF authorization last year was an important step,  but securing a permanent, dedicated funding source for the multiple  conservation programs funded by the LWCF has been the ultimate goal of  the Democratic leaders of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee all the way back to Senator Jeff Bingaman. So it goes back  quite a ways.   Many other Senators, Democratic and Republican, Members of the House,  both retired and here today, have been champions for the LWCF and  helped to pave the way to where we are today. We are within striking  distance of realizing the goal of permanent, mandatory funding,  especially since we have only seen the full funding twice in 55 years.  To have it now, where it is going to be permanent, and the $21 billion  that went down the black hole, that will no longer happen. We will be  able to make sure that the projects in all of our wonderful States--and  I think almost every county in the country is going to benefit. It is  on a personal basis. It truly is a long, hard-fought caucus  achievement, and I am incredibly proud that as the current ranking  member of the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee, as a  sponsor of the LWCF Permanent Funding Act, and one of the lead  Democrats on this bill to be part of getting this legislation done.   I have my good friend Senator Heinrich of New Mexico, who has worked  so hard. Then we have had Senator Cantwell. We have had Senator Ron  Wyden and all who have been former chairs of the committees or ranking  members. On the Republican side, all my colleagues there will be  speaking on behalf of bringing so many people together.   So its time has come. It is a testament to the importance of this  historic conservation legislation that has brought so many of us  together in support. Something this impactful doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time and hard work. I would like to recognize the work of my  colleagues and thank them again.   We had a lot of votes. We have had a lot of votes that we have had to  shepherd through and make sure that everybody understood how important,  how historic, and the timing of something--to be able to say that you  were in this body, you were able to vote and participate on a piece of  legislation so our country, the United States of America, is going to  be able to share with every inhabitant we have and all the visitors  coming from around the world for years and years and generations to  come, that is pretty historic. To have that happen, I think, is one of  the most important things we have done in the conservation world in the  last 50 years.   So we are very proud of that. Sixty of my Senate colleagues have  cosponsored the Great American Outdoors Act, and 20 more joined us last  week, resulting in strong bipartisan votes to begin consideration of  the historic bill. The beauty of our Nation's great outdoors truly  brings them together.   All of us have been able to speak and show you pictures of our  wonderful, beautiful States. These are some beautiful pictures from my  beautiful State of West Virginia. This is Cheat River Canyon here.  Anybody who has ever rafted that or hiked it or been on top and looked  down to the beautiful vista, this is just truly as rugged as it looks  right here. It is something gorgeous when you pass through it on a  raft. It is really unbelievable.   I would invite everybody to come and visit. We are only a 5-hour  drive from about half the population of the United States, right here  in West Virginia.   This other photo is of the Dolly Sods Wilderness, a beautiful place.  This is what we call Bear Rocks. I have a little, little place right  down in the Canaan Valley area here, and I intend to be there this  weekend with my family. This is something we enjoy. This is an  unbelievable vista here. Again, it is only 3 hours from Washington, DC,  by driving   So we invite you all to West Virginia. We would love everybody to  come visit and enjoy what sometimes we take for granted. When you have  these types of views, you can never take that for granted, what the  Good Lord gave us all. Every one of our States has so much to offer.   At the end of the day, this is an opportunity for us to pass down a  legacy to our kids, our grandkids, and of course generations to come.   I believe this will be the most impactful nationwide conservation  legislation since the Land and Water Conservation Fund was first  created over 50 years ago.   From what we have seen from the votes over the last week and a half,  I anticipate we will see again today. It is a shining example of  Democrats and Republicans coming together to put politics aside to do  what is best for conserving this great Nation's natural resources.   So I would like to say thank you to all of them.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a list of all of my staff who have worked on this. I am sure my friends  on the Republican side would do the same because there has been a lot  of effort put forth. People have worked long nights and long weekends  to make this happen   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       H.R. 1957--Great American Outdoors Act Staff (Senator Manchin)         David Brooks, Democratic General Counsel; Renae Black,       Democratic Staff Director; Sam Fowler, Democratic Chief       Counsel; Samantha Runyon, Democratic Communications Director;       Bryan Petit, Democratic Senior Professional Staff Member;       Elliot Howard, Democratic Professional Staff Member; Melanie       Thornton, Democratic Professional Staff Member; Charlotte       Bellotte, Democratic Research Assistant; Adam Berry,       Democratic Research Assistant; Cameron Nelson, Democratic       Research Assistant; Jeremy Ortiz, Democratic Digital Manager;       Peter Stahley, National Park Service Bevinetto Fellow; Lance       West, Chief of Staff; Wes Kungel, Legislative Director.     I have got David Brooks, who has been on the committee  for 30 years. He probably knows more about this process. I know he is  fretting over is every word right, is every comma in the right place,  every dot in the right place, but we have confidence in David and Sam  Fowler and Renae Black doing a great job with the committee on the  ranking member's side.   To every one of them who have worked so hard, thank you. God bless  each and every one of them for a job well done, and it is something  that we can all take pride in.   Someone said: How was your work in the Capitol? I said: We had a  great week. We had a great week, and today is going to be the  culmination of that great week.   So I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to make these  comments. I want to make sure we enter into the Record all the people  who deserve the credit. I want to thank my colleagues for being here  also.   I yield the floor.
