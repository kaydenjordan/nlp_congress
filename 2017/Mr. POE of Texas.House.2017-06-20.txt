 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of a common sense  bill, H.R. 1393 which would set a national standard of 30 days for  states to subject non-residents to income tax requirements within that  state.   Under current law, many of the 41 states with a broad based personal  income tax rate subject out of state residents to income tax in that  state on the first day they ``work'' in the state.   This patchwork of state laws have created a confusing and unworkable  nationwide system where individuals who travel to another state for a  conference or meeting can find themselves subject to income tax  requirements in a state where they only spent a few days.   In fact, these overburdensome requirements can create a scenario in  which a company of 7,000 employees who travel for domestic business may  have to file 10,500 W-2's over the course of a given year. This burden  can be even worse for a small business.   One small business, which operates several customer service centers  throughout the United States and has 600 employees working in 46  states, faces a significant burden trying to comply. Most of these 600  employees work out of one of the customer service centers, but 12  employees travel out of state to do a job occasionally. The manager of  this company has to spend 3 plus hours every week figuring out the tax  reporting requirements for these employees, even though most of them  only pay $30 to $100 a year into these different taxing authorities.   Is this really a good use of the time of a small business? Wouldn't  we rather have these individuals working to create jobs and grow our  economy then wasting time complying with the burdensome reporting  requirements for 42 different taxing authorities?   H.R. 1393 is a common sense solution to this problem. 30 days is a  fair baseline standard that can be applied nationwide. It allows U.S.  workers to travel and work around the country for a reasonable amount  of time without subjecting them to reporting requirements for taxation  in all of the jurisdictions in which they travel. If they stay longer  than 30 days in any particular state then the state is free to tax them  according to their own state laws.   With this new standard, American business will know what the rules of  the road are across the country and they can plan their business  accordingly.   I thank the Chairman for moving this important bill through the  committee, and urge your support.    Mr. Speaker, North Korea released Otto Warmbier  last week after 17 months of imprisonment and torture. Otto returned  home in a coma, never again to speak or see his parents. Yesterday, he  died--murdered, actually--from brain damage because of the Korean  beatings that he endured.   North Korea had humiliated Otto for allegedly stealing a pro- government placard, forcing him to publicly beg for forgiveness. Now,  these are the tactics of terrorists.   We need to ramp up the pressure on North Korea. Three other Americans  are still being held in North Korea for apparent political reasons. We  must prioritize saving their lives.   It is time to call it like it is: designate North Korea as a state  sponsor of terrorism. Doing so would isolate the country and publicly  categorize North Korea with many other rogue nations.   The House has already passed my bill to designate North Korea as a  state sponsor of terrorism. Now the Senate needs to do the same.   Little Kim has American blood on his hands. Give him and his outlaw  regime the designation it deserves, a terrorist state.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
