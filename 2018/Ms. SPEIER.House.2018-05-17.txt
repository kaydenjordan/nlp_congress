 Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have a point. It is  really terrible that some people take advantage of free food and drink  to continue their slothful lifestyles. I agree. This conduct must stop.   Of course, Members of Congress can attend lunches and receptions with  free food and drink every single day, sleep on the taxpayer's dime in  their offices, and have the taxpayers do their laundry, too.   The House has been in session for a measly 50 days this year, and I  have compiled at least 54 receptions, which is just the tip of the  iceberg of free food and drink available to Members.   But even estimating a modest $10 for a glass of wine and a plate of  appetizers, that means that a Member who attends a reception every  night the House is in session, has received a benefit of over $500 just  since the beginning of this year.   That is about the same amount of money as the maximum monthly food  stamp benefit for a family of three, except Congress Members are  nibbling on pork sliders, and French Brie, and pate, while these poor  families are expected to feed each family member three meals a day for  30 days. That breaks down to about $5.60 for each meal, or about $1.87  per person per meal.   Now, I am sure none of my colleagues would think that they are better  than working people who struggle to keep a roof over their heads and  food on their tables. And I am sure all of us are happy to be subject  to the same rules that we vote on in this Chamber. So here is my modest  proposal: The congressional electronic benefits transfer card, or  congressional food stamp card. We will put a little cash in it--say  $1.87 per reception--and Members can figure out how to make their  monthly reception budget stretch to fit their wining-and-dining needs.   Maybe we will have Members carrying their single glass of wine from  one reception to another, or maybe they will blow their whole allotment  on one plate of shrimp, or maybe--just maybe--we will see more Members  of Congress showing empathy for the most vulnerable in our society.   Now, to be clear, there is nothing wrong with private organizations  spending their own money on outreach to Members of Congress. I have  certainly attended my share of receptions, as has everyone else here.  But what is truly repellent in this debate, is the rank hypocrisy.   Here we sit, we get paid $174,000 a year to work 4 days a week here  at the U.S. Capitol, and we are considering a bill that would take food  assistance away from millions of Americans. Members of Congress can  literally walk down the hall for free appetizers any time of the day or  the week.   Yet, Republicans are proposing to deny 265,000 children school meals.  Congress can't pass an infrastructure bill or DACA, but we can debate a  bureaucratic and ineffective work requirement for people struggling  with hunger.   Perhaps if my colleagues ran out of funds on their congressional food  stamp card and got a bit peckish, they would remember that in one of  the richest countries in the world, we should not let people go hungry.  Period.   How can we be debating on whether to starve children whose parents  are struggling with low-paying or unstable jobs? You know what should  be an unstable job? Giving corporations $2 trillion in tax cuts while  slashing basic food assistance to 20 million children, 5 million  seniors, and 1 million veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this disgusting  bill. And for those who don't, I will pray that you regret every bite  of free shrimp cocktail and every sip of free wine.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which  will create some fairness for more than 600,000 workers across our  country who are in small businesses and manufacturing facilities that  use sugar as an ingredient in the products they make. Over 91,000  of those jobs and 2,300 of those businesses are in my home State of  California.    This amendment would make the sugar program fairer for taxpayers,  manufacturers, and American consumers. By removing the many unnecessary  government interventions that have kept sugar prices excessively high,  manufacturers will create jobs and American consumers will no longer be  on the hook for $4 billion per year in hidden sugar costs.
