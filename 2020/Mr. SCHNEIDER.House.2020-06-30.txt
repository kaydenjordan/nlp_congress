 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, it was reported that U.S.  officials were aware more than a year ago of Russian bounties on the  lives of our troops and, further, that President Trump received written  intelligence in February, 4 months ago. If true, this represents a  gross dereliction of duty.   I shudder at the idea that the men and women defending our Nation  might not have the full confidence that their Commander in Chief has  their back.   Mr. Speaker, I am the father of a young Navy officer. I represent  Naval Station Great Lakes, where every enlistee receives basic training  on their journey from recruit to sailor. I feel a great personal  responsibility for everyone who volunteers to risk their lives in  service to our Nation. I wish I had confidence that the President felt  the same.   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs answers as to the truth. Every Member of  Congress needs to be briefed by the CIA and the intelligence community.  With the truth, Congress can better protect our troops, fulfill  America's role as a global leader, and make sure that Russia is held to  account for their heinous actions.                            ____________________
