 Madam Speaker, the transatlantic  relationships between the United States  [[Page H1021]]  and European democracies are some of our most important. It is  important we work together, try to understand each other, and  communicate--not only on a political but on a personal level--through  our citizens.   For nearly 40 years, a cultural and political exchange has occurred  between the United States and Germany through young members of society.  In fact, my office is currently participating.   Maja Sondermann is a 21-year-old from a town close to Frankfurt,  Germany, a young professional and student studying marketing and  advertisement and currently interning for my office. She is a  participant in the 39th year of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange,  CBYX, a program jointly funded by the U.S. Congress and the German  Bundestag, and one of five CBYX participants currently interning on the  Hill.   Initiated in 1983, the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange offers young  Americans and Germans the opportunity to explore each other's culture.  This cultural exchange program involves participants moving to the U.S.  or Germany for 1 year and strengthens the ties of our American-German  relationship through citizen diplomacy.   Over 26,000 American and German high school students, vocational  students, and young professionals have thus far participated in and  benefited from this incredible experience.   Even through the pandemic the participants remained resilient and  joined the cultural exchange virtually. This year, the CBYX was able to  return to an in-person exchange in August of 2021. For the duration of  the program, the participants live with host families, immersing  themselves in the daily life of a different culture, and attend  classes, and the young professionals even work in the foreign country.  They form bonds and friendships with people whom they meet during the  year abroad and learn about a different culture while fully immersing  in it and building strong personal and professional connections.   The participants on both sides gain a new perspective on global  affairs, politics, and socioeconomic topics, as well as a new sense of  empowerment, independence, and knowledge of a different culture and  what it means to be a global citizen.    Their contribution to cultural exchange and the American-German  friendship doesn't end with their flight back home. These young minds  are positively impacted through this experience, as they share it with  others after returning to their home countries.   Even beyond that, the participants stay connected with the people  they meet and other participants. Many alumni of the program continue  to contribute to transatlantic relations on both sides through the  alumni network and their personal career paths.   With the upcoming 40th anniversary of the Congress-Bundestag Youth  Exchange in 2023, and as a member of the German-American Caucus, I want  to draw attention to this important program. It continues to support  both our nations' transatlantic bonds while also inspiring so many  young minds to engage in a cultural and political exchange.   Madam Speaker, the CBYX program is an exceptional chance for our  countries to connect and communicate on a different level and form  relationships that will last and positively impact our future since the  program directly impacts the foundation of our future young citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 112th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America. On February 8,  1910, Chicago businessman, William D. Boyce, who grew up in Western  Pennsylvania, incorporated the Boy Scouts of America.   Since that time, millions of young men and women have joined the  Scouts and learned the values of patriotism, courage, and self- reliance.   The Scouts have helped shaped some of the most memorable figures in  U.S. history: Former President George W. Bush, Martin Luther King, Jr.,  and even retiring Supreme Court Justice, Stephen Breyer.   Mr. Speaker, I have spent more than 50 years in scouting, including  serving as Scout Master and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout in 1977.  It was these experiences that first sparked my interest in public  service. The Boy Scout oath, in part, urges us to perform our duty to  our country. I am proud to introduce this resolution designating today  as Boy Scouts of America Day to honor the tireless service of Scout  volunteers and participants in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed firsthand the important principles,  values,  [[Page H1024]]  and lessons that are imparted upon young people and last a lifetime.  The Boy Scouts of America has played a pivotal role in shaping the  leaders of tomorrow and I look forward to seeing their continued  contributions to our country.   Mr. Speaker, after the Bible, probably this manual, the Boy Scout  Handbook, has done more to shape my life and made me the person that I  am today.                            ____________________
