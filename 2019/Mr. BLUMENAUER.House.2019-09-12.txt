 Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis in housing, in  homelessness, growing wealth inequality, and it is all not an accident.  It is the result of deliberate discrimination and policy failure.   The Federal Government, for years, intervened in housing for White  veterans, for middle-class homeowners, for developers and property  owners, but shut out poor and, especially, people of color--African  Americans, most notably. Trump is making it worse.   Tonight, 550,000 people will go to sleep homeless. We have a gap of 7  million affordable rental units, and income inequality grows. We need a  reset.   Last week, I released this report, ``Locked Out: Reversing Federal  Housing Failures and Unlocking  Opportunity,'' which details solutions for our most vexing housing  policy challenges. It is available on  blumenauer.house.gov website.   We must be bold, transformative, and ambitious in solving these  challenges. We can't afford another generation of small-scale thinking  and large-scale failure.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding and  allowing me to speak on this.   I was on the Ways and Means Committee that passed the grotesque  Republican tax cut. This provision was never debated on a bill that  never had a hearing wedged in. The math doesn't work out. It portends  that we are going to have hundreds of millions, a billion or more in  savings. It is not going to happen. We are talking about a relatively  small amount of money, which I am convinced, despite my good friend  from Alaska's assertion, this is going to move forward.   The American public opposed it. It is the wrong thing to do. We need  to be moving in the other direction in terms of keeping the oil up  there in the ground for climate, but also, for the environment there. I  had a chance to visit that area with Governor Inslee and other  colleagues and am really impressed with the nature of that. I saw that  caribou herd.   This is a treasure. It is much more fragile than one would think, and  we are bound and determined to work to support the environmental  values, the desire of the American people, our challenges for climate,  and to unwind this egregious provision in the Republican tax bill,  which, mark my words, will, in fact, be substantially adjusted, if not  in this Congress in a subsequent Congress.   I appreciate my friend's forthright approach here. I appreciate the  fact that we are focusing the American public on the outrageous  provision, that we are fighting to protect the Arctic Wildlife Refuge  and dismissing this egregious provision in the Republican tax scam.
