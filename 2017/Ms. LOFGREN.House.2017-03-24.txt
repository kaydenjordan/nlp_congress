 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this terrible bill  that will hurt my constituents in California.   Mr. Speaker, each one of us was elected by our constituents to stand  up for them here in Washington. Today, I will stand up for people who  live in the 19th Congressional District by voting no on this terrible  bill.   It's small wonder that polling shows only 19 percent of Americans are  in favor of this bill. With the bill, 24 million fewer Americans will  have health care insurance. Families will pay increased out of pocket  costs with higher deductibles.   Incredibly, it allows insurance companies to penalize people older  than 50 by allowing them to charge 5 times more for insurance than  younger Americans.   It hurts Seniors in other ways too. . . . by shortening the life of  the medicare trust funds, by increasing costs for medicine for medicare  recipients and by smashing the safety net for nursing home care which  the Medicaid program provides.   Incredibly, it also has a special penalty for veterans, by barring  veterans from receiving tax credits if they are nominally eligible for  VA care, even if there is no room for them at the VA.   Let's stand together for our hardworking Americans all over our  country and in our own districts by voting no on this poorly crafted  bill that cuts taxes for the richest Americans and leaves regular  Americans on the short end of the stick when it comes to health care.
