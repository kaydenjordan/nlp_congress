 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 292, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 24355 Creekside  Road in Santa Clarita, California, as the William L. Reynolds Post  Office Building.   William Reynolds, better known as Bill, was brought up in the San  Fernando Valley. He was the son of a World War I veteran.   Following high school graduation and just before his 20th birthday,  he followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the U.S. Army  during the Vietnam war. He served in the 9th Infantry Division and is  recalled as one of the few surviving servicemembers of the Charlie  Company's ``Boys of `67.'' For his heroic service, Mr. Reynolds earned  a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.   After receiving an honorable discharge, Mr. Reynolds moved to the  Santa Clarita Valley in California with his wife, Meg. He spent the  remaining years of his adult life as an influential supporter of  veterans.   In addition to his military accolades, he is remembered for single- handedly organizing a local effort to construct a memorial wall at the  Veterans Plaza to honor Santa Clarita Valley veterans from World War I  to the present day.   He also traveled to Da Nang, Vietnam, with a veteran delegation led  by a former President to honor the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war.  As a passionate advocate for Santa Clarita Valley's local veteran  community, he became a high-profile historian as director of veterans  affairs for two Santa Clarita-based news journals, publishing more than  100 different biographies of local veterans in his community.   On January 11, 2021, Mr. Reynolds passed away. I encourage my  colleagues to join me in honoring the distinguished life of Mr.  Reynolds by naming a post office in Santa Clarita, California, after  him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage  of H.R. 292, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 996, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3901 MacArthur  Boulevard in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the Dr. Rudy Lombard Post  Office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Carter), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New  Orleans for his eloquent words about Dr. Lombard. May I add, not only  was  [[Page H4943]]  he a hero to the people of New Orleans and Louisiana, but he was also a  nationally recognized civil rights advocate who was the vice president  of CORE when he was a student at Xavier University. He is remembered  for leading a 1960 sit-in at McCrory's Five and Dime store to  peacefully protest Jim Crow in Louisiana with a group of people  famously known as the ``CORE Four.''   So the naming of this post office will be an opportunity not just for  the people of his city and State, but for the people of the United  States to recognize him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong favor of H.R. 2379, designating the facility of the  U.S. Postal Service located at 616 East Main Street in St. Charles,  Illinois, as the Veterans of the Vietnam War Memorial Post Office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Illinois for his remarks about the naming of this post office, and I  strongly encourage all of our colleagues to endorse this significant  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Second Lieutenant Patrick Palmer Calhoun was born on March 19, 1941,  and raised in Mount Vernon, Georgia. He graduated from the University  of Georgia and enlisted in the U.S. Army in the middle of the Vietnam  war.   While stationed in South Vietnam, Second Lieutenant Calhoun served  heroically for his country as a rotary wing aviation unit commander.   On April 19, 1965, his helicopter was shot down by enemy fire in the  Pleiku Province. He was later declared killed while missing in action  at the tender age of 24.   I encourage my colleagues to join us in honoring the life of Second  Lieutenant Calhoun by naming a post office in Mount Vernon, Georgia,  after him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and  Accountability, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4502, the Modernizing  the Acquisition of Cybersecurity Experts Act.   I thank my distinguished colleagues, Representative Nancy Mace from  South Carolina, who is the chair of the Cybersecurity, Information  Technology, and Government Innovation Subcommittee, and Representative  Katie Porter, who is the ranking member of the Health Care and  Financial Services Subcommittee, for their excellent bipartisan work on  this bill, something that, yes, does still exist in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   This year, more than 750,000 cybersecurity jobs in the United States  will be left unfilled. Each one is a missed opportunity for a talented  person and also a missed opportunity for our country.   These are well-paid positions with great job security. They are  essential to the protection of our government, the prosperity of our  businesses, and the security of our communities.                                time  1630    One big barrier to entry for many of these jobs is the requirement  that applicants have a college degree, even if that degree has no  bearing on the technical expertise required to satisfactorily meet the  demands of the job or to successfully perform the work. Remember that  Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college before he created Facebook.   According to a 2017 study by Harvard Business School, more than 60  percent of employers turned down qualified applicants in the IT field  because they didn't have a college degree. Many such applicants were  turned down even when they sought to fill jobs vacated by individuals  who also didn't have college degrees.   This degree inflation excludes people from opportunity. In 2022, less  than 40 percent of the population over the age of 24 had a bachelor's  degree.   As technological and cultural advancements continue to transform the  nature of the workplace, businesses and public-sector entities alike  have begun to realize that college degrees are not always effective  proxies for job qualifications and skills. Often, highly capable  candidates became that way precisely because they pursued their own  path in life, a nontraditional route into the workforce. To remain  competitive and to attract top talent, hiring authorities could no  longer allow degree inflation to automatically disqualify more than  half of our workforce.   H.R. 4502 applies the same logic to the Federal cybersecurity  workforce which performs the critical work of defending our Federal  networks and our Federal data from attack. Recognizing the government  must be competitive to attract high-demand cybersecurity talent to  public service, the bill eliminates the requirement that a BA degree is  a prerequisite to Federal hiring for cybersecurity.   Eliminating unnecessary degree requirements isn't just good for  business, it is good for workers and especially minority workers who  are too often excluded from opportunity. In 2022, less than 30 percent  of the Black population had a bachelor's degree. For the Hispanic  population, that number is even lower at 21 percent. Addressing degree  inflation and advancing legislation like this takes steps toward  creating the more inclusive and fair society that the public wants.   This bill contributes to a record of strong bipartisan cooperation to  strengthen Federal cybersecurity and its workforce. Democrats led  passage of the CHIPS and Science Act last year with increased funding  for Federal cyber workforce programs, and the Office of the National  Cyber Director recently published the Biden-Harris administration's  National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy. This strategy includes  a provision encouraging employers to take a more skills-based approach  to hiring for these cyber positions.   While Republicans in the House continue the crusade to shut down the  government--let's hope they have thought better of it now--I do hope  that Americans see that it is still possible for Congress to come  together on commonsense legislation like this to advance meaningful  opportunity in a well-functioning government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Porter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for her  introduction of this legislation with Congresswoman Mace and for her  leadership here.   The gentlewoman is absolutely right that there are people who may  have gotten a college degree and a Ph.D. in some other field but are  completely unprepared and unqualified to have a cybersecurity  professional's job in the Federal Government, and there are those who  never went to college at all who would be excellently prepared based on  what their professional and life experience has been.   I thank them for moving in this direction, and I hope we can look at  some other parts of Federal hiring to make sure we are making  equivalent adjustments, so we are getting, as the gentlewoman says, the  best candidates.   I am wondering--and I would yield to the gentleman for a second, if  he knows the answer to this.   Is it just a happy coincidence that the acronym for this legislation  is the MACE Act? Was that pure coincidence? I don't know.   In any event, I congratulate Ms. Mace and Ms. Porter on this  excellent legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
