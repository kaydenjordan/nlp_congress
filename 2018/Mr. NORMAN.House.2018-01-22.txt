 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. In the  early morning hours of Tuesday, January 16, four law enforcement  officers were ambushed while responding to a domestic call in York  County, South Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, Detective Mike Doty, who had been with the York County  Sheriff's Office for 12 years, was slain in the line of duty.   Today, Detective Doty will be laid to rest, and our hearts grieve and  mourn at the loss of one of our bravest. Our hearts especially ache for  all his loved ones: James, Katherine, Joshua, Patricia, Michelle,  Christina, Diana, Shane, and his twin brother, Chris, who served with  him. They will continue to remain in our prayers.   In the Gospel of Matthew 5:4, we are told that God heals the  brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. May we take solace in this  verse and always remember that the Lord is with us.   May God bless the family of Michael Doty.                            ____________________
