 Madam President, I will vote against confirming former  Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. There are too many  policies he promoted while he was governor that cause concern. He  refuses to accept scientific consensus regarding human causes of  climate change. His support for clean energy and energy efficiency  seems tenuous, at best, and he is in lock-step with the Trump  administration's desire to boost fossil fuel production at the expense  of human health and the environment.   Governor Perry, while campaigning for the Republican nomination for  President in 2012, proposed abolishing the agency he has now been  nominated to run. I appreciate his candor and honesty in repudiating  that position and acknowledging that he really didn't understand the  Department of Energy's mission at the time. He has served our Nation  and Texas as an Air Force pilot, a member of the Texas House of  Representatives, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, and the Lieutenant  Governor and Governor of Texas.   A key part of DOE's mission has been to promote clean and advanced  energy technologies, via grants for research and development, and  through the work of 17 national laboratories. In response to growing  global demand for clean energy solutions, DOE under the leadership of  Secretaries Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz launched initiatives to expand  the global reach of DOE's clean and advanced energy missions.   In 2009, then-Energy Secretary Chu announced that he would host the  first Clean Energy Ministerial, CEM, to bring together ministers with  responsibility for clean energy technologies from the world's major  economies and ministers from a select number of smaller countries that  are leading in various areas of clean energy.   The CEM is a high-level global forum to promote policies and programs  that advance clean energy technology, to share lessons learned and best  practices, and to encourage the transition to a global clean energy  economy. Previous CEMs have yielded remarkable national pledges from  both the United States and foreign governments to develop and deploy  clean energy technologies which in the aggregate have played a  significant role in improving the global market competitiveness of  clean and renewable energy technologies.   DOE also serves as the linchpin of the U.S. pledge to Mission  Innovation, a global initiative involving 20 nations aimed at doubling  public clean energy research and development.   The program, spearheaded by President Barack Obama and French  President Francois Hollande with private sector support from Bill Gates  via the Breakthrough Energy Coalition. The current U.S. Government  investment portfolio of more than $5 billion spans the full range of  research and development activities--from basic research to  demonstration activities, RD&D. The U.S. Government investment  portfolio includes programs at 11 agencies, with the largest investment  at DOE. These programs address a broad suite of low carbon  technologies, including end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy,  nuclear energy, electric grid technologies, carbon capture and storage,  advanced transportation systems, and fuels.   At DOE, these programs are implemented through a number of mechanisms  including cost-shared projects with the private sector research and  development activities at the National Laboratories, grants to  universities, and support for collaborative research centers targeted  to key energy technology frontiers. The next planned phase for Mission  Innovation, as envisioned by former Energy Secretary Moniz, was  developing an international clean energy consortia, based on the  principle of sharing institutional and technological resources to  deploy shared energy solutions across international boundaries. The  goal was to bring countries of all sizes together to develop, produce,  and deploy clean energy solutions, with our 17 National Research  Laboratories at the center of this results-oriented partnership.   Unfortunately, all of this investment and America's ability to lead  and profit from the clean energy revolution is in jeopardy. There is no  credible reason to believe that former Governor Perry or President  Trump appreciate the U.S. interest in growing clean energy research and  cooperation. President Trump deliberately ignores the significant  growth of solar energy in the U.S. Human health, the environment, and  America's global competitiveness will suffer as a result of this  backwards ideological outlook on U.S. energy research, development, and  production.   There were significant investments in wind energy in west Texas while  Mr. Perry was Governor, but he also tried to fast-track 11 new coal- fired power plants in the State, a plan the courts ultimately scrapped.   During Mr. Perry's two unsuccessful runs for the Republican  Presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, he consistently recited  popular tropes coined by climate change denialists. For instance, in  his book, ``Fed Up'' former Governor Perry called the science behind  climate change a ``contrived, phony mess.'' During his 2012 campaign,  former Governor Perry accused climate scientists of manipulating data  in order to receive funding for their projects. While he was Governor,  his administration deleted all references to climate change from a  report about sea level rise in Galveston Bay.   I am also concerned that, during the Perry administration, Texas  dropped from 11th down to 27th in the American Council for an Energy  Efficient Economy's ranking of State energy efficiency policies. Under  his watch, Texas filed suit in 2012 challenging the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases significantly  endanger public health.   Under his watch, Texas sued EPA a dozen times between 2008 and 2011.   According to press reports, the Trump administration may eliminate  several DOE offices, including the Office of Electricity and the Office  of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.   Former Governor Perry was asked about these reports during his  confirmation hearing but didn't commit to fighting for the offices or  the vital programs they administer.   Former Governor Perry was also an active member of the Outer  Continental Shelf Governors Coalition, OCSGC. While the OCSGC supports  offshore wind development, its primary purpose is to promote oil and  gas production on OCS lands, including the mid-Atlantic, and expand  revenue sharing for interested States. So States to the south of  Maryland may push for OCS oil and gas production and reap increased  benefits from it at the expense of all taxpayers. But if there is an  oil spill that hits Maryland's coastline and enters the Chesapeake Bay,  it will be our fishing and tourism industries that suffer.  [[Page S1560]]    For all of these reasons, I will vote against confirming former  Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, I oppose the nomination of Governor  Rick Perry to be Secretary of the Department of Energy, a Department  that he called for eliminating in 2011. After briefings on the  Department's mission and programs, Governor Perry came to ``regret''  that position, but his short education on his prospective job is not  enough to prepare him for its complexity and importance.   The Department of Energy is a home of innovation and, critically, the  Federal agency that manages the safety and reliability of our nuclear  arsenal. The last two Secretaries of Energy were physicists.   According to the Dallas Morning News: ``In all of the department's  missions, science is front and center. But during his 14 years as  governor, Perry built a questionable record when it comes to science.  He has a pattern of supporting offbeat medical theories while  dismissing the established science on climate change. And his record of  using public funds to boost technology and research in Texas is  littered with poor management and allegations of cronyism.''   In one example, a 2010 Dallas Morning News investigation discovered  mismanagement and political influence in the Texas Emerging Technology  Fund, which Governor Perry established to provide funding to high-tech  startups. The Dallas Morning News reported that the fund awarded more  than $16 million to companies with connections to large campaign  donors. A company in which an old college friend and donor invested  received $2.75 million. Another company, where an investor had given  more than $400,000 to Governor Perry's campaigns, received $1.5  million. A company founded by a former Perry appointee got $4.5  million.   The Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Texas House Speaker  made the Emerging Technology Fund's decisions based on input from an  advisory committee that operated in secret and did not take minutes.  Its recommendations to the Governor were not public. This unusual  decisionmaking process, with ultimate power vested in elected officials  rather than technical experts, is deeply troubling. As Secretary of  Energy, Governor Perry would be charged with managing a number of grant  and loan programs aimed at developing the next generation of energy  technologies.   Governor Perry has also failed to commit to funding for ARPA-E and  the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. These programs  are essential to ensuring that the United States is a leader in the  21st century energy economy and confronts the critical challenge of  climate change.   I am deeply concerned by Governor Perry's limited experience with our  Nation's nuclear program. While he did advocate a low-level nuclear  waste repository in his State, he has no experience with nuclear  weapons. His inexperience is particularly problematic when the  President he would serve has also appeared confused by issues  surrounding the nuclear triad and has inaccurately said that the United  States has ``fallen behind on nuclear weapons capacity.''   The United States is engaged in a $1 trillion program to refurbish  our nuclear weapons systems, a process that should be tightly  controlled. We should be reducing, not expanding, the number of nuclear  weapons in the world. President Trump has questioned the New START  Treaty, a critical tool to decrease nuclear weapons in both the United  States and Russia. He glibly and irresponsibly called for ``an arms  race,'' even though the United States and Russia already control 95  percent of the world's nuclear weapons and each have enough to destroy  the world many times over.   The Secretary of Energy needs to have a clear vision to manage our  nuclear arsenal and ensure that the President fully understands our  capabilities and their implications for national security and  international peace. There is nothing in Governor Perry's record or  testimony that indicates that he is prepared for this job.   Governor Perry may have considered the Department of Energy  insignificant enough to forget during his Presidential run, but its  mission is essential to the safety and security of the American people.  Between our national labs and research and loan programs, it fosters  greater economic competitiveness and discovers new technologies to  drive energy independence and solutions to climate change. I do not  believe that Governor Perry is prepared to manage the Department and  provide thoughtful counsel to the President, and thus I must vote  against his nomination today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Georgia.                             The Attorney General     Mr. President, I thank the Chair.                Russia and the President's Address to Congress    Mr. President, on Tuesday night, along with my colleagues, I listened  to the President of the United States address the joint session of  Congress. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, I was particularly interested to hear what the President  would be saying about American foreign policy.   I heard him say during the speech that American foreign policy would  be based on the respect of the sovereign rights of nations, which is  something that I strongly believe in. I then thought I would hear the  President talk about one of our greatest challenges from a country that  is not respecting the sovereign rights of the United States of America,  that country being Russia. But the President didn't mention Russia at  all in his State of the Union address, which really surprised me.   When we look at Russia's most recent conduct and know what they did  in regard to their attack on the U.S. democratic election system, it is  beyond dispute that they wanted to interfere with our free elections,  they wanted to affect the credibility of our democratic election  system, and they wanted to influence the outcome of the election. That  is pretty clear from the evidence that we have seen to date. Yet  [[Page S1565]]  the President did not mention that at all--a country that had attacked  us as recently as just a few months ago. There was no mention in the  President's State of the Union address.   It wasn't an isolated attack by Russia on the United States. We knew  that before that, when we saw Russia's influence in regard to  Montenegro's elections and how they tried to impact their parliamentary  elections to influence Montenegro's decision to join NATO. We know that  Russia is attempting to influence the elections in Western Europe.   So we have a country that is trying to bring down our democratic  system of government by using our democratic system of government, and  the way that we conduct open elections, to compromise our system.   But that is not the only thing Russia has done that is contrary to  the U.S. national security and our foreign policy objectives. We know  that they have physically incurred into other countries. They have  physically incurred into Ukraine. Today, Russia has annexed Crimea-- something we will never recognize. Crimea is part of Ukraine. Russia is  continuing to support the separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine,  compromising Ukraine's sovereignty.   The President did not mention that in his State of the Union address.   We know that Russia is in Georgia, in Moldova, and other sovereign  countries; once again, no mention of that.   And then Russia is very much engaged in the Middle East. We know that  Russia's footprint in the Middle East is growing. They have their  military presence in Syria, backing the Assad regime, facilitating  Iran's participation in Syria.   We also know that the type of conduct that has been conducted under  Russian support, where civilians have been targeted, humanitarian  convoys have been attacked, amounts to war crimes--a situation where  Russia has culpability; yet, we don't hear anything about that.   So we have a role. Congress has a role to play in making sure that we  protect our national security interests.   First and foremost, we have to know what is going on. We have to know  what Russia was doing. We have to know what Russia's intentions were  when they compromised our cyber security and used that information to  try to influence our elections. We have to know what Russia's  intentions are all about regarding the contacts they have made with  Americans in their effort to influence this campaign. We have to  understand what Russia's intentions are as they relate to democratic  countries.   We saw in General Flynn's case that a contact was made, and as a  result of not coming forward with that, General Flynn has left the  Trump administration. And then we find out yesterday that the Attorney  General, as a U.S. Senator, had contact with the Russian Ambassador,  and that information was not made available during the confirmation  process.   The timing of that meeting in Senator Sessions' office is concerning.  It is concerning because it was right at the time that Russia was the  most active in trying to get information that they could use to  influence our elections. So this is an important aspect for us to  understand.   We need to understand why that meeting took place and what was  involved in that meeting. There have been calls by Members on both  sides of the aisle that we get that type of information.   But I will add one more dimension to this: Why was the Russian  Ambassador interested in meeting with Senator Sessions during the  campaign period? Was this part of an overall strategy by Russia to try  to influence the election? We need to get the answers to that.   The only way we are going to be able to get a complete account of  what has happened by Russia's attack on the United States is by setting  up an independent commission. Russia may not have used MiGs to attack  America. They may have used a mouse. But it was an attack. And when we  were attacked on 9/11, Congress did right thing--they set up an  independent special commission to understand what happened, how we were  so vulnerable to an attack, so that we could take steps to protect  ourselves from future attacks and hold those responsible accountable.  That was a bipartisan effort by the Congress of the United States,  setting up an independent commission, a commission where the members  could devote their entire full time to the assignment, because that is  how serious being attacked is. There was no limit on their  jurisdiction. They could go where the facts led. They could give a  report to the American people so there would be credibility that we,  the policymakers, are going to have independent information in order to  act to protect the national security of the people of this country.  That is what that independent commission meant. That independent  commission met. They made many recommendations on eliminating a lot of  the stovepiping of intelligence information and combining agencies  together. Congress acted on those recommendations. As a result, we are  safer today than we were prior to 9/11.   We need to be safer tomorrow than we are today from the attacks of  Russia. The only way we are going to be able to get that objective  information with the credibility so that we can act in the best  interests for the people of this Nation is to have a nonpartisan,  independent commission take a look at what Russia was doing, get all  the facts, find ways and recommendations to make us safer, give the  credibility to the American people, and then Congress needs to act in  order to protect our national security. I know we have some committees  looking at this. I know the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing some  very important work. I support that.   We have our responsibilities in Congress to take steps within the  jurisdictions of our committees. I am for the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee looking into what Russia was doing in order that we can  protect the jurisdiction of our committee to do a better job in our  bilateral relationship with Russia, or what Russia is doing in Europe  or in other parts of the world that affects our national security under  the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We need to  do that work. The Intelligence Committee needs to do their work. Armed  Services needs to do their work. Judiciary needs do their work.   But we need one central investigation that includes the broad  jurisdiction that can get to answer why the Russian Ambassador may have  wanted to see a U.S. Senator who was active in one of the campaigns  that close to the elections, that has an opportunity to understand why  Russia was so active in their cyber attacks in America, getting so much  information, so much political information, why Russia was trying to  understand our election system. There is no evidence that they tried to  manipulate individual votes. That didn't happen--at least we don't  believe that happened--but we know they were looking into how we do  that. Was that for some future use? We need to understand that to  protect our democratic system of government. That is what an  independent commission will allow us to be able to receive.   I urge my colleagues to respond to the national security challenge of  Russia, and let's establish an independent commission.   There are other things we need to do. There are two bills I filed  with my Republican colleagues to make it clear that it is not going to  be business as usual with Russia. There are going to be consequences to  what they have done to the United States and our national security  interests.   One bill that I filed, of which Senator Graham is the principal  sponsor, is to make sure that Congress carries out its responsibility  of oversight in regard to our bilateral relationship with Russia. It is  the Russia Review Act, which would require the President of the United  States to submit to Congress for review any attempt to eliminate or  modify the current sanctions against Russia. He would be required to  submit that to the Congress of the United States, hopefully working  with us and consulting with us before he makes decisions but giving us  an opportunity to weigh in before that decision could take effect.   For my colleagues who remember the Iran nuclear agreement, it sounds  very familiar. Senator Corker and I, Senator Menendez, Senator Kaine,  and others worked on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. It passed  nearly unanimously in the Congress. It required a President to submit  that  [[Page S1566]]  agreement to us before it could take effect. It made the negotiations  much more transparent. As a result, I believe we had a stronger  agreement, but we also had a more open process, and Congress had a  chance to carry out its responsibility. In a similar vein, it is  important that we pass the Russia Review Act so that we can carry out  our responsibilities, preventing the President from taking unilateral  action without consulting with us. This is bipartisan; we have  Democrats and Republicans working on this. I hope we will be able to  pass this bill in a timely way.   The third bill I want to bring to my colleagues' attention as it  relates to Russia's activities in the United States is legislation that  I have filed with Senator McCain and many others. We have a large  number of Democrats and Republicans who have cosponsored this bill that  would increase the sanctions against Russia because of their attack  against us. It would expand the options for imposing sanctions to  different sectors that could affect Russia's energy, that could affect  the ability of Russia to finance their sovereign debt, that could  affect Russia's ability to privatize their industries by making it  clear that we are not going to allow Americans or companies to help  finance these activities because in reality they are financing  activities against our interests, such as the cyber attacks, as we saw  last fall.    This legislation is comprehensive. It deals more than just with  sanctions; it deals with another major problem that we have found.  Through NATO and U.S. leadership, we have made it clear that we will  defend the countries of NATO, and we have deployed troops to make it  clear to Russia that they better not try to compromise the territorial  integrity of the member states.   This initiative has been well received by Europe and has countered  Russia's attempts to cause a fracture within the European community. We  need a similar initiative on democracy, a democracy initiative, because  not only is there a threat against Europe from their geographical  boundaries, there is a threat against Europe in regard to their  democratic institutions. We know that. We saw that here in America. It  is being challenged in Europe. So this democratic initiative would  allow us to participate in strengthening the democratic institutions in  Europe so that we don't allow Russia to use the democratic institutions  to try to bring down the democratic institutions.   There is another part of this legislation which I think is extremely  important. We are all getting to better understand the tactics being  used by Russia, this fake news--inventing news and then using the  social media to make it look like it is the hottest news in town. We  know they are good at that. We also know they are very good at  propaganda, and they go in directions that we, prior to this election,  thought we would never see in our own country. We are now seeing it  more frequently. Part of this legislation is for us to develop a  capacity to be able to counter this propaganda and fake news so that  Russia's deployment of it will not compromise our national security.   I think all three bills will be considered shortly and favorably by  this body--setting up an independent review commission; requiring the  President to submit any changes in the Russian sanctions to the  Congress for review before they could take effect; and strengthening  our sanctions regime against Russia for its conduct, including  strengthening our commitment to democratic institutions and fighting  this new cycle of fake news.   I also listened to the President during the State of the Union  Address when he said that our foreign policy calls for a direct,  robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. That is another  statement I happen to agree with. And then I thought about what I had  heard a little earlier that day: that the President's budget was going  to have about a 30- to 35-percent cut--it wasn't exactly clear, but it  was a large number--to the State Department.   I said: How are you going to have a robust and meaningful engagement  in the world if you cut our diplomacy budget, you cut our development  assistance budget? This is how we keep the world safe. This is how we  get our goals accomplished globally.   We have had so many hearings in our committee where there is a much  greater need. We need to do more in Africa in promoting democracy. We  need to do more in the Middle East in promoting good governance and  inclusive governance so we don't have to have as many wars. We need to  do things in our own hemisphere. We heard today in a hearing what is  happening in Venezuela. There is a lot of work for America to do. A 30- percent cut? Is that a more direct, robust, and meaningful engagement  within the world? It didn't sound that way to me. I was concerned about  that and how we are going to be able to gauge.   It was Secretary Mattis who said: If you don't give the Secretary of  State the resources, you better give me more soldiers.   And they are more expensive. We have the best fighting force in the  world, and we are going to support our fighting force. The way we show  respect for our soldiers is to use them only as a matter of last  resort. Diplomacy is critically important for America's national  security.   A strong, credible Office of the President is equally important if we  are going to be able to be the type of country that influences our  values globally, and the President of the United States has put that at  risk. That is why I am reintroducing my resolution to try to avoid a  constitutional crisis. I introduced it before President Trump took the  oath of office, and I am introducing it again to avoid a constitutional  crisis. It deals with the emoluments clause of the Constitution of the  United States.   Every modern President of the United States prior to President Trump,  in order to avoid conflict, in order to do what is ethically right and  to comply with the Constitution of the United States--the emoluments  clause--has either divested their financial holdings or has set up a  blind trust. Some have done both. That is the way that the ethics  officers tell us you can comply with not just the Constitution but with  the highest ethical standards so that there are no real conflicts and  you don't have any perceived conflicts, which can be just as damaging  to the credibility of a public office holder.   President Trump, by not divesting, by not setting up a blind trust,  has put the Office of the Presidency, our country, in a compromising  position.   Let me give some specific examples, if I might. I will mention three  countries. I could mention more.   Saudi Arabia. Very interesting country, Saudi Arabia. In August 2015,  the Trump organization filed eight separate business companies to do  business in Saudi Arabia. As we all know, the President's Executive  order that was originally issued that excluded immigrants from seven  Muslim countries from visas did not include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  even though, as we all know, many of the participants in the 9/11  attack against the United States originated from the country of Saudi  Arabia. President Trump has vast business interests in Saudi Arabia.   Let me quote President Trump:         Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy       apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I       supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.    It is not a question, Mr. President, of whether they like you or they  don't like you; under our Constitution, they cannot give you any favor.  If they give you a business favor, that is an emolument and violates  the Constitution of the United States and violates your oath of office.   In regard to Turkey, Turkey has two large-scale developments in the  country that are under the Trump organization. The Trump organization  has a partnership with a luxury furniture company, Dorya International,  to build pieces to be sold under the Trump Home Collection brand and a  multimillion-dollar branding deal with the Dogan Group-- the Dogan  Group is run by one of the most politically influential families in  Turkey--for a two-tower complex in Istanbul. According to President  Trump's May 2016 financial disclosure, he received as much as $1  million in royalties from the first venture and as much as $5 million  from the second venture.    Because President Trump has not properly divested himself from his  business, he will presumably continue to receive royalties from both  ventures, and these business arrangements are not unknown to Turkey's  leadership. President Erdogan presided over the opening ceremonies of  Trump Towers, Istanbul.  [[Page S1567]]    Shortly after the election, President Trump held a phone call with  President Erdogan in which he praised his business partners. There are  substantial business interests known by the Turkish Government that Mr.  Trump has in their country. Mr. Erdogan is not shy about talking about  and using the Trump Towers. He has bragged about it. We have a lot of  foreign policy decisionmaking that affects Turkey. We need to know that  when the President is making those decision, it is America's interest  which is at the front and center, not the Trump Organization's  interests that are affecting those decisions. That is why we have the  emoluments clause, that is why we believe in avoiding conflicts, and  that is why President Trump needs to divest of his interest or set up a  blind trust.   I will mention one other country, if I might. That country is China.  For a decade, the Trump organization has been trying to get a trademark  of its brand in China. I am going to quote from Mr. Trump on February  7, 2011, when he wrote to the American Ambassador in China. This is  what Mr. Trump said: ``I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in  legal fees to secure my own name and globally recognized brand for  Chinese individuals who seek to trade off my reputation.''   For 10 years he was fighting to get that trademark protection. It was  granted on February 14, 2017, a few weeks after President Trump took  the oath of office, shortly after President Trump stated that he would  support the One China policy, something the Government of China  strongly wanted him to say.   We don't know connections. We can't draw connections. We don't know  that. That is why the emoluments clause is in the Constitution, so you  cannot accept any favors from another country. It is against our  Constitution. Yet we have concerns as to whether the President is  acting under that interest. That is just wrong and it needs to stop.  What the President has done is established a circumstance where there  is an appearance of conflict, where it looks like foreign governments  are trying to influence his decisions.   He has affected America's standing to advance good governance and  corruption. I want to underscore that point. He is compromising  America's moral authority on the values we hold so dear. Our Western  democratic values are being compromised because leaders of autocratic  countries, corrupt leaders, can say: If it is all right for the  President of the United States to keep his business holdings while he  is President, what is wrong with me having an interest in some of our  entities here? It takes away our effective ability to use diplomacy to  solve problems or advance our goals. We are being compromised. The  current arrangement is simply inadequate.   President Trump announced he is going to let his two adult sons  handle his businesses, but he still maintains his financial interests.  He gives a couple of different other things he is going to do. I will  just go over one or two of them.   He says he is going to donate the profits from his foreign hotels to  charities. That sounds good.   Let me just quote from Steve Carvell, a professor at the Cornell  University School of Hotel Administration, who said:         It's a monumental task to constantly run this down. Even if       the company is trying its hardest and making its very best       effort, it will be difficult to fulfill that goal.    Let's get serious about this. The arrangements he set out will not  solve the conflict. It will not comply with the Constitution of the  United States. The Office of Government Ethics said on the President's  proposal it is ``wholly inadequate.'' That is the Office of Government  Ethics. They go on to say: ``The plan the [President] has announced  doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting  and that every President in the last four decades has met.''   I am a lawyer but would not claim to be a constitutional expert. Let  me quote, if I might, from constitutional experts. Richard Painter,  Norm Eisen and Laurence Tribe have written a comprehensive study of the  constitutional provisions, concluding that ``since emoluments are  properly defined as including `profit' from any employment, as well as  `salary,' it is clear that even remuneration fairly earned in commerce  can qualify.''   Richard Painter, the chief ethics officer for President George W.  Bush, stated it in a blunter fashion. He said:         This is a for-profit hotel. [Trump] is making profits over       dealing with foreign governments. Same with the loans from       foreign government-owned banks. Those are for a for-profit       business. That is prohibited under the Emoluments Clause of       the Constitution.    Let me just conclude with this. This is not about any one person.  This is about the Office of the President. This is about our  constitutional form of government that depends upon the Office of the  President being respected. It is bigger than any one person. The  Framers of our Constitution went on to say: We recognize it. We know  the faults of men. That is why we set up the Constitution, to protect  against the frailties of individuals.   This is about the Office of the President of the United States, not  about any one person who may occupy it 4 to 8 years. We need to protect  the Office of the President, and that is why we need to act now to  avoid this constitutional crisis of the President of the United States,  who has put our Nation at risk because of his personal conflicts and  because of his violation of the Constitution of the United States.   I call upon President Trump to live up to the values of the  Constitution. Give the American people the transparency they deserve  and completely sever his relationship with the Trump Organization  before we are embroiled in an ethical and constitutional crisis that  will not serve the best interests of the President, Congress or the  American people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
