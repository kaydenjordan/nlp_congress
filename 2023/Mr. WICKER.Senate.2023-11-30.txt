 Madam President, this is a difficult topic for me to  discuss because it is so serious and because the United States has so  much catching up to do. Two years ago, Congress created the bipartisan  Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States.  We gave it the job of examining the strengths and weaknesses of our  national security position.   The Commission report was released just last month. The report  comments on an array of military issues, but its findings can be  distilled to a single alarming fact: China and Russia are increasingly  able to match our military might. And if we do not act now, the  consequences will be seismic. Not only could we fail to deter a war, we  might actually lose the next war.   The report finds that we are not prepared for what is coming. And  here is what is coming: For the first time, we must stand up to the  ambitions of two nuclear-armed peer adversaries in multiple regions of  the world at the same time. That stunning conclusion means this report  should be required reading for each of my colleagues.   And so I directed my staff to deliver a copy of this bipartisan  report personally to every Senator, and I hope we take its message to  heart.   The American military, in particular, our nuclear deterrent, has been  one of the principal guarantors of global security--not just American  security but global security--since the late 1940s. Our power crested  at the end of the 20th century when the Berlin Wall crumbled, and we  emerged as the world's sole superpower. But regrettably, instead of  maintaining that competitive edge, we have allowed it to slip away in  both conventional and strategic deterrents.   China and Russia watched as we shuttered our shipyards and ammunition  plants, as we let our ships rust, and as we neglected to replace our  aging Cold War nuclear arsenal. Then, as successive Presidential  administrations let defense assets deteriorate, China and Russia poured  more funds into their weapons stores. They built the kind of weapons  needed to take us on in a conventional fight and keep us at bay in a  strategic one.   This is not one Senator saying this; this is the bipartisan  Commission that we tasked with investigating this thoroughly. The  autocrats who ruled China and Russia began paying attention to more  than our guns and ships. When our satellites and next-generation  communications capabilities gave us an unbeatable edge in the Gulf war,  these enemies, adversaries of ours, took notice.   We could see, communicate, and shoot from farther away than anyone  else. When we deployed these tools, we inaugurated new ways to protect  ourselves, cutting-edge technology, not mere masses of metal, would win  the final argument of nations. But the leaders of Russia and China soon  came to recognize this also. They began to meet our advances and ensure  we could never do to them what we had done to Saddam Hussein's military  in 1991.   Among the bipartisan Commission's direst findings is the fact that  China and Russia have largely succeeded. China has built strike  complexes of their own that make the prospect of war increasingly  perilous. Their fleet of anti-satellite weapons and cyber warfare  capabilities could render our military blind, deaf, and mute in a  potential conflict over Taiwan.   U.S. victory, and, therefore, deterrence, was once a fait accompli,  but today we risk war that would shake the foundations of everyday  American life and the foundations of global peace.   The consequences of our negligence, together with the Chinese and  Russian investment, are most acute when it comes to our nuclear  position, which has been the foundation of our deterrence capability.  Russian submarines are becoming much more advanced, and China is  rapidly bringing missile silos online. Meanwhile, our Air Force  personnel are still using floppy disks to operate missiles that are  older than their parents, and they are flying bombers that are older  than their grandparents.   Our nuclear submarines--the crown jewels of U.S. military power--are  having to remain at sea longer as our fleet shrinks. Workforce problems  and maintenance delays hold the fleet back from its potential. The  AUKUS agreement is a tremendous diplomatic achievement that can be a  game changer, but it must be implemented correctly. And right now, we  are short of the attack submarines needed.   China and Russia now clearly realize that, by joining forces, they  can help each other reach their goals. China wants to occupy Taiwan,  and their leader has said they need to be ready to do that as soon as  2027. Russia wants to puncture NATO's iron wall, and they want to help  each other to do both. Their sinister intent and increasing  capabilities make this the most dangerous national security moment we  have faced in 75 years.   Paul Nitze, the Pentagon official whose strategic wisdom helped us  win the Cold War, once said:         Our fundamental purpose is more likely to be defeated from       lack of the will to maintain it, than from any mistakes we       may make.    In other words, the future is ours to lose, but the future is still  ours. This report recommends several policies that can help us end the  damaging defense cuts of the past three decades and begin making  investments we need.   The Commission's first recommendation is that we rebuild and expand  the defense industrial base, including the National Nuclear Security  Administration's nuclear weapons production infrastructure. In  particular, Congress should partner with the administration and the  Navy to establish a third public shipyard to conduct submarine  maintenance. Again, this is the recommendation of a completely  bipartisan Commission of experts.   The second proposal builds on the first. We need educational  institutions and a talent pipeline to bring skilled tradesmen to this  industrial base. These high-paying, stable, and long-term jobs do not  require master's or bachelor's degrees. They can advance both national  security and expand economic opportunity.   Finally, the report recommends a series of products we should  prioritize. We need more conventional forces, and we should increase  procurement of strategic nuclear capabilities like the B-21 and the  Columbia-class submarine. We need improved missile defenses and rapidly  deployable theater nuclear forces like the sea-launched cruise missile.  Delivering these products would put our adversaries on notice and  reassure our allies at the same time.   Of course, these actions come with a pricetag, but we have always  found our defense investments to be both expensive and priceless. It  will cost money to deter China and Russia and Iran from threatening us,  but it will cost much, much more--in money and in lives--if we do not.  In the words of former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, ``America can  afford survival.''   The good news is that we have done this before. In the late 1970s,  the Pentagon sowed the seeds of our defense technological revival, even  as the Carter administration shrank from the world stage. But then in  1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. That attack was a wake-up  call. It taught Washington there is no substitute for superior military  might.   Again, Paul Nitze helped form an organization that educated Congress,  the Carter administration, and the American people about the Soviet  Union's threat. The result was the Reagan defense buildup that won the  Cold War.  [[Page S5690]]    We can do that again, but we must abandon the status quo and start  thinking big again. The shocking warnings in this report should spur us  to abandon our inertia and take bold actions that will lead us into the  next American century.   I thank the members of this Commission for their years of hard work,  and I urge my colleagues in both the House and Senate to take note.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I congratulate the  leadership, faculty, staff, and students of my alma  [[Page S5691]]  mater, the University of Mississippi. Military Times, a publication  that provides news and resources related to our military services,  recently highlighted the ways Ole Miss honors our Nation's veterans. It  placed Ole Miss in prominent positions on its ``Best for Vets'' lists,  ranking it as the top Southeastern Conference--SEC--school and fifth- best university in the Nation. The Best for Vets list is the largest  and most comprehensive ranking of schools for military servicemembers  and veterans. It is compiled from a survey of 325 higher education  institutions around the Nation, gathering information on their  resources, opportunities, and success rates for veteran students.   The University of Mississippi is committed to student veterans and  our Nation's military. The university established its first student  veteran organization in 1920, following World War I. Over 1,900 Ole  Miss students--more than 10 percent of the student body--have military  service connections or are veterans. Ole Miss provides focused and  dedicated support resources for veterans on campus, including the  Office of Veteran and Military Services, which sits in the George  Street House at the heart of campus. This office was opened in 2013 to  support Global War on Terror veterans, and it has become a critical  stop for student veterans. It helps them access G.I. Bill and Veterans  Affairs benefits, study resources, and scholarship applications.   Ole Miss has set the standard for veteran healthcare support. It  created the Veteran Treatment Team to allow student veterans to access  healthcare directly on campus. Now, these students do not have to  commute to full-scale Veterans Affairs clinics and medical centers for  routine treatments. Professionals at the university's mental health  clinics are trained in specific military-related mental health issues  and lead peer support group meetings and workshops for veterans. This  reduces the load on the Veterans Affairs system and supports deeper  veteran integration into the student body. The university even added a  staff counselor focused on veterans and active military issues,  bringing mental health resources directly to student veterans.   I commend the Military Times for recognizing and honoring Ole Miss'  good work. I am certain that the university will continue these efforts  in the years to come, seeing and supporting the needs of student  veterans from this new generation of military servicemembers.                            ____________________
