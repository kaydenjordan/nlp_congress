 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 183) condemning anti-Semitism as hateful  expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values and  aspirations that define the people of the United States and condemning  anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities as hateful  expressions of intolerance that are contrary to the values and  aspirations of the United States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 183         Whereas the first amendment to the Constitution established       the United States as a country committed to the principles of       tolerance and religious freedom, and the 14th amendment to       the Constitution established equal protection of the laws as       the heart of justice in the United States;        Whereas adherence to these principles is vital to the       progress of the American people and the diverse communities       and religious groups of the United States;        Whereas whether from the political right, center, or left,       bigotry, discrimination, oppression, racism, and imputations       of dual loyalty threaten American democracy and have no place       in American political discourse;        Whereas white supremacists in the United States have       exploited and continue to exploit bigotry and weaponize hate       for political gain, targeting traditionally persecuted       peoples, including African Americans, Latinos, Native       Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other       people of color, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, the LGBTQ       community, immigrants, and others with verbal attacks,       incitement, and violence;        Whereas the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., taught that       persecution of any American is an assault on the rights and       freedoms of all Americans;        Whereas on August 11 and 12, 2017, self-identified neo-      Confederates, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux       Klansmen held white supremacist events in Charlottesville,       Virginia, where they marched on a synagogue under the Nazi       swastika, engaged in racist and anti-Semitic demonstrations       and committed brutal and deadly violence against peaceful       Americans;        Whereas a white nationalist murdered nine African American       worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church       in Charleston, South Carolina, on the evening of June 17,       2015, in the hopes of igniting a nationwide race war;        Whereas on October 27, 2018, the perpetrator of the       deadliest attack on Jewish people in the history of the       United States killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life       Synagogue building in Pittsburgh and reportedly stated that       he ``wanted all Jews to die'';        Whereas anti-Semitism is the centuries-old bigotry and form       of racism faced by Jewish people simply because they are       Jews;        Whereas in 2017 the Federal Bureau of Investigation       reported a 37 percent increase in hate crimes against Jews or       Jewish institutions and found that attacks against Jews or       Jewish institutions made up 58.1 percent of all religious-      based hate crimes;        Whereas there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and       security of Jewish communities, including synagogues,       schools, cemeteries, and other institutions;        Whereas Jews are the targets of anti-Semitic violence at       even higher rates in many other countries than they are in       the United States;        Whereas it is a foreign policy priority of the United       States to monitor and combat anti-Semitism abroad;        Whereas anti-Semitism includes blaming Jews as Jews when       things go wrong; calling for, aiding, or justifying the       killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology       or extremist view of religion; or making mendacious,       dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotyped allegations about       Jews;        Whereas Jewish people are subject in the media and       political campaigns to numerous other dangerous anti-Semitic       myths as well, including that Jews control the United States       Government or seek global, political, and financial       domination and that Jews are obsessed with money;        Whereas scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the United       States have persisted for many years, including by the Ku       Klux Klan, the America First Committee, and by modern neo-      Nazis;        Whereas accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to       the Jewish community than to the United States constitutes       anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens cannot       be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, when Jews have       loyally served our Nation every day since its founding,       whether in public or community life or military service;        Whereas accusations of dual loyalty generally have an       insidious and pernicious history, including--        (1) the discriminatory incarceration of Americans of       Japanese descent during World War II on their basis of race       and alleged dual loyalty;        (2) the Dreyfus affair, when Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish       French artillery captain, was falsely convicted of passing       secrets to Germany based on his Jewish background;        (3) when the loyalty of President John F. Kennedy was       questioned because of his Catholic faith; and        (4) the post-9/11 conditions faced by Muslim-Americans in       the United States, including Islamophobia and false and       vicious attacks on and threats to Muslim-Americans for       alleged association with terrorism;        Whereas anti-Muslim bigotry entails prejudicial attitudes       towards Muslims and people who are perceived to be Muslim,       including the irrational belief that Muslims are inherently       violent, disloyal, and foreign;        Whereas Muslims and people perceived to be Muslim are       subjected to false and dangerous stereotypes and myths       including unfair allegations that they sympathize with       individuals who engage in violence or terror or support the       oppression of women, Jews, and other vulnerable communities;        Whereas in 2017, mosques were bombed in Bloomington,       Minnesota, and burned in Austin, Texas, Victoria, Texas,       Bellevue, Washington, and Thonotosassa, Florida, and mass       attacks on Muslim communities were planned against       communities in Islamberg, New York, in 2019, Jacksonville,       Florida, in 2017, and Garden City, Kansas, in 2016;        Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that       hate crimes against Muslims or Muslim institutions in the       United States increased by over 99 percent between 2014 and       2016;        Whereas attacks motivated by bigotry against those who are       Muslim or perceived to be Muslim have substantially increased       since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;        Whereas the violation of an individual's civil rights based       on his or her actual or perceived membership in a particular       religious group clearly violates the Constitution and laws of       the United States; and        Whereas all Americans, including Jews, Muslims, and       Christians and people of all faiths and no faith, have a       stake in fighting anti-Semitism, as all Americans have a       stake in fighting every form of bigotry and hatred against       people based on religion, race, or place of birth and origin:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) rejects the perpetuation of anti-Semitic stereotypes in       the United States and around the world, including the       pernicious myth of dual loyalty and foreign allegiance,       especially in the context of support for the United States-      Israel alliance;        (2) condemns anti-Semitic acts and statements as hateful       expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the       values that define the people of the United States;        (3) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United       States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as       part of the broader policy priority of fostering       international religious freedom and protecting human rights       all over the world;        (4) rejects attempts to justify hatred or violent attacks       as an acceptable expression of disapproval or frustration       over political events in the Middle East or elsewhere;        (5) acknowledges the harm suffered by Muslims and others       from the harassment, discrimination, and violence that result       from anti-Muslim bigotry;        (6) condemns anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against       all minorities as contrary to the values of the United       States;        (7) condemns the death threats received by Jewish and       Muslim Members of Congress, including in recent weeks;        (8) encourages law enforcement and government officials to       avoid conduct that raises the specter of unconstitutional       profiling against anyone because of their  [[Page H2548]]       race, religion, nationality, political, or particular social       group, including the assignment of blame or targeting members       of an entire religious group for increased suspicion, based       on the conduct of a single individual or small group of       individuals; and        (9) encourages all public officials to confront the reality       of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, and other forms of       bigotry, as well as historical struggles against them, to       ensure that the United States will live up to the       transcendent principles of tolerance, religious freedom, and       equal protection as embodied in the Declaration of       Independence and the first and 14th amendments to the       Constitution.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 183, which condemns  anti-Semitism unambiguously, as well as anti-Muslim bigotry and all  forms of prejudice against minorities, as contrary to fundamental  American values and principles. This resolution makes clear that we  condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and racism no matter where on the  political spectrum they may emanate from, right, left, or center.   This resolution is a statement of our values as a Nation. While it  focuses on concerns raised in the last few weeks regarding anti- Semitism and Islamophobia, it addresses those noxious forms of bigotry  in the context of our broader concern with all forms of bigotry and  hatred in our country.   Bigotry against members of minority groups based on their actual or  perceived religion, ethnicity, race, or national origin are among the  cardinal sins of our Nation. As the resolution notes, tolerance and  religious freedom are among our country's fundamental principles, so  much so that they are enshrined in the very First Amendment to the  Constitution.   Sadly, without constant vigilance, our Nation has seen darker moments  where religious and other forms of hate have reared their ugly heads.  Often, our Nation has fallen short of its ideals when they succumbed to  the demagoguery of bigots.   Indeed, one of the biggest problems facing our country today, and one  that has bedeviled it in the past, is the fact that white supremacists  have weaponized bigotry and hatred to achieve political gains. They do  so by stoking hatred and division among Americans based on religion,  race, ethnicity, or other characteristics.   To combat this, it is imperative that all of us--but especially those  of us in public life--speak out against such hate. Unfortunately,  sometimes the perpetrators of religious and other forms of bigotry are  themselves public figures and even, distressingly, Members of this  House.   Indeed, in the last few weeks, comments have been made by some of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle that can fairly be characterized  as anti-Semitic, and I have condemned these remarks.   Anti-Semitism is among the most ancient of prejudices and is  associated with pernicious stereotypes, including the claim that Jews  exert control over the government and the global political and  financial systems, that they are obsessed with money, and that their  loyalty to their home countries is somehow in question.   Assertion of these beliefs does not constitute merely making  statements of political or policy positions. Rather, propagation of  these beliefs has, throughout history, resulted in harassment,  discrimination, violence, and murder against Jews.   While anti-Semitism is an ancient prejudice, its effects are not  ancient history. Less than 6 months ago, a gunman murdered 11  worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, reportedly  stating that he ``wanted all Jews to die.'' Nearly 2 years ago in  Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacists chanted, ``Jews will not  replace us.''   Despite this ugly history, Members on both sides have questioned the  loyalty and patriotism of Members of this House. The trope that support  for Israel, particularly among Jewish Americans, is the result of a  ``dual loyalty'' to Israel and the United States is deeply offensive to  me.   What I find equally despicable is a somewhat analogous ``dual  loyalty'' trope increasingly deployed against Muslim Americans. This  includes the recent implication by one of our colleagues that another  colleague is a spy and a State Republican poster in the West Virginia  State capitol that implied an association between that same colleague  and the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York.   Indeed, statements have repeatedly been made in the recent past by  public officials, including the President, which can fairly be  characterized as anti-Muslim more generally.   Particularly since the September 11 attacks, Muslim Americans have  faced a gauntlet of prejudice alleging that they are inherently  violent, disloyal, and foreign, and this has led to hate-motivated  violence. In 2017, for example, at least five mosques were bombed or  burned in various cities around the country.   Efforts to question the loyalty or patriotism of anyone in this  country based on their religion or on any innate characteristic is  completely out of bounds.   It is my fervent hope that this resolution will be a chance for us,  both as an institution and also as a Nation, to remind ourselves of  what we all believe in, and to come together and heal.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this resolution today,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, listening to the gentleman from Georgia, I  think I heard him say that he and his colleagues were going to vote for  this resolution. I am glad to hear that, especially since I noted that  after the march in Charlottesville and the murder in Charlottesville  when a censure resolution was brought up, the Republicans, who were  then in control of the House, refused to bring it to the floor. So I am  glad that they are willing to vote for this resolution today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Virginia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, could you please tell me how much time the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) has remaining, and how much time  do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), who is the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 407,  nays 23, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 1, as follows:                               [Roll No. 108]                                 YEAS--407       Abraham      Adams      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Allred      Amash      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Axne      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (UT)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.

As my colleagues have also discussed, we have been pushing for more  than 15 years to finally address the moral obligations we have to those  made ill by exposure to toxins on September 11 and in the weeks and  months after the attack. It is a two-part moral obligation.   First, the attacks on September 11 were not just attacks on New York  or on Washington, D.C. They were attacks on America.   In the last few weeks, we have heard an objection raised to this bill  that New York should handle this issue because it is a ``New York  problem.''   The World Trade Center stood in my district. Many of the people who  ran into those towers were my fellow New Yorkers. The people who fled  their homes and offices to find safety were my constituents.   But they were Americans, and those towers fell on that Tuesday  morning not because they stood in New York, but because they stood in  the United States of America.   While it may have been the brave men and women of the Fire Department  of New York and the New York Police Department and the Port Authority  who first rushed to those towers, to say that the responders and  survivors who are sick today are just in New York is factually untrue.   There are sick responders and survivors in every State and in 434 of  the 435 congressional districts. This is not a New York or a D.C.  issue; it is a national issue and deserves a national response.   The second moral obligation directly ties the Victim Compensation  Fund to the Federal Government.   The reason so many survivors and responders were exposed to the  toxins that made them sick was that they were told by the Federal  Government--specifically, by Christine Todd Whitman, then the  Administrator of the Federal EPA, and then by Mayor Rudy Giuliani--that  the air at Ground Zero and in Lower Manhattan was safe to breathe, that  they should work for months to clean up the pile, that they should go  back to work in Lower Manhattan, that the air was safe to breathe.   But it was not safe; it was toxic.   In the rush to get Wall Street up and running, tens of thousands of  people were sent directly into harm's way by the Federal Government.   I went to Ground Zero days after the attack. We knew even then that  the air was not safe, that the air was thick with dust and debris, and  we had no idea what was swirling in those clouds around us as we  struggled to breathe. But the Federal Government said it was safe.   I think of those responders, first on the rescue mission. And I don't  begrudge anybody who worked on the pile in the first 3 days when people  may have still been alive who worked without proper respiratory  protection to save lives. But after the first 3 days, it was a recovery  mission; and people worked, breathing that air, for hours and days  without adequate protection.   I think of the families sent back to their apartments in Lower  Manhattan and told to wipe away the layers of asbestos from their  furniture and their windows with a damp cloth.   I think of the students sitting in their classrooms at Stuyvesant  High School, blocks from Ground Zero, and the barges removing debris as  trucks full of asbestos idled below the high school's open windows.   The Federal Government bears the burden to care for and support all  those who went back to Ground Zero because the Federal Government told  them it was safe when it was not safe.   And since the day the EPA and others told people it was safe to go  back to work, to school, and to their homes, since the day the EPA told  those responders at Ground Zero that it was safe to work with minimal  protection, I have been fighting alongside my colleagues Mrs. Maloney  and Mr. King to secure healthcare and support for the people who became  sick because of that exposure.   We fought for nearly 10 years to get the first Zadroga Act passed in  2010. That bill created the World Trade Center Health Program and  reopened the Victim Compensation Fund.   But we only authorized the VCF for 5 years. We knew we needed more  than 5 years, and we came back in 2015 and passed the reauthorization  bill.   That bill made the health program permanent--or, at least, until  2090--which gave much-needed certainty to those suffering from 9/11  illnesses and their families. But, again, we authorized the Victim  Compensation Fund, the VCF, for just another 5 years.   As those 5 years have gone on, people have become sicker. More and  more responders and survivors have been diagnosed with various cancers,  particularly cancers with long latency periods, and, tragically, more  and more have died from those illnesses.   As people become sicker and pass away, the VCF has functioned exactly  as Congress directed. It has provided those individuals, those first  responders, those survivors, and their families with compensation and  resources they need to get through these difficult times.   But, just as people are getting sicker, the VCF is running out of  money. Last month, the Justice Department announced that, because of  the high demand for claims, because the cancers are more numerous than  anticipated, because more people of the heroes of  9/11 than anticipated are getting sick, the Department would be forced  to cut awards by 50 percent if they were filed by February 1 and 70  percent if they were filed after February 1.   Can you imagine that? You are dying of stomach cancer, unable to  work, unable to leave your house for more than your doctor's  appointments, and waiting for compensation so you can pay off your  house and protect your family before you die, and the award you  anticipated is cut in half or by 70 percent.   Your wife dies after a long struggle with breast cancer, and you are  waiting for your claim to pay her funeral expenses, and your  compensation is cut in half or by 70 percent.    You have such severe gastrointestinal issues that you can only work  part-time. You are waiting for your award to pay for your child's  college tuition, and your claim is cut by 70 percent.   That is not the promise we made to those first responders and  survivors. That is not fulfilling the moral obligation that pushed us  to create the VCF in the first place.   That is failing Lincoln's statement of our duty ``to care for him who  shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.''   That is failing our promise to never forget 9/11 and failing the  brave men and women who helped us on that day and who struggle and  fight to this day.   But that doesn't have to happen. If we pass the Never Forget the  Heroes Act, we can stop these cuts and make the Victim Compensation  Fund permanent, providing responders and survivors the certainty that,  no matter how sick they get, they will have us at their backs and the  resources they need.   I thank my colleagues who have been with us in this fight from the  start, and I thank the 142 bipartisan cosponsors who have already  signed on to this bill.   We will get this done. We must get this done. We will meet our moral  obligations.   We will never forget these heroes.
