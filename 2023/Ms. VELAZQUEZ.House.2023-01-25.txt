 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 399, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023.   Let me begin by welcoming the new chairman of the Small Business  Committee (Mr. Williams of Texas).   The committee has a long tradition of setting partisan differences  aside and working together on behalf of America's small businesses. I  am glad we are off to a good start in the 118th Congress.   Today, we are considering three bills that overwhelmingly passed the  House in the last Congress. As the chairwoman of the House Small  Business Committee in the 117th Congress, I worked closely with my  colleagues on the committee and stakeholders to craft dozens of bills  that will increase access to capital, expand opportunities for free and  low-cost counseling, and boost entrepreneurship. The three bills we are  considering today are a product of that hard work, and I am hopeful  that we will continue in the spirit of bipartisanship and focus on  areas of agreement throughout the 118th Congress.   Turning to our first bill, the Office of Advocacy was established in  1976 to be an independent voice for small businesses within the Federal  Government and is tasked with representing the views of small  businesses before Congress, the White House, and other Federal  agencies.   To that end, the office has regional advocates on the ground that  provide  [[Page H302]]  outreach to small businesses, local chambers of commerce, and other  associations to hear firsthand the concerns of small businesses. The  office works closely with Federal agencies to elevate these concerns  throughout the rulemaking process.   Over the years, their hard work has saved small businesses billions  of dollars in regulatory costs while still accomplishing the important  goals of the regulations. However, their charter does not specifically  state that they have the authority to represent the views of small  businesses before foreign governments and international entities.   H.R. 399 will simply clarify that the Office of Advocacy has the  authority to examine international economic data and represent small  businesses in international discussions, particularly in trade  negotiations.   I thank Chairman Williams, Mr. Luetkemeyer, Mr. Carter of Louisiana,  and Mr. Mfume for their bipartisan work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Luetkemeyer,  Carter, and Mfume for their work on this bill that will give small  businesses a strong voice in the international regulatory arena.   All too often, small businesses' views are drowned out by larger  companies with sophisticated legal departments and armies of lobbyists.  SBA's Office of Advocacy works tirelessly to ensure that small business  interests are heard at all levels of government.   Now that the world is more connected, more and more small businesses  are participating in the global economy. Looking ahead, they will need  a strong voice advocating on their behalf in international discussions  and trade negotiations.   The Office of Advocacy is ready, willing, and able to assume this  responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R. 449,  the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act, which will improve  SBA's data reporting with respect to the microloan program.   Congress created the microloan program in 1991 to make funds  available to nonprofit, community-based lenders who, in turn, make  small-dollar loans to eligible borrowers. Many of these borrowers are  unable to get a traditional loan due to poor credit, no credit history,  or a lack of business experience.   This program reaches various demographic groups that will otherwise  not be served by the private sector or even the SBA's 7(a) program,  especially businesses located in underserved communities.   In fact, in fiscal year 2021, the program delivered more than 4,500  loans to small businesses in these communities, totaling almost $75  million. This fiscal year, the SBA estimates it will assist over 5,700  small businesses, supporting approximately 24,000 jobs.   The bill we are considering today will help Congress and the public  better evaluate the program and its impact on underserved communities.   Despite the program's record of success, many participating  intermediaries report being restricted in their lending activity as a  result of numerous rules governing the program being outdated. The  information received from these reports will assist Congress and the  agency in developing policies to continue the strong performance of the  program.   I applaud the bipartisanship shown by Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim, the  sponsors of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This bill will greatly increase the publicly available information  about the microloan program's performance and impact.   If we intend to continue to support the smallest of small businesses,  especially women- and minority-owned businesses, we need to make sure  the programs targeting them are operating at their best. That starts  with improving the data and information available about where the loans  are going, how affordable they are, and where the gaps in coverage are.   With more data, Congress will be able to monitor the program and  identify areas for improvement.   I thank the gentlemen from Tennessee and New Jersey for their hard  work and collaboration in bringing this bill to the floor today. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R. 400,  the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023.   The SBA's Small Business Investment Company program is a multi- billion-dollar investment program designed to bridge the gap between a  small business owner's need for capital and traditional sources of  financing. It achieves this purpose by partnering private and public  investments in early-stage startup businesses.   It also gives America's small, high-growth companies an opportunity  to fund and grow their innovative ideas and create jobs.   The success of this program can be seen with companies like Apple,  Intel, and FedEx, which all received early stage financing from the  SBICs.   In fiscal year 2021, the combined private capital and SBA-backed  funds totaled $34 billion, which was the highest in program history,  and helped support more than 126,000 jobs. The number of financings to  women-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned small businesses  increased by 36 percent.   Yet, we can do more to ensure the program continues to meet demand.   The Investing in Main Street Act, introduced by my colleagues,  Representatives Chu and Garbarino, will strengthen and grow the SBIC  program by allowing banks and Federal savings associations to invest up  to 15 percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs.   This change brings the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 in line  with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's national bank  charter percentage requirements. It will increase the investment  capital available to SBICs and allow them to invest more in small  businesses.   I applaud Representatives Chu and Garbarino's continued work on this  issue and this bill, and I ask all my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the SBIC program fills the gap between the availability  of venture and private equity capital and the needs of small businesses  in startup and growth situations.   For decades, this program has channeled capital to leading-edge,  high-growth companies. Without it, some of the Nation's most successful  corporations would not be the companies they are today.   H.R. 400 raises the investment cap for banks and Federal savings  associations from 5 percent to 15 percent. This will lead to  significant small business investment by SBICs, which will result in  economic growth in our local communities and job creation.   I applaud Ms. Chu and Mr. Garbarino for their bipartisan work on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.
