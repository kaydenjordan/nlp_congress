 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6414) to amend title 23, United States Code, to  extend the deadline for promulgation of regulations under the tribal  transportation self-governance program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6414         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR PROMULGATION OF                     REGULATIONS UNDER TRIBAL TRANSPORTATION SELF-                    GOVERNANCE PROGRAM.         Section 207(n)(1) of title 23, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (B) by striking ``21 months'' and       inserting ``42 months''; and        (2) in subparagraph (C) by striking ``30 months'' and       inserting ``48 months''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6414.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6414.   I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for including the  Tribal Transportation Self-Governance Program in the FAST Act.   The FAST Act requires the Department of Transportation to use a  negotiated rulemaking process to establish the regulations to implement  the program. It also set deadlines for the issuance of the regulations.   H.R. 6414 would extend these deadlines. This bill would ensure that  there is an opportunity for a true negotiated rulemaking process that  is not one-sided and that respects Tribal self-determination.   Without this extension, I am concerned that the Department will move  forward with implementing the program in a way that is not helpful to  the Tribes of America. This would undermine the intent of the previous  FAST Act and would lead to a lack of Tribal participation in the  program.   I thank the Sitka Tribe of Alaska for their leadership and work on  this program and issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6414.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 756) to reauthorize and amend the Marine Debris Act  to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 756.  [[Page H7643]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), and I ask unanimous consent  that he may control that time to manage the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hunter and Ranking  Member Garamendi and, of course, Peter DeFazio.   This is a good piece of legislation. I had a House bill similar in  fact, too. This came over from the Senate side, but I am not really  interested in whose bill it is but, more likely, getting things done.  So this is a good bill.   And debris is what I am interested in as one of our biggest issues;  it has been well explained by both speakers prior to me. It is getting  bigger, like I say. What is it? Tenfold more. And the tonnage is  already there.   We have to look at preventing the debris, but also what do we do once  it is in the ocean. I have some ideas. And, hopefully, later on, we can  explore those ideas, how we will recover and utilize that debris,  because it does harm our maritime lives, and it makes the ocean really  a garbage dump, and we don't want that.   So this is a good piece of legislation. I thank each person that has  been involved in it, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
