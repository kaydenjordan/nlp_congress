 Madam Speaker, I rise today determined to fulfill our  sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies,  foreign and domestic. Last week's violent insurrection on the Capitol  was a stain on our democracy. A riotous mob incited by the President  stormed these very Halls, beat and murdered police officers, planted  pipe bombs, and left our Nation shocked and in mourning.   The President's rhetoric, actions, and refusal to accept  responsibilities are an imminent threat to our Nation. I vote to  impeach the President. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
