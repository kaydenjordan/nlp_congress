 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share  the story of Judith and her daughter KC.   Like all mothers, Judith only wants the best for her children--to  live a full and purposeful life, the ability to pursue their dreams and  reach their utmost potential. However, at a very young age of 11, KC  was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This health condition  causes KC to have uncontrollable mood swings, to perceive reality  differently, to see and hear things that aren't there, and to sometimes  even become disconnected with reality altogether.   It has taken an enormous emotional and physical toll on KC and her  family.   As a mom of two kids, I cannot imagine the difficulties that Judith  has faced. Some nights, Judith had to hold her daughter tightly all  night long to help her through her psychosis and her panic, not to  mention the emergency hospitalizations.   Living with this condition has been a lifelong struggle for KC and  for her  [[Page H308]]  family. It requires a combination of daily medications, weekly  psychiatric treatments, hospital visits, and constant support and  medical care. And that is only half the story.   Without this intensive treatment, KC would simply be unable to  function. With it, she has the tools she needs to live a healthy and  productive life.   When KC was younger, she was covered by a family healthcare policy,  but even then, Judith needed to pinch pennies and barely scrape by due  to the high cost of insurance co-pays and deductibles, costing her $13-  to $15,000 per month. To try to keep up with her never ending medical  bills, Judith used all of her retirement savings.   When KC reached adulthood, she was bumped off the family insurance  plan. Fortunately, KC qualified for healthcare coverage through the ACA  Medicaid expansion. Without it, she and her family would have had no  viable alternative.   The ACA provided KC with access to reliable, consistent medical care  that has been vital to her well-being and has allowed her to thrive.                                time  1045    I am very happy to share that KC finished her bachelor's degree in  May and is now pursuing her master's in counseling psychology.   With her own struggles as her inspiration, she decided to make  psychology her life's work, and Judith says that KC is now the person  whom everybody goes to anytime one has a problem or needs comfort.   Without the healthcare coverage that KC obtained from the Affordable  Care Act, she would never have been able to obtain private health  insurance due to her preexisting conditions and rigorous health needs.  With the Affordable Care Act, Judith was able to see her daughter  realize her dreams.   I know all of you who are parents want the same for your children;  so, when I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about  eliminating KC's healthcare coverage, I get a pit at the bottom of my  stomach. This is not about politics; this is about people's lives. This  is about KC's life and Judith's life and the lives of 20 million  Americans who have gained healthcare coverage because of the Affordable  Care Act.   Today, I rise to speak up for KC and for Judith and for the millions  of other Americans whose lives would be put in jeopardy if we repeal  the ACA without our having an adequate replacement.   I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider this reckless repeal  that would throw our entire healthcare system into chaos and take  lifesaving care away from those who need it the most.                            ____________________
