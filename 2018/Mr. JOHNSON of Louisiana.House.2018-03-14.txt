 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for this  time this evening and all of our strong colleagues who are standing  with us today for the Constitution and for the sanctity of human life.   You know, Psalm 127 says:         Children are a heritage from the Lord, a reward from him.    For most women, of course, finding out they are pregnant is certainly  a beautiful moment in their life. Often, it is an answer to years of  prayer. However, of course, there are times when the heavy  responsibility of carrying a child can bring uncertainty. That is why  the work of thousands of pro-life pregnancy centers throughout our  Nation is so vital.   Hundreds of thousands of women have sought the guidance and the  services of these pregnancy centers nationwide, and they have been  embraced and supported with unconditional love and care throughout  their entire pregnancies. These centers serve the woman, the child, and  their whole family.   There are more than six pregnancy care centers in Louisiana's Fourth  Congressional District--that is my district--from the Community Care  Center, the Northwest Louisiana Crisis Pregnancy Center, and Mary's  House in the northern part of our district to the Community Pregnancy  Center, the New Life Crisis Pregnancy Center, and the Cenla Pregnancy  Center in the southern part of our district. These centers work day in  and day out to serve our communities. I know these folks well. They are  selfless servants down in the trenches.   Over the past two decades, I have provided pro bono legal services to  almost all of these centers and many more around the country, and I  have often defended their causes in court because I believe so very  strongly in what they do: they save lives and they provide critical  care, like performing ultrasounds and counseling services and parenting  classes and so much more, and they do this at zero cost to the persons  who are receiving these vital services.   They also do it with zero Federal funding, by the way, and they save  their clients and taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars every  year.   As fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and friends, I think  Members of Congress have to stand with these pregnancy care centers  throughout our districts, and we ought to support these women and their  children and their families, especially in times as precious as  pregnancy when they need us most.   As Dr. Harris mentioned, on March 20, my former colleagues at the  Alliance Defending Freedom will stand before the U.S. Supreme Court,  and they will argue on behalf of National Institute of Family and Life  Advocates and its affiliated pregnancy centers in California.   All of us ask and expect the High Court to protect the freedom of  speech not just for pregnancy care centers, but for anyone who would be  forced by the government to speak a message that contradicts their  sincerely held beliefs. It is absolutely absurd for the State of  California to try to force pro-life centers to provide information on  abortion services.   The outcome of this case could not only affect the freedom of speech  for every American, it could save countless innocent lives. This is a  pivotal moment in our Nation's history, and we pray the Court will  uphold our fundamental liberty, the sanctity of every single human  life, and the best of our American traditions.
