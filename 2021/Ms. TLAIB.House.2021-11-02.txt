 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kathy Aro for her  17 years of service to the families of southeastern Michigan through  her work at the Accounting Aid Society. Kathy has led the Accounting  Aid Society in fulfilling its mission to help put the residents of  southeast Michigan on the pathway to financial stability.   Her leadership has been a catalyst for massive growth of Accounting  Aid Society's free income tax assistance program, which puts hard- earned dollars back into the pockets of many of our vulnerable  families.   Under Kathy's leadership, Accounting Aid Society has expanded its  programming to include Accounting Aid Academy, which provides basic  small business guidance and financial coaching.   In short, Kathy has been an outstanding community leader, cultivating  Accounting Aid Society into a trusted community partner.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Kathy's outstanding  contributions to the communities of Michigan's 13th Congressional  District as we wish her well in her retirement.                            ____________________
