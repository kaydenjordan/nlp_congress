 Madam Chair, I rise in favor of the Chabot amendment.   Our country faces serious threats around the globe. We have cyber  threats coming from China, Russia, and Iran, and others. Iran is also  pursuing nuclear weapons that threaten our friends and our ally,  Israel, and indeed the rest of the world.   While ISIS is defeated and on the run, radical islamic terrorism  remains one of our Nation's greatest threats, thanks in part to Iran's  actions as a leading state sponsor of terrorism.   It is, therefore, extremely irresponsible to take our attention and  resources off of these known and proven threats to American national  security and divert those funds and attention to climate change.   The intelligence community, which is tasked with protecting Americans  from fiscal and cyberattacks, should not bear the burden of silly,  politically correct, left-wing social policy. But just as Democrats  politicized military policy with the NDAA, here they go again with the  intelligence policy.   That is a mistake, it is irresponsible, and that is why I support  this amendment to strip out this silly idea and refocus the  intelligence community on the actual threats to our national security.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
