 Mr. Speaker, in 2002, after extensive  research by the Department of Energy (DOE), scientists concluded that  Yucca Mountain met all the requirements to act as a repository for high  level radioactive waste. After which, the DOE applied for the license  from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to begin construction of the  Yucca Mountain facility.   Unfortunately, due to political brinksmanship, those plans have  stalled indefinitely, despite the fact that ratepayers have contributed  nearly $30 Billion to the nuclear waste fund, which is specifically  designated to be used for Yucca Mountain.   The federal government and taxpayers have dedicated enormous  resources to completing the nuclear storage facility at Yucca Mountain.  However, the Obama Administration did everything in its power to stall  the completion of the facility, holding up construction under political  red tape--even though the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's own safety  evaluation found it would not be a threat to the local population of  Nevada as it would benefit all of America.   Thankfully, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 will  finally remove  [[Page H1363]]  unnecessary burdens to make much needed improvements to our national  nuclear waste strategy.   This legislation is especially important to the residents of South  Carolina. South Carolina ratepayers have invested over $1.3 billion  into Yucca over the last 30 years--that's in addition to the billions  of dollars collected from ratepayers across the country. During this  time, states like South Carolina have remained de facto repositories  for nuclear waste. The federal government should finish what they  started and complete the Yucca Mountain license application.   Currently, SNF is stored in 121 different neighborhoods, across 39  states--all waiting to be moved to a permanent location. The Nuclear  Waste Policy Amendments Act will address the concerns of communities  across the country, in a cost-effective manner, and passed the Energy  and Commerce Committee with bi-partisan support, 49 members voting in  favor and only 4 against. I am grateful for the opportunity to support  this legislation, and am hopeful that it will provide much needed  clarification on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.   I am grateful that text from my bill, the Sensible Nuclear Waste  Disposition Act was included in this bill and thank Chairman John  Shimkus for his leadership.                            ____________________
