 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 266, the Democratic  proposal for funding the Department of the Interior, the Environmental  Protection Agency, and related agencies for the remainder of fiscal  year 2019.   This bill is almost entirely a Senate product. As such, it ignores  the bipartisan priorities of the House and, perhaps even worse, it  abdicates congressional responsibility under the Constitution to keep  the executive branch in check.   Before I get into the details of the bill, however, I want to take a  moment to congratulate my friend and colleague, Betty McCollum, for her  appointment as the new chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee  on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.   She has been a tireless advocate for programs under the jurisdiction  of this subcommittee, a firm but fair overseer of agency operations, a  tough negotiator and, above all, a good friend. She will be an  outstanding chair. I wish her well, and I look forward to working with  her in both of our new capacities.    Madam Speaker, over the past year, Ms. McCollum and I worked in  collaboration to write a bill representing the needs and priorities of  the House. We held nine budget oversight hearings, including four  hearings with nearly 80 Tribal leaders regarding programs that honor  treaty rights promised to our Native American brothers and sisters.   We wrote a bill that accommodated, in some shape or form, roughly 93  percent of all House Member requests, regardless of party. On top of  that, when the bill came to the House floor, 70 amendments were debated  and 50 were adopted.   And when told to begin negotiating the House-passed bill last year,  we defended it against competing priorities in the Senate. We came  together on numerous topics to write report language directives that  maintain a check on the executive branch.   I am extremely proud of our work. We are so close to a final product.  We shouldn't be throwing it all away with the bill before us today, a  bill that the Senate has already said it will not consider and the  President will not sign.   Let me highlight just a few of the House priorities missing in this  product which concern me the most, and which are likely to concern our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   First and foremost, the bill leaves behind all congressional report  language directives. These directives are critical for keeping the  executive branch in check. These directives are also the conduit  through which the concerns of our constituents back home are heard  directly by agency officials at the highest levels.   All of our colleagues in the House who have worked with their  constituents and worked with the Appropriations Committee over the past  year to craft these directives understand the effort that went into  them and the impact they have on people's lives back home. The bill  before us today throws that away, all that important work.   We included language to protect the California WaterFix from  frivolous lawsuits in order to move forward a water supply project that  is critically important to my constituents. By taking up this Senate  bill, I am prevented from even fighting for my constituents.   But this isn't about my priorities; this is about all of the  bipartisan priorities of the House of Representatives that are flushed  away by rubber-stamping the Senate bill.   The bill provides $12 million less than last year's House-passed bill  for the U.S. Geological Survey's natural hazards research and early  warning system, the earthquake system, and $21 million less for the  Forest Service and Department of the Interior to clear dead and dying  trees from our forests in order to prevent more catastrophic wildfires  like the kind we experienced in my own State of California.                                time  0930    These ounce-of-prevention programs save lives and save money. With so  many fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, and other natural disasters in  recent years, these programs should be a higher funding priority than  they are in this bill.   Additionally, this bill provides $77 million less than the House  Republican bill for EPA's WIFIA, brownfields, and Superfund remedial  programs. These programs provide regulatory relief, leverage Federal  dollars, improve water infrastructure, and spur economic development.   Instead, this bill increases funding for EPA regulatory programs. In  many parts of the country, particularly agricultural States, EPA  regulations and additional red tape are a bipartisan concern.   Even popular EPA grant programs, like the diesel emission reduction  grants, DERA, and targeted airshed grants, were significantly reduced  in this bill.   The DERA and targeted airshed grants are essential to my home State  of California, where air quality remains one of our biggest concerns.  My State and constituents rely on these grant programs to help improve  air quality and public health by accelerating the replacement of older  engines with new, cleaner engines.   For our National Park System, the bill before us today falls $27  million short of the House-passed level for park operations and  reducing the maintenance backlog. With park visitation on the rise,  this is no time to cut corners on the budget.   This bill also lacks important reforms for implementation of the  Endangered Species Act, and it lacks the funding needed to prevent the  sage grouse from being listed. Failure to prevent a listing will hurt  local economies in 11 Western States and undermine our Nation's energy  security.   This bill is almost $10 million below last year's House-passed bill  in funding for historic preservation grants, including civil rights  grants and grants to underserved communities.   The House felt so strongly about these programs that it added $5  million in multiple amendments on the House floor last year. Why would  we give up all that funding by acceding to the Senate?   Last, but certainly not least, this bill falls $160 million short of  last year's House-passed bill in funding treaty obligations to American  Indians and Alaska Natives through the Department of the Interior and  the Indian Health Service.   Earlier this week, USA Today was the latest news agency to run a  front page article on the sad state of healthcare in Indian Country,  which is funded mostly through the Indian Health Service in this bill.  Funding for the Indian Health Service in this bill is $135 million  below last year's House-passed level.   For an Indian health system that already is rationing the kind of  healthcare that most of us take for granted, every dollar makes a  difference in the quality of life of one of our fellow Americans whose  ancestors paid in advance with their lives and their land to guarantee  that the Federal Government would care for the health of their  descendants. Properly funding this obligation is not optional.   The House heard from nearly 80 tribal leaders in hearings last year  about the importance of funding these programs. Let's not turn our  backs on them now, acceding to the Senate position.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons and others, I am strongly opposed to  this bill, H.R. 266, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to stand up for their constituents' priorities and oppose the  bill as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the former chairman of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to point out that leaders in the Border Patrol want a barrier as a part  of securing the border. Most people the majority leader mentioned are  also in favor of a barrier as part of securing the border, as that is  something that acts like, using a football metaphor, an offensive line.  It slows people down in order for technology and people at that point  to pick up people who are coming into this country illegally with drugs  or otherwise illegal activity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from the great State of Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I point out to my friend from the State of  Washington that the earthquake warning system that we both worked on is  below the House number by $9.4 million. So that is unfortunate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I have served on the Appropriations Committee for a long  time, and I am proud of the work that we have been able to accomplish  in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, which is the history of the  Appropriations Committee.   Unfortunately, the Senate bill before us today forces us to choose  between abdicating our constitutional obligations and underfunding  important programs in a way that is unacceptable to me and my  constituents. I am afraid this is a bad precedent, and I hope that this  does not happen in the future: we just accept whatever the Senate  determines is the proper path forward.   I am disheartened by the Democrats' closed process that throws our  bipartisan House priorities and will neither  [[Page H496]]  secure our borders nor reopen the government. Rather than passing bills  to score political points, I urge my friends on the other side of the  aisle to work with us to find a solution that reflects the will of the  House, will pass in the Senate, and will be signed by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    In its current form, yes.    Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration has $21  million less for a major House priority than what was included in the  fiscal year 2019 Interior and Environment bill passed in the last  Congress. I am talking about doing more to prevent and stop  catastrophic wildfires.   For the past 4 fiscal years, the House has prioritized funding to  improve our national forests and other Federal forestland through the  Department of the Interior's and the Forest Service's hazardous fuels  reduction programs. These programs use methods such as thinning,  prescribed burns, and removing underbrush to help unhealthy forests  return to a healthy condition.   In fiscal year 2018, Congress provided $614 million for these  programs. Last year, the House-passed bill increased that amount by $30  million for fiscal year 2019. The bill before us today, H.R. 266, only  provides a $9 million increase. My motion to recommit will fix this  major problem and save lives.   The increase is offset by a reduction in the Bureau of Land  Management's deferred maintenance account and the Forest Service's  capital improvement and maintenance account. These infrastructure  programs received significant increases in fiscal year 2018, and they  have a large carryover balance.   Mr. Speaker, my bottom line is that I cannot support a bill that does  less to prevent catastrophic wildfires. My home State of California  experienced deadly and record-setting wildfires last year. I was with  the President; former Governor Brown and current Governor Newsom; our  minority leader; and our colleague, Congressman LaMalfa, in Paradise  late last year. In 2017, I also visited Santa Rosa with my colleague  from the northern part of the State, Congressman  Mike Thompson. The  devastation I saw was indescribable and heartbreaking.   While we can and should continue to debate what more needs to be done  to improve the health of our Nation's forests, I am proud that the  Interior and Environment Subcommittee, on a bipartisan and bicameral  basis, has led the way.   The subcommittee successfully negotiated a forest management reform  package and fire-borrowing fix as part of the fiscal year 2018 omnibus  appropriations bill. It allowed for more on-the-ground forest  management activities. These are the activities that prevent the  natural cycle of fires from exploding into terrible conditions.                                time  1045    It provided smarter budgeting for wildfire suppression costs. The  budgeting reforms go into effect in fiscal year 2020.   I am certain that the new chair on the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, my distinguished colleague and friend  from Minnesota, looks forward to that. It has been a pleasure to work  with her as partners on the forest management and wildland fire  budgeting issues.   Yet, there is more that we need to do. Today we can start by  supporting this motion. It will send a strong message to the Senate  that they should focus on this issue. More importantly, it will show  Californians and other Americans affected by wildfire that the House is  doing something about this problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the motion, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
