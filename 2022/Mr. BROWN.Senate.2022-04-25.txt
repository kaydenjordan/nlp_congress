 Mr. President, I thank the other Senator from Ohio,  Senator Portman, for his work in Ukraine. I was with the Ukrainian  group over the last week or so and talked about the work Senator  Portman has done. And we also talked about how Putin has just been  shocked by the passion and the effectiveness and the strength and the  courage of the Ukrainian opposition, surely, and also Putin has been  shocked by President Biden's skill at putting together this coalition  in opposition to the Russians.   Germany, who hadn't really played in an exercise like this, in an  action like this in decades, and Sweden and Finland and Switzerland-- countries that simply were neutral. And I appreciate Senator Portman's  work on that and the President of the United States, and it is why we  are doing a reasonably good job as a world, as a world community, in  helping with refugees who have gone to Poland and Moldova and other  areas while we are getting arms to them, while we are doing damage to  the Russian economy and will continue to do that. So I thank my friend  from Cincinnati.              Nominations of Lael Brainard and Lisa DeNell Cook    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in joining me in voting to  confirm the  [[Page S2124]]  nominations of Lael Brainard to be Vice Chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Lisa Cook to be a Member of  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.   Dr. Brainard and Dr. Cook are highly qualified economists with  decades of experience, having provided exemplary service to their  profession and to this country.   Since 2014, Dr. Brainard has served as a Member of the Board of  Governors to the Federal Reserve. She has helped oversee the Fed's  important financial stability work. She has worked to create a better  payment system that works for consumers and for small banks.   Prior to serving on the Fed, Dr. Brainard was Under Secretary for  International Affairs at Treasury, where she played a critical role in  helping support our country's recovery from the Wall Street-induced  financial crisis in 2008.   She has a long history of bipartisan support and bipartisan work. She  served in administrations of both parties. She was Deputy National  Economic Adviser in the Clinton administration. She was a staff  economist at the Council of Economic Advisers during the first George  Bush administration.   And in between her public service to our country, she served as a  professor of applied economics at one of the nation's great  institutions, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Throughout this distinguished career, Dr. Brainard has been not just  a good economist, but she has been a persistent advocate for working  families and for communities who have been left on their own for too  long.   She understands the role of government and the role of the Federal  Reserve should be--it is not always successful in getting them there; I  think these new nominees will do that--putting workers at the center of  our economy and putting the workers at the center of our financial  regulatory system, and putting workers at the center of what we do  here.   She led the way at modernizing and strengthening the Community  Reinvestment Act, a landmark civil rights law passed to begin undoing  the legacy of redlining and lending discrimination, spurring  investments in neighborhoods and communities. The CRA has fallen short  many times, partly because of the last administration and the damage it  did, but we are breathing new life into the CRA. Dr. Lael Brainard has  done a good job in keeping it alive and setting the stage.   She led decisive, bipartisan action to use the Fed's emergency  lending and monetary policy tools to support families through the  COVID-19 crisis.   Like Dr. Brainard, Dr. Cook is a leading economist with years of  research and international experience in monetary policy, banking, and  financial crises. She knows that workers drive our economic growth. She  knows how important their local communities are.   Dr. Cook spent her formative years in the South, growing up in  Milledgeville, GA. She spent a significant portion of her career in the  industrial Midwest. She has seen how economic policy set here and  economic policy set at the Federal Reserve affect all kinds of  different people in different parts of the country.   She graduated from Spelman College, one of the great institutions in  this country. She was a Marshall scholar and a Truman scholar. Whom do  we know that are both of those things? And she chose both, very  exclusive honors and academic disciplines. She studied at Oxford  University. She earned a Ph.D. in economics, again, from one of our  great institutions in this country, the University of California  Berkeley.   She is a tenured professor of economics and international relations  at one of the great institutions in my part of the country, Michigan  State University. She taught at the Harvard Kennedy School of  Government. She served on the Council of Economic Advisers during the  eurozone crisis and at the Department of Treasury.   Yet--yet--Mr. President, despite her extensive experience, despite  her broad support, a small but really, really loud minority, far  outside the mainstream, have engaged in a smear campaign against Dr.  Cook. It is emblematic of the sorts of attacks that Black and Brown  Americans, particularly women, have encountered for far too long here.   I won't go through what has happened in my committee. I chair the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. I won't lay out--for  one thing, the Senators on my side of the aisle know it, and the  Senators on their side of the aisle don't want to think about it--what  has happened with very, very qualified, accomplished Black women coming  out of my committee and how few Republicans have voted for them.  Counting one after another, they get zero votes or 1 vote or 2 votes  out of 12.   Women, and certainly Black women, know all too well what it is like  to be called ``inexperienced'' when you are anything but. They know  what it is like to be told that your qualifications are never enough,  no matter how extensive they are, no matter how impressive they are.   These naysayers wrongly claim that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the  standards for this position--standards that only seem to apply for  certain nominees. Like the game of Whac-A-Mole, each time these  assertions and allegations are rebutted--and each time they are  effectively rebutted--a new, more untethered one arises.   She is unquestionably qualified. Dr. Lisa Cook is unquestionably  qualified. If confirmed, she would be the first Black woman ever in the  100-plus year history of the Fed to serve on the Board. Think of that.  In 1913, the Fed started, and 109 years later, seven people--not one  person on the Fed, not one Chair; seven people on the Fed, most times-- but with seven spots on the Fed, she will be the first Black woman ever  in 109 years. Think about that.   Dr. Cook and Dr. Brainard will be excellent additions to the Fed. We  need them on the job now. As Americans face rising prices caused by  corporate greed and the global pandemic and Putin's war, having a full  Board has never been more vital than now. I urge my colleagues to join  me in supporting Dr. Lael Brainard and Dr. Lisa Cook--their  nominations--so they can get to work for the American people.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
