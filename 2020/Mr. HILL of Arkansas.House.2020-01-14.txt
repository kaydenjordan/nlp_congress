 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize John  P. Gill of Little Rock, Arkansas, who is being honored with Preserve  Arkansas' 2019 Parker Westbrook Award for Lifetime Achievement.   This award recognizes significant individual achievement in historic  preservation and is Preserve Arkansas' only award for achievement in  preservation over a long period of time.  [[Page H225]]    Throughout his career, both as an attorney and as a historian, John's  passion for preservation was evident by his service in a number of  capacities throughout central Arkansas, including sitting on the board  of Little Rock Visitor Information Center Foundation and leading the  efforts to preserve and restore Curran Hall. He also was president of  the board of Preserve Arkansas in 2010.   John has demonstrated his passion for preservation through his  commitment to service and leadership. I congratulate my friend John  Gill on receiving this year's Parker Westbrook Award for Lifetime  Achievement.                            ____________________
