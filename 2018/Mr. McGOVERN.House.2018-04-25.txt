 Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate the 29th birthday of  Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama of Tibetan Buddhism.   He was chosen for his position on May 15, 1995, by His Holiness the  Dalai Lama. Two days later, when he was only 6 years old, the Chinese  Government detained him and his family. The Panchen Lama has not been  heard from since. Twenty-three years later, he is one of the world's  longest held prisoners of conscience.   People from all over the world--representatives of governments, the  United Nations, and civil society organizations--have repeatedly asked  to see him, without success.   What kind of government steals away a child?   The Panchen Lama's disappearance symbolizes the violations of  religious freedom that take place in Tibetan areas of China on a daily  basis.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of his birthday, please join me in calling on  the Chinese Government to free the true Panchen Lama.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Missouri, for her leadership. I am honored to join her  and other distinguished colleagues this evening in recognition of  Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month.   Preventing genocide and mass atrocities is a moral imperative that  deserves to be at the very top of our priority list. Mass atrocities  are large-scale, deliberate attacks against civilian populations. They  include genocide but also crimes against humanity, war crimes, and  ethnic cleansing.   After the Holocaust--the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored  persecution and murder of 6 million Jews and members of other  persecuted groups by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1941  and 1945--people all around the world vowed to never again stand by in  the face of genocide; but since then, mass atrocities, including  genocide, have been committed in Indonesia, Cambodia, Guatemala, East  Timor, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sudan, and South Sudan, among  other places. Hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered,  tortured, disappeared, or suffered sexual violence; and millions more  have been forced to flee with profound humanitarian, political, and  national security consequences.   I don't believe the world's failure to prevent atrocities is because  no one cares. In this era of instant communication powered by social  media, most people I meet have seen and passionately condemn the  ongoing atrocities in Syria and elsewhere. Nor is it because no one  knows what is happening. Many, many people warned us for years about  the potential for genocide against the Rohingya in Burma.   The problem is that we have not been very good at turning knowledge  and moral indignation into action to prevent a bad situation from  worsening. We must do better. We must do more. This year, in the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission, which I co-chair along with my  colleague Congressman Randy Hultgren, we are looking at the tools we  have as U.S. policymakers to prevent mass atrocities and asking how we  can strengthen them.   We are asking what it would mean to institutionalize an atrocity  prevention's lens so we don't wait until it is so late and the problem  is so big that all we can do is lament the immorality and the  inhumanity and then provide humanitarian aid to the victims and  survivors. As we undertake this effort, we know that there is a lot of  good work already underway in both Chambers of Congress and on both  sides of the aisle to find new ways forward.   One example is H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities  Prevention Act of 2017, led by Representative Ann Wagner and  cosponsored by both myself and Representative Hultgren. We also  recognize that government officials cannot do this work alone. We need  civil society, in all its diversity, to help us. We need community  associations, churches, synagogues, mosques, schools, and businesses to  take a stand against hate speech, to teach and live tolerance, to  document and denounce human rights violations, to open their hearts to  reconciliation based on justice. We need to get to the point where our  societies recognize and honor every person's innate human dignity.   And I want to take this opportunity to salute one of the many  organizations that are doing just this kind of work. STAND is a  student-led movement to end mass atrocities and genocide by organizing  and educating their peers and communities. I first met student leaders  of STAND in 2005 and 2006, when they were part of the national movement  that brought the genocide happening in Darfur, Sudan, to public  awareness. They were my teachers during that time.   Tonight, representatives of STAND are here listening to this debate.  They push us to do better, and I thank them for their commitment and  their vision.   Mr. Speaker, mass atrocities are human rights violations on a grand  scale. We must find new strategies to prevent them from happening and  more effective strategies to interrupt and stop them at the very  earliest stages, should they begin to unfold.   Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Chamber, all of us in this country,  need to do more, because I believe, if the United States of America  stands for anything, we stand for human rights. We need to be better.  We need to be more effective in preventing these mass atrocities and  these genocides.  [[Page H3572]]    So I am very proud to stand with my colleagues in these efforts. I  want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for her incredible  leadership, and I am honored to participate in this Special Order with  her.
