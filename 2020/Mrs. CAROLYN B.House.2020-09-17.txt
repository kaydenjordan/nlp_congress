 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. As a member of the New  York City Council, I became the first woman in history to give birth  while in office as a council member. There had been many men who had  become fathers, but I was the first woman. So I know firsthand how  physically draining and stressful it is to work while pregnant.   Some of the only good news coming out of the COVID-19 lockdown is  that there has been a dramatic drop in the number of premature births.   In Denmark, the rate of babies born preterm dropped by 90 percent  during the lockdown. So the accommodations in this bill can keep  mothers and babies safe. It is strongly pro-family.   This bill is an incredible step in the right direction. Once we  ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, we will have an anchor in the  Constitution to pass even more robust protections for women and  families.   I urge a strong ``yes.'' It is long overdue.
