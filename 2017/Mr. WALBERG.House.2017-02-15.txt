 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 66.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 66, a resolution to  protect retirement savers.   During the final days of the Obama administration--in fact, the final  hours--the Department of Labor created a regulatory loophole that  threatens the retirement security of working families. We are here  today to use Congress' authority under the Congressional Review Act to  close that loophole by blocking a misguided regulation from taking  effect.   The regulation paves the way for States to force certain employers to  automatically enroll their employees into government IRAs. States would  be allowed to skirt Federal law and deny workers important protections  designed to safeguard their retirement savings.   The Obama administration's action is somewhat perplexing. The  Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, has enjoyed strong  bipartisan support for decades. As President Ford said when he signed  the law, the American people have ``greater assurances that retirement  dollars will be there when they are needed.'' Yet, over 40 years later,  the same administration that frequently touted the importance of  consumer protections moved to exempt States from ERISA.                                time  1430    The question is why. To facilitate the creation of government-run  plans that  [[Page H1210]]  would lack basic protections for retirement savers? As a result,  workers and retirees would have nowhere to turn if their savings were  mismanaged.   Let's be honest about what this regulation is really about. It is  part of an assault on small business retirement plans that began under  the Obama administration. First, small businesses were hit by the  fiduciary rule that would make it harder for them to access the  financial advice they need to set up retirement plans for their  employees. Then the Obama administration created a last-minute  regulatory loophole that could discourage small businesses from  offering retirement plans in the first place. As a result, many  families could soon realize, If you like your 401(k) plan, you may not  be able to keep it.   Because of this loophole, taxpayers also are at risk. Many of the  States leading the charge on these government-run plans have a long  history of mismanaging public employee pensions. Today there is an  estimated $5 trillion in unfunded State pension promises--$5 trillion.  That figure is completely unsustainable. It begs the question: Will  taxpayers or retirement savers foot the bill if these government-run  IRAs are similarly mismanaged?   However, we are not here today to debate the merits of State policy.  To be clear, States should be free to experiment with new retirement  options, and more options are certainly needed. It is up to the voters  in each State to hold their elected officials accountable. The point of  this debate is that States should not be exempt from a law that has,  for decades, provided important protections for retirement savers. If  States want to come up with new ways to help workers save for  retirement, they can. But they should follow the law in the process.   The goal of this resolution is simple. It is to uphold protections  Congress--including Members of both parties--have long afforded  retirement savers. Today we can close a regulatory loophole that would  be detrimental to the retirement security of hardworking Americans, and  we can ensure retirement savers in every State continue to have the  same protections under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to support  strong protections for retirement savers by voting in favor of H.J.  Res. 66.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the immediate past chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Speaker, I guess the point that I would make again  is not the fact that we are trying to stop States from doing this. In  fact, this CRA does not do that at all. It just simply says we express  our concern that States would be allowed as a result of what was put  through in midnight fashion that exempted States from having to come  under the same protections of ERISA that we would expect to be covered  for all retirement plans. That is the challenge. We want to make sure  that retirees' incomes are protected in a secure, safe way, and that is  the value of ERISA. This proposal or the rule that was put through did  not cover that, and that is our concern, again, protecting retirees.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to make note that, as we discuss this here today, there have  been points made about businesses wanting this change, they want to  work with the States, and they are concerned about liabilities. Well,  if that were the case, we wouldn't have endorsements of this coming  from the Chamber of Commerce, Air Conditioning Contractors of America,  American Benefits Council, NFIB, just looking through, the Small  Business and Entrepreneurship Council, National Federation of  Independent Business, National Electrical Contractors Association,  National Black Chamber of Commerce, and I could go on and on,  businesses and the business associations and groups that deal with this  and have concern about their employees, their retirees, having a good  and safe mechanism by which to have their retirement savings protected,  supporting our efforts here to take back what took place under the  cover of darkness, as it were, which took retiree savings off the  benefit of ERISA. I just want that to be made clear.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We are certainly willing to work with the States and would concur  that there ought to be a laboratory.   But again, our concern, and basically the only concern, that this  resolution deals with is that they be managed in such a way that they  come under the protections given under ERISA. And why do we say that?   Well, we look at, for instance, Illinois' unfunded liability. We are  looking at $114.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016--a State plan  managed by, yes, an outside manager--but $114.8 billion under. We look  at California Public Employees' Retirement System, CalPERS, which has a  $228.2 billion shortfall in funding. Oregon's unfunded actuarial  liability of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, again,  managed by someone for Oregon, of $21.8 billion. If we looked at it all  put together, we have over $5 trillion unfunded liability for State  plans managed by some outside source.   That is where our concern comes from--this rule that was put  through--that takes people out of the protections of ERISA. So we are  saying: Have at it, States, but do it according to the rules and the  protections that are there. That is all we are asking. We want  retirees' savings to be protected for the purposes that they planned  for and not come up short some day because of a lack of care and the  coverage of ERISA on their plans.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are not opposing voluntary plans. We are  not opposing States setting up plans that will encourage retirement. We  are not opposing that. We are just saying we want to make sure they are  protected under the same requirements of ERISA that all other plans  are. We want to make sure that those dollars are there when the people  need them. That is all we are saying. We are not opposed to voluntary  or plans for retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Roskam), my colleague and good friend, the chairman of the Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter,  undersigned, representing thousands of businesses, individual  employees, and retirees from almost two dozen specific groups in  support of H.J. Res. 66.                                                  February 13, 2017.        To the Members of the United States Congress: The       undersigned organizations, representing thousands of       businesses, express our support for H.J. Res. 66 and H.J.       Res. 67, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional       Review Act (``CRA'') to invalidate the Department of Labor's       (``DOL'') ``safe harbor'' regulations on Savings Arrangements       Established by State and Political Subdivisions for Non-      Governmental Employees.        These ``safe harbor'' regulations allow states and cities       to mandate private employer participation in state-sponsored       automatic IRA programs. It also provides that states that       offer these programs are not subject to ERISA despite       considerable opinions to the contrary. Thus the DOL is       encouraging state and local governments to provide private       sector employees retirement programs that do not have the       same high-level protections as other private employer-      sponsored plans.        Below we highlight a number of our concerns with the ``safe       harbor.''        Lost worker protections--States offering these plans to       private sector employees are not subject to ERISA, therefore       limiting the protections for workers in these plans.        Different standards from state to state result in an       administrative quagmire for employers--States can and will       have different rules for their programs, so employers       operating in multiple states, or just with workers from       multiple states, will have to track the complex web of       varying rules to ensure compliance.        Fewer employer plans, especially among small businesses--If       a state mandates auto-IRAs, some employers will decide to       avoid taking on the work of offering their own plans and let       the state take it on instead, resulting in the loss of       significant retirement savings opportunities for their       workers.        Mismanagement of state pension funds--Many states have       mismanaged their public employee retirement systems, and it's       not clear they'll do a better job controlling assets of       millions of small private sector savers. Also, some state       pension funds restrict investments to favor state initiatives       or engage in politically motivated investment and divestment       schemes instead of investing in the economic interest of the       workers.        Imposes a mandate on private employers--The ``safe harbor''       requires that the state program mandate employer       participation even though retirement savings plans are       traditionally voluntary.        We urge Congress to take timely action under the CRA to       vitiate these misguided regulations. We thank you for       addressing this important issue.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just make one comment that, when my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle had both Houses and the White  House and the opportunity to do these reforms, they weren't done. Yet,  now, when we stand with great concern because of a midnight rule that  was put through that takes away the security of retirees in programs  that will be, as I said earlier, foisted upon employers to  automatically enroll their employees into government-run IRAs--allowing  the same States to skirt the Federal law of ERISA--and deny workers  important protections, we are pushed back on.   I have some concern about that. When the opportunity to do what they  say they want to be done could have been done with both Houses under  control of the same party and the White House, this was not undertaken.  Yet we are called out and told that we are hurting retirees when, in  fact, we are giving assurances to retirees that you will come under the  same protections regardless of where you go, and we expect that to be  the case because it has worked. That is decried. I find that less than  objective in its honesty.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In response to the gentlewoman from California, I would just say that  much of what we have been doing for the past 4 weeks on the floor,  including today, is trying to give a shot in the arm to our economy, to  our workers, our workforce, our retirees, and savers to take off some  of the traps that have been put in place that have frustrated this  economy and the growth of this economy for 8 years.   There is a reason for what took place at the ballot box. And the  expectation is that we move to take some of the clamps of the Federal  Government off the private sector, the States, the local communities,  and, more importantly, the citizens of this country.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  I express appreciation for the full-throated debate that went on here.  It is good to do that.   It is good for the opportunity to make it very clear that retirement  security is a significant challenge facing this country. We have said  that. I am glad that on the floor of the House today both sides of the  aisle indicated concerns for that. Far too many men and women are  struggling to save for their retirement years.   Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen regulations like the  fiduciary rule that will make it harder for low- and middle-income  families to save for retirement. And we have seen a regulation that  would strip away important protections for retirement savers.   As policymakers, we must do more to expand retirement options for  workers. That is a given. That we can agree on. However, the regulatory  loophole created by the Obama administration is clearly not the answer.   I want to remind my colleagues that this resolution does not prevent  States from coming up with new retirement options for workers. That is  not what this resolution is about, and simply reading it will assure  you of that.   This resolution is about ensuring every American has strong  protections for a secure retirement.   I urge my colleagues to protect retirement savers by voting in favor  of H.J. Res. 66.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 116, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 67) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by  qualified State political subdivisions for non-governmental employees,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 67.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 67, the second of two  resolutions the House is debating today to ensure strong protections  for retirement savers.   There are two parts to the regulatory loophole we are seeking to  close today. First, the Obama administration created a sweetheart deal  that would allow States to deny important protections for retirement  savers. Then, a second regulation was issued to extend that sweetheart  deal to cover certain cities and counties.   The resolution we are debating right now would block the second  regulation and ensure retirement savers in every city are afforded  longstanding protections under Federal law. It would also ensure  employers continue to have clear rules of the road for retirement  plans. The last thing employers, who are trying to provide benefits for  their employees, need is a confusing patchwork of rules that vary  across cities and counties, even in the same State.   As I mentioned during the earlier debate, States and cities should be  free to experiment with new ways to help workers save for retirement.  All this resolution says is that they must follow the law and provide  retirement savers strong protections. That is a commonsense idea that  we should all get behind.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 67.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney), who evidenced his complete  commitment to meeting the needs of all people by receiving an  ambassadorship and performing duties very well to the Holy See.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I just--for matters of accuracy about the legislation that is  in front of us, I think it ought to be clear that both sides of the  aisle can agree that we ought to encourage retirement savings and we  ought to be willing to look for choices, opportunities, variety, all of  that, and allow States, local communities, cities, to be creative, to  look for a means by which we can foster increased retirement savings.   All this legislation is doing, though, is saying that we want those  approaches to be protected for the retirees. That is all we are saying.  We are not opposing States. We are not opposing cities. We are not  opposing counties, municipalities, from establishing plans. But we want  them to come under ERISA, the same requirements that other people come  under, and make sure that people aren't sold a bill of goods that they  lose in the future. That is all we are saying.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to make that clear. None of the proposals or  the statements that are being made that what we are trying to do is  stop people from having retirement options is accurate. We just want  them to be protected.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the full-throated debate that went  on here in the discussion of a most important issue. I am grateful that  ERISA was in place for my father, a tool and die maker, a machinist. He  didn't have pensions, but he was able to, as a result of making little- by-little allocations to a retirement savings plan, set aside money to  make sure that, most specifically, my mother was taken care of--and she  was--as a result of protections that were put in place, requirements  that were put in place, and a savings plan for retirement outside of  any pension. Her basic needs were cared for until the end of her life.    So I certainly resonate with the desire to make sure middle-income,  middle class families, and everyone has the opportunity for secure  retirement savings. We all support creating new options for retirement  savers. Unfortunately, the regulatory loophole created by the Obama  administration is not the answer.   Every American, regardless of what city or State they live in,  deserves strong protections and secure retirement. That is why, for  over 40 years, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act has been the  law of the land. Denying those longstanding protections to certain  workers is a completely backwards approach that undermines the  retirement security of working families, and I know my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle don't want that to happen. We agree on  that.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 67 to ensure  workers and retirees in every city across the country continue to have  the legal safeguards they need to retire with security and peace of  mind.  [[Page H1221]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
