 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that we can  immediately consider H.R. 471, Representative Yvette Herrell's bill, to  enforce title 42 at the border.   As a Mexican-born legal immigrant, Border Patrol wife, and a mother,  I know firsthand how out of control our border crisis is. Our south  Texas communities are hurting because of this crisis, and our people  feel totally ignored by our government. Dangerous drugs are pouring  across the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl killing Americans  comes into our country at the southern border.   Human traffickers are taking advantage of our open border to conduct  their evil and heartbreaking trade. Criminal organizations are in total  control of our southern border.   Last month alone, 240,000 illegal immigrants were encountered  entering our country, a new record. And those are just the people who  were caught. The true number is undoubtedly far higher. And in 2022 so  far, 50 people on the FBI's terror watch list have been arrested by the  Border Patrol. That is higher than the previous 5 years combined.   Title 42 is one of the only things keeping the crisis at the border  from getting even worse, allowing Border Patrol the flexibility to  expel some illegal immigrants quickly. And yet, for some inexplicable  reason, President Biden and the Democrats want to end title 42 for  good. Doing this would put out an even larger welcome sign to drug,  sex, and human traffickers. It would send the signal across the world  that America's border is open, and that the administration has no  intention of upholding the rule of law.                                time  1245    As a Border Patrol wife, I also know that the morale of our agents is  already low. Eliminating title 42 would discourage those brave men and  women even further as they struggle to contain the never-ending surge  of illegal immigration that the Biden administration is trying to make  even worse.   I came to this country legally, as did so many in south Texas, for  the chance to live the American Dream. My legal immigration experience  as a child was incredible. That legal process is how it should be done,  and I want more children to have that same positive experience. My  experience should not be rare.   We need to focus on legal immigration and how to make the process  faster and affordable for those good people who want to come to this  amazing country. Yet, today, we have a Federal Government that  encourages illegal immigration, knowing the dangers that they will have  to go through.   Not only does this put our country at risk, but it also puts  thousands of women and children in harm's way as they make this  dangerous journey and face the possibility of horrendous abuse.   My heart breaks every time Border Patrol agents tell me about the  human tragedies they see unfolding before our eyes. Yet, the Biden  administration seems determined to make things worse.   Madam Speaker, I urge my new colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  stand with our border communities and support Representative Herrell's  critical bill to preserve title 42. The humanitarian crisis at our  border demands we do nothing less.   I believe that securing our border shouldn't be political. It is the  right thing to do.
