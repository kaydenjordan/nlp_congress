 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of the Honorable Graydon K. Kitchens, Jr., a giant of a man and my  former law partner and mentor.   Judges Kitchens' list of accomplishments is limitless. I could stand  at this lectern for an hour listing off all of his accomplishments and  barely scratch the surface.   He was a husband of 62 years; father of three; proud grandfather of  six; varsity pitcher at LSU, our alma mater; U.S. Army lieutenant;  judge; chief justice; deacon; and a man of deep, profound faith.   He provided wise counsel through troubling times to me and to so many  countless others, and he is an irreplaceable senior statesman in the  Louisiana Bar. I am among so many to consider him to be truly one of  the greatest men we have ever known.   As the patriarch of his family, Judge Kitchens planted roots in north  Louisiana that will flourish for centuries. Our community lost a  towering character and a leader, and we are so much better for the time  that we had when he was here.   Our prayers are with Roberta and the entire Kitchens family and all  who loved him.   Rest in peace, Judge Kitchens. God bless.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, Democrats have enjoyed  unilateral control of Washington for the last 17 months, and we all  know the results: record inflation, soaring gas prices, unhinged crime  in our cities, and uninhibited illegal immigration.   In the midst of all this, what issue gets their prime-time billing?  Very simple. They are displaying their seething hatred for Donald Trump  and anybody who ever supported him.   For nearly a year now, they have invested thousands of hours,  millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars. They have interviewed  hundreds and hundreds of witnesses. They compiled 100,000 pages of  documents. They hired lawyers, consultants, and even big network TV  producers. And all for what?   They are doing this production, this rehash, this replay of a moment- by-moment dissection of a terrible event that took place here a year  and a half ago. They thought the American people would be riveted by  their production, but the ratings have proven what everybody already  knew. The American people have lived through all this, and they have  moved on.   In fact, we thought it was interesting, according to one report, CBS'  decision to bump a ``Young Sheldon'' rerun from its prime-time slot in  favor of Thursday's January 6 hearing resulted in fewer viewers than  the identical time slot the prior week. Reruns of ``Young Sheldon''  played better than the January 6 drama.   The American people have moved on. They have moved on to caring about  things that actually affect their daily lives.   Look, the criminals involved in January 6 are being prosecuted.  Lessons about Capitol security were learned here. We will never know  the true facts about all that, of course, because Speaker Pelosi's  partisan committee will not look into why we didn't have adequate  security here.   But the Senate produced a bipartisan report on all these events a  year ago. The truth is the Democrats could hire an army of broadcast  media executives and specialists to try to boost their ratings, but it  will not change the simple facts.   The election this fall is going to be about three things. It is going  to be about inflation, immigration, and incompetence, the staggering  levels of incompetence that the Democrats in charge of Washington put  on display here every single day.   If the Democrats want to reverse their political fortunes, they need  to reverse their policies. But we all know, of course, they refuse to  do that. So hardworking American families will continue, very sadly, to  struggle as our country becomes less safe, less secure, and less stable  by the hour.   I am grateful to my colleagues for joining me tonight to discuss the  myriad crises facing our country. They are all taking a back seat to  the Democrats' reality show, but we think it is important to point out  to the American people the realities here, the true realities of what  is happening and what we are facing as a country, these unprecedented  challenges.   Madam Speaker, I yield first to the fine gentleman from the State of  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. That is  so well said. Just get out of the way. Let the American people do it.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to another great gentleman from the State  of Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Thank you for that expertise. You sound  like a former Secretary of Revenue or something from the State of  Pennsylvania.   As you pointed out, my friend, you don't have to be an economist to  figure this out. Every freshman economics student knows if you keep  printing money and dropping it into the economy, you are going to cause  inflation. This is not rocket science, but you know what? The President  of the United States apparently doesn't get it.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted next to yield to the good doctor from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, that was so well said.   Dr. Babin, that woke socialist policy has brought some real pain to  the American people. I think they have had enough.    November can't get here soon enough.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Thank you, my friend. That border crisis  continues to grow by the hour. Right now as we speak, there is the  largest caravan we think that has ever been spotted currently headed to  our southern border.   It was incentivized, of course, by the Biden administration's open  border agenda. The caravan has as many as maybe 15,000 people, most  from Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba.   Here is the key point. One of the migrants is reported to have told  FOX News that he hopes President Biden will keep his amnesty promise to  the caravan. You know, that is exactly why people from more than 160  countries have been flooding over that border since right after Joe  Biden took office.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett).    And you have got to know when to fold.   Madam Speaker, Tennessee is going so well, I may as well yield to  another good friend, another gentleman from the State of Tennessee (Mr.  Rose), one that is even more reputable than the last speaker.    Madam Speaker, my friend is correct. That  energy crisis haunts every American. We see no end in sight because the  White House will not reverse its policies.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Bilirakis).    Madam Speaker, my friend said it well. He  is right, time is of the essence. Every day that we belabor and  continue these radical leftist policies, the American people feel more  and more pain.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to my good friend from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde).    Madam Speaker, my friend from Georgia made  a great summary of the crisis that we are in. I thank him for bringing  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs.  Harshbarger), my dear friend, and the third speaker from the good State  of Tennessee, can't have enough of those Vols.    Madam Speaker, I have another colleague or  two on the way. How much time is remaining on the clock in this Special  Order?    Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. I will  read a quote here that is very familiar to everyone now because it has  been repeated over and over in the last several days. It is from Chuck  Schumer. Of course, he is the Democrat leader on the Senate side. He  stood on the steps of the United States Supreme Court, and he exclaimed  to a crowd, to their applause, and to all the television cameras, what  is now a quote that lives in infamy, ``I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I  want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you  will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with  these awful decisions.''                                time  1745    The leader of the Democrats in the Senate stood on the steps of the  United States Supreme Court and threatened the Justices by name.   Now, what is happening? What is happening now? Well, people are  heeding that advice. There was a leaked opinion, an unprecedented,  terribly tragic event there that will harm the institution permanently,  the Supreme Court. Some clerk, we suspect--I think it is one of the  liberal law clerks for one of the liberal Justices, the three Justices  on that Court committed to that ideology. Somebody leaked the draft  opinion, and it has caused a whirlwind.   All of these protesters are criminals. They are not really  protesters. They are criminals because this is blatantly against the  black letter of the Federal law. 18 U.S.C. 1507 openly makes this a  crime. You can't protest at the home of a judge to try to influence  their opinion. Yet, that is exactly what is happening.   As we speak right now, there are liberal activists on the lawns of  the Justices of the Supreme Court, the conservative Justices.   Do you know what? Their lives are in danger because we now know, just  a few days ago, a would-be assassin was apprehended on the lawn of  Justice Kavanaugh. He was home with his wife and his two young  daughters.   This is a dangerous thing, and this is what is wrought when so-called  leaders tell the American people to get in the faces of their political  opponents, to release the whirlwind, you won't know what hit you, and  all the rest. That is what is happening right now.   What are Republicans doing about it? What is Congress doing about it?  Nothing at all. The Democrat majority won't even acknowledge that this  is a problem. In fact, on this floor last night, we had 27  progressives, 27 of the Democrats in this House, vote against a simple  bill, a measure that would provide security and protection for the  innocent children of these Justices. They voted against that. It is  unbelievable.   People back home ask me, my constituents, say: What are they  thinking? What in the world is going on? Do they want people to be  harmed?   Look, I think the motive is that they want to send a message to the  radical left that we like you violating the law. We want you on the  lawns of conservative judges. We want you to try to intimidate them  into changing their opinions because they may overturn Roe, or they may  interpret the Constitution in a way that the radical left disagrees  with.   This is a tinderbox. This is a dangerous time in the country. The so- called leaders here are encouraging and inflaming this. Heaven forbid  if someone actually gets hurt.  [[Page H5603]]    We filed a resolution here within a few days of that leak last month.  Forty-five Members joined me in that resolution. We called upon the  Department of Justice to enforce 18 U.S.C. 1507, to enforce the law  that makes it a crime to picket or parade to influence a judge. Do you  know what? Crickets. The Department of Justice hasn't done anything.   Can you imagine if a threat was made to one of the liberal Justices?  Can you imagine the outcry? The mainstream media and the Democrats  here, the radical left, they would be demanding action. But if it is a  conservative judge, hey, fair game, apparently. It is open season on  conservative judges. That is what we have now.   We also filed, last month, the Leaker Accountability Act that would  make it a crime to knowingly share confidential information from the  Supreme Court. I authored that legislation. I think it ought to be  punishable by a fine or up to 5 years imprisonment.   We have to send a message. This behavior, the leak, the violence that  has ensued because of it, is unacceptable. The idea, again, that our  colleagues would vote against protection for the children of these  judges is, to me, unconscionable and an unforgivable vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for  faithfully coming to this floor and speaking to his constituents and  the American people about these very serious issues that face us as a  country. His voice is an important one.   I am grateful to him and our many colleagues for joining us tonight  to discuss all of these crises facing our country that are taking a  back seat to the Democrat reality show and the most radical set of  domestic and foreign policies that America has ever seen.   As we close, I remind everybody--we heard it last night--the  President exclaimed in his now infamous speech, he said: ``We are  changing people's lives.'' You saw that?    There is zero doubt about that, Mr.  President. Lives are being devastated under your policies.   I will just say this, as we conclude: November cannot get here soon  enough.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
