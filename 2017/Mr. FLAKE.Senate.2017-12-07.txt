 Mr. President, I just want to say on the record how much I  have enjoyed serving with the Senator from Alabama. He has meant a  great deal to this institution, to this body during his short time  here, and it is sad to see him go.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session, as under the previous order.
