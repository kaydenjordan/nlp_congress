 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Sherriff Tony Harbaugh of Custer County for his tremendous  impact on the State of Montana.   In early October, Sheriff Harbaugh was awarded the Montana Board of  Crime Control Lifetime Achievement Award at the 12th Annual Montana  Crime Prevention Conference in Billings.   Harbaugh began his career at the Custer County Sheriff's Office in  1978 as the only jailer. He was then officially sworn in as a deputy  with the sheriff's office in May of 1979. Harbough quickly climbed the  ranks and was officially elected as Custer County Sherriff in 1986,  holding that title until today.   Throughout his long career in law enforcement, Harbaugh has served in  a number of leadership positions in law enforcement. Currently,  Harbaugh is the Montana law enforcement representative on the Western  States Sheriff's Board, chairman of the Peace Officers Standards and  Training Council, chairman of the Eastern Montana Drug Task Force, and  is the National Sheriffs liaison for Montana Sheriffs and Peace  Officers Association.   It is my honor to recognize Sherriff Harbaugh for his extraordinary  dedication to public service and public safety. His role as leader in  the law enforcement community has made Montana a better place to live,  and I am grateful for his selfless service to the Custer community and  Montanans statewide.                            ____________________
