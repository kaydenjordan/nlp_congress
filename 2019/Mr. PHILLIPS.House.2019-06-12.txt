 Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago today, a mother woke up at 2  a.m. She woke up to a flurry of text messages from her son. He was  trapped in a nightclub bathroom at the mercy of a man with an MCX rifle  and a death wish. His first text: ``Mommy, I love you''; then at 2:39  a.m.: ``He's coming. I'm gonna to die.'' Eddie Justice was murdered in  the Pulse nightclub that morning, and he was 30 years old.   Today we stand with Eddie's family and loved ones. We stand with  Orlando. We stand with the LGBTQ community. And we stand up here to say  doing nothing to prevent mass shootings in our country is a dereliction  of our duty.   The Senate must pass the gun violence prevention measures that the  House put forward in February. Thoughts and tweets do not save lives.  Action saves lives.   In honor of all the Pulse nightclub victims, we need action, and we  need it now.                            ____________________
