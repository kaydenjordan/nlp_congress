 Mr. Speaker, the majority of my patients in the emergency  department are age 50 and older. This bill's age tax will devastate  Americans ages 50 to 64 who have worked their whole lives, planned for  retirement, and now are wondering how they will make ends meet.   The age tax will force older Americans to pay premiums up to five  times higher than others, no matter how healthy they are, no matter how  responsibly they have lived, making coverage too expensive, and forcing  them to be uninsured.   For example, Rex, from my district, wrote me that he was worried  about choosing between affordable insurance or saving for his  retirement. Insurance for older Americans like Rex will be too  expensive, leaving them uninsured when they need coverage the most.   Under this bill, a 64-year-old like Rex, with an income of $26,500,  in the individual market, will pay up to $14,000 for health insurance.  That is more than half of their income on premiums alone, leaving  little for food, for medicine, rent, and other basic necessities.   I stand with our older Americans, and I urge everyone, Democrats and  Republicans, to stand with older Americans. Put ideology, partisanship,  and politics aside and do the right thing.
