 Madam Speaker, I think all of us would wish that we were  not here on a subject of this gravity, on a subject so present in our  society at large: The exhortation to violence to accomplish one's  objectives.   I have been sitting here since we started the debate, which was about  45 minutes ago. So many get up and say, ``I do not support violence,''  ``I do not support this action,'' but I will do nothing about it.   Now, of course, they don't say the last sentence. They just don't do  anything.   As I sat there as Mr. McCarthy was talking, I was thinking that he  was getting up in my face and up in Nancy Pelosi's face. I think that  is what he was doing. I expect that in vigorous debate.   They focused on a non-analogous action by a Member of this House, the  chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Why did they do that?  Because there is no analogous event to this one. In the 40-plus years  that I have served here, there has never been a case like this. Never.                                time  1500    This is not about control, as the majority leader would represent. It  is about decency, democracy, and security, and the rule of law.   We have seen, Madam Speaker, over and over again in our politics that  words matter, and actions matter even more. Vitriol, the glorification  and promotion of violence, hate speech, and the failure to condemn all  of these when they occur have created an atmosphere in our country,  which sadly has now and too frequently been visited on this floor, that  is not conducive to the exercise of free constitutional politics.   A former leader of my party Dick Gephardt said that democracy was a  substitute for war, that we should settle our differences peacefully  and nonviolently.   The speech that has been the subject of this resolution whittles away  at the rule of law and the civility needed for constructive debate.   Indeed, violent words and images are too often a precursor to the  practice of violence. We have seen that. We saw it on January 6 as the  President of the United States incited and urged people to come to the  Congress to stop democracy in its tracks.   And people wanted to hang the Vice President of the United States as  a result of those words because he was not doing that because he  thought it was not legal. He wanted to follow the law.   My friend Gabby Giffords and Senator Kelly know that all too well,  that violent words and images are too often a precursor, as does  Representative Speier who worked for the late Representative Leo Ryan  and was herself badly injured in the shooting that took his life. My  friend, the Republican whip, and his family know that words can  encourage and result in violence. Last month, the family and  constituents of Sir David Amess in the United Kingdom experienced the  same pain.   All of us who were in this Capitol on January 6 and those who stood  in defense of it know that pain.   The loved ones of Officers Sicknick, Liebengood, Smith, DeFreytag,  and Hashida carry that pain with them every day.   Officer Evans' family, as well, has been carrying that pain since  April.   Madam Speaker, so do the families of elected officials, journalists,  and civil society leaders who have been killed or maimed by political  violence across the world incited by rhetoric that is rationalized as  acceptable in the political environment. And then, oh, I don't support  violence. I don't know how that happened. Yes, I said in front of the  White House, ``Go down to the Capitol,'' and although it wasn't the  exact words of ``be violent,'' it is what those who came down here  expected the exhortation to be.   It would be naive, Madam Speaker, to suppose that we can eradicate  the promotion of violence in wider society, either in our country or  abroad.   Such evil has always existed, and the internet and social media make  it easier to disseminate that malicious type of speech.   But constitutional parliamentarians worldwide have long understood  that in order to maintain the level of civility required to carry out  the business of legislating for the people, we must have rules of  decorum and limits on speech that would cause civil debate to devolve  into uncivil attacks and political violence.   That is why we have rules in this House to enforce decorum and ensure  civility. That is why we have rules of conduct, which the chairman of  the Ethics Committee read a little earlier. It should be and is  undebatable that this conduct violated that rule.   Those rules apply not only to this floor but everywhere a sitting  Member engages in work relating to his or her service as a  Representative.  [[Page H6342]]    When those rules were written, they did not anticipate that a Member  would threaten violence directly against another Member. Not because it  has never happened. A Congressman from South Carolina nearly beat to  death a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Sumner, because he wanted  to abolish slavery. That, of course, was a crime.   In some countries threatening public officials is a crime. They  didn't have to spell that out explicitly because it has always been  understood that such behavior is unacceptable in this institution and  incompatible with our service.   Indeed, any kindergartner, frankly, Madam Speaker, will tell you that  such behavior is wrong anywhere.   The actions of Representative Gosar this week and in weeks  previously--much like the actions of Representative Greene earlier this  year--would convey a dangerous lesson to our children and teenagers  that the opposite is true, that threatening violence against those with  whom one disagrees is acceptable. It is not. That bullying and  encouraging one's followers to menace another person or another group  is somehow compatible with citizenship in a democracy and indeed a  civilized society. It is not.   The resolution before us today is necessary because we in this House  who speak for the American people must reflect, as the Speaker said,  the highest standards of American society.   I just came from the Speaker's office not too long ago. I don't know  how many of you have been there, but over the door it says it is Robert  H. Michel Rooms.   I had the opportunity to serve with Robert Michel. Robert Michel was  a Republican, and he was from Peoria, Illinois. He was one of the  finest, most decent men that I have known, not just serving in the  Congress of the United States, but have known. He said this: ``Civility  means being tough without being mean, being witty without being  malicious, and . . . believing in the power of reason to influence  public debate while still being aware of the power''--hear these last  words--``being aware of the power of irrationality in public life.''   This resolution, Madam Speaker, is necessary because when Members of  Congress and other elected officials speak and act, our constituents  and followers give great weight to our words and actions.   It is a way for them to rationalize unacceptable behavior as was done  on January 6. It is disgusting, Madam Speaker, whenever someone out in  the world tweets a threat of violence or hateful content.    But when a Member of this House does so, no matter how you  rationalize it, no matter how you try to put lipstick on that pig, it  is a threat of violence.   What Representative Gosar did last week is not just worthy of  censure, it demands it.   And for anyone who threatens to apply the same standard to Democrats  in the future, as Ms. Speier said, I am with you. This is not about  Republicans or Democrats; this is about decency. This is about security  for our Members. This is about democracy, not violent overthrow or  opposition.   I, for one, will join you in enforcing that standard on any Democrat  who violates it. But I will tell you this, Madam Speaker, the analogies  that the Republicans have been making limp badly.   I am certain my fellow Democrats will do the same. Because this is  not about party, it is not about politics, it is not about  partisanship. It is about decorum, civility, safety, and, yes, the rule  of law that was trampled upon on January 6.   But this is not about January 6. This is about this incident of a  Member using whatever medium you want to say on the public dime  threatening and showing the killing of a Member of this House. Can't  that appall you, even that act? Do you have no shame? Madam Speaker,  those are the questions that I would ask.   No one--Democrat or Republican--ought to be allowed to engage in the  promotion of violence against a fellow Member, or indeed, a fellow  American. Because we know where the glorification and promotion of  violence leads, and we have seen it. We have seen it this year and in  previous years.   Piercing tweets become sharp knives.   Fiery words bring out deadly firearms.   And cartoon killing begets real life bloodshed.   This resolution specifically addresses Representative Gosar's  actions, but it also reflects more generally, Madam Speaker, what I  hope is a sentiment shared by Members from both parties that we have  seen too much of violent speech in our politics and in this country,  and it must end.   In February, when we considered a resolution relating to the  violence-promoting and undecorous actions of Representative Greene, I  recalled the famous words of Edmund Burke, who viewed service in his  nation's Parliament as the highest calling.   He said the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good  men and women--he did not add that but would today, certainly--that  good men and good women do nothing.   Once again, the Republican leadership in this House has chosen to do  nothing. It is interesting because a far lesser offense resulted in the  removal of a Republican by the Republicans from committee,  Steve King  of Iowa.   So, again, the House, in light of that void, must take action.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on both sides of the aisle to  uphold a standard that should be critical to us all. Some modicum of  respect for those who are political opponents, Madam Speaker, and some  restraint is in the way we depict them and ourselves.   Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
