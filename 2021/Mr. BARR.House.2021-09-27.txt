 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his  leadership and leading tonight's Special Order.   As a member of both the HEAT Team and a member of the House Financial  Services Committee, I want to address another dimension of the Biden  administration's war on American energy.   Specifically it is the Biden administration's weaponization of  financial regulation to implement through the back door of unilateral  executive action what it cannot do through the democratic process and  what it cannot do through the Congress and through the legislative  process, because, frankly, the Biden administration knows that the  American people oppose their radical agenda that would decrease the  [[Page H5458]]  reliability and affordability of electricity, industrial power, and the  manner in which we conduct daily life.                                time  2045    That is, specifically, that the Biden administration intends to use  financial regulators to bully banks, investors, and other financial  firms, to divert capital away from what they view as politically  unfashionable energy producers.   This is coming in multiple different forms. The Secretary of the  Treasury has set up a czar within the Department of the Treasury to  look at this from a holistic perspective to discriminate against  American companies and American workers.   In bank regulation, there is a concept called redlining, and it used  to be that it was illegal for banks and other financial firms to  discriminate against the American people. Well, now the Biden  administration is legalizing redlining. They are redlining against  their own people because they are engaged in an industry, a great  American industry that, for decades, has powered the American economy.  Now they want to discriminate against those American heroes who have  literally powered this country for decades.   What form does this take? Number one, it is taking the form of bank  regulation, where the bank regulators are bullying credit providers and  saying: You ought to rethink who you are lending money to because we  don't think you should be lending money because of the reputational  risk.   For example, ``Bank A, you better stop loaning money to that Kentucky  coal mining operator. We want to get rid of all those coal mining jobs  in eastern Kentucky,'' in my home State.   So, instead of going after the coal mining operator directly, they  are going to the bank and saying: Choke off that coal mining company.   To heck with the fact that those mining jobs are important to put  food on the table for those people in eastern Kentucky and in western  Kentucky. They are weaponizing bank regulation.   That is precisely why, Madam Speaker, I introduced a bill to fix this  called the Fair Access to Banking Act. This would basically codify the  Fair Access to Financial Services Rule that the Office of the  Comptroller promulgated in the previous administration. It would  basically provide a guidance to banks that they must provide access to  capital and credit based on assessment of the borrower's actual risk,  rather than making broad-based decisions impacting entire industries.   This is guided by the fundamental principle of nondiscrimination and  ensures that banks can't pick winners and losers in the marketplace.   That bill is pending in the Financial Services Committee, and we  can't get any kind of consideration by this majority because this  majority doesn't want fair access to banking. They are endorsing the  Biden administration policy of discriminating against the American  people.   Then there is the issue of ESG investing and mandating ESG, so-called  environmental and social governance. This is through the back door of  securities regulations at the Securities and Exchange Commission, but  this is not the mission of the SEC.   The statutory mission of the SEC is to protect investors; to maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital  formation. Its mission is not to reduce carbon emissions or solve  climate change or try to change the weather.   I acknowledge that there is some investor demand in the market for  ESG funds. I also see some utility in standardization of ESG  disclosures to eliminate some of the inconsistencies in the way public  companies are rated because, let's face it, even if you are interested  in sustainable investing, you do not know what you are investing in  because these ESG funds are frauds, in many cases.   But more than 90 percent of all S&P 500 companies already voluntarily  publish ESG information on an annual basis, and this regulatory  approach from the Gensler SEC would not provide new material  information to investors. Instead, it would inundate investors with  voluminous, confusing, and nonmaterial information that would hurt the  very investors that Democrats claim they want to help or, in the words  of the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, in TSC Industries v. Northway,  bury the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information, a result  that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking. We need to avoid  burdening investors with an avalanche of trivial information.   The Gensler SEC would also weaponize disclosure requirements to name  and shame politically incorrect companies; pick winners and losers in  the marketplace; and discriminate against energy firms that produce  jobs, affordable and reliable energy, and returns to investors.   The SEC proposal would also compromise investor returns by elevating  nonpecuniary factors above and ahead of financial performance. Fees for  ESG funds are 43 percent higher than non-ESG funds and many low-ranked  ESG stocks. They outperform the market overall.   We must not harm American savers by subordinating investor returns to  promote nonpecuniary policy objectives like social justice, diversity  quotas, and lower carbon emissions.   Finally, the Gensler SEC, the Biden Securities and Exchange  Commission, would increase compliance costs for public companies,  discourage private companies from going public, and encourage public  companies to go private, resulting in fewer investment choices for  everyday investors. This is why the Gensler SEC is even proposing to  hoist these requirements on private companies. The SEC, by wading into  social and environmental policy debates like climate change, through a  top-down, government-directed, one-size-fits-all mandatory ESG  disclosure regulation, untethered to the longstanding investor-driven  materiality standard, will politicize the agency and reduce its  credibility by hurting investors, elevating nonpecuniary factors above  financial returns.   Here is the bottom line. Not only is the Biden administration waging  a frontal assault on heroic American energy companies that provide the  American people with affordable, reliable energy, particularly low- income and blue collar families who can't afford the skyrocketing costs  of Biden's energy bill, but in addition to that, this backdoor approach  to financial regulation, discriminating against Americans in these  industries, will compromise investor returns, elevating and  prioritizing the woke environmental priorities of the select coastal  elites over middle-income Americans in the energy sector who provide  affordable energy for the American people, compromising Main Street  investment returns.    Those moms and dads who are trying to put their kids through college,  those folks who are trying to save in their 401(k)'s and their IRAs  just to have a secure retirement, those middle-class Americans are  going to be the ones who suffer because of the politicization and the  weaponization of securities regulation.   This is exactly why we must oppose this dangerous agenda that will  compromise American energy dominance, American energy independence, and  investor returns.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his leadership  on this issue. I thank the HEAT Team for bringing some light to this. I  wanted to provide a little bit of a different dimension to this  important debate, and that is how the Biden administration is  weaponizing financial regulation.
