 Madam President, today, I would like to honor Keanon  Lowe's heroism and bravery in tackling a gunman at Parkrose High School  on May 17, 2019. Mr. Lowe is known for being a top wide receiver for  University of Oregon's football team and now as a popular coach of  football and track and field at Parkrose High School. He also works as  a security guard at the school.   On Friday, May 17, a distraught student entered a Parkrose classroom  with a shotgun. Already this year, our Nation has watched children die  at the hands of their armed classmates, including two young men who  sacrificed their lives to stop gunmen and save their fellow students.  To prevent such a tragedy, Mr. Lowe, in a tremendous act of courage,  tackled the armed student and wrestled away the gun before anyone could  be injured.   Mr. Lowe put his life on the line to protect our students. Mr. Lowe  has not only guided students on the field, but now he has also  protected them in the classroom. He will no doubt be remembered by  those students for the rest of their lives as an example of  selflessness and courage.   On behalf of all Oregonians, I express our deepest gratitude and  admiration to Mr. Lowe, and thank him for his service to Parkrose  students, every Parkrose family, and all Oregonians.                            ____________________
