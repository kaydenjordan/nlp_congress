 Madam Speaker, as you know, our Nation was created with  the highest ideals and values. Our new Nation was set aside to be a  beacon of hope where we could build our hopes and dreams and calm our  fears. We are known as the home of the brave and land of the free.   Yes, the history is clear, when President Abraham Lincoln signed the  Emancipation Proclamation, America demonstrated its ability to rise to  its values. But America's history, as we all know, is complicated. For  it took 2 years, from January 1 of 1863 to June 19 of 1865, for the  last group of enslaved Americans to receive official word that they  were indeed free.   But we know today, Madam Speaker, that our work is not yet done. We  are still a work in progress. We the people, in order to form a more  perfect union, we are a work in progress.   Let us celebrate Juneteenth, as we should. But celebrating freedom  must be more than just a special day. It must be a celebration of who  as a Nation we say we are; one who says we believe in justice for all.   Yes, America celebrates being free, celebrates our freedom from  physical bondage, but we must also celebrate freedom from  discrimination. We must also celebrate freedom from racism. We must  also celebrate freedom from poverty. We must also celebrate freedom  [[Page H2731]]  from injustice. And we must also celebrate freedom from complacency.   Mrs. Coretta Scott King said this: ``Struggle is a never ending  process. Freedom is never really won, you earn it and win it in every  generation.''   Madam Speaker, regardless of the color of our skin, what State we are  from, how much money we have in the bank, our religion, our gender, or  our political party, we all have an obligation, and we all must carry  the torch of freedom.   Madam Speaker, I thank our chair who is leading this Special Order.
