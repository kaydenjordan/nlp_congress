He was driven by a desire to make a bigger impact in the community  and beyond, by making connections with young people before they were in  trouble. That led him to the Orlando Police Department, where, over his  22-year career, he rose through the ranks and was appointed deputy  chief in 2017.   Throughout his career, Canty's devotion to improving community and  police relations in his hometown has been his driving ideal. Canty's  hallmark is leadership by example.

As commander of the Orlando  Police Department's SWAT team, Canty directed team members while they  rescued survivors and helped to ensure no more innocent people were  killed.   Over the years, Canty's community involvement strides have been just  as important as those he made in crime-fighting. In March 2019, Sheriff  John W.  [[Page H1121]]  Mina, appointed Canty as the Undersheriff of Orange County Sheriff's  Office.
