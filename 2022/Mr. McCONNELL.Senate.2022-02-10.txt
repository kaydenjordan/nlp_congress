 Madam President, moments ago, the country got yet  another terrible monthly inflation report under the Biden  administration. Yet again, the data confirmed what working families  already know painfully well: Rampant inflation and soaring prices are  crushing--crushing--the American people.   Experts had predicted another red-hot inflation report, around 7  percent. Even that alone would have meant we were still trapped inside  the worst inflation in 40 years, but reality turned out to be even  worse than that. It turns out inflation this past year hasn't been 7  percent; it has been 7\1/2\ percent. In other words, if you haven't  personally gotten a pay raise of 8 percent or more in the last year,  then Democrats' policies have given you a pay cut--pay cut.   To add insult to injury, reporters say the worst of this inflation  was driven by the most painful categories for working families: food  prices, energy prices, and rent.   This is not about financial inconvenience for wealthy people who can  afford to stomach it; this is about massive price increases for  essential goods that make up a huge share of working families' budgets.  Gas is up about 40 percent since this time last year. Used car prices  are up about the same. Meat, fish, and eggs cost over 12 percent more  than they did just 1 year ago. The cost of natural gas for home heating  has soared by 24 percent since this time last year. Fuel oil has shot  up almost 47 percent. The cost of essentials has absolutely exploded  since Washington Democrats took power.   To be clear, the worst inflation in 40 years is not something that  just spontaneously happened to Democrats on their watch. As a Pew  report demonstrated late last year, it is true that countries around  the world are facing inflation--they are--as a result of COVID, but  America has it worse than almost everybody else in the developed world.  This is a direct result of liberal policy choices.   Here is how Jason Furman, President Obama's CEA Chairman, explained  it recently. I will quote from the New York Times:         ``The United States has had much more inflation than almost       any other advanced economy in the world,'' said Jason Furman,       an economist at Harvard University and former Obama       administration economic adviser, who used comparable       methodologies to look across areas and concluded that U.S.       price increases have been consistently faster. The       difference, he said, comes because ``the United States'       stimulus is in a category of its own.''    Obviously, he is referring to the $2 trillion so-called rescue  package last year.   The severity of this inflation was directly fueled by the reckless,  far-left spending spree that every single Democrat in this Chamber  voted to ram through at President Biden's behest last year.   Even the most prominent liberal economists knew this would happen and  tried to warn the Democrats. A year ago, Larry Summers warned that  Democrats' binge could set off ``inflationary pressures of a kind we  have not seen in a generation.'' Ah, but Democrats ignored their own  experts. They  [[Page S622]]  plowed ahead, using the pandemic as a pretext--a pretext--to dump $2  trillion into left-wing policies that were overwhelmingly unrelated-- unrelated--to the healthcare fight against the virus, and we see the  results all around us. Families are living with the results every day.   As recently as the last few days, some of my Democratic colleagues  have come here to the floor to boast about the increase in nominal  wages. They want a round of applause because the numbers on many  Americans' paychecks have gone up. But that is staggeringly out of  touch with the reality. Yes, in an inflationary spiral, lots of people  will see the numbers on their paychecks go up. The problem is that even  those bigger paychecks are buying Americans less in real terms today  than their smaller paychecks bought them before Democrats were sworn  in.   It is like this: Democratic policies have created an inflation  riptide that is forcing families and small businesses to swim as fast  as they possibly can just to avoid getting sucked out to sea, but  Democrats are trying to call this a success because of how fast  everybody's arms and legs are moving. Talk about an absurd effort to  spend your way out of reality. The truth is plain for everybody to see.    A few weeks ago, the Washington Post ran a story with the headline  ``'That raise meant nothing:' Inflation is wiping out pay increases for  most Americans.'' The story explained, and this is a direct quote:         [M]any [workers] said that despite considerable pay       raises--as much as 33 percent, in some cases--they were still       struggling to cover basic expenses. Several workers said they       had taken second jobs to keep up with rising costs for       groceries, gas and rent.    So American workers are not buying the Democratic spin for 1 second.  One year after President Biden took office with massive economic  tailwinds at his back, with an economy that was primed for a roaring  comeback, 75 percent of Americans say our economy is doing badly. About  90 percent of Americans say they are concerned with inflation. Ninety  percent of Americans say they are concerned with inflation. A 60- percent supermajority say their family's income is falling behind the  cost of living.   It didn't have to be this way. This was a policy choice. This all- Democratic government was warned that their radical agenda would  supercharge inflation, and they pushed ahead anyway, and our country is  paying the price.    Madam President, after more than six decades as a  staple of Logan County radio, Don Neagle is retiring this year. As the  host of the WRUS morning show and the ``Feedback'' program, Don brings  high-quality news to his community, interviewing everyone from  politicians, to writers, to theologians. As one local leader put it so  aptly, Don is Logan County's ``bulletin board,'' relaying all of his  community's most important news in one place. Today, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring Don in his retirement.   For decades, Don arrived at his office every weekday at 4:15 am,  preparing the day's news while most listeners were still fast asleep.  By the time Logan County residents were on their morning commute, he  was already halfway through his workday. Through his incredible work  ethic and scrappy style, Don stayed ahead of breaking news and at the  pinnacle of Kentucky journalism.   Don is a legendary interviewer, and his ``Feedback'' show is the  highlight of WRUS's entire programming lineup. Any leader in Kentucky  government, myself included, knows that it's basically a requirement to  be interviewed  [[Page S642]]  by Don when visiting Logan County. I have had the pleasure of speaking  to him many times, and it is always an enlightening conversation full  of informed, probing questions.   Don's calm, constant voice has earned him many fans across the  Commonwealth. He joined the Kentucky Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2005  and the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 2006, demonstrating that  his influence reaches far beyond Logan County's borders. While his  skill brought him acclaim from around Kentucky, he never strayed in his  commitment to his Logan County home. Don's career was more than just a  job; he formed a deep bond with Logan County, and even after six  decades, he seems loath to give it up.   Though Don is taking a step back from his expansive role at WRUS, he  will remain at the station for the time being as host of ``Feedback''  and an occasional guest interviewer. In the meantime, he will have more  time to spend with his two daughters, six grandchildren, and six great- grandchildren. He will also be able to pursue his favorite lifelong  pastime, reading, with new gusto.   In honor of Don's retirement, I would like to thank him for his  service to the Commonwealth and unflagging loyalty to strong local  journalism. He has delivered an invaluable service to Logan County  residents for more than 60 years, and we will all miss his ever-present  voice.   Mr. President, Bowling Green Daily News paid tribute to Don's career  in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From Bowling Green Daily News, Jan. 31, 2022]                `Voice of Logan County' Announces Retirement         Logan County residents have trusted Don Neagle as their       source of news for more than 63 years. But on Jan. 27, the       hall of fame broadcaster and journalist announced his career       was coming to an end.        While he will continue to host his popular show       ``Feedback'' and will conduct other interviews for WRUS       radio, Neagle is permanently stepping away from his duties as       morning host.        At 84 years old, Neagle said the decision to retire was       mostly because of health concerns.        ``I have shingles, and I'm awfully uncomfortable now. I'm       dealing with back problems as well. I thought this would be       an ideal time to cut back,'' Neagle said. ``It's just an       obvious time to wrap it up. My wife died three years ago, and       she always said that when it was time to retire--you'll know       it. And I know it now.''        Neagle joined WRUS on Sept. 1, 1958, after a stint at WKCT-      AM in Bowling Green.        Over the course of his career in Russellville, Neagle has       interviewed political figures, Pulitzer Prize-winning       writers, theologians and newsmakers of all types. He has       earned several honors, including his induction into the       Kentucky Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Kentucky       Journalism Hall of Fame in 2006.        Neagle said what he will miss most about his time as       morning host is bringing the news to Logan County.        ``I enjoyed promoting activities in our community and       particularly in our African American community,'' Neagle       said. ``I really enjoyed breaking news stories. We also put       our obituaries right in the front of our newscast. We wanted       people to know that information.''        In 2002, Neagle partnered with Bill McGinnis and Chris       McGinnis to form Logan Radio Inc. and purchase WRUS.        Chris McGinnis will take over the WRUS morning show on an       interim basis, while the search begins for a permanent host.       He told the Daily News that Neagle was viewed widely across       the state as ``the voice of Logan County.''        ``He became the local trusted source for news and       information here,'' Chris McGinnis said. ``Don earned the       trust of the community. Through the years, Don Neagle was       that constant voice that soothed the community. He became       that comfort voice.''        Chris McGinnis described Neagle as a man of faith who was       very educated, addicted to reading books and still a bit shy.        ``You will not ever find a more gentle spirit than Don,''       he said. ``He is an individual that cares and wants the best       for everyone. He is quick to lift up everyone. It's hard to       put into words what a kind spirit he is.''        Neagle confirmed his love for reading and said in       retirement he hopes to become a night owl who stays up late       with his nose in a good book.        He said his love for reading first came from his parents       while he grew up in rural Green County. Neagle would go on to       be valedictorian of his high school class.        Besides reading, Neagle said he is looking forward to       spending more time with his friends and family.        He had two daughters, and his late wife, Vivian Gray       Neagle, had two sons. Altogether, Neagle said he has six       grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.        Neagle specifically thanked his daughter Lisa Whitt, his       granddaughter Anna Haley and the people of Oak Grove Baptist       Church for their support during his career.        ``I'm looking forward to having a quiet life,'' Neagle       said. ``I got all the traveling out of the way with my wife.       I'm looking forward to dealing with my pain and living in       peace with those who have been just so good to me.''        Retired Logan County Circuit and Kentucky Supreme Court       Judge William Fuqua said he has been doing an oral history       program every Thursday morning with Neagle for over 25 years.        Fuqua told the Daily News that Neagle's knowledge would be       ``irreplaceable'' to Logan County.        ``I call him the community morning bulletin board,'' Fuqua       said with a laugh. ``He is always accessible. He is a class       guy, who loves his job and is dependable in every way I know.       He is a keystone of the community. People stop me on the       street and ask me about Don. I can't say enough good things       about him.''        As he now heads into what Neagle hopes is a peaceful       retirement, the man who spent more than half a century       informing Russellville and Logan County leaves with a word of       thanks to his listeners.        ``I've enjoyed the support from the people,'' Neagle said.       ``For the most part, they have been very kind to me. I love       and respect them very much.''                            ____________________
