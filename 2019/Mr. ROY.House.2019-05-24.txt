 Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I am here today  primarily because if I do not object, Congress will have passed into  law a bill that spends $19 billion of taxpayer money without Members of  Congress being present here in our Nation's Capitol to vote on it.   Secondly, it is a bill that includes nothing to address the clear  national emergency and humanitarian crisis we face at our southern  border.   There is no reason this disaster supplemental should not have  included the quite modest $4.4 billion that Director of OMB Vought sent  to Capitol Hill to ensure DHS and HHS do not run out of money--which  they are slated to do--while managing the over 100,000 illegal aliens  crossing our border being apprehended, and the unaccompanied alien  minor children being unable to be housed appropriately.   And, finally, this is a $19 billion bill that is not paid for when we  are racking up $100 million of debt per hour. And this is a bipartisan  problem, to be honest, and it is a problem that we should solve in  Congress rather than ignore.   Our Nation is strong enough and compassionate enough to have a  responsive and fiscally responsive approach to help people who are  hurting in the wake of natural disasters.   We have had months to figure this out and to do our job to secure our  border. And we now are expected to let the swamp continue to mortgage  the future of our children and grandchildren, making it less likely  they will inherit a stronger and better country with a government  capable of defending the Nation in responding to disasters such as  these.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I respectfully object.
