 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, the  Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act, a bill to assist the U.S.  Department of Labor in identifying and preventing cases of human  trafficking.   Human trafficking is a global and domestic threat to basic human  rights and humanity as we know it. However, the injustice of human  trafficking is not just a global program. Human rights abuses are  happening right here in the United States every day and in every region  across the country.   Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking  Resource Center hotline here in the U.S. received reports of over 8,000  cases of human trafficking in our country last year, an increase of 35  percent over the year before.   Government agencies must continue to work together to identify and  eradicate all cases of human trafficking. We can and must do better to  prevent cases of abuse before they happen. That is the purpose of this  bill, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act.   H.R. 2664 directs the Department of Labor to train appropriate  Department staff on how to detect human trafficking and ensure that all  personnel at the Department of Labor are provided with regular  screening tools to identify and detect trafficking activity.   This bill establishes training for a clear course of action,  including referring cases of suspected human trafficking to the  Department of Justice and other appropriate authorities to properly  investigate and prosecute offenders.   This bill also requires the Department of Labor to report back to  Congress within a year on the progress that is being made by such  efforts.   Mr. Speaker, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act  supports current efforts to combat human trafficking by providing the  Department of Labor the tools and resources it needs to identify and  properly respond to human rights abuses.   I ask my colleagues for a vote in favor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2480, the Empowering  Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act, a simple but  powerful bill that will amend the Byrne JAG Grant Program to include  funding initiatives aimed at disrupting and reducing the demand for sex  trafficking.   As we know, dismantling the multifaceted web of sex trafficking  requires collaborative and comprehensive action at every level of  government. I am pleased to join Representative Hartzler and so many of  my colleagues as we continue to address this problem.   In conjunction with a number of bills introduced this Congress to  strengthen and reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, H.R.  2480 acknowledges that a comprehensive approach to eliminate sex  trafficking necessarily requires the inclusion of demand reduction  efforts. Specifically, this bill provides support to State and local  jurisdictions working to eliminate sex trafficking by expanding the  designated use of Byrne JAG funding to include the express purpose of  combating sex trafficking demand.   It is important that we support concrete and effective measures in  furtherance of demand reduction as a critical component of law  enforcement. Yet in nearly every State across the country, especially  when it comes to underage youth, the buyers of sex tend to be treated  as johns. When we are looking at underage girls, anybody that is  purchasing sex should be viewed as a child molester.   Just as we are beginning to see the need to acknowledge the shift in  how we see and respond to victims of sex trafficking--most of whom are  minors, 59 percent of all reported cases in 2016 per Polaris National  Hotline, and nearly all of them having involvement in the child welfare  system, 86 percent as reported in the 2016 National Center for Missing  & Exploited Children--there must be a paradigm shift in how we see and  respond to those engaged in the illicit buying of women and children  for sex.                                time  1545    Sex trafficking reduction programs under this bill would support  enhanced efforts to arrest and prosecute these offenders. This bill  would further help jurisdictions implement and facilitate necessary  training programs designed to help law enforcement understand,  identify, and appropriately respond fundamentally to those who buy and  perpetrate sex trafficking.   Just as law enforcement must make critical efforts in distinguishing  and identifying victims in need of services from petty criminals, so,  too, must efforts be made to identify and prosecute dangerous and  predatory sex offenders. Thus, State and local justice systems would be  eligible to receive Byrne JAG money to support innovative advancements  in developing and acquiring cutting-edge technology.   For example, H.R. 2480 would support the use of programs like  Spotlight, a web-based tool used by over 4,000 law enforcement agencies  in the U.S. and Canada to enable them to collaborate across  jurisdictions for streamlined tracking of child sex trafficking  victims.    Mr. Speaker, over the past year, reports showed that  Spotlight identified, on average, five kids per day, and that law  enforcement using Spotlight daily are seeing a 60 percent time savings  in their investigative process.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill and the need to invest in comprehensive measures to prevent and  attack sex trafficking demands.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2200, a bill to  reauthorize $130 million in currently appropriated funds in order to  continue, over the next 4 years, critical and necessary work to fight  sex and labor trafficking. This bill builds upon the remarkable work of  the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the  cornerstone of Federal human trafficking legislation.   I want to thank my colleagues Chairman Royce and especially Chairman  Chris Smith for his pioneering leadership.   Despite great strides and the tremendous progress we have made in  exposing and beginning to understand the complexities and growing  obstacles of human trafficking, we still have much to do.   I am particularly thankful for the inclusion of my language in  section 103, which provides a modification to grants for victims  services in order to provide a necessary focus on young victims in the  child welfare system. Specifically, this section will amend the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act to address a key reason children and  women have difficulty leaving their exploiter: the lack of housing.  They have nowhere to go.   As with all antitrafficking measures, I am particularly concerned  about what we are doing to combat the devastating epidemic of young  girls in the foster care system falling prey to child exploitation and  sex trafficking. The average age of a girl entering into sex  trafficking is 12 years old.   In 2016, an estimated one out of six endangered runaways reported to  the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children were likely child  sex trafficking victims. Of these reported victims, 86 percent were in  the care of social services or foster care when they ran.   One seasoned detective in Los Angeles recently reported during a  demonstration on law enforcement technology used to identify victims  that every single girl he has ever encountered through sex trafficking  or commercially exploited sex activity has been in the child welfare  system.   It cannot be overstated that the purpose of the child welfare system  is to protect children who are abused or neglected. It is our  responsibility to make sure these children do not fall between the  cracks. It is devastating to know that we have failed many of them.   Just as if one of our own children in our family went missing, a  child that is under the care of the government that goes missing  demands our most aggressive response and effort to find, save, and  protect them.   Our most urgent priority should be disrupting the child welfare-to- trafficking pipeline and finding better, more effective ways to meet  the critical needs of this vulnerable population. In particular, as we  continue to tackle child sex trafficking in the United States, it is  imperative that we provide a special focus on the immediate and long- term housing needs of at-risk foster youth. Young girls and  disconnected youth have particular and sensitive needs as trafficking  victims.   Current funding for housing and shelter for victims of child sex  trafficking is insufficient to meet the growing demand for youth  services, especially young foster girls exploited through their  emotional and financial vulnerabilities. At every level of government,  we have an urgent responsibility to shut down pathways for child sex  trafficking and to invest in critical housing needs for vulnerable  youth and girls. This responsibility includes supporting and adopting  H.R. 2200.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is the ranking member on the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of this important  legislation, Mr. Chris Smith; and I thank Chairman Royce for bringing  it to the floor. I support this bill and I encourage my colleagues to  do so as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back that balance of my time.
