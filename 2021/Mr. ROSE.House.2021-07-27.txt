 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am concerned about the  financial security of our Nation.   Whether you are standing in the checkout line at the grocery store or  at the gas pump, it is clear that Tennesseans and Americans everywhere  are facing a bitter reality. We are 6 months into the Biden Presidency,  and we are feeling the effects of his reckless spending decisions as  prices for everyday foods, goods, and even gas skyrocket.   According to a recent study, 83 percent of Americans surveyed said  they noticed price increases in June and July. Right now, families find  themselves paying 45 percent more for gas, 7 percent more for fruit,  almost 6 percent more for milk, and 18 percent more for bacon just  since Biden was sworn in.   Inflation is like a cruel and regressive tax hike on the working  people of this Nation who can afford it the very least. For older  Tennesseans on fixed incomes that often do not grow with inflation,  high inflation is even more cruel.   President Biden's policies have caused inflation to grow every month  since he took office and, often, at a rapid clip. This means  Tennesseans and all Americans are paying more for groceries, more for  prescription drugs, and more for household goods, and their take-home  pay after taxes is worth less than it was, as if they got a pay cut  through no fault of their own.   What will the administration do to combat drastic rises in inflation?  The answer to that appears to be absolutely nothing. In fact, they are  doubling down and making it worse.   President Biden and his fellow socialist Democrats want to keep  spending money on things we can't afford and increasing taxes on  everyone, which, along with the inflation monster, creates a one-two  punch to the gut of all Tennesseans and especially the ones who are  most vulnerable and who can least afford it.   Another massive $3.5 trillion spending package that will raise taxes  and further fuel inflation is not what our Nation needs. We need to  stop this spending spree on the backs of the taxpayer before it is too  late.   The Biden administration can try to talk around it, but the reality  remains the same: Their policies are hurting Tennesseans, and I will  never stop working to hold them accountable.
