 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, Mr. President, just a few moments before you  assumed the Chair, Senator Murray opened the Senate as President pro  tempore for the first time. Kudos, congratulations.   She is a great, great Member. She is the chair of Appropriations and  now PPT, and it was a wonderful thing to see her open up the Senate for  the first time as PPT. So congratulations to Senator Murray and to all  of us for having such a good President pro tempore.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on to business, in no time at all,  the House Republicans are off to the rockiest start of any new majority  in recent memory. Have you ever seen anything like this? We aren't even  a month into the new Congress, and already the House GOP has shown the  American people they have been consumed by chaos, paralyzed by  division, and held captive by the most extreme elements of their  conference.   On their first day of voting--the very first day--House Republicans  decided their first order of business as the new majority was to pass  legislation making it easier for ultrarich tax cheats to escape  accountability. Amazing. That is their first thing. At the same time,  as they did that, they would blow a hole--a $100 billion hole--in the  deficit because according to CBO, the amount of money brought into the  Federal Treasury by closing some of these loopholes against tax  cheats--very wealthy tax cheats--would far exceed the expenditure made  for the new IRS agents. The deficit would come down if we passed this  legislation. For all the talk on the other side about we have got to  bring down the deficit--not when it comes to closing loopholes of the  ultrarich and corporations that pay a smaller percentage than most  Americans, uh-uh. Wow. Apparently, cutting taxes for megacorporations  and the 1 percent was not enough for Republicans 5 years ago. They did  that in the Trump tax bill. Now they want to make things even easier  for tax cheats.   Then, a few days later, the House Republicans doubled down on their  war on women by passing measures that will undermine women's freedom of  choice.   Make no mistake, these bills will never see the light of day in the  Senate. But again, the extreme--the extreme--MAGA fringe element of the  Republican Party seems to be controlling the whole entity. We hope that  doesn't last for long.             We in the Senate will serve as an inextinguishable firewall and stop  the anti-woman, anti-health, anti-choice bills in their tracks. So,  right off the bat, the House Republicans are showing us exactly whose  corner they are  [[Page S62]]  in: the ultrarich and the fringe elements of their party.   Now, make no mistake, Democrats want to work with a competent and  capable Republican Party wherever possible to make life better for  average Americans. Democrats are united in this commitment because we  all saw firsthand how bipartisanship was the key to so many of last  year's successes. Later today, in fact, I will join President Biden,  Leader Jeffries, and a number of Senate and House colleagues precisely  to talk about how we can turn our unity into action to help the  American people.   House Republicans, meanwhile, seem trapped in a cycle of extremism so  powerful that now they are even giving proposals like a national sales  tax--a national sales tax--serious consideration. According to some  House Republicans, House leadership has agreed to give GOP radicals a  vote on a 30-percent national sales tax on all goods across the board.  That means, right now, with inflation finally beginning to drop,  Republicans are looking to make Americans pay 30 percent more for  everything they buy.   Look, if Republicans want to have a debate with Democrats on their  national sales tax bill, we will be happy to have it. We would love to  hear Republicans explain to the American people why it is a good idea  to send prices skyrocketing on everything from cars to groceries, to  diapers, and everything in between. We would love to hear Republicans  tell seniors why their expenses would go up by a third after they have  spent a lifetime for retirement. And we would love to hear Republicans  explain to middle-class families why their taxes would increase by  thousands of dollars a year while the ultrarich see their taxes go  down. If Republicans want to push this terrible proposal, they are  welcome to make their case. Make our day.   I think many within the Republicans own ranks recognize that a  national sales tax is an especially dimwitted idea. Even Grover  Norquist, whose ideas on tax are far away from most Americans--and he  is one of the most conservative voices out there--called it ``a  terrible idea.''   Even Steve Forbes said this would make the average new home in this  country cost $100,000 more.   Young families, do you want to buy a home? Some of our Republican  friends want to add $100,000 to the cost of buying that home, and of  course it would raise bills by thousands more. And yet--yet--despite  the insanity of this idea, the House Republican leadership is bent to  the MAGA wing of the Republican Party and have promised a vote.   If this is how House Republicans want to spend their time--taxing  middle-class families, attacking women's freedom of choice, giving  cover to tax cheats--be our guest.   Once again, this is the central quandary of the new Republican  majority. By bending to the demands of the MAGA hard right, Speaker  McCarthy has guaranteed that Republicans will have to constantly cater  to the whims of the MAGA wing at the expense of the American people.   Now, we will be a firewall against all of these things, and I am sure  the American people are glad that we have a Democratic majority in the  Senate to stop some of these rather insane proposals because when  extremists run the show, as seems to be happening in the House, it  makes it nearly impossible to have serious-minded, constructive  conversations on the big issues that matter.   No issue, of course, will matter more in the coming months than  raising the debt ceiling. Over the next few months, we are going to  hear more about the debt ceiling in Congress, maybe more than any other  issue. But the matter is very simple. If the United States is allowed  to default on its debt for the first time, the consequences will be  severe and every single American will pay the price.   A default means interest rates will spike on everything from car  loans to credit cards, to mortgages. It means that Americans will have  to pay thousands of dollars more on regular expenses. Homes will lose  their value. Homes, the average middle-class person's piece of the rock  that they struggled and saved for so that they could own a home and so  they don't have to pay rent and can pay a mortgage where they get  equity--those homes will lose their value if we default, God forbid, on  the debt because mortgage interest rates will soar. That means people  will have less money to pay for a home and supply and demand just sits.  The price goes down. The value goes down.           Meanwhile, the millions of Americans who have saved for  retirement will see their retirement plans, like 401(k)s, lose their  value, robbing retirees of their hard-earned livelihoods.    So the dangers of default are not abstract. Oh, no, this is not some  academic argument up there in the clouds. This affects every American  family, and we are going to make sure that they hear all about it. The  consequences are as real as they get, and the entire world is watching  what we do here in Congress.   But, rather than work with Democrats in a productive, constructive  way to raise the debt ceiling, the House GOP has immediately resorted  to brinksmanship and hostage-taking. They say they will not raise the  debt ceiling unless we give in to their demands for draconian spending  cuts that would impact just about every American--again, in a very bad  way.   Well, I say to my Republican colleagues, if you want to talk about  deep cuts, then you have an obligation--an obligation--to show the  American people precisely what kind of cuts you are talking about.   Are Republicans going to hold Social Security hostage in exchange for  the debt ceiling or pay raises for our troops or support for veterans  or funding for police and fire and first responders or Medicare funding  that millions of seniors rely on?   Republicans, you owe the American people answers on what you mean by  spending cuts.   Remember, the House rules that the GOP approved are clear. They need  to bring a debt ceiling bill to the floor, let the entirety of the  House debate it and vote on it, and let the American people see and  assess the cuts for themselves.             So, once again, to my House GOP colleagues, if you are serious about  spending cuts, show us the math. Show us why you think it is worth  risking a global financial crisis just to pass an extremist agenda,  because, inevitably, what you are saying are cuts are vital to so many  Americans--so many Americans. Being in the majority means that it won't  be enough to hide behind time-worn rhetoric about wasteful spending.  When it comes to the debt ceiling, the substance counts; the details  count; and the consequences are very, very real.   Unless the Republicans can resolve their own chaos and beat back  their own extremism, I fear that every day that passes without action  on the debt ceiling will increase the risk of default and risk the  great harm it will do to the American people. And, should that happen,  Americans will see that the fault lies entirely in the hands of the  radical GOP.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
