 Madam Speaker, radical environmentalists have weaponized  the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act,  known as NEPA, and are using frivolous lawsuits to block nearly every  management project or salvage sale after fire that the U.S. Forest  Service proposes.   This has helped result in over 68 million acres of forest land burned  in the last decade and over 10 million acres just in 2020 alone.   I am pleased to see President Biden today is speaking about how to  address wildfires. One important component I hope he will look into and  help rectify is we desperately need to rectify the litigation and the  amount of stoppage of forest management that is the result of  environmental groups.   These groups have worked very hard to advance the false scenario that  climate change is somehow responsible for the increasing vulnerability  of forests. This is flatout false. The truth is that the decline of  responsible timber harvesting and the lack of active management are  undeniably the real culprits.   In California, most forest types historically had, in the past, about  64 trees per acre. They now sit at an average of over 300 trees per  acre. Indeed, too much inventory.   We need to get back to basics and manage our forests and help prevent  this fire problem.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I do have to clear up one point made  earlier. The sales of gas Mustangs are double that of the so-called  four-door electric Mustang in the month of May, and the gas Mustang is  triple that of the electric Mustang for the year. As a Mustang driver,  I had to get that out.   So when we had the Biden administration announcing an over $2  trillion spending package, but we only end up with 6 percent in  expenditures for roads and bridges, it is a bait and switch.   Indeed, it seems like the Democrats are trying to take this miniscule  investment in infrastructure and challenge themselves to waste it on  something else in Green New Deal programs.   It is already a big enough challenge to get money and keep money in  infrastructure these days and keep it from being siphoned off.   This bill does nothing to reform or fix the 30 percent of overhead  costs that go towards frivolous regulation, et cetera. That means they  are planning to waste right off the top $160 billion of their own  proposal.   In California, with the high-speed rail boondoggle, they are setting  aside $25 billion for a program that originally was going to cost $33  billion, according to how it was sold to the voters. So this needs to  be stopped and put into programs that people can actually use like  their road system.
