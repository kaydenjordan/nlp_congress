 Mr. President, the strongest military alliance in the  world is the NATO alliance. President Joe Biden has made that alliance  stronger than ever since its creation.   Countries like Finland now want to be part of that alliance for their  own safety because they share our values. Countries like Sweden feel  the same way. They want to be part of this alliance, which President  Biden has supported completely.   It has never been stronger since its creation, and the contributions  made by the alliance members to the war in Ukraine are unprecedented.  It has never happened before. Nations from all over Europe and nations  that share our values are standing behind the NATO alliance.   To hear the suggestion on the floor of the Senate that somehow there  is a weakness in the Biden administration when it comes to NATO is  belied by the facts and the truth.   The fact of the matter is, as well, that when you look back at the  previous President, named Donald Trump, chart what he has to say about  Ukraine now. He questions whether we should be helping them at all. He  questions whether or not we should make Vladimir Putin angry.   You all know and remember, as I do, as well, that during the 4 years  of the Trump administration, there was this ambivalence, this bromance  between Putin and Trump that no one could explain. And now to have  someone come to the floor and say Joe Biden isn't strong enough when it  comes to standing behind the people of Ukraine, that is just flatout  wrong.   The support for the Ukrainian people against Vladimir Putin is  universal across--I shouldn't say ``universal.'' Let me strike that  word. It is almost universal and should be universal across all Members  of Congress. Democrats and Republicans alike in the Senate believe that  we are doing the right thing as a nation standing behind the people of  Ukraine.   As a cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus in the U.S. Senate, I believe  this in my heart and soul: If the Ukrainians do not prevail over  Vladimir Putin, I am afraid we are going to have more wars to fight. I  can think of other countries that are vulnerable to his expansionist  dreams: Poland, for goodness' sake; the Baltic States; Moldova. The  list goes on and on.   President Biden has made a stand in Ukraine, and it is the right  position to take. To suggest that the NATO alliance is not behind him  is wrong. They are behind him in a way that is unprecedented in  history.   I am happy to report that I am not only pleased to support the  Ukrainians in this effort, but I think we have done everything that we  should do.   Now, remember, President Biden has an important decision to make each  time someone suggests a new weapons system: Will this be provocative?  Will it lead to expansion of the equipment used in war, even to nuclear  weapons?   That is an important question. I don't know if I could sleep at night  if I had to worry about my decision the next morning and whether it  would trigger a nuclear war. But that is what President Biden faces day  after day, after day. People who come in and say, ``Just send every  weapon system and don't think twice about it,'' don't understand the  burden of the Presidency--to make sure we do the right thing to support  the Ukrainian people, but not a provocative action that draws in  American forces or runs the risk of nuclear war.   The President has to make the careful decision with every weapons  system. So if it takes an extra day or week, do it right, Mr.  President. Don't be pushed into it by those who really can't understand  the gravity of each of these decisions. Stand behind the Ukrainian  people. Do it through the NATO alliance. Do it in a way that doesn't  expand this war to include American troops or to make it a nuclear  conflict. That, I think, is the bottom line.    Mr. President, there are parts of this letter which I  find incredible. We received it late last night.   As I mentioned before, Harlan Crow, the Texas billionaire who gave  hundreds of thousands of dollars of undisclosed gifts to this Supreme  Court Justice over a period of 20 years, now refuses to tell us  anything about what those gifts involved, how much was spent, who was  there, what this was all about. He says he can't tell us that because  we don't have any authority in Congress over that branch of  government--the Supreme Court.   Well, he is wrong about that. It turns out, the ethics laws that we  passed in Congress in years gone by have been upheld by other courts  and followed by them, but it is only one court in the land that has  decided it won't follow  [[Page S1969]]  those standards. The highest Court in the land has decided it will have  the lowest ethical standards.   It is hard to understand. Here is Harlan Crow, the Texas billionaire,  spending all this money on one Supreme Court Justice, saying that we  cannot, in Congress, ask hard questions about the ethical standards of  the highest Court in the land because it would put undue influence on  the Court.   Bottom line: Undue influence is what this is all about. No one should  be able to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a Senator, a  Congressman, or certainly a Supreme Court Justice without full  disclosure and compliance with the law.   For the Supreme Court to say that is asking for too much, I think the  American people can draw their own conclusions. They have a right to  know, if Harlan Crow thinks our passing an ethics code for the Supreme  Court would put undue influence on the Court, how does he explain  spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on gifts, trips, on yachts,  and chartered airplanes for a Supreme Court Justice? Is he not seeking  undue influence on the same Court? It is obvious that it is true.   What surprised me after I received this letter--and, once again, was  offended by the logic of it, if there is any--at the end of the day, I  looked online today to find that this attorney, Michael Bopp, is saying  that he made an offer now to meet with the staff of the Senate  Judiciary Committee.   I read the letter for a third time. And I thought, how did I happen  to miss that? Well, it turns out it is the final sentence in the  letter. And I would like to read it to you.         Please feel free to have your staff contact me with any       questions concerning this response and to set up a time to       further discuss your requests.    That, I suppose, is the offer to meet. I am not going to turn it  down. We are going to meet with him if he wishes to discuss this  further.   But before we go any further than that conversation about this  committee, let me make a reference to the bottom line in this  controversy. Chief Justice John Roberts, the person that this Court is  named after, as all Chief Justices are--the Roberts Court has the  authority this afternoon, before 5 o'clock, to announce a resolution to  resolve this issue once and forever, to make sure that the Court steps  away from the sordid affair with the right conclusion. To put a code of  ethics in a standard of ethical conduct in place will bring this Court  into the same world of reality as the rest of the courts in the United  States.   The American people need to have confidence in this Court. And hiding  gifts of hundreds of thousands of dollars, not disclosing, and paying  no price when they are finally discovered is not the way to convince  the American people that the Court is credible.   We are going to continue in the Senate Judiciary Committee to do all  that we need to do to get to the bottom of this controversy. The  American people have a right to believe in this Court, as they do in  this Congress. And we have to do everything under our power to make  sure that happens.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  is necessarily absent.
