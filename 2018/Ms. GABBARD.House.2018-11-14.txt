 Mr. Speaker, last night, House Republicans on the Rules  Committee voted to undermine our democracy by blocking the American  people and Members of Congress from having a debate and the ability to  vote on a bill that would end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's genocidal  war in Yemen: a war that has created the world's worst humanitarian  disaster in generations, leaving 22 million people in dire need of  humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of civilians killed, and many more  vulnerable to mass starvation, famine, and cholera outbreaks.   Don't be fooled. If Congress and this administration truly were  concerned about the plight of the Yemeni people and peace, all U.S.  support for Saudi Arabia's atrocities would end now.   Instead, last night, on the Rules Committee, Republicans voted to  shut down debate to prevent a vote that would end U.S. support for  Saudi Arabia in Yemen.   Later today, Congress has the opportunity to do the right thing. We  are faced with a choice.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on House Resolution 1142 so that  Congress can fulfill our constitutional role, debate, and vote on this  critical issue. It is long overdue that we end U.S. complicity in Saudi  Arabia's atrocities. We must end all U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's  genocidal war in Yemen now.                            ____________________
