 Mr. Speaker, we should not shut down the government of the  United States. Democrats do not want government to shut down. It is,  however, not in our hands. It takes a majority to pass any bill in this  House: 218 votes. Our Republican colleagues have over 240 votes. We  have 193. So it is not in our hands, Mr. Speaker.   The Republican Party has been given the responsibility and the duty  to enact legislation to ensure the proper functioning of government. As  the governing party, they can pass whatever they want to pass on this  floor. Indeed, as the governing party, they have a responsibility to  use their votes to keep the government running. They control the House,  they control the Senate, and they control the White House. All the  levers of power of legislating are in their hands.   But, we are here, Mr. Speaker, on the verge of a shutdown because of  a familiar pattern where Republicans cannot  [[Page H9716]]  unite as a party. They cannot agree among themselves on spending  priorities. This has happened again and again and again. In fact, each  time Congress has successfully enacted a funding bill since the  majority took the majority in 2011, they had to have Democratic votes  to pass that legislation every single time.   When we passed the continuing resolution in September, just about 3  months ago, we did so because Republican leaders asked for more time to  work on the priorities that confront this country and, responsibly,  keeping government working. They had 3 months to do so, yet here we are  with 1 day remaining and nothing to show for it.   Instead, they have spent the past 3 months--on priorities that I will  outline in just a minute--working on a tax bill that is reckless,  deeply unpopular, and harmful to the lives and livelihoods of millions  of Americans and the economic well-being of our country that I call a  death tax because it will explode the debt of the United States; a bill  that would raise taxes on 78 million middle class households and kick  13 million Americans off of their health insurance coverage; a bill  that would increase, as I have said, the deficit by $1.5 trillion-- indeed, much more than that, because we have to pay interest on the  money that we are going to borrow to do the tax cut, while we fail to  pay our bills--a bill that would trigger an automatic cut of Medicare  by $25 billion next year; a bill premised on a falsehood that tax cuts  magically pay for themselves.   That is what the past 3 months have been wasted on, Mr. Speaker.   Not a single appropriations bill has been enacted by this Congress,  not a single one. There are 12. They control the House, they control  the Senate, and they control the Presidency.   Now our Republican colleagues, Mr. Speaker, are asking for 2 more  weeks. Two more weeks, they say. Republicans are asking us for 2 more  weeks because they claim they haven't had time to write a funding bill  they can pass.   Ninety days. Every Democrat voted for what I call the ``no drama'' CR  in September. Ninety Republicans voted ``no'' on an agreement we had to  use the next 90 days to address the priorities of America. But 90  Republicans voted ``no.''   They have had time to write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again  a tax bill that advantages the wealthiest in America at the expense of  the majority of Americans. That, Mr. Speaker, is how they have spent  their time these past 3 months.   Write a funding bill to avert a shutdown?   No.   Reach an agreement that is responsible to fund the priorities of  America?   No.   Write a tax bill that kicks millions off of their health coverage and  raises taxes on millions more. That is what they have done for 90 days.  That is what they chose to do.   Two more weeks?   If they want 2 more weeks, they have 240 votes to give themselves  more time. But I am certainly not going to vote to give them 2 more  weeks simply to work on the tax bill, which they have pledged to pass  by Christmas.   However, if they passed it a year from now, it would have the same  impact on America's taxes. The critical they have ignored and delayed.  The political has been their sole focus.   I say to my Republican friends, Mr. Speaker: You won control of the  government. Govern, govern. Be responsible. Focus on that which is  critically important to the American people. Don't say you haven't had  time to do the most important job you had. You had time. We voted-- every one of us--to give you 90 days, to work either in a partisan  sense, as you have done so much of the year; or in a bipartisan sense,  which was much more positive and would have been much more productive.   There is a to-do list, Mr. Speaker, of critical legislative items  that this House has to complete before the end of the year. It is a  long and compelling list. Six of them have hard deadlines and must be  done before we leave for the end of the year. For 90 days we didn't do  them.   None of the six is a surprise either. Neither are any of the others  that the American people expect us to do by the end of the year as  well.   The majority has had months to work on bringing legislation to the  floor on each one of them--months--yet here we are, in December, pushed  up against the wall of a funding deadline.   And Republicans want 2 more weeks so they can focus on passing their  tax bill before Christmas?   Not the priorities of America, but a tax bill, a deeply unpopular,  appropriately so, tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, let me list what we need to do, what we ought to do, and  what we should have done over the last 90 days. Let me just share with  the American people who sent us here what the Republican majority has  not gotten done in all of the months they have had complete control of  the government:    Keep the government open and functioning by passing funding bills and  sending them to the President for signature;   Reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program so that millions  of our children will not lose healthcare insurance;   Provide funding for VA Choice to help care for our veterans, which  must be done;   Reauthorize the flood insurance program, which is so critical to so  many millions of Americans;   Extend expiring health programs, such as community health centers, on  which so many others rely;   Reauthorize portions of the Intelligence Act to protect America's  security, which will end before the end of the year.   Ninety days we have had to consider all of those items.   The American people also expect us to:   Provide the necessary resources to address the opioid addiction  crisis, which they had 90 days to do that;   Reach an agreement on spending levels for critical priorities of the  American people. We call it dealing with sequester, which is somewhat  jargon, but we haven't done that;   Pass funding to keep government effectively serving our people.  Ninety days to do that, and here we are;   Pass the Dream Act to provide certainty for those young people who  were brought here as children and have grown up as Americans;   Take action to stabilize our health insurance markets. We haven't  done that. We had 90 days;   Extend the expired Perkins Loan Program so college students, with the  most need, can complete their degrees. We haven't done that in the last  90 days;   Reauthorize fire grants so that our domestic defenders and our first  responders can have the resources they need for training, for  personnel, and for equipment to keep our communities safe. We had 90  days to do that;   Prevent nearly 1 million people from losing access to Medicaid in  Puerto Rico;   And I will end with: making sure that the people of Texas, the people  of Florida, the people of Puerto Rico, and the people of the Virgin  Islands have resources to rebuild and restore their communities  devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   All of this we need to do by December 31.   What do we focus on?   A tax bill.   When will that tax bill take effect for taxes in 2018? When will you  pay those?   By April 15, 2019.   Yet that is what we spend all of our time on. That is what we have  spent all of our time on, not the priorities that I have just read, but  a tax bill that will hurt America, hurt its financial status, hurt its  middle-income workers, and, most of all, hurt the children who will pay  back the money we will borrow to give the wealthiest in America a tax  cut, those people making over $900,000 a year. That crowd will get 62  percent of the resources, yet the Speaker says that we need to help  struggling Americans.   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, there is not a person at any one of my  town meetings who came up to me and was worried about the people making  $900,000 or more--not one. Maybe it has happened to you, Mr. Speaker,  but it hasn't happened to me.   Why are we at this point?   Because we have a governing party that refuses to govern; because we  have  [[Page H9717]]  a majority that has failed to do the business of the American people,  even for something as fundamental as providing for the operations of  government.   Mr. Speaker, we Democrats welcome the opportunity to sit down with  our Republican colleagues and reach a compromise agreement to meet our  responsibilities and address many of the pressing issues I have  outlined earlier in this address.   My time is about up. Had we utilized the 90 days that we all voted-- we on our side of the aisle, the Democrats voted--with our Republican  friends, although 90 Republicans voted ``no,'' but we all voted ``yes''  to take 90 days to meet our responsibilities to the American people. It  hasn't been done. We have no confidence that giving 2 more weeks will  make it happen.   Let's get to work right now. Not on the tax bill. That could be  passed at some point in time. I am against it. I will vote against it.  I hope it fails. It is a bad bill. But let's address these priorities.  That is not what the intent of these 2 weeks are. It is to give 2 weeks  so we can pass a bad tax bill that will hurt America, will hurt our  children, and will hurt the middle class.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    I thank the majority leader for yielding.   Normally, of course, we would have a scheduling discussion tomorrow  at the end of business, but in light of the fact that we are not  meeting tomorrow, we will not have that colloquy.   Mr. Speaker, can the leader give us some indication of what might be  considered next week? As we know, there are numerous items that need to  be resolved before we leave here this year, and we need to obviously  have some BCA, Budget Control Act, numbers arrived at so that the  Appropriations Committee can move forward either on an omnibus or  appropriations bills. We need to do flood insurance. We need to do FISA  section 702. We need to do, obviously, the Children's Health Insurance  Program, and other matters.   Mr. Speaker, can the leader, who has just said that we will be in--is  he anticipating 4 days next week? Four days next week, and presumably 4  days or 5 days the following week? So let's say we have 9 legislative  days.   Mr. Speaker, can the leader give us some idea of how we might  accomplish the work that needs to be done in that timeframe?    Mr. Speaker, I hear the majority leader's hope that we  will move appropriations bills on the Senate side. Obviously, one of  the things that we have been trying to work on for the last 90 days,  Mr. Speaker, has been trying to get to an agreement on the numbers that  will replace the sequester numbers that certainly many people on your  side don't want for the defense side of the budget.   Obviously, we believe that we had an agreement over the last 4 years  for parity in spending. We would hope that we could reach an agreement  similar to that agreement.   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I am sure that Mr. McConnell, the majority  leader, could bring appropriations bills to the floor, and he has not  done that. We don't control the Senate, and those bills have not been  brought to the floor. You can't pass them if they aren't brought to the  floor.   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, they need to be bipartisan bills, because  the history is that the majority party, Mr. Speaker, has not been able  to get a majority of votes. They did today, but the history is, since  2011, that has not happened; therefore, failing that, you need to work  in a bipartisan fashion, Mr. Speaker, the Senate does, in order to get  these bills done.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, I won't go into all the pieces of  legislation that are pending that need to pass for the welfare of our  country, the security of our country, and the assistance to our people.  I would hope that we could proceed and proceed now. Frankly, I am  available tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and I am sure others are, to start  talking about how we reach agreement on these critical issues, because  9 days, as we all know, is not very much time.   We have had 90 days. We unanimously voted for a continuing CR. Ninety  of your members voted against it. I say respectfully, the reason we got  90 days to hopefully reach agreement on a number of critical issues,  critical to us, and I think critical to you, was because every one of  us on this side of the aisle voted for the CR, and 90 of the  Republicans voted against it. It could never have gotten to a majority  but for our votes.   I would hope that now that we have another 2 weeks that we start  sitting down together, reaching agreement, and are prepared next week  to start voting on bipartisan bills that both sides can support.  Neither side will get all it wants, but that is the way I think that  this House will proceed as a credit to the House and a credit to the  American people.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, my presumption is that  the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who voted against the CR  in September, did not do it because he wasn't for funding the troops;  did not do it because he didn't want to protect the security of our  country; did not do it because he wanted to shut down the government, I  presume. None of us did either.   We did it because we are very concerned about the fact that 90 days  ago we voted for a CR that was noncontroversial, notwithstanding the  fact that 90 on your side voted against it. It was noncontroversial,  however. The President agreed to it. You agreed to it. I agreed to it.  We had an agreement.   But the fact of the matter is that we have not used those 90 days  productively in a bipartisan way to get to constructive resolutions of  these issues. I agree with the gentleman, we ought to do that.   I will pledge to the gentleman that I and my leadership here and our  Members will come at least 50 percent of the way. You are in charge.  You have the responsibility. We understand that. But, as we have in the  past, almost every time, whether it was Speaker  [[Page H9745]]  Boehner or Speaker Ryan, it was this side of the aisle that kept the  government open. It was this side of the aisle that made sure we didn't  default on our debts.   So I want to be constructive. There is no point in further argument  on this. It is to say, however, to all of us, I have talked to some of  your Members privately. They are shaking their heads.   Why are we in this position?   We ought not to be in this position. Every one of us who sits in this  body--every one of us ought to be saying to ourselves: we need to act  constructively. Confrontation is not constructive; the failure to reach  agreement.   You say you passed SCHIP. I pleaded with the gentleman not to put a  partisan bill on the floor. We had agreed on the authorizing side.  Unfortunately, we couldn't agree on the funding side because you wanted  to cut things we thought ought not to be cut. Clearly, we could have  gotten to an agreement.   In fact, you passed a bill on IPAB, $17.6 billion unpaid for that  would have paid for all of that. So, Mr. Leader, I will yield to you,  if you want to; but I just plead with every one of the Members of this  body: This is not good for the American people. You say you don't want  a CR. You had 90 days to come to an agreement with us or with  yourselves. You have 218 votes. You just showed us.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I didn't hear my friend  saying that when John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and the whip asked for  votes to keep the government open.   They got 84 of their colleagues on your side of the aisle to join  them, making a total of 87, and the majority of your Members voted  against your own leadership on the bill that they were proposing. So  don't lecture me about voting ``no.''   I voted ``no'' because I think we should not have had a CR. I voted  ``no'' because I think there are too many things left undone. I voted  ``no'' because the American people expect us to get our work done, not  to twiddle our thumbs while Rome is burning.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
