 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Centre County 4-H Robotics Club for winning the FIRST  Robotics Competition and being the first Pennsylvania team to capture  the title.   The FIRST Robotics Competition is an international high school  robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students,  coaches, and mentors work during a 6-week period to build game-playing  robots that weigh up to 120 pounds. The Centre County 4-H Robotics Club  was 1 of 405 teams from 22 States and 7 countries to compete in the  late-April event which was hosted at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan.   Each team earned a spot in the contest based on competition  performance throughout the year. This year, the Centre County 4-H  Robotics Club earned its spot by winning its first regional competition  at the Greater Pittsburgh Regional in March. The championship entailed  10 rounds of qualification matches in six divisions. The top eight  teams in each division drafted an alliance of four robots to compete in  a single-elimination playoff to determine the division champion, at  which time the Centre County team joined forces with Stryke Force from  Kalamazoo, Michigan; Team Rush from Clarkston, Michigan; and Lake  Effect Robotics from Kingston, Ontario.   Mr. Speaker, this is an amazing accomplishment on many fronts. The  Centre County 4-H Robotics Club has created state-of-the-art  technology, they have worked together with interstate and international  peers to achieve success, and they have built long-lasting career  skills.   I am incredibly proud of this club, and I want to highlight each team  member: Tom Sowers, Mary Davis, Tate Geiger, Hannah Strouse, Petr  Esakov, James Hanagan, Nathan Tack, Thad Valentine, Griffen Josephs,  Roger Nagel, Emily Christensen, Zach Jester, Lachlan Sneff, Isaiah Adu,  Ben Servey, A.J. Marsala, Braydon Button, Alex Mullen, Eli Johnson, and  Lee Conklin.   The club had numerous mentors and community supporters who helped  them to achieve this first-place international finish. This is  especially important today, on National Teacher Appreciation Day. This  week we celebrate America's hardworking, dedicated, and passionate  teachers, who inspire scores of students. To all of our teachers and  mentors, especially those who helped the Centre County 4-H Robotics  Club bring home gold at the FIRST Robotics Competition, we salute you.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate the Centre County 4-H  Robotics Club on this outstanding achievement in Centre County, in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in the United States of America, and,  quite frankly, in the world. Congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, 73 years ago, Nazi  Germany's forces formally surrendered, marking the end of World War II  in Europe.   Today, we commemorate Victory in Europe Day, or VE Day. Celebrations  erupted throughout the world on May  [[Page H3790]]  8, 1945, to mark the end of the Second World War in Europe.   From Paris to London to New York and in small towns everywhere,  people poured into the streets to join the revelry.   Old photos showed ticker tape parades and streamers galore, exciting  and proud crowds were cheering the German surrender.   The war was over in Europe, and so many American GIs would return  home to be with their loved ones.   It would take another 4 months and the use of two atomic bombs before  Japan surrendered and World War II ended for good.   Mr. Speaker, the end of the war in Europe meant an end to nearly 6  years of war--a war that cost millions of lives; a war that destroyed  homes, families, and cities; but a war that stamped out hatred and  bigotry for the greater good.   VE Day is one that shall never be forgotten.                            ____________________
