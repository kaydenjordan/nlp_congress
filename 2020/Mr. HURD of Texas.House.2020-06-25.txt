 Madam Speaker, today we are missing an opportunity  to pass an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill. We are missing an  opportunity for a police reform bill to actually become law. We are  missing an opportunity to do our part to prevent another Black person  from dying in police custody.   Everyone here believes, as I do, that whether your skin is black or  your uniform is blue, you should not feel targeted in this country.   We have failed to do one simple thing: empower police chiefs to  permanently fire bad cops.   This is one of the most important things Congress could have  addressed. Keeping bad cops off the force could prevent another killing  like George Floyd. It would protect good police officers by ensuring  bad officers, like George Floyd's murderer, don't soil the reputations  of good officers.   Just a few months ago when dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we  worked together as one Congress--not two parties--to pass needed relief  to our fellow citizens. That is the spirit that I wish was in this  Chamber today.
