 Mr. President, I enjoyed hearing the remarks of my  fellow Senator from Missouri. I wish Sam well in his next deployment as  a military liaison, and I thank him, as well, for serving our country.                     Children's Health Insurance Program    I come to the floor today to talk about tax reform and its benefits  for middle-class families across this Nation. First I wish to highlight  a program that is critical to these families, especially children; that  is, the State Children's Health Insurance Program or, as it is referred  to across the Nation, CHIP.   For more than 20 years--and really since the very beginning, when I  first began serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates--CHIP was  one of the first programs for which I became a strong champion. That is  because I understood how critical it was then for families in West  Virginia and how critical it is now.   When I was in the State legislature in the nineties, I served on the  committee charged with creating and implementing the State Children's  Health Insurance Program.   My voting record on this issue has been very clear. As a Member of  the House of Representatives and now in the U.S. Senate, I have voted  numerous times to fund and expand the CHIP program.   In my State of West Virginia--a smaller State--22,000 children are in  the West Virginia CHIP program. That includes over 10,000 families. It  is essential for these working families. It is essential that we  recognize that some working families are unable to get insurance. Maybe  they can get it for the person who is working, or the spouse, but a lot  of times it is prohibitive to get insurance for the children at the  same time. That is where CHIP comes in. It is preventive. It is for  sickness and illness. It has really helped to improve the health of our  young people in the State of West Virginia.   I was pleased that the bill passed out of the Finance Committee with  strong bipartisan support, and I want to thank them for their efforts.   I have also spoken with Leader McConnell, and he is very favorable  about the need to reach a solution for this by year's end. Thousands of  West Virginia families and children who rely on this program need to  know that it is going to be there. We know we are running up against a  funding deadline and expiration; we have already passed the expiration  date.   So I look forward to working together with Members of the Senate on  both sides of the aisle to reauthorize CHIP and the CHIP program as  soon as possible. That will be a good Christmas present.   Mr. President, another issue I wish to speak about is a policy that I  think will greatly benefit families in West Virginia and across this  Nation; that is, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we passed last week. I  was very proud to vote for that--proud because I understand what this  legislation can mean to the working families and so many people in our  States. Today, I would like to explain exactly why I did vote for the  bill.   First I wish to speak about the 83 percent of West Virginia families  who file and don't use itemization. They file the short form. For those  families--83 percent of those filers--that is double the standard  deduction, double the child tax credit, which means significant tax  savings.   I voted for the bill because it cuts taxes for folks in all income  brackets. These are the people who are tired of Washington telling them  how to spend their hard-working dollars or, even yet, Washington  spending their hard-working dollars for them. Now we are telling these  hard-working men and women that they can keep more of their own dollars  to make those decisions. They can decide how to spend it. This is not a  novel idea, but I think a very welcome increase in our tax dollars  coming home. They will be welcomed by every individual family. So  whether they are spending it on something that helps them today or  tomorrow or whether they are saving for the future, let's let them make  that decision. The point is that decision should be theirs.   I also voted for this bill because it helps American businesses of  all sizes. It will empower our small businesses to grow and thrive. We  had a small business that came to Capitol Hill last week from the  Eastern Panhandle. Many of them had different reasons as to why this  was going to help their small businesses. Yes, a tax cut means more  money for them to invest in their own business and is a big positive  for many of them. But one particular small business owner said: Do you  know what I really want? I want more time with my family, more time to  devote to my family and my church. So while I am an owner of a small  business and devote all of my time to the small business, give me the  time back that it takes me to comply with the U.S. Tax Code. Simplify  this, and give me that time to devote to my family and my church.   I also feel that not just small businesses are going to grow, but it  is also going to help men and women have more job opportunities and  higher wages. When it comes to our larger businesses and corporations,  it makes them more competitive. Even in a small State like mine, 50  percent of our private workforce works in a larger--well, actually  works for a small business; I think it is 30 percent who work for a  larger corporation. But as that corporation becomes more competitive  globally and our products become more competitive, the result of that  is going to be higher wages, more sales, more jobs, more opportunities,  more expansion into our State and not beyond our borders.   I voted for this bill last week because it gives our economy a big  boost. I challenge anybody who is watching this closely or feels in  their family or in their State budget or in their personal budget--who  says that this country's economy is growing fast enough or is robust  enough or everybody is benefiting. We know that is not the case. We see  it in our towns.   I live in a relatively small area. Communities in my State of West  Virginia and across this country have been forced to deal with the  consequences of a struggling economy--shuttered stores, closing  schools, falling real estate prices. This is what happens when  everything contracts or stays so stagnant. It has really affected many  aspects of our lives. I voted for this tax bill because I am just not  OK with that.   I am not OK with standing still. If you are standing still, you are  losing. We need to move this economy forward. We need to make it work  for everybody. So, basically, I have had enough.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act represents a new direction for America--one  that provides hope, prosperity, and a chance to really turn things  around for a lot of people.   Of course, as with many legislative accomplishments of this  magnitude, concerns have been raised from some of those who feel  differently. That is what a conference committee is about. We hear  concerns. We have heard them from our constituents, and I am sure the  House has heard them from their constituents. That is what the  conference committee is all about. I have been raising the ones that I  have heard in West Virginia to my friends who are going to be a part of  the conference process.   So, as I have said many times, this is a significant moment for our  country. I believe we haven't done major tax reform in 31 years. It is  well past time. It will provide a significant opportunity, and it  requires big and bold action. We do a lot of little things around here  that help people, and those are great. But it is rare that we can do  something big and bold that is going to help so many people in this  country.   Let me go back to my statistics. Eighty-three percent of the people  in West Virginia file without itemization.  [[Page S7873]]  They are going to be getting a doubling of the standard deduction, a  doubling of the child tax credit--a tax cut, tax relief. Keep the  money; make the decisions in your own family. It is predicted because  of the simplification factor that that number of 83 percent will  actually rise in many States, mine included.   I think this big and bold action we are about to embark on is  something we can look at with great pride. I ask my colleagues on both  sides to sincerely look at this and join us in our efforts to provide  tax relief, tax reform, tax cuts, and an economic boost to our  country--which we so desperately need.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.
