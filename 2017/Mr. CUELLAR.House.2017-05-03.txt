 Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and  Ranking Member Lowey for their hard work on this good bill.   This bill today is a compromise bill. It is a good bill because this  is the way Congress is supposed to be working. I say it is a good bill  because it provides an increase to the Pell grants, authorizes them in  the summertime, year long. That will be good to get kids into  education. It provides $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health.  It provides a solution to the citrus greening crisis that is impacting  our citrus growers in south Texas and other parts. It provides funding  for 10 additional immigration judges and their support staff to help  cut down the backlog of over half a million cases that we have on top  of the 55 immigration judges we had last year. As Chairman Carter said  a few minutes ago, it adds $1.5 billion to improve the Nation's border  security without funding the medieval wall that we have.  [[Page H3296]]    Again, I thank all of my colleagues for working in a bipartisan way.
