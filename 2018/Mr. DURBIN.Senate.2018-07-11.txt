 Mr. President, the world breathed a sigh of relief. For  almost 2 weeks now, we have had our attention focused on 12 children,  Thai soccer team players who were lured into a cave with their coach  and were thought to be lost for days. They couldn't be found in that  flooded cave.   Then came the good news that they were discovered. They were still  alive. It was a miracle.   Then came an extraordinary challenge: how to safely bring these 12  children out of this trap they were in and bring them to safety. I  cannot imagine the effort that was undertaken. It included countries  from around the world and the United States coming together to provide  extraordinary levels of assistance at great cost to save the lives of  these 12 children, to bring them out of this trap they were in and  reunite them with their families.   All the prayers and all the hard work, all the bravery and all the  investment paid off. These children are safe, as is their coach. They  are currently being tended to for medical care, but the day will soon  come when they will be back in the warm embrace of their families.   It was a great illustration of the caring heart of people around the  world for children they had never seen; children who, through no fault  of their own, found themselves in a deadly circumstance; children  separated from their families with no hope when it came to their  future. People responded. It was a great moment for the world to  reflect on those children.
