 Mr. Speaker, ``climate change effects are outpacing our  ability to adapt.'' That is from the recent IPCC report.   Here is what that means in America in 2022:   We have coastal communities where flooding has washed out roads  before the bond used to pay for that road was fully paid off.   We have mayors with no budget for seawalls who are being forced to  tell their constituents that the only solution is for them to abandon  their homes and their businesses and relocate to higher ground.   NOAA reported recently that sea levels in Florida will be 18 inches  higher by 2050. What that means is that there are properties in Florida  today that will be underwater before their 30-year government-backed  mortgage is fully repaid.   What happens in your community when that happens, if voters are told  they have to abandon their home, or that their town can't connect them  back to their grocery store, or that their local bank has to write down  Federally backed mortgages? We know the political pain that that  drives, and we know what measures are necessary to protect American  families from that pain.    Yet my Republican colleagues in the Senate, who claim to be so  focused on the economy, are withholding their confirmation for new  Federal Reserve appointees because they have the temerity to suggest  that we should not  [[Page H1291]]  even do the scenario analyses necessary to protect ourselves against  this climate risk to our financial sector.   When you ignore the laws of physics, you put taxpayer dollars at  risk; you put communities at risk; you puts lives at risk; you put  American energy independence at risk.   It is time, it is long past time for the climate denial caucus to  pull their heads out of the sand before the rising ocean washes all  that sand away.                            ____________________
