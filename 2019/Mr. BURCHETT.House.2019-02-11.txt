 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to finally come to the table for a meaningful  discussion around securing our Nation's borders.   The Democrats' leadership would have the entire country believe that  our President and the Republicans are the ones holding up negotiations  to avoid another unnecessary government shutdown, but it is the  President and the House Republicans who have come to the bargaining  table in good faith.   Just this week, there were rumors that a deal was near with less  border funding than the President and my party wanted. That is what  happens in negotiations: We give, and they take.   Now that we are close to a deal being cut, the Democrats are moving  the goalpost, Mr. Speaker. This brand-new cap on ICE detention beds  came out of thin air and is proof that the Democrats are willing to do  anything to keep from making a deal with the President and the  Republicans.   What is worse, the move by the Democrats would make our country less  secure. It is just a backdoor attempt to get rid of ICE entirely.   The citizens of this country deserve better, Mr. Speaker. They  deserve a government that works. Let's do the job our constituents sent  us here to do.                            ____________________
