 Mr. President, this Nation faces an uncertain future.  Gripped by a pandemic, economic disruption, and racial injustice, the  American people are yearning for bold, forward-thinking leadership. Now  is the time for elected leaders to stand up and make the investments  necessary to secure a better world for our children and grandchildren.  The Great American Outdoors Act, which I am proud to cosponsor, does  that. While it addresses a narrow set of challenges and opportunities,  it should remind us all that we are capable of meaningful, forward- looking action. If enacted, our bipartisan bill would be the most  significant conservation achievement in more than 50 years and would  provide benefits for generations to come.   Throughout my service in the Senate, it has been an honor to bring  Vermont's values to Washington. And for Vermonters, stewardship of the  land and water is a bedrock value. Our agrarian tradition, sense of  place, and outdoor economy all rely on preserving open spaces and  conserving our natural resources. This bill reflects those values on a  grand scale.   The Great American Outdoors Act would secure full, permanent funding  for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As is true for States across  the country, the LWCF has played an unparalleled role in permanently  protecting some of Vermont's most important and iconic landscapes, and  I am proud to have been able to take a leading role in championing this  program and these investments. In the 55 years since its creation, LWCF  investments totaling nearly $150 million have helped conserve more than  275,000 acres in Vermont. From the Green Mountain National Forest, to  Camel's Hump, to the Long Trail and Green River Reservoir State Park,  this program has played a role in protecting Vermont's invaluable  natural spaces. It has also helped Vermont towns conserve local  treasures and facilities, such as Rutland's Pine Hill Park and the  school playground in Pomfret.   As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was proud to lead  the creation of the Forest Legacy Program in the 1990 Farm Bill. This  voluntary program recognizes the critical stewardship role that private  landowners play by helping them conserve working forest lands. In so  doing, the Forest Legacy Program supports timber sector jobs and the  forest products economy, and it sustains all the other benefits  provided by intact forests: outdoor recreation, fish and wildlife  habitat, and air and water quality. Since the Forest Legacy Program's  first project at Cow Mountain Pond in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, more  than $39 million in Federal Forest Legacy funds have supported the  permanent conservation of thousands of acres of private working forest  lands in my State.   The conservation ethic embodied in this bill is not just about green  mountains and open waters. This is a conservation bill, a stewardship  bill, and a jobs bill. Passage of the Great American Outdoors Act would  provide immediate and sustained economic stimulus to States and  communities that desperately need it. Vermont's outdoor recreation  sector alone contributes an estimate $5.5 billion annually, supporting  51,000 jobs. Our forest products industry supports more than 10,000  jobs and generates nearly $1.5 billion in economic output. Maintaining  the land base that these sectors depend on through LWCF investments is  essential to Vermont, particularly as our State's economy gets back on  its feet. An analysis by the Trust for Public Land estimates that every  dollar invested in LWCF returns $4 in economic benefits. I call that a  wise investment, particularly considering that LWCF is funded by  revenue from offshore oil and gas leases.   The 116th Congress began with the passage of a sweeping, bipartisan  public lands package, the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management,  and Recreation Act. That bill established permanent authorization for  LWCF. How fitting that we should continue the work we started by now  establishing permanent funding for this legacy program and by finally  addressing the maintenance backlog facing our National Parks and other  public lands. During such an uncertain period for our Nation, it is  clearer than ever that access to trails and public lands is essential  for the physical, emotional, and economic health of every community.  The Great American Outdoors Act embodies the spirit of stewardship that  Vermonters have cultivated for generations, and I am proud to support  it. We should celebrate the Senate's leadership today and thank the  broad coalition of conservation stakeholders in Vermont and across the  country that has helped make this moment possible.    Mr. President, this morning, the Senate narrowly invoked  cloture on the nomination of Justin Walker to the DC Circuit. Within  the week, the Senate is expected to confirm, by the thinnest margins,  both Judge Walker and a separate nominee, Cory Wilson, to the Fifth  Circuit. That fills the final two available seats on the circuit  courts. In one case, there isn't a vacancy yet, but he is preemptively  filling it. This will complete Leader McConnell's rush to pack our  appellate courts with President Trump's nominees.   I want to speak about this because I have had more experience on  nominations, only because of tenure, than anybody else in this body. I  note that both Judge Walker and Judge Wilson are partisan ideologues  who have given no indication that they will leave their politics  outside the courtroom. This has become par for the course under this  President--choosing nominees not for their judicial qualifications and  in spite of their political leanings but because of those partisan  leanings. Extreme partisanship has become a qualifier, not a  disqualifier. It is a prerequisite.   My Republican friends may consider these confirmations a great  achievement; however, I fear that the damage left in the wake of their  effort--to the courts, to the Senate, to the country--is going to  remain with us for years to come after most of us have probably left  this body.   Let us consider the backdrop in which we consider these nominees. We  are in the throes of a global pandemic that has taken almost 120,000  American lives. It has plunged our economy into a deep recession. It  has deprived nearly 45 million Americans of their jobs, something I  have never seen in my years here in the Senate. Yet are we here today  considering legislation that further assists Americans struggling  during this pandemic? Indeed, we have done nothing to respond to COVID- 19 for months even though the House passed $3 trillion in further  assistance last month.   The Senate today is not working together to find bipartisan  meaningful ways to address the plagues of racial and social inequality,  despite the fact that we see millions of Americans of all backgrounds,  ages, creed, and color who flood our streets and squares with protests  in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.  [[Page S3039]]    What are we doing to respond as a body? We are busy processing and  confirming an endless stream of partisan ideologues, such as Justin  Walker and Cory Wilson, to our Federal courts. I think it has to be  noted, again, that Judge Walker, who is a protege of Senator McConnell,  has been nominated to a seat that isn't even vacant until September.   It would be one thing if we were coming together in the Senate across  party lines to confirm mainstream nominees, something we have done so  many times in years past, but nothing about Judge Walker and Judge  Wilson is mainstream. Judge Walker is not shy about his overt  partisanship. He is openly hostile to the Affordable Care Act, even  though the Affordable Care Act has provided a critical lifeline to  millions of Americans during this pandemic. He has dangerously  suggested that the FBI Director--whom we provided with a 10-year term  to avoid politicization--``must think of himself as an agent of the  President.'' One can see why President Trump is interested in a nominee  like him. People should worry about somebody who would want the FBI  Director--who is supposed to treat everybody the same and just uphold  the law--to be, instead, an instrument of whoever is present. Even if  we ignore his hyperpartisan writings and countless cable news  appearances before he became a district court judge--and that was just  a few months ago, last fall--he has already shown he does not leave  politics at the door when he puts on his robes. Even his judicial  investiture ceremony could have been a lead-in for a Trump campaign  rally, where he lamented that his legal principles have not yet  prevailed and feared losing ``our courts and this country'' to his  critics. These may be the words of Judge Walker, but they are not the  words of any other judge I have ever known, Republican, Democrat,  Independent. This judge wears his partisanship as a badge of honor,  knowing that it will only appeal to a President who knows nothing of  the role of the Federal judiciary and, sadly, knowing it will not deter  this Senate from confirming him.   Judge Cory Wilson is no better. Again, I spoke about the Affordable  Care Act, which has provided help to millions of Americans during the  coronavirus epidemic. What does he call it? He calls the Affordable  Care Act ``perverse'' and ``illegitimate.'' Golly, how would he vote on  that? I wonder if those Americans--Republicans and Democrats alike--who  are receiving lifesaving care through the ACA would call the law  perverse.   He has attacked President Obama in ugly, personal terms, berating him  as a ``fit-throwing teenager'' and ``shrill, dishonest, and  intellectually bankrupt.'' That is a good attitude to hold when you are  coming to the Senate as a Federal judge where you are supposed to be  impartial. Such baseless accusations were laughable when he made them.  They are beyond parody today.    Judge Wilson has a long record of undermining minority voting rights  and dismissing the scourge of voter suppression, which we saw again  last week during primary elections. He dismisses that as ``phony,''  even though everybody watching the news, from the right to left, can  see it happening.   What message do these nominees of President Trump send to the country  in this moment? Well, it says that the Republicans in the Senate are  fast-tracking nominees who are eager to overturn the Affordable Care  Act in the midst of a public health pandemic. They are fast-tracking  nominees who are dismissive of racial injustices in the midst of a  national reckoning on racial injustices.   The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent to  a President's nominee. When I came to the Senate, that meant something.  It meant something under both Republican leadership and Democratic  leadership. It meant something with both Republican and Democratic  Presidents. But under this President, that constitutional duty has  meant no more than serving as a mindless conveyer belt to rubberstamp  nominees, however unqualified, however extreme, and however  inappropriate at the moment.   You couldn't have two more inappropriate nominees at a time when we  need healthcare because of the coronavirus or so inappropriate at a  time when we are trying to do away with racial tensions and address the  racial tensions of our country. It says that we don't believe in our  standing as a coequal branch of government and that the Senate is  willing to have that position as a coequal branch of government  diminished.   Worse is the damage we inflict upon our courts. The Senate has now  reshaped our Federal courts, especially our appellate courts, to  resemble an extreme partisan arm of the Republican Party. For  generations, Americans have valued our judiciary for its independence,  a place where all Americans--of any political party or background,  race, or belief--believed they could obtain fair and impartial justice.  That is changing every day under President Trump.   When I tried cases before Federal courts at the district level or the  appellate level--and the same with State courts at the trial level and  the appellate level--I never worried that I would come before that  court and my political beliefs would in any way affect the outcome.  What I thought would affect the outcome would be the facts and the law.  I have appeared before courts of appeals and Federal courts of appeals.  Most of the time I had no idea what the political position or political  party of the judge was. Yet today, anybody who comes in trying a case  or appealing a case has to say: No matter what my facts are or no  matter what the law is, I have to face a partisan ideology with a judge  who is supposed to be nonpartisan. We have seen fair and impartial  justice, as I said, changing every day under President Trump.   I have to hope that the Senate can rediscover its better angels. I  can hope that we can again reassert ourselves as the crucible in which  the great issues of the day are debated heatedly but resolved amicably,  across party lines. I hope that one day the Senate will again serve as  the conscience of the Nation, as it has during so many moments of  upheaval and uncertainty in our history.   Today, more than any other time since I have been here, when we  should be the conscience of the Nation, we are keeping that conscience  locked up behind closed doors.   I hope, one day soon, the Senate will again demand--as it has under  Republican and Democratic leadership in the past--that our President's  judicial nominees are deserving of lifetime appointments to our Federal  courts, possessing the qualifications and temperament that, until now,  were rarely in question and now, time and again, are in question.   I ask my colleagues to go back to being the U.S. Senate. We owe it to  ourselves. We owe it to the Constitution. Most of all, we owe it to the  American people. Let the Senate once again be the conscience of the  Nation, as it should be.    Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention  to a letter published by my friend Sir Peter  [[Page S3058]]  Westmacott, on the occasion of what would have been the meeting of the  G7 at Camp David. Peter is the former U.K. ambassador to the United  States and a thoughtful diplomat if there ever was one. He previously  served as ambassador to France and ambassador to Turkey. Unburdened by  the self-consciousness that sometimes plagues American policymakers  critical of the Trump administration, he writes honestly and  insightfully to a British Prime Minister of the ways President Trump  has weakened America's standing as an international leader and how  others stand to capitalize from our diminished role. In the midst of a  global pandemic compounded by climate change, multiple armed conflicts  and humanitarian crises, Russian aggression and expanding Chinese  influence, when global leadership and cooperation are needed more than  ever, the incoherence and isolationism of this White House are  appalling.   Over many years, I have worked with Senators of both parties, with  Republican and Democratic administrations, and with foreign leaders. I  disagreed with, as well as those with whom we have much in common. The  most successful makers of foreign policy share an adherence to the  truth, objectively and uniformly acknowledged; a recognition of the  importance of engagement with the rest of the world; and the goal of  seeking common ground to make progress on shared interests.   Unfortunately, President Trump fails on each of these counts. As Sir  Peter describes, he disregards facts for his preferred fictitious  narratives. He turns away from our allies and picks fights with our  trading partners. He impulsively withdraws from international  agreements that took years to negotiate because he does not stand to  benefit personally or politically from them. He has abandoned our role  as a moral and strategic leader. He crafts foreign policy by tweet. It  is a disgrace, and foreign diplomats and heads of state, with the  exception of our adversaries and autocrats who stand to benefit by  mimicking President Trump, are confused, worried, and appalled.   Sir Peter aptly describes this sorry state of affairs and what it  means for our country and the world.   I ask unanimous consent that Sir Peter Westmacott's letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [June 10, 2020]      An Ex-Ambassador's View of a World Without Political Leadership                           (By Peter Westmacott)         Dear Prime Minister: This week you should have been meeting       up with your G7 colleagues at Camp David. Covid-19 has       stopped that happening but there is so much going on that I       thought I should send you my briefing note anyway.        President Trump was delighted to be host. He always likes       to be centre stage but the summit would have been a welcome       distraction from his slow and confused response to the       pandemic and from how, in marked contrast to his predecessor,       he made things worse not better when Americans took the       streets following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.       Every judgement he makes from now until 3 November will be       viewed through the prism of whether it helps him win a second       term.        That is currently looking less likely than before the       pandemic. Trump's base is holding up--he has delivered       hundreds of conservative judges, sided with white       supremacists, stood up for the gun lobby and given tax cuts       to the wealthy. His attempts to smear his opponent Joe Biden       don't currently seem to be working but much will depend on       whether there are signs of an economic bounce-back before       election day; and on turn-out, especially in the six critical       swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin where       Trump sealed it last time, plus Florida, North Carolina and       Arizona. Democrats I talk to currently point to the betting       spreads--not just the polls--slightly favouring Biden and       dare to hope for a clean sweep of White House and Senate (not       even Republicans expect the Democrats to lose the House).        The summit would have taken place against a background of       failure of the global institutions, including the G7--to       organise a meaningful collective response to the C19 crisis.       Everyone knows that the WHO chose to praise rather than       lambast China for its performance in the early stages of the       outbreak, in the hope of eliciting a more honest and       transparent response. But your counterparts are clear that       Trump's decision to walk away from the WHO had more to do       with pointing the finger of blame before the US elections       than with improving our ability to act collectively.        This is symptomatic of a wider problem--the disappearance       of US moral and strategic leadership under Trump. The causes       are legion: take for example his protectionist focus on       `America First', the trade wars with China and the EU, the       undermining of NATO, the renunciation of international arms       control agreements, of the Iran nuclear deal, his trashing of       the Middle East Peace Process, his vainglorious but failed       attempt to denuclearise North Korea, his abandonment of the       Paris climate accords, and his unique contribution to the       creation of a posttruth world in which the West has largely       forfeited the right to call out others for bad behaviour.        Crises accelerate trends more than they create new ones.       When Covid-19 hit us, the free world was already rethinking       its attitude towards the rise of a China more interested in       consolidating the power of the communist party and its       leader, Xi Jinping, than in the welfare of its people or       engagement with the rest of the world on any other than its       own terms.        You will recall coming under heavy US pressure in January       to exclude Huawei from Britain's 5G telecoms infrastructure.       Allies and friends in South East Asia were already very       exercised about China's militarisation programme and       disregard of the findings of the UN Law of the Sea Convention       rejecting its territorial claims. Taiwan was feeling       threatened while China's attempt last year to impose an       extradition treaty on Hong Kong was a foretaste of its       attempt now, under cover of the pandemic crisis, further       to undermine ``one country, two systems'' with new       national security laws jeopardising the territory's       fundamental freedoms.        Covid-19 has also accelerated the concern of China's       trading partners about the resilience of their supply chains.       Early in the crisis, Jaguar Land Rover had to halt production       because of a lack of components made in Wuhan. Companies the       world over are now looking again at whether `just-in-time'       deliveries from far away Chinese suppliers need supplementing       with `just-in-case' arrangements nearer home.        Your own launch of Project Defend designed to improve the       resilience of strategically important firms is being matched       by similar rethinking elsewhere in Europe, where Macron and       Merkel have joined forces to press for greater EU       sovereignty. That in turn followed the EU's decision last       year to designate China as ``a systemic rival promoting       alternative systems of governance'', as concern has grown       around China's increasingly apparent agenda of seeing the       Western model of individual liberty, freedom of expression       and democracy replaced by acceptance of authoritarianism and       the party-state.        China likes to pick off individual countries, as we in the       UK have seen in the past. After Australia called for an       independent investigation of the Covid-19 outbreak, China       imposed an 80% tariff on its imports of Australian barley. So       it will be important to forge a common approach. It was       unfortunate that in March US Secretary of State Pompeo       blocked a G-7 statement on the pandemic because other       governments would not agree to describing it as ``the Wuhan       virus''. But Dominic Raab's call with the foreign ministers       of our Five Eyes intelligence partners on 2 June to discuss       Hong Kong was a good start.        As far as possible, however, we should aim to work with       rather than against China. It is heavily invested in the       global economy and has vast trade surpluses with the rest of       the world. It has also begun to move in the right direction       on imports and inward investment--if not yet on protection of       intellectual property. But as you have made clear with your       offer of a path to citizenship for Hong Kong's British       passport holders, that cannot be at the cost of surrendering       fundamental principles or reneging on our international       commitments.        Trump has said he thinks Putin should be invited to the       next G7 summit, whenever it takes place. You have said firmly       that you don't agree, for the very good reason that there has       not been the improvement in Russian behaviour in Ukraine       required by the Minsk agreements. Trump is close to Putin,       and his business dealings with Russia go back many years. So       he may try again, perhaps with the support of Macron who       wants to ``re-engage'' with Russia.        In Putin's playbook, compromise is weakness so you may need       to remind your colleagues of his mission to recover the       ground he thinks Russia lost in what he has called the       ``greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th Century'' when       the Soviet Union imploded; of Russia's role in systematically       undermining elections in free countries; and of the Kremlin's       nasty habit of trying to murder its critics and opponents on       the streets of British cities.        Your European counterparts are likely to raise their       concerns at the current state of Brexit negotiations. They       have understood that you won't be asking to extend the       transition period beyond the end of the year. They would like       a deal to be reached in the remaining six months since they       too will be losers if there isn't one. But just as your team       argue that the Commission are being unreasonable, and have       moved the goalposts, so Barnier & Co think we have changed       our position since you concluded the Withdrawal Agreement and       political declaration last year and that the bespoke       arrangement we are asking for is much more than the simple       Canada-style agreement we say we want. Waiting for, or       provoking, a breakdown, in  [[Page S3059]]       the hope that political leaders will come to the rescue is       unlikely to work: we should be preparing for either stop-the-      clock at the end of December while a last-minute fudge is       worked out, or no deal at all.        Beyond those detailed negotiations lie some big issues       related to Britain's place in the world and our global       influence. The E3 arrangement between France, Germany and the       UK still functions, and is helping to manage the fall-out       from Trump's abandonment of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.       More generally, on many of the big international issues the       UK is more naturally aligned these days with its European       partners than with the US. But there is still a sense that we       currently have little bandwidth or inclination to play the       kind of substantive foreign policy role we have played in the       past, and disappointment in EU capitals that we don't want to       include foreign and security policy in the structure of our       new post-Brexit relationship. I would say this, wouldn't I,       but we need to guard against the risk that, despite the talk       of Global Britain, we find ourselves unable to exercise as       much influence outside the EU as we did inside it--a concern       shared by foreign policy experts in Washington.        So at some point you might want to consider boosting our       soft and hard power alike by bringing together the       substantial resources of our defence, international       development, international trade and foreign ministries in       more joined-up fashion to restore the UK's global       credibility, trust and diplomatic clout. Our friends feel we       have left the stage and want us back. We have in the past       come up with original ideas, built bridges and helped solve       problems. We should aspire to do so again.            Yours,      Peter.                            ____________________
