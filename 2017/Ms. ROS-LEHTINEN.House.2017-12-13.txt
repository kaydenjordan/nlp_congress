 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nicklaus  Children's Hospital in Miami on the opening of its new Sports Health  and Urgent Care Center.   With this new center, Nicklaus continues its proud tradition as one  of the leading pediatric institutions in the Nation. Located in my  congressional district, just down the street from my home in Pinecrest,  this center will provide injury prevention and performance training  programs, as well as rapid care, to our young athletes through the  cutting-edge therapy services found at Nicklaus Children's Hospital. It  will also serve as a resource to families to take their young children,  sadly, in times of medical emergencies.   For decades, Nicklaus Children's Hospital has inspired hope and  promoted lifelong health in south Florida by providing the best care to  kids in our community. It prides itself in bettering south Florida one  patient at a time.   So I invite everyone to come out and meet the staff of the new  Nicklaus Sports Health and Urgent Care Center this Friday, December 15,  at the Suniland Shopping Center in Pinecrest from 9 to 11 a.m.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado  (Mr. Buck) for the time.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling because these bills that we are  combining today came out of his committee. I want to thank him for his  leadership in bringing these important bills before us today.   I rise in support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset  Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from Maine, Bruce  Poliquin, for his  [[Page H9857]]  work in authoring this bill. It is a critical step, a necessary step in  holding the Iranian regime accountable for its money laundering, for  its terror financing, and other wide-ranging criminal activities.   The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known by its initials, its  acronym, IRGC, has long been at the heart of the Iranian criminal  enterprise, controlling the better part of Iran's economy in key  sectors like oil, gas, telecommunications, and transportation.   The IRGC's business empire and monopoly of these economic sectors  provides the regime with billions of dollars that it uses to do what?  To feed the people, to clothe the people, to educate the children?   No. To repress the Iranian people and to export the terror that it  has done so much damage in throughout the world, and its hateful  ideology abroad.   Two years ago, I held a hearing of our Subcommittee on the Middle  East and North Africa, where we explored the role of the IRGC and,  again, that is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We looked at the  role of the IRGC in Iran's economy and we raised these very concerns,  Mr. Speaker.   So I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this  issue and his consistent efforts to hold Iran accountable, because that  is what we are trying to do, hold these terrorists accountable.   This is one of the many issues where the Financial Services and the  Foreign Affairs Committees have done a great job of working together to  implement targeted sanctions against the Iranian regime for its illicit  activity.   For years, our Treasury Department has been working to identify and  to sanction IRGC leaders. They have shell companies. We have been  looking at what these shell companies are. Let's identify and let's  sanction them. Their proxies. Let's designate and warn foreign  companies about the risk of doing business with the IRGC's connected  entities. As fast as the IRGC can create new ones, we shut them down,  new ones pop up.   Unfortunately, the misguided JCPOA has made the Treasury's job even  harder, with the IRGC collecting billions from their financial windfall  created by new outside investments in the very sectors previously  targeted by our sanctions.   So it is important now more than ever that the Treasury publicizes  the assets controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the  rest of Iran's corrupt leadership for two reasons, Mr. Speaker.   First, so that the long-suffering people of Iran, with whom we have  no problem--we want to help the people of Iran so that these people  have a window into the regime's pervasive theft and corruption that  deprives them of the most basic of commodities.   Second, so that businesses stop funneling cash into these criminal  enterprises that are financing terror throughout the world.   This bill will help shine a necessary light on these nefarious  actions of Iran both inside and outside of the country, and I urge its  swift passage.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed leader for this  time, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening  Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act, authored by our good friend  Mr. Williams of Texas, who is swinging for the fences.   When the Obama administration signed this terrible Iran nuclear deal,  in addition to the lifting of sanctions and sending billions of dollars  to this hideous regime, it also authorized licenses for the export of  commercial passenger planes to Iran.   After selling the world a bill of goods, the administration then  turned around and agreed to allow the sale of planes to the world's  biggest exporter of terror. Not only that, but U.S. financial  institutions would be needed to finalize these sales, meaning American  taxpayers' dollars could be used to finance these sales.   The results were predictable, Mr. Speaker. Iran has been using its  commercial planes to transport fighters, to transport weapons, to  transport material to Hezbollah in Syria, just to mention one. The list  could go on and on, many illicit activities.   This is not something that Americans would be supporting, let alone  underwriting. That is why Mr. Williams' bill is so important, and I  thank Mr. Hensarling for bringing it to the floor. It protects the U.S.  financial system, and it protects the taxpayers by giving us in  Congress greater oversight. That is what this bill is about: oversight  over business that the Treasury authorizes with Iran.   As we have heard speaker after speaker, Iran is the number one  leading state sponsor of terror. It is responsible for the deaths of  countless brave American men and women fighting overseas. It is the  destabilizing force in Syria, to name just one of the countries.   The Supreme Leader calls for the destruction of our most trusted  ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel; and the calls for ``death  to America,'' Mr. Speaker, they go on and on, and it is written on  walls.    Mr. Speaker, the JCPOA was flawed. We all know  that. It was weak and it was dangerous.   Let's ask our constituents, our taxpayers, if they want their dollars  to fund the purchase of planes for the number one state sponsor of  terror. I think that the answer would be ``no.''   We are actually being asked to supposedly support American jobs by  helping Iran, the number one terror state, to buy planes so this horrid  human-rights abuser of a country, this killer of Americans can use  these very planes to continue exporting its terror activities  throughout the world.  [[Page H9888]]    This is preposterous. It is a false choice.   Mr. Speaker, this bill protects the American consumer; it protects  our constituents; it protects the taxpayer; and it gives us in Congress  the proper oversight. Let's pass what this is: a commonsense bill.
