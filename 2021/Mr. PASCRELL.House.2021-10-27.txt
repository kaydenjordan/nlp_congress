 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   It is good to have something bipartisan on this floor, I will tell  you that.   Mr. Speaker, during this devastating pandemic, our Nation's first  responders have stood heroically on the very front lines keeping  communities across America safe. Our firefighters, police, and EMS go  to work every day, and they risk their lives and the lives of their  families.   In my own district, we lost Paterson police officer Frank Scorpo and  Passaic firefighter Israel Tolentino to COVID. These men made the  ultimate sacrifice for their communities.   My heart bleeds for all of our fallen first responders and their  families. Last year was the deadliest ever for our Nation's public  safety officers. COVID has made it clear as day that more must be done  to support these heroes.   As long-time co-chair of the Law Enforcement Caucus and the Fire  Services Caucus, I have been proud to lead efforts to pass the  bipartisan Protecting America's First Responders Act with Senator Chuck  Grassley.   I want to thank Senator Grassley for working together to get this  bill across the finish line. He has been a good partner to shepherd  this through the other Chamber.   Currently, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program only provides  disability benefits to first responders who can never again perform any  compensated work at all. This is so restrictive that officers  practically need to be in a vegetative state to qualify.   Our bill will guarantee that first responders and their families get  their owed benefits without delay or red tape.   Our legislation will expand the disability definition so permanently  injured first responders can still receive benefits and perform work  that is for therapeutic purposes, involves simple tasks, and provides  special accommodations.   Our legislation also provides retroactive disability benefits to  injured 9/11 first responders.   The bill extends these critical officer safety benefits to groups  unfairly left out of the program. This includes trainees, fire police  officers, and Good Samaritan first responders who protect the public  while off duty.   Importantly, our bill extends the statutory presumption that  guarantees the families of first responders fallen to COVID-19 receive  full public safety officer benefits.   I was glad to work alongside Chairman Nadler to pass this presumption  into law last year. I thank him for his efforts to bring the Protecting  America's First Responders Act to the floor today. It is especially  important because our bill provides an extension of this critical  provision.   Finally, I want to recognize the fire and police organizations who  support our bill. Thank you to the Fraternal Order of Police, the  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association  of Police Organizations, the International Association of Fire Chiefs,  and the National Volunteer Fire Council. I especially want to  [[Page H5952]]  recognize the International Association of Fire Fighters for their  recent support.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statements from each of these  organizations.   Stakeholder Support for Protecting America's First Responders Act (S.                             1511 / H.R. 2936)         Edward A. Kelly, General President of the International       Association of Firefighters (IAFF): ``On behalf of the       325,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical       personnel of the International Association of Fire Fighters,       I respectfully request you vote in favor of S. 1511, the       Protecting America's First Responders Act (PAFRA). This       bipartisan legislation will help ensure the families of fire       fighters and emergency medical personnel who are disabled or       die in the line of duty receive the compensation and benefits       they deserve.        The Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB) provides       guaranteed death and disability benefits to emergency       responders who die or are disabled in the line of duty.       Unfortunately, current law places significant limits on       program awards, leaving the families of deceased or injured       public safety officers without deserved recompense. PAFRA       corrects these oversights by ensuring disabled responders may       qualify for necessary benefits, extending benefits to fire       department cadets who are killed or injured in the course of       their training, extending benefits to children of public       safety officers who had not been born at the time of the       officer's death or disability, and extending benefits for       officers who die from COVID-19 for the duration of the public       health emergency.        Fire fighters and emergency medical responders make       significant sacrifices to serve their communities everyday,       and should not need to worry about their families' financial       security should they sustain lasting injuries or lose their       life in the line of duty. PAFRA will help ensure responders'       families are cared for in the face of catastrophe, and       deserves your affirmative vote.''        Ken Stuebing, Acting President and Chairman of the Board of       the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC): ``I       would like to thank Representative Pascrell for introducing       the Protecting America's First Responders Act. This       legislation would revise the Public Safety Officers' Benefits       program to provide necessary assistance to more families of       fallen public safety officers during their time of need. The       IAFC looks forward to working with Congress to pass this       important legislation.''        Steven W. Hirsch, Chair of the National Volunteer Fire       Council (NVFC): ``PAFRA makes important improvements to the       process by which public safety officers are able to access       the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) Disability       Program. It also makes necessary changes to how PSOB claims       are paid to the survivors of public safety officers who died       of occupational illnesses related to work at Ground Zero       after 9/11. Finally, I am very pleased that the PAFRA       includes language clarifying that members of volunteer fire       departments who perform scene security and traffic management       duties at emergency scenes are public safety officers''        Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of       Police (FOP): ``The PSOB program is currently burdened with       unreasonable definitions of the terms `catastrophic injury'       and `gainful work' that prevent officers who are disabled in       the line of duty from receiving the benefits to which they       are entitled. This legislation addresses this issue by making       the PSOB standards more consistent with similar Federal       benefit for programs which will improve the ability of our       injured and disabled officers to have their claims processed       more fairly and more quickly''        Larry Cosme, National President of the Federal Law       Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA): ``FLEOA fought for       years to have the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB)       program created in order to support officers killed or       injured in the line of duty. Congress meant for this       important program to support officers and their families.       Unfortunately far too many officers are unable to qualify for       any type of disability benefit due to how the law was       written, including heroic 9/11 responders who continue to       face lingering health issues metastasizing years later after       the attack. FLEOA appreciates the bipartisan and bicameral       leadership of Representative Pascrell and Senator Grassley to       ensure officers are able to access the PSOB program benefits       they are entitled to and have earned, and look forward to       working with their offices and other champions in Congress to       advance this critical reform''        Bill Johnson, Executive Director of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO): ``The goal of the       Protecting America's First Responders Act is to help protect       the ability of survivors, disabled officers and their       families to get the death and disability benefits they so       rightly deserve. This important legislation will ensure that       officers who are disabled in the line of duty are not left       behind by the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) Program       and that all children of our fallen or disabled heroes are       able to benefit from the Public Safety Officers' Education       Assistance Program. NAPO supports the efforts of       Representative Pascrell and Senator Grassley to ensure that       America's public safety officers, who put their lives on the       line every day in service to our nation, get the benefits       promised to them, and we thank him for his leadership on this       issue.''     Mr. Speaker, the past 18 months have been difficult for  our communities, difficult for all Americans. It has been especially  unbearable for our men and women in uniform.   These brave individuals have protected us at our lowest moment. The  least we can do is protect the benefits they have earned and stand with  them.
