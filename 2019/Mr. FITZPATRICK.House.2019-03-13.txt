 Mr. Speaker, our local businesses in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, help make our community vibrant and prosperous. Today, I  am proud to recognize one such business, McCaffrey's Food Markets,  which was recently named Business of the Year by the Newtown Business  Association. Each year, the Newtown Business Association recognizes a  business that contributes to our regional economy and contributes  substantially to the community at large.   The McCaffreys opened their first supermarket in 1986 in Lower  Makefield and over the past three decades has expanded throughout  Pennsylvania and  [[Page H2688]]  New Jersey while maintaining its headquarters in Middletown Township.   McCaffrey's Food Markets and the McCaffrey family are both noted for  their generosity to our community and are noted supporters of the  American Red Cross, St. Mary's Medical Center, the American Cancer  Society, and the 9/11 Garden of Reflection, among many other  organizations and memorials.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud McCaffrey's Food Markets, the McCaffrey  family, and all their amazing employees for their investment in our  community and their entrepreneurship.    I also thank Bill Sheffer and Beverly Dimler of the Newtown Business  Association for all their leadership in our community.       Recognizing Bucks County Association for the Blind and Visually                                  Impaired     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is seeking to assist  college students as they enter the workforce. The Bucks County  Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired, based in Newtown,  recently teamed up with Bucks County Community College to collect  attire for college students.   Mr. Speaker, a critical component to ensuring the success of recent  college graduates, and those who will be graduating in the future, is  making sure that they are equipped with the resources they need to  succeed. I applaud the work of the Bucks County Association for the  Blind and Visually Impaired, especially the organization's executive  director, Anne Marie Hyer, for her service.   I also thank Bucks County Community College for its collaboration  with this dynamic organization and so many others in our community.                             Honoring John Poprik     Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and memory of a very, very special member of  the Bucks County community, John Poprik, whom we recently lost.   Born in Philadelphia, John attended Father Judge High School and  Drexel University, where he graduated in 1970 with a degree in  accounting. He was a respected business executive, having served as the  CFO of Better Material Corp. before becoming the CFO of Sommer Maid  Creamery.   John was truly dedicated to making our community a better place  through public service. He served on the Northampton Bucks County Water  and Sewer Authority, the Bucks County Drug and Alcohol Commission, and  Pennsylvania's Office of Unemployment Compensation Board of Review.   More than anything, John was a dedicated family man. He spent some of  his most treasured moments with his five grandchildren, his wife, Pat,  and his children.   I extend my deepest condolences to his beloved wife of 50 years, my  dear friend Pat Poprik, and their sons, Brad and Matt. May John, a good  and decent and honorable man, enjoy his eternal reward for a life well- lived.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and the memory of a very special member of our  Bucks County community, John Poprik, who our community recently lost.
