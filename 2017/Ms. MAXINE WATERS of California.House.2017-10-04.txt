 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to the Republican's 2018 budget, which would dramatically  increase our deficit and debt by trillions of dollars to give  millionaires and billionaires a massive tax cut.   Don't be fooled. This plan directly benefits President Trump, his  family, and his administration, including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,  Education Secretary DeVos, and Commerce Secretary Ross, but offers  breadcrumbs for the middle class and nothing for low-income Americans.   The craziest thing about all of this is that Republicans have been  crowing for 7 years that the deficit is too large and that it is  hurting our job growth, yet here they go abandoning their principles to  cash out their rich benefactors.   I also want to talk about some of the ways Republicans partially pay  for this tax cut for the rich. During the same week that Equifax and  Wells Fargo executives are testifying about the harm they have caused  to millions of Americans, Republicans propose gutting the Consumer  Bureau, which has successfully helped millions of our constituents  receive compensation by effectively eliminating its funding and  independence.  [[Page H7790]]    What is more, Republicans would eliminate the backup authority to  safely unwind failing megabanks without harm to our economy. Rather  than eliminate this tool, we should instead be talking about how to  break up bad megabanks like Wells Fargo, who repeatedly break the law  and harm millions of consumers. Yet, both the Consumer Bureau and the  megabank wind-down authority are sacrificed to pay for the richest 1  percent tax cut.   So I would urge all of my colleagues to reject this measure.
