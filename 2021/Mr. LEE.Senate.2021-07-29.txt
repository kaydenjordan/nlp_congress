 Mr. President, the word ``republic'' means public thing in  Latin.   We bring our different perspectives and our different identities  together respectfully to make decisions for an entire Nation. The  United States is a nation with diverse, varied beliefs, different  cultural origins, and different politics from the different regions and  different States that we represent. It has been this way from the very  beginning.   As much as some of us imagine otherwise, from the very outset of our  Republic, there were immense, regional differences. Depending on which  State someone represented, they might have different views.   Now, our Republic--and, for that matter, any republic ever in the  history of republics--has relied on the willingness of the citizenry to  be kind, for individuals who play a role in that Republic to be kind  and respectful and decent to each other, even when--especially when--we  disagree with each other. Our Founders knew that, and they enshrined it  into our Constitution.   As much as anything, they assumed it, and it was on that set of  assumptions that the norms enshrined in the Constitution became  possible, because without them they would not be. Without them none of  this would work.   You see, the only way a republic can possibly function now or 250  years ago or 250 years from now is that it always has to follow a  somewhat similar formula. The only way it can function is when citizens  and leaders are gracious to those with whom they disagree and grant the  freedom necessary to allow others to make choices, even if those  choices might be things that they disagree with.   We have witnessed the degradation of American political discourse for  some time now. It has been a sad, tragic reality unfolding, but it is  not an inexorable conclusion. It is not one from which we cannot  depart. But we must make a choice to do better and to choose a better  path.   We received a bulletin earlier today--a bulletin from the Capitol  Police--indicating that all visitors and all House staffers and, in  fact, all House Members are required to wear masks indoors or be denied  entry or forced to leave the premises. And at least in the case of  staff and visitors, if they fail to comply, they will be arrested-- arrested for unlawful entry. Conviction for a violation of this rule  will, according to the bulletin, be punished by a fine of not more than  $1,000, imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or both. The Senate,  which happens to be housed in the same building as the House, is not  subject to these same requirements.   But is this decision based on science or is it based on the will and  whim of the Speaker of the House of Representatives? Whatever the  reason, the arrest of peaceful House staffers shows the total loss of  political grace in the House of Representatives.   I cannot fathom a legitimate reason to arrest a person in this  building for not wearing a mask. I cannot fathom a legitimate reason  for arresting anyone based on a failure to wear a mask.   Members are not treated as the legitimate representatives of their  constituents, as in fact they are, under our system of government, when  they are subjected to this kind of manipulation and when they are  subjected to this type of oppressive order. Staff, under this type of  oppressive directive, aren't treated as hard-working, dedicated  Americans, which truly they are. Instead, everyone who doesn't comply  is deemed the enemy of the current House of Representatives. There is  no room for disagreement or dissent.    It is tragic, indeed, to see a key deliberative body where dissent  and debate are supposed to be tolerated and appreciated and decided and  have been not just for decades but for centuries--to see that turned  into a place where disagreement and dissent are disdained and punished  by arrests.   Congress works on collegiality and respect. We need to get back to  those basics.   Regardless of what you might think about the coronavirus, about the  vaccine, about masks, there is never a good reason to arrest someone  for not wearing a mask.   This decision falls into the larger context of the Centers for  Disease Control's recent flip-flop on masks and the Biden  administration's worrying push toward masks and vaccination mandates.   The CDC issued updated recommendations earlier this week, stating at  its outset that masks should be worn indoors in areas of ``substantial  or high transmission,'' even by individuals who have been fully  vaccinated.   Now, this new guidance claims that ``[e]merging evidence suggests  that fully vaccinated persons who do become infected with the Delta  variant are at risk for transmitting it to others.'' But one glaring  thing is missing from that conclusion: evidence backing up the CDC's  claims.   In fact, the CDC didn't publish any new research on the effectiveness  of the COVID vaccines against the newer variants when it issued its  latest edict. The CDC's website simply cites ``unpublished data'' from  its own COVID-19 Response Team when it makes this new, rather  significant, rather jarring, rather impactful, and rather unwise claim.   The CDC is undermining its own credibility and, thus, I believe  placing public health and safety at risk by going back and forth on  recommendations and failing to be upfront about whether there is any  actual reliable scientific evidence to support or compel those  recommendations.   In fact, even when asked questions by Members of Congress, the CDC is  failing to respond. This is not hyperbole; this is not conjecture; this  is based on my own personal experience. I will point to the fact that  on April 24, more than 3 months ago, I sent a letter to the Centers for  Disease Control asking a very simple question, a simple question that I  would hope anyone here would want to be asked. I wanted to know why is  it, when there are so many of our peer nations around the world that  don't require masks to be worn on airplanes, for example, by children  as young as 2, as we do in the United States--you know, many of our  peer nations, a mask requirement may not kick in until 10 or 11 years  old or, in some cases, 5 or 6 years old. But, here, the CDC has said  that it has got to kick in at 2 years old. I would ask the question:  Did any of these people who made this recommendation, who made that  conclusion that 2-year-olds should have to travel with a mask, have  they ever known an actual 2-year-old? Have they ever raised a child?  Have they ever traveled on an airplane? Have they ever traveled in a  car, in a bus, on a train, in the rain, anywhere with an actual child?  This doesn't work.   Now, when you add that to the fact that children react to the virus  differently than adults do--and that is putting it mildly--when you add  that to the fact that this creates other problems for children, not  just for those handling them but for the kids themselves, it makes it  especially important to know why.   Now, my letter wasn't attempting to make any case. My letter was  simply trying to obtain information. You see, because when the CDC  makes these sweeping recommendations, and sometimes they like to make  them feel easier by calling them recommendations, when, in fact, they  precipitate a whole host of things that feel a whole lot more binding  than recommendations. You see, because if you get on an airplane or a  bus or a train or you go to a bus depot or a train station or an  airport, and you have got a 2-year-old who won't wear a mask, as any  red-blooded American 2-year-old will not do, you are told that you are  subject to arrest and that you are violating Federal law if you do  that. So it is not unreasonable to ask that they pony up with  information. If they are going to make recommendations, they should  explain to us what those recommendations are.   So I asked them what scientific proof is there that a 2-year-old  needs to wear a mask?   Well, I sent that on April 24. I didn't hear anything on April 25 or  April 26 or the 27th or the 28th, 29th, or 30th, or any of the days of  the months of May or June or July, and we are almost to the end of the  month of July. They didn't respond to this. I don't know why. Maybe  they are really busy doing other stuff. Maybe they are really busy  figuring out where they are going to flip-flop next and where they are  going to issue their next edict that the American people are expected  to follow, all  [[Page S5166]]  in the name of it being science, that we have to defer to blindly,  without any evidence. But this isn't acceptable, and it doesn't inspire  confidence, nor does it inspire confidence for an Agency that makes  these sorts of recommendations that have a really significant impact to  flip-flop and not justify its own analysis, not provide even a  scintilla of scientific proof for what it did.   So let's get back to its more recent flip-flop. The fact that it has  flip-flopped this week, coupled with the fact that it hasn't backed up  its other claims over the last few months, is understandably troubling  to many of us, especially so, when you consider the fact that in my  personal experience, I have been vaccinated. I chose to get the  vaccine. I respect those who have chosen not to.   Many of those I have known who have been reluctant to get the  vaccine, who eventually got the vaccine, most of them, I would say,  ended up getting it when they realized that certain aspects of life  could be made mor predictable and more convenient if they did get the  vaccine.    Many people, when they walked into a hotel lobby or a restaurant or a  grocery store or at Costco or at Sam's Club, if they would see signs  saying that vaccinated persons need not wear masks, they would realize  there is some benefit there; that if they got the vaccine, they could  walk in there and say, well, I don't have to wear the mask.   Now, obviously, we don't ever want to get to the point where somebody  has to wear an arm band to prove whether they have been vaccinated or  not. In fact, it would be an absolutely horrifying experiment that we  should not attempt. But the fact is, that when people see that there  might be some benefit, they are more likely to do it. If they see that  something different will happen in their life if they get the vaccine,  they are more likely to get it.   But when you are constantly moving the goalpost, you are saying:  ``Here are the benefits of the vaccine. Oh, psych, just kidding. We are  moving along. We are going to take those away,'' people are not going  to get it. So if you want more people to get vaccinated, you darn well  better have the CDC getting its act together, providing scientific  evidence for what the CDC is recommending and what it is not.   So, look, I am still waiting for answers from the CDC on my April 24  letter. And I am still waiting for answers from the CDC when it comes  to scientific evidence supporting their most recent flip-flop. But  while we wait for those answers, and that clock is ticking--I don't  know whether we need to start humming the tune to ``Jeopardy,'' but  they do need to provide those answers. And while we wait for those  answers, here are a few principles that I think might help guide some  of our discussions:   Our government needs to trust Americans to make these decisions, some  of the most personal decisions that a human being can make for  themselves. We need to trust the people's representatives in Congress  to make decisions regarding the law. We need to be able to trust each  other, to be decent, and to be kind when we disagree.   We have to learn from our own history, from our own nature as  individuals, and from the history that we have experienced as a nation.  We cannot stand by while those in power simply decide on their own whim  that they are going to arrest political opponents for disagreeing.   At what point did we decide that it was OK to cross that threshold? I  get it. We always need to be able to disagree without being  disagreeable. Sometimes that is really hard. Sometimes all of us fall a  little short of that mark. But I think all of us should be able to  agree that we shouldn't arrest those who disagree with us merely  because they disagree with us. That is wrong. We are better than that.   This time calls for more political understanding and hardy,  legitimate debate, not blind mandates and manipulation.   We have to remember that, at its heart, at its core, government is  not deity. It is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. Government doesn't  have eyes to see you. It doesn't have arms with which to embrace you.  It doesn't have a heart with which to love you. Government is force. It  is the official use of coercive force.   Now, we need that. We need that to protect safety, to make sure that  we don't hurt each other; that we are not harmed by others; that we  don't take each other's possessions. But we have to be very careful how  we operate it because otherwise force is just force. And if we start  arresting everyone with whom we disagree, we are not going to be able  to do the things we need to do, which is to make sure that government  is there to prevent people from hurting each other and taking each  other's things.   We need to be kind to our neighbors, even when--especially when--we  disagree. We need to be helpful and caring to those around us, even if  they vote, feel, believe, or even act very differently than we do. We  must not allow for arrests and mandates to Members of Congress and  their staffs without providing sufficient evidence.   And, yes, all of this stuff goes both ways. We all need to be  respectful of each other's opinions. But, look, we are not talking here  about activity that, by its very nature, is so harmful that it warrants  the use of blunt political force in the form of an arrest.   I cannot fathom a circumstance in which it is ever appropriate to  arrest another human being for not wearing a mask, COVID or no COVID.  That is not arrest material.   In Congress and across the country, what we need now is a return to  American graciousness. Our way of life and our precious Republic are at  stake.   Thank you.    Mr. President, as we have undertaken this conversation, I  can't help but reflect on the fact that we are here in a representative  body. We are here in order to have an exchange of ideas. We are here to  engage in political speech, not the kind of political speech that  people think of when they think of the word ``politics,'' where they  think of something necessarily unpleasant. You know, when people hear  the word ``political'' or ``politics,'' they think of the two great  roots of the word ``politics.'' You have poly, which means many; and  ticks, which are blood-sucking parasites. And they assume if it is  political, it is unpleasant.   But I am using the word ``political'' here in a different sense, the  sense that refers to the body politic. It refers to the fact that we  are doing the people's business. The exchange of information, of ideas  is essential to everything we do.   Then it occurs to me that the mask discussion does carry a deeper  meaning here, a deeper meaning that takes into account the fact that  when we communicate--sometimes with words, sometimes without words,  sometimes in print, sometimes with the spoken word, sometimes without  any words at all--we are engaging in activity that is protected by the  First Amendment.   Now, this is important to note in a wide swath of areas. It is  important for how we worship or decline to do the same. It is important  in how we express our viewpoints in our news, in our entertainment,  media. In every aspect of our lives, it is important.   It is regarded as especially important in a body politic that people  be able to express their feelings about government and about the role  of government. It is also especially important here that people be able  to speak and otherwise communicate in a way that is clear and  unvarnished, unfiltered.   In fact, we go so far even as to protect Members of Congress from  liability in what they would say on the floor of the Senate or the  House of Representatives. We do that because we feel that a full,  frank, informed discussion is important. We don't want Members being  threatened with some sort of action, civil or criminal, based on things  that they would utter here.   So freedom of speech is important for all citizens. It is also  important to make sure that that freedom of speech is protected here.   It occurs to me that with the question of masks, the decision whether  to wear a mask is not only deeply personal, but it is also, in this  context, quite arguably expressive. Even before you utter a single word  and regardless of whether you utter a single word, in many respects,  your decision to wear a mask or not wear a mask is, itself, a form of  expression. And as a form of suppression, it is protected.   In a long line of cases, the Supreme Court of the United States has  identified conduct that is expressive and therefore protected by the  First Amendment, notwithstanding the fact that it doesn't necessarily  involve words.   When you merge that with another line of analysis under First  Amendment jurisprudence, we remember the fact that it is a problem  whenever government suppresses speech in one way or another. It is  especially problematic when the government tries to compel speech. When  the government tries to direct an individual that he or she must utter  certain words in order to be compliant with the dictates of the  government, that implicates the compelled speech doctrine, and the  compelled speech doctrine is an especially rigid one. It is an  especially rigid one with very good reason.   You don't want to force people to say stuff. That is the not  government's role. That is the whole idea behind the First Amendment,  is that the government needs to stay out of our headspace. It needs to  stay out of where we worship; it needs to stay out of our relationship  with God; it needs to stay out of printing presses; and it needs to  stay out of what we say.   Sometimes what we say can consist of things that don't even involve  words, something as simple as whether or not to wear a mask. In  addition to all of the other public policy reasons, in addition to all  the problems with having a CDC issuing these sweeping mandates and  edicts without bothering to back up those edicts with scientific  justification--even after months and months of receiving inquiries from  Members of the U.S. Senate that they do so--separate and apart from all  of those issues, I think it is important for us to look at the speech  element, the expressive conduct that is inherent in whether or not you  wear a mask, and whether or not by compelling people to wear a mask,  you are compelling people to engage in state-sponsored speech. You are  telling them that they must send a message, a message with which they  may well disagree.   Now, if I am wrong on this, if this is strictly a medical issue, then  it will be backed up by scientific medical evidence. That is the nature  of the problem that I have with the CDC's mandate, its ever-fluctuating  mandate, its mandate that, as recently as a few days ago, flip-flopped  yet again. If, in fact, it were medical and scientific, it would be  backed up as such, but it is not.   This is a form of compelled speech, not as we traditionally  understand it because compelled speech usually involves the utterance  of specific words. But we know that speech can be protected, even if it  doesn't involve words, if it is a type of expressive conduct, which  wearing a mask is, especially if as here. We don't have scientific  evidence making it a medical issue.   So I would ask the Speaker of the House: Are you really going to  arrest people for not saying what you want them to say? That is not OK.  If it would never be OK for you to arrest people for not saying words  that you have prescribed for them, why is it OK for you to compel them  to engage in expressive conduct now amounting to speech? It is not.   Make no mistake, this isn't medical. This isn't scientific. If it  were, we would have evidence of such. We don't   In light of that, separate and apart from all the other problems-- problems that inhere in our form of government, problems that inhere in  the fact we do, in fact, have three distinct branches of our Federal  Government, that most laws are not Federal laws to begin with. Most  laws originate in the States and in the localities. Most laws are not  Federal, and they should never be.   But for those things that should be Federal laws, we have got one and  only one branch of government that makes laws. It is no coincidence  that the very first clause of the very first section of the very first  article of the Constitution provides:         All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a       Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and a House of Representatives.    Article I, section 7 then goes on to outline the formula contemplated  in article I, section 1. In article I, section 7, it says that you  can't make a law under our form of government--at least not a Federal  law--without passage in the House of Representatives and passage in the  Senate and presentment to the President of the United States.   In many respects, these recommendations issued by the CDC end up  carrying the force of generally applicable Federal law. That is wrong.  And in many, many respects, that is on us. We have done a horrible job  over the last few years--I would say over the last few decades--I would  say over the last 80, 85 years, really. I won't lay the  [[Page S5170]]  blame entirely at the feet of either party. In fact, this has happened  under the control of different parties. It has happened with Senates  and Houses of Representatives and White Houses of every conceivable  partisan combination. We have seen the de facto outsourcing of our  lawmaking authority to unelected, unidentifiable bureaucrats; men and  women who, while well-educated, well-intentioned, hard-working, and  highly specialized, don't work for the people. They don't work for you.  You do not have the ability to elect them or unelect them.   You don't have the authority to replace them. That is why it is so  dangerous for us to give them this sweeping authority. And even where  they don't technically have authority that extends very far--and in  this case, it is far too far, as evidenced by the fact that anytime you  get on an airplane or other mode of public transportation, you are told  that, under penalty of Federal law, you must wear a mask.   But I would ask, where is the act of Congress providing that? In what  year did the Congress of the United States pass through the House and  through the Senate and submit to the President of the United States for  signature or veto a law stating that you must wear a mask on a plane or  a train or a bus or in a bus depot or in a train station or in an  airport under penalty of Federal law? There is no such law. You will  not find it.   Now, you will find some other stuff in which we delegated far too  much authority and given broad authority to the executive branch--to  people like the CDC--to issue regulations. But as a matter of proper  form, whenever they exercise that power, it is not appropriate for that  to take effect by itself. It is not really a law in the constitutional  sense of the word unless Congress has enacted it.   We have given them far too much power anyway. That is on us. We  shouldn't do that. That is why I have been calling for years for  reforms to this; why I have been calling for years for reforms,  including but not limited to the REINS Act, which would require for any  economically significant Federal regulation, before it takes effect, it  must be passed by both Houses of Congress and presented to the  President for signature or veto. It is why I have introduced the Global  Trade Accountability Act, which would do for trade policy what the  REINS Act does for regulatory policy. It is why we need to reform so  many aspects of our laws, where we, as a practical matter, made the  unelected and the unaccountable the supreme lawgivers, the lawmakers,  law interpreters, and law enforcers.   This is not just something that can lead to tyranny; it is the very  definition of tyranny, as every signer of the U.S. Constitution  understood well. It is why they went to great lengths to separate out  these three branches of government.   In addition to those problems with these edicts not based on science  or medicine but based on political considerations that are ever- changing--it is why they are so sweeping. It is why they are so  troubling.   But they are maybe even more troubling, still, for the additional  constitutional reason that, at the end of the day, to whatever degree  these are not rooted in medical science and fact--which I believe they  are not or at least the CDC hasn't established as much, and they really  do amount to something compelling expressive conduct, the suppression  of an official orthodoxy mandated by the government--we shouldn't  accept this. We shouldn't accept any affirmative legal obligation  placed on those we represent, to whom and for whose been we have sworn  an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United  States, which requires us to make any law we force on the American  people. We have an obligation to them, a solemn obligation to make sure  they are not subject to laws made by those not of their own choosing.   It is these very features that James Madison had in mind when he  authored Federalist No. 62. When he wrote, and I am paraphrasing a  little bit here: It will be of little benefit to the American people  that their laws may be written by men of their own choosing if those  laws be so voluminous, complex, and ever-changing, if they can't  reasonably understand what the law means and predict what it will say  from one day to the next.   Today--this week even--we have seen the law be so unpredictable and  ever-changing, that we can't expect what the law says from one day to  another. But even worse, contrary to what Madison assumed would always  be the case because the Constitution required it, the laws aren't even  being written by men and women of our own choosing but instead by  unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who, despite how well-educated,  well-intentioned, hard-working, and highly-specialized they may be,  don't work for you, nor do they have authority under this document, to  which we have all sworn an oath, to make laws.   That is our power. Shame on us if we relinquish to them the power  that only we can exercise, that is, itself, nondelegable. Shame on us,  further, if we allow those same people who, lacking the authority to  legislate in the first instance, then transgress another affirmative  constitutional command by compelling compliance with official  government-mandated orthodoxy.   This cannot be. This cannot stand. I will not stand for it, and I  will continue to draw attention to this issue until we have resolved  the problem.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
