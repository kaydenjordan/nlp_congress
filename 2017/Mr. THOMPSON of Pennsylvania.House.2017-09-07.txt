 Mr. Speaker, during the August in- district work period, I had the privilege of visiting CPI in Pleasant  Gap, Pennsylvania. CPI is the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science  and Technology.   I was proud that my colleague, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of  Illinois, was able to join me in Pennsylvania's Fifth District at CPI  on the first day of school.   CPI was founded in 1969 to meet the career and technical education  needs of high school students in Centre County. By combining academies  with technical training and industry-recognized certifications, CPI is  uniquely poised to prepare students for rapid employment and long-term  career success. CPI offers more than 18 secondary programs, over 60 in- house adult and continuing education programs, and more than 350 online  courses.   In addition to exceptional classroom and hands-on instruction from a  highly qualified, experienced faculty, CPI offers certification in a  wide range of disciplines, a notable advantage to CPI graduates and  their employers.   Congressman Krishnamoorthi and I were at CPI to talk about our bill,  the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Act. This House unanimously approved the bill in June, and I call on  the United States Senate to make it a priority for this fall.   Mr. Speaker, our bill is the first major overhaul to the Carl D.  Perkins Career and Technical Education Act in more than 10 years. The  bipartisan legislation strengthens and improves career and technical  education and gives Americans the skills they need to compete for in- demand jobs.   This can be witnessed firsthand at CPI. This November, CPI will  launch a new 2-year degree program: Natural Gas Compression--CAT/Ariel  Emphasis Associate of Specialized Technology. The program is in  partnership with the Cleveland Brothers, a Pennsylvania-based  Caterpillar dealer, and Ariel Corporation, the world's leading  manufacturer of natural gas compressors. CPI is currently accepting  students for a November 28, 2017, start date. It is only one of two  programs of its kind nationwide.   Ariel Corporation compressors and CAT engines are located in oil and  gas fields throughout the world. Graduates of CPI's natural gas  compressor degree program will have an opportunity to work locally,  nationally, and globally. Cleveland Brothers, Ariel, and gas industry  partners will be interviewing the NGC students after the first term. If  pre-hired by the program's industry partners, students will receive  company-sponsored tuition reimbursement.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the type of career and technical  education investments we should be making and encouraging. By educating  Americans in high-demand fields, they can climb rungs on the ladder of  opportunity and obtain family-sustaining jobs.   I will continue to advocate for these important reforms that will  benefit Americans from all walks of life. I urge the Senate to take up  our bill without delay. It is important to close the skills gap and  give every American a chance at having a fulfilling career.  [[Page H7093]]                                     time  1015    Now, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Krishnamoorthi, for  traveling to Pennsylvania to see this program in action. I want to  thank the staff of CPI for not only hosting us on the first day of  school, but for working to educate students in their chosen fields.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act on this bipartisan bill without  delay because it is critically important to closing the skills gap in  this country, and above all else, it is a win for the American worker  and American families. Let's help all Americans learn to earn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Clarion University of Pennsylvania as it celebrates 150 years.   In 1859, the people of Clarion County created a proposal for a higher  education institution in Clarion. Shortly after, the Civil War erupted  and disrupted the Nation, but it did not stop the determination of the  Clarion people.   On September 10, 1867, Clarion University was founded as the Carrier  Seminary of western Pennsylvania. With no facilities to call home,  Carrier Seminary operated as a co-educational program in the old  academy building, with Reverend James G. Townsend as principal.   Carrier Seminary then became Clarion State Normal School in 1887. In  1915, the Commonwealth purchased the school, and it became a technical  school of junior college rank in 1920.   It opened its doors as a college-level institution in 1929. Since  then, Clarion's student body has grown to more than 5,000, its programs  have received top level accreditation, and the institution has become a  part of Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Clarion University on reaching this  milestone, and I join all in celebrating its rich history and  contributions to our area.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of  the subcommittee for the opportunity to offer this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, prior to the enactment of the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act of 1977, coal mining played an important role in  the United States for nearly 2 centuries, providing critical energy and  jobs for our Nation.   However, across Pennsylvania and throughout Appalachia, we continue  to have great needs in reclaiming our abandoned mine lands and  restoring our waters that have been impacted by historical mining  activities.   Since 1977, we have made great gains in restoring our historical mine  lands, but much more work still needs to be done.   The Federal Office of Surface Mining has estimated that the unfunded  liabilities of abandoned mine lands across the Nation exceeds $10  billion, with nearly half of that obligation located in Pennsylvania.   To complement the funding from the AML trust fund, which was  established through SMCRA, this legislation contains appropriations for  the AML pilot program in order to support additional  [[Page H7143]]  funding for abandoned mine lands for areas that need assistance most.   This program provides grants to States ``to accelerate the  remediation of AML sites with the economic and community development  end uses in mind.''   Unfortunately, this legislation provides $32 million less for the  pilot program compared to last year's level.   My amendment is simple and would not increase Federal spending. The  amendment would restore funding for the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation  pilot program to its 2017 level by reallocating funds from the EPA's  Environmental Programs and Management by the same amount.   Mr. Chairman, where these funds are coming from is very consistent  with the mission of that account that it would to be taken from. But  the difference is that by putting this into the AML pilot program with  a laser focus, we are focused on environmental concerns that have been  identified, and we are funding remediation techniques that are proven.   We have an obligation to clean up our environment and restore our  abandoned mine lands and waters, and this program helps us do just  that.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman  for those comments.   My point is, though, that this actually takes $32 million and puts it  like a laser on an area where we know that environmental damage is well  documented and we have very effective public-private partnership  techniques to address.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.
