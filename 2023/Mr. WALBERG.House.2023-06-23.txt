 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a remarkable young man  from the Fifth District of Michigan, Jude Stamper.   While completing his Eagle Scout leadership project, Jude sought to  raise funds to help purchase a new van for a local shelter. He  organized, emceed, and played in a fundraiser with the Monroe High jazz  band that far surpassed his initial goal.   Jude has a rare condition called AMC which makes movement difficult,  but Jude doesn't slow down. In 2018, then-Michigan basketball coach  John Beilein recognized Jude's infectious attitude, valuable  perspective, and unparalleled energy. Beilein had him join the team,  and stars like Moe Wagner and Duncan Robinson credited Jude's spirit  for helping propel the team to the national championship game.   Mr. Speaker, we are grateful for Jude's contributions, and we look  forward to what he takes on next.                            ____________________
