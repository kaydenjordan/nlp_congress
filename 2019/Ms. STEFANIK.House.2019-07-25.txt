 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Marylou Whitney, the  ``Queen of Saratoga,'' who, sadly, passed away on July 19 at the age of  93.   Marylou embodied the spirit of a revitalized Saratoga. She was  graceful, classic, sparkling, full of joy, and truly one of a kind.  Most of all, she loved her community and gave so much of herself to it.   She had a passion for horse racing and was a fixture of the Saratoga  Race Course. She hosted a yearly racing season ball for many decades,  where proceeds benefited track workers and local organizations like  Saratoga Hospital. She was active and involved in philanthropy until  her last months.   Her generosity, energy, and compassion were unmatched. She was the  founder of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and the National Museum  of Dance.   Marylou often called Saratoga one of her favorite homes, and those of  us in the community are unsurprised by this. It is a community like no  other, and Marylou made it better for all of us. Her deep commitment  will leave a mark on Saratoga for generations to come.   I want to express my sincere condolences to Marylou's husband, John  Hendrickson, and her entire family.   I consider it an honor to have known Marylou Whitney and an honor to  speak her memory into the Congressional Record. She will be missed.                     Honoring Adirondack's Randy Preston     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life of Randy Preston, Wilmington Town supervisor, former chairman of  the Essex County Board of Supervisors, former volunteer firefighter,  former fire chief, and fierce advocate for Essex County and the  Adirondack region.   After a long, courageous fight with an aggressive brain tumor, Randy,  sadly, passed away on July 18. He was 60 years old.   He was a bipartisan leader on behalf of Essex County. He voted for  the interests of the people, was beholden to no one, and let no one  deter him. He was, undoubtedly, a champion for those he represented.   Randy's missions and advocacies for the Adirondack region were  innumerable. He was passionate about lowering our tax burden and  ensuring we had ample funding for lifesaving emergency medical  services.   He was known not only for his staunch advocacy but for his sense of  humor, his unapologetic convictions, and his willingness to shoot  straight and be honest with people, whether a Governor or a  Congresswoman.   He was quick to tell me when he thought a policy was right for his  community and just as quick to tell me when he thought a policy was  wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I express my deepest sympathies to Randy's wife,  Michelle, and his entire family. It is a sincere honor to enter Randy  Preston's memory and achievements into the Congressional Record.   Honoring Mariano Rivera, First Unanimous Inductee into Baseball Hall of                                    Fame     Mr. Speaker, the hallowed halls of the National  Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, welcomed six inductees  last weekend.   In 80 years, baseball has honored 232 players as the best of the  best. Only about 1 percent of the 19,500 who played the game are  enshrined here.   As a proud New Yorker, I can say the hall includes 60 Yankees, and  the bronze busts of Bronx Bomber behemoths include Ruth, Berra, Gehrig,  Mantle, DiMaggio, Jackson, and more.   I rise today to honor Mariano Rivera, the first unanimous inductee  into the Hall of Fame.   Mo, the Sandman, wore the Yankee pinstripes with honor, pride,  humility, and dignity for 19 seasons. On the field, number 42 was a 13- time All-Star and won five World Series championships with the Yankees,  including being named MVP in 1999.   Mo racked up a record 672 saves. His cutter is legendary. He amassed  1,173 strikeouts and had a postseason ERA of 0.7, allowing only 11 runs  in 96 appearances, fewer postseason runs than the number of people who  have walked the Moon.   Mo was the very definition of ``automatic,'' as he was so often  described.   Mariano is a man of faith and recognized the importance of family  support through good times and struggles. He is a mentor, a teacher,  and demonstrates quiet leadership that is far too scarce today.   Mr. Speaker, as a young boy in Panama, Mariano used a homemade glove  of cardboard, tape, and netting. He had holes in his cleats when he  tried out for the Yankees.   Through grit, hard work, and dogged determination, Mo achieved the  very pinnacle of greatness in America's greatest game. He is the  embodiment of the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Sandman: Here's to you. I tip my cap.                            ____________________
