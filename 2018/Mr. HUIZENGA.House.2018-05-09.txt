 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Muskegon  Community College, a national leader in 2-year higher education  institutions.   MCC, located in Muskegon, Michigan, offers classes at state-of-the- art facilities throughout the west Michigan region.   Under the leadership of my friend President Dale Nesbary, the  students, faculty, and staff have all collaborated to reach great  heights. As a result of these efforts, MCC was recently ranked the top  2-year college in the State of Michigan.   MCC has excelled, in part, by emphasizing academic achievement,  investing in high-quality facilities, and developing apprenticeship  training programs. Last year, graduates of the nursing program ranked  first in the country on the registered nursing licensing exam,  achieving a 100 percent first-time pass rate.   Currently, MCC is seeking to build on its success by investing in the  most significant facilities upgrades in its history.   Through its unique apprentice training program, students work to earn  a skills trade certificate, with the option to complete further classes  to achieve an associate's degree.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in honoring  Muskegon Community College as they continue to raise the bar and  provide high-quality educational opportunities for students in Muskegon  County and all across west Michigan.                            ____________________
