 Mr. Speaker, as we all know, there is a baseball game  that is played between the Republicans and Democrats. It goes back many  decades and raises a lot of money for local charities.   In this game, they do keep score, and there are winners and there are  losers, and there is a trophy, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) the  manager of the Republican team, who happens to be the coach of the  winning team.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Sanchez), the manager of the Democratic team.    Mr. Speaker, with that, let's resume voting.
