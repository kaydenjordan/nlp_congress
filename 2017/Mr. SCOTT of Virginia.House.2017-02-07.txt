 I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 58, the joint  resolution of disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of  Education relating to teacher preparation programs.   This resolution would not only block the rule in question, but  according to the rules of the CRA, it would tie the hands of this and  of any future administration from re-regulating the provisions until a  successful reauthorization of the Higher Education Act might take  place.   Mr. Speaker, this rule in question provides clarity to States on how  to increase teacher preparation program quality, transparency, and the  equitable distribution of well-prepared teachers. It was promulgated to  enable compliance with the statutory provision included in the 2008  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.   According to a study by the Education Schools Project, more than 60  percent of new teachers feel unprepared to enter the classroom. We also  know that disadvantaged students are taught disproportionately by new,  inexperienced, and underprepared teachers. Congress sought to address  this in the HEA reauthorization through the inclusion of requirements  that are clarified by this regulation. Congress clearly intended for  these equity-focused provisions to be meaningfully implemented;  however, absent Federal regulation, the bipartisan intent of Congress  has gone unfulfilled.   Despite statements made by many on the other side of the aisle, the  Department of Education did engage in extensive consultation with  stakeholders and the public in drafting and then in finalizing this  rule. The draft rule put forward in 2014 lacked the appropriate  flexibility and was met with overwhelming resistance. Through an  extended comment period, the Department worked for more than 2 years to  revise the rule and produce a final rule with considerably more  flexibility for States and institutions.    Regardless of how flexible the rule is or not, I believe that, upon  careful review of the regulation and the statutory provisions, the  final rule is clearly within the scope of the agency's regulatory  authority. Whether one thinks  [[Page H1046]]  the rule is perfect or flawed, the substance of the final rule is  reasonable and is clarifying an interpretation of how to comply with  statutory requirements.   It is now 2017. Federal requirements to improve teacher preparation  program quality and transparency have gone largely unfulfilled since  the 2008 reauthorization. In such an instance, it is well within the  purview of the implementing agency to regulate and more clearly  interpret statutory requirements to prompt meaningful compliance and  inform Congress and the agency in subsequent reauthorizations.   The executive overreach or illegality of a rule and the disagreement  with the substance of the rule are not two sides of the same coin.  Republicans now control the executive branch. President Trump has  administrative tools at his disposal to revise or to completely rewrite  this regulation. It is clear, based on the history of the  implementation of these provisions, that regulatory clarity is  necessary. The responsible approach would be to utilize those tools to  improve the regulation.   In the history of the Congressional Review Act, Congress has only  used it once to disapprove a regulation. Instead of engaging in the  hard work of governing by revising the teacher preparation rule, my  colleagues have resorted to this act of repealing yet another rule that  is meant to support our Nation's families and children. It is  unnecessary, and we must recommit to doing the right thing for those  whom we serve.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I  [[Page H1049]]  rise in strong opposition of H.J. Res. 57. This resolution takes aim at  the heart of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA. That bill passed  with overwhelming bipartisan support. This resolution would strike down  regulations that provide necessary clarity to States about what it  means to ensure that all students are taught to high standards, and  what it means to provide accurate data on student academic performance  and resource equity.   States now lack direction needed to proceed with implementation of  the bill. Just last week, the Department removed all ESSA technical  assistance to the States from the public domain, despite numerous and  repeated requests for technical assistance from State and local  leaders.   Mr. Speaker, when Congress came together to pass ESSA, we made a  promise, the promise of stability and consistency and a full  replacement of No Child Left Behind. And while we promised new  flexibilities, those flexibilities came with guardrails to guide the  decisionmaking, to ensure protections for vulnerable students, and to  support educators and school leaders. This resolution breaks that  bipartisan promise.   Contrary to the wishes of some, ESSA was not a blank check to States  from the Federal Government. ESSA is a fundamental approach with much  power restored to the State and local level, but it comes with Federal  protections for vulnerable students. So we must not waver in our  commitment to give States the support and guidance they need to move  forward.   Mr. Speaker, some claim the regulations are unnecessary because  States can just read the law and implement it. But we all know, based  on precedence and common sense, that the new landscape of ESSA would  necessitate regulatory clarity from the executive branch, just as all  Federal agencies routinely update existing regulations as new  legislation is passed.   Providing stakeholders with direction and clarity about how to carry  out the Federal laws as big as the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act is not new. No Child Left Behind led the Bush administration to  undergo similar rulemaking, and it was more than 2 years before the  regulations were fully realized. It also enabled States, in their  efforts, to move forward with timely submission of their ESSA plans.   If this resolution of disapproval is enacted, States will have no  ability to prepare State plans that require Federal approval until  after the Department reestablishes requirements and criteria, causing  an unwelcome and unnecessary delay for States eager to move forward,  leaving ESSA unregulated before States to just wait until the new  regulations are passed, and also undo months of work that is currently  underway.   In effect, the lack of clarity on how to effectively utilize the new  flexibilities, while meeting statutory requirements, may lead many  States to revert to--they have to revert to something--maybe the No  Child Left Behind narrow policies and systems, the very policies that  the ESSA eliminated.   Mr. Speaker, where the law's requirements are ambiguous, agency  interpretation is necessary to set a Federal floor. Without that floor,  compliance with the Federal law becomes subjective, with different  standards being applied from State to State. This kind of subjectivity  was the same problem we had with No Child Left Behind when States  relied on guidance without regulation.   Under that scheme, the Department could not be held accountable for  treating one State different from another, and that is what we are  correcting through the enactment and regulation of ESSA's core  requirements. Those requirements must be applied fairly across all  States. That is the whole point of a Federal law.   The Department conducted hundreds of meetings, held public forums and  listening sessions, and read and responded to thousands of comments to  produce a consensus-driven rule. The Department made significant  revisions before finalization, and they were met with praise from  teachers, State education chiefs, local administrators, parents, and  civil rights communities.    Regardless of whether you think the rule is perfect or flawed, the  substance of the rule is a reasonable interpretation that provides  clarity for States to enable their compliance with statutory  requirements. Now, President Trump has administrative tools at his  disposal to revise or completely rewrite this regulation. However, it  is clear, based on history of implementation of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act that regulatory clarity is necessary.   Using the CRA to block the rule is unnecessary and shortsighted. It  hurts students and schools. It undermines a bipartisan intent of  Congress and leaves States in a lurch by causing confusion and delays  for the submission of their State plans. It also undermines equity  protections for vulnerable students that the law was intended to serve.    This resolution threatens the success of the  law we fought so hard to pass, so I urge a ``no'' vote.
