 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Rabbi Bruce Lustig, who just  led us in this wonderful opening prayer.   Rabbi Lustig is senior rabbi of the Washington Hebrew Congregation,  which is Washington, D.C.'s largest and oldest synagogue and where many  of my constituents worship.   The son of a refugee from Nazi Germany, his mother, Hedy Lustig,  Rabbi Lustig grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was often the  only Jewish child at school. The strong cultural identity instilled by  his mother, and the emphasis his family placed on engaging with his  Christian friends and classmates, laid the foundation for his lifelong  commitment to interfaith work, including his efforts to open dialogue  and strengthen relationships among Jews, Christians, Muslims, and  people of all faiths.   Ordained at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion,  Rabbi Lustig holds a doctorate of divinity and a master's degree in  Hebrew letters. He earned his bachelor's with honors from the  University of Tennessee.    In delivering today's opening prayer in the House, Rabbi Lustig  continues a venerable and important tradition. Since the Washington  Hebrew Congregation was created in 1862, every single one of its senior  rabbis has delivered an opening prayer before the U.S. Congress. Rabbi  Lustig now joins that esteemed group.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Lustig to the House today,  and I would like to extend my thanks for his excellent leadership in  our community and for offering today's prayer.                            ____________________
