 Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting issue with the  canvas in the back of the entire immigration laws that need to be  addressed.   This body--not the body at the other end of the building, this body-- didn't have the guts to address it 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years  ago, nor this year. This is something that we need to address, even  though it is not the bill itself.   I am a strong supporter of law enforcement. As co-chair of the Law  Enforcement Caucus, I rise in total opposition to this bill and the  rule. Here is what the misguided goal of this bill would do:   You are going to prove a point by penalizing law enforcement for  immigration policies politicians in their city have to implement. That  is what you want to do. So it absolves us down here in Washington.   This bill threatens the central Federal funding streams for law  enforcement. You have heard all of those programs that are being  endangered. Any grant administered by the Department of Justice or the  Department of Homeland Security that is substantially related to law  enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or  naturalization you are putting on the chopping block if this bill  becomes law.   This bill would not make our communities safer. In fact, it  undermines public safety.   The funding this bill puts at risk allows local police departments to  purchase equipment and hire and provide training for officers. This  actually jeopardizes the security--read my lips--of communities in  order to perpetuate a false narrative about immigrants.                                time  1300    I just received a letter from the New Jersey State Policemen's  Benevolent Association. I think it says it better than anything I could  say. It says: ``Politics should not interfere with the safety of our  members or our ability to do our job.''   The police are telling us that, and you are asking them to go out and  do the job of protecting our citizens day in and day out--which we all  are, I hope--and then you are telling them: But I am sorry, because we  have a disagreement on this issue, you are going to suffer the  consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the New Jersey  State Policemen's Benevolent Association.                                        New Jersey State Policemen's                                    Benevolent Association, Inc.,                                      Woodbridge, NJ, June 28, 2017.      Re H.R. 3003.       Hon. William Pascrell, Jr.,      Paterson, NJ.        Dear Congressman Pascrell: The New Jersey State Policemen's       Benevolent Association (NJSPBA) represents over 33,000 law       enforcement officers throughout our state. It is no secret       that law enforcement officers risk their own safety every day       to keep our  [[Page H5252]]       communities safe. And as a strong supporter of law       enforcement on the floor of the U.S. House of       Representatives, we would like to thank you for all your       efforts on behalf of the men and women that serve within the       law enforcement community.        It is our understanding that this week the House is voting       on H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' which       adds additional obstacles to funding for the hiring of       additional police officers in certain communities throughout       our state. Specifically, the bill restricts municipalities       from receiving grants administered by the Department of       Justice or the Department of Homeland Security if municipal       officials fail to notify the federal government with regard       to the presence of individuals as it relates to information       regarding citizenship or immigration status.        While we strongly agree that state and local law       enforcement should work closely with federal law enforcement,       cutting off funding for law enforcement to already       underfunded and understaffed police departments and law       enforcement entities undermines our collective efforts to       keep our members and the communities they serve safe.       Politics should not interfere with the safety of our members       or our ability to do our job.        On behalf of our membership, we appreciate your ongoing       efforts and hope you will continue to work with your       colleagues in Congress to assure funding for law enforcement       and prevent our government from punishing our membership for       something that is completely out of our control.        I am available to discuss our opposition to H.R. 3003       further, at your convenience. You can reach me at our NJSPBA       offices, if you have any questions.        Thank you for all your efforts on behalf of the men and       women of law enforcement.            Sincerely,                                                  Patrick Colligan,                                                   State President.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, congressional Republicans are doing that  right here. They are playing politics with our Nation's security.   To quote the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association  again--these words are from the police, not me--`` . . . punishing our  membership for something that is completely out of our control.''   Why are the police opposed to this legislation?   The Fraternal Order of Police you have heard about. Some of my  friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk the talk when it  comes to supporting law enforcement until it either costs money or we  are going to have to deal with the bigger factors. That is a fact.   You may laugh all you want, but that is a fact. I can cite you  chapter and verse if you want. This is no laughing matter. This is  business. This is the lives of the police.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to address remarks to  the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very pathetic way to  look at our police officers in this country. ``If you don't like it,  don't take the money.''   You must be kidding me. I urge my colleagues to find a different  tactic to penalize political decisions that you don't like.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are, again, reminded to address  their remarks to the Chair, not to individuals on the floor.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question. And if we do defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to this rule to bring up Representative Bobby Scott's Raise  the Wage Act, H.R. 15, which would finally give workers the raise they  deserve, and increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour within 7  years.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) to discuss our proposal.
