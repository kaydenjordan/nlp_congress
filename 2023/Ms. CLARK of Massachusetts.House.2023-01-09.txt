 Mr. Speaker, when Roe v. Wade was  overturned, the impact on Americans was swift and devastating. Women  were denied healthcare. Doctors were threatened with criminal charges.  Hospitals were forced to put their own liability over patients' lives.    As the GOP doubled down on its plan for a national abortion ban, the  American people saw it for what it was: anti-women, anti-choice, anti- family, and anti-freedom.   Kansas, California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont--voters  across the country rejected this extremism.   With this anti-freedom agenda exposed, some of my Republican  colleagues started to scrub their websites, rolled back their rhetoric,  and dodged questions on abortion. But here we are again in this rules  package, within days of taking over the House majority, Republicans are  pushing legislation to limit women's rights.   Let's see where you truly stand. Today, House Democrats offer the  Women's Health Protection Act to make abortion access a Federal right,  no matter your ZIP Code or your income.   Do my colleagues across the aisle believe that families, in  consultation with their doctors, with their faith, with their life  circumstances, should decide when to have children, or do my colleagues  think that is a decision for Republican politicians?   Vote to make Roe v. Wade the law of the land. Vote for freedom.
