 Mr. President, on behalf of my constituent, Christy  Teslow, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  information about a program she founded to help educate children of all  ages about the importance of being a good digital citizen.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Mobile Mamma is a non-profit organization which was founded       in 2017 in Cresco, Iowa. We are 6 moms who are working       professionals that use a common-sense approach to educate       about the impact of technology. We personally have children       ranging in age from kindergarten to college and wanted to be       better educated about using devices of daily use, with the       common goal to keep our children safe and secure while being       online. From our own research, we felt compelled to design a       curriculum to share with students and adults of all ages.        Statement of the Problem. Children today are so self-      reliant on their mobile devices which in turn has caused a       social disconnect with society. Children are more concerned       with their ``e-reputation'' and not as much of what their       real-life reputation is. Parents have an ethical and moral       role to provide children with online safety. The problem is,       children are not safe online and parents are unaware of the       detrimental dangers, harms, and effects of social media.        Conceptual Framework. Clear and concise communication about       parents' expectations are especially important. Research has       demonstrated that teens, whose parents use effective       monitoring practices, are less likely to make poor decisions       such as having sex at a young age, smoking, using illegal       drugs, drinking alcohol, being physically aggressive, or       skipping school (Center for Disease Control and Prevention,       2012). Teens who believe their parents disapprove of risky       behaviors are less likely to participate in these behaviors.       Teens rely on their parents and other adults in their daily       lives for information about online safety. In 2013, a study       by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention titled       ``Adolescents, Technology, and Reducing Risk for HIV, STDs,       and Pregnancy'', a participant stated ``I multitask every       second I am online. At this very moment, I am watching TV,       checking my email every two minutes, reading a newsgroup       about who shot JFK, burning some music to a CD, and writing       this message'' (a 17-year-old male). According to Farrukh,       Sadwick, and Villasenor (2014), parents seek information on       how to best protect children online through various channels.       Parents utilize general news media 38% of the time, other       parents 37%, and school teachers 29%.        Statement of the Purpose. The purpose of the Be a B.E.A.R.       program is to educate children of all ages about the       importance of being a good digital citizen. The Be a B.E.A.R.       curriculum is designed to teach children from kindergarten       through high school about what is acceptable to portray on       social media and what is not acceptable. The intention of the       Be a B.E.A.R. program is not only designed for children but       can be applied to adults as well. The purpose of the program       is to gain a positive structured approach to handling online       situations.        Significance of the Program. There is an ethical and moral       responsibility of schools and adults that give these devices       to children, to properly educate themselves and their       children. With the rising mental health crisis, not only in       Iowa but across the Nation, the devices of daily living (also       known as Smartphones, tablets, etc) are causing these issues.       Some of these issues include: low self-esteem, anxiety,       depression, sadness, sleeplessness, and paranoia. Due to the       mental health concerns, if we can get this program in schools       it will help give a positive  [[Page S1837]]       use to technology by determining what a good digital       footprint and digital citizen are. This program continues to       educate both parents and children about cybersecurity/safety,       the potential harms and dangers associated with the evolving       virtual environment, and discusses in detail about the       responsibility needed by all ages when it comes to the       constant influx of technology in our children's lives. With       the increasing suicide rates, there is a direct correlation       between human trafficking, cyberbullying, and sexting that       are negatively impacting society.                             Definition of Terms         Good digital citizen: While online portraying yourself as a       positive person and using appropriate etiquette        Good digital footprint: Leaving positive markers when using       the internet and social media sites        B.E.A.R.:        B = breathe, stop and take a breath before reacting to a       situation that may cause you negative feelings        E = explain to the other person or parties how the negative       behaviors that are being portrayed are impacting you       personally        A = affirm actions, your choice is to walk away, block the       other party on social media, and ignore        R = report the unwanted behavior to a trusted adult such as       parents, teachers, or counselors.        Timeline. Currently, we are involved with two Northeast       Iowa School Districts. We are using a 7-week program to       educate the students in the following grades kindergarten,       third, sixth, eighth, and eleventh about the Be a B.E.A.R.       program. Each student has completed a pre-test about the       different objectives that are covered in the core curriculum.       After completion of the program there will be a post-test       administered to determine the learning curve of the students.        Currently, we do not have substantial results because of       the initiation phase we are in. After the completion of our       7-week program we will have results to support our statement       of intent.        Conclusion. By implementing these steps of the Be a       B.E.A.R. program with children and adults, we can bring       positivity and education while being safe online.                            ____________________
