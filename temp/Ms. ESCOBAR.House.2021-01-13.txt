 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On January 6, terrorists attacked the United States of America. It  was an attempted coup and an insurrection. But what I hope Americans  understand is that it was a terrorist attack against our country.   Those who came and participated must be found and prosecuted. Those  who aided and abetted must be found and prosecuted. And the man who  incited it, President Donald J. Trump, our greatest national security  threat, must be impeached, held accountable, and never be allowed to  hold office again.
