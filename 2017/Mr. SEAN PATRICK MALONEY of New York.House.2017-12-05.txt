 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to  suggest a new rule.   All my life, I have heard the Republican Party preach family values  and fiscal discipline, but in the course of a single week, Mr. Speaker,  we have seen the Republican Party in this House vote to add more than  $1 trillion of new debt because tax cuts for rich people matter more.  We have seen the Republican President and the Republican Party in the  Senate choose to support a credibly accused pedophile because power  matters more.   So, I will tell you what, Mr. Speaker, new rule: After today, the  Republican Party can choose to support massive new debts and  politicians who abuse kids, but it cannot lecture the rest of us about  it. The rest of us have listened to our last lecture from Republicans  about family values or fiscal discipline. From now on, that party has  no credibility on either issue.   So I will tell you what. When it comes to family values or fiscal  responsibility, please keep it to yourselves. We have heard enough of  it.                            ____________________
