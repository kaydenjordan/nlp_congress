 Mr. Speaker, I am excited tonight to talk to this audience  here and at home about a serious situation that has plagued America and  American politics since the mid-1980s.   But that is not what I am excited about. I am excited to offer a  bipartisan legislation solution to fix our broken immigration system.   Before I get into the nuts and bolts of what we are going to talk  about, we need to look back on past efforts of what worked and efforts  that did not work.   This body, along with President Reagan, did immigration reform that  gave approximately 3.5 million individuals amnesty. Reforms were put in  place to prevent a repeat of the illegal immigration challenge this  Nation has had.   America, time and time again, has been said to be the most generous  country when it comes to immigration policies, and I think we can all  agree with that. Over 1 million people migrate to America, legally, per  year.   Unfortunately, this body became divided and has continued to be  divided over the enforcement of current laws and border security and  making the needed reforms and revisions and adaptation to the times and  needs of today to ensure our Nation's borders are secure.   There are many programs where individuals can migrate to America  legally, whether it is for work, to get an education, to become a  citizen, to seek refuge from a national disasters, fear for one's  safety because of bad government, corrupt government, or fear of life.   However, this body has become so divided and the situation since 1986  has grown to the point that we now have a conservative estimate of over  12 million individuals in America illegally, and the number continues  to grow.   The number will continue to grow until this body stops playing  politics with policies and people's lives and puts forth a policy that  is best for America--not best for a political party, not best for the  next election.   If a policy is best for America, the question is asked: Is it not  best for all--our citizens, the immigrant, and national security?   What must happen is for this body to stop playing the political  divisive game that has divided this Nation over the immigration  policies.   The Democratic side, Mr. Speaker, claims the Republicans are running  concentration camps, tearing children away from their parents, and  throwing children in cages with no food, no water, no toothbrushes, et  cetera.   The Republicans claim, Mr. Speaker, the other side wants to have open  borders, and I have to admit, the Democratic Presidential candidates  have talked about that. The Democrats, Mr. Speaker, want to give  everyone amnesty.   Therefore, nothing gets resolved because the narrative becomes  political, the canyon that has grown between us grows larger, and  nothing gets done.   I am a veterinarian by trade, and what I have learned is you have got  to look at the facts in front of you; you have got to diagnose the  condition; you have got to look at the underlying cause; and then you  have to treat accordingly.   In order for a problem to be solved, there must be the recognition  that there is a problem.   Let me reference some of the rhetoric spoken by the very people  tasked with solving this challenge to our great Nation, and this was at  the beginning of the year.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the situation: ``A fake crisis at  the border.''   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it: ``A crisis that does  not exist.''   House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said: ``There is no crisis at the  border.''   And I can read on and on with the individuals' names, but there is no  need to because they are talking points that don't change.   Another Member: ``There is no crisis at the border.''   Another Member: ``A fake crisis at the border.''   ``There is no crisis at the border.''   ``We don't have a border crisis.''   ``A phony border crisis.''   ``A fake crisis at the border.''   ``A crisis that does not exist.''   ``Nonexistent border crisis.''   ``There is no border crisis.''   This comes from a piece in the Washington Examiner that Byron York  wrote: ``This moment might be a time for introspection for those who  have consistently downplayed the urgency of the situation on the  border. Earlier this year, with the number of illegal crossings rising;  with the nature of the crossers changing, more families and more  children than in earlier years; with the testimony of border officials  that they were unable to handle the situation; with all that happening,  many Democrats and their supporters in the media forcefully denied that  there was a crisis on the southern border.''  [[Page H5986]]    Here are a few more examples, Mr. Speaker.   ``In the media, `Never Trump' Republicans, former Republicans, and  other commentators have joined in.''   ``Former Rep. Joe Scarborough, now with MSNBC, called the situation  `an imaginary border crisis.'   ``Former Bush White House official Nicolle Wallace, also with MSNBC,  said, `There's not a crisis.'''   ``Former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol called the situation `a  fake crisis.'''   Another one says: ``A fake crisis.''   Another one: ``There is no crisis on the border.''   Another one: ``There is no crisis at the border.''   They are the same talking points that get passed from one person to  another.   Another one: ``A faux crisis.''   ``A make-believe crisis.''   Even the comedians on late-night television weighed in and said: ``A  fake border crisis.''   In this one article, there are over 26 examples, and there are plenty  more where this came from.                                time  1945    ``The situation at the border is so terrible in part because those in  power, and those cheering them on in the media, have steadfastly  resisted commonsense measures to reduce the flow of illegal migrants,  the large majority of whom do not have a valid claim of asylum, across  the border. The resulting paralysis in border policy encourages more  migrants to come, making the situation worse by the day.   ``Perhaps some of those quoted above only want to deny the President  a victory,'' which is shameful. No matter how sensible the results are,  they can't give in so that the situation is resolved.   The bottom line is, the American people are less safe; the immigrants  are less safe; and America's national security is threatened.   ``Perhaps others are simply looking for a partisan advantage'' for  the next election. ``Perhaps some sincerely believe in open or  virtually open borders.''   As I said, the Democratic Presidential candidates have all expressed  their views on that.   ``It does not matter what their motives are. The crisis--yes,  crisis--at the border worsens every day that we do not act.''   I am happy to say that I think people have come to their senses, that  there is recognition today that there is a crisis at our border. The  important thing to note is that if we recognize there is a crisis at  the border, then you can start to heal the problem, and then you can  start fixing that problem. It starts with border security and the  enforcement of the laws already on the books.   People want to put in new laws and do all these things. The laws are  already on the books. There are some flawed laws, like the Flores  agreement, that need to be changed.   I just spoke to a Member of Congress who returned from the border,  and he has spoken to the border security people. He was down there, and  he saw firsthand. He had a shocking report. The coyotes bringing people  in have control of what we call parishes or little neighborhoods. They  have control of an area, and they bring people in. They are working  with the narcotraffickers. They are bringing individuals into this  country.   Understand what is happening here. An individual who comes in will  pay a coyote up to $8,000 for entry to come into America. It is more  difficult to bring one individual in than it is with a child. A person  who comes in with a child only has to pay $5,000 to a coyote. The  reason is that they have to smuggle an individual in, get them on a  bus, and they give them a boxed lunch.   This was just reported to us, and that was from last week.   The person with a child who comes in only has to pay $5,000 because  we have to process that, so it is easier to get them in. They can just  come across the border, and our system rolls them in, so it is only  $5,000 to come in.   The coyotes--understand this--and human traffickers, which are the  same, are advertising in other countries, Africa, the Middle East, the  Asia-Pacific region, and South and Central America on TV ads. Ads in  print say: Come to America. We can get you in.   They have the prices printed. The coyotes, the human traffickers, and  the narcos are getting rich at the expense of the immigrant and the  refugee who truly need to come into America, and the children.   We always hear on the other side that it is for the children. Well,  by God, if you believe that, then fix the dang problem.   It is also at the expense of our American citizens and our children.  I was elected by American citizens, and my first job is to uphold the  Constitution. My first job is to the people of my district who sent me  here. My first job is to protect our constitutional principles for the  people of this Nation.   The other thing that gets threatened is our national security. The  reports we have right now indicate there are over 60 countries  represented from around the world, from China and Africa, that are  coming into this country at the hands of the coyotes.   I want to drop back to 2014. I think it is interesting that Members  on the other side of this very body who were saying there is no crisis  at the border, if you look at my first poster here, it is from June  2014. Let me read you the headline here, ``Sickening Photos of the  Humanitarian Crisis at U.S. Border Detention Centers.'' This was June  16, 2014, and it was written by Brett Logiurato.   There were Members who are serving in this Congress today who took  these photos, and they said what a shame it is that we have these  situations at the border.   You can see this picture. People are laying on concrete floors.   But then they turn around and accuse President Trump of laying these  people on concrete floors with no pillows and no blankets. That is  2014, when President Obama was in charge.   Here is another picture. ``A staggering humanitarian crisis on the  U.S.-Mexico border has left Federal officials scrambling to provide the  basic human necessities to thousands of undocumented immigrants, most  of them unaccompanied children.''   The other side will say, well, it is for the children. I agree. No  child should have to go through that. No parent should have to go  through that in 2014. Yet, this is 2019. Not a dang thing has been done  in this body to fix this problem because politicians--and I am almost  embarrassed to say that I am a politician--are afraid to fix this  problem.   Do you know why? They will get political arrows thrown at them.  Somebody will say: Oh, you want amnesty. You want to deport everybody.   They stay away from this, another election comes, and nothing happens  other than the situation gets worse.   Let me go to another picture of sickening photos of the humanitarian  crisis at the border detention center. Business Insider all the way in  Australia is highlighting how dysfunctional the American immigration  system is. You see kids running around. They are barefoot. People are  laying on aluminum blankets, heat shields.    People are in this situation. This is not a new crisis. This is  something that has been going on since 1986. It is coming to a head,  and it is going to get worse if this body does not get the backbone to  do what is right and do what is right for America. As I said, if it is  right for America, then it is going to be right for the immigrant,  right for the American citizen, and right for this country. If we don't  do those things, then it is going to get worse.   Let's go to that other picture. There is a graph here that I want to  highlight before I turn it over to my good friend. On this graph, I  think it is interesting because numbers and pictures speak lots of  words. This is the southwest border apprehension for fiscal year 2019.   Before I get into this, President Trump has taken a lot of heat for  trying to resolve a situation that gets worse every day. He has to do  that only because this body is inept at what it is tasked to do. This  body is the one that is supposed to write immigration laws. This body  is the one that is supposed to do the enforcement laws. The President  is tasked with executing the laws. According to Article II, Section 3,  he shall faithfully execute the laws of the land. But if Congress does  not solve the problem, then he has no other choice.   He has called this an emergency. He has taken flack for that. He has  taken  [[Page H5987]]  all kinds of criticism for trying to do what is right for this country,  trying to protect our national security, and trying to have some kind  of commonsense way to slow this down.   Yet my colleagues on the other side who acknowledged in 2014 that  this was a crisis, at the beginning of this year, they said there was  no crisis. They criticized him for trying to act.   I want to show this graph. I know it is probably hard to see from TV,  but look at this graph. We have different years represented here. We go  from 2014 all the way up to 2019. The bottom line is, 2016, we were  actively deporting people. There was a bad economy. We weren't getting  as many people into this country.   What I want to show is in October 2018. Look at 2019. If we start at  January, we are at 54,000 people apprehended at the border. This was  when there was no crisis at the border, 58,000 while there was no  crisis at the border. By the time June came around, that number had  grown to 104,000 apprehensions at the border.   There was no crisis, according to my colleagues on the other side who  won't come together to solve this problem.   President Trump acted, and he acted strongly. He appealed to Mexico  to help us with this situation. I commend the President of Mexico for  coming to terms with President Trump. They put in enforcement at their  southern border.   You can see exactly the effect of that when it happened. It happened  right here in the end of June. Since then, the illegal apprehensions  have dropped precipitously down to under 110,000 in just a month and a  half.   We haven't changed the laws in this country. We haven't increased  border security in this country. But the Mexicans came to rescue and  help us. In fact, the Mexican Government is doing more to solve this  problem for America, American citizens, and immigrants than my  colleagues on the left side.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), who is a  great friend of mine and a great proponent of legal immigration.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. King, his passion for this. And I  want to run through a few numbers before I go to Mr. Chip Roy from  Texas.   Southwest border apprehensions by U.S. Customs, total apprehensions  from October 2018 to May of 2019, 593,507.   May of 2019, apprehensions alone, 138,887--highest month in over a  decade.   Total inadmissibles in October of 2018 to 2019, 82,808.   Inadmissibles, these are people who can't come into the country  because of their record.   Mr. Speaker, 2019, 6 months total already has exceeded the total for  the year of 2015.   At this time, I yield to Mr. Chip Roy from Texas, a passionate  individual about this. And I, again, thank Mr. King.    Mr. Speaker, I was going to bring this up, and I am glad  the gentleman from Texas did.   What happened to the day when migrants came to this country to  cherish liberty and freedom and become enrolled in the beliefs that we  have to assimilate?   I appreciate the gentleman bringing that up because those aren't  friendly signs, to take down the American flag and put up the Mexican  flag in our country.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's passion, and  appreciate him bringing these things out.   And this is something we have sent President Trump, and I am going to  say tonight, I implore President Trump--in fact, I am going to  challenge President Trump to reconvene this Congress at the beginning  of the August recess. And I would do it every recess from here on out  until this body comes to grips and solves this problem in a bipartisan,  bicameral way; because, if you don't do that, Congress will run out.   Like the gentleman said, they are going to go fundraise. They are  going to get ready for the next election and tell everybody how great  they did, yet this problem is getting worse.   President Trump, you can do this. It hasn't been done since 1948.  That was President Truman, and he did what was best for this body.   I can tell you one thing. When you invade the personal time of  Members of Congress, you get their attention. I think it is time we do  that. I, for one, will stay here. I think this needs to be done. This  is such a critical issue.   At this time, I would like to go over a couple more facts, these  numbers, the  [[Page H5989]]  sources, total CBP enforcement, Custom Border Patrol.   Apprehensions in 2017, total for the year was 526,901. 2018, that  number--because the word had gotten out. The drug cartels are very good  business people, unfortunately. They are not ethical people. They are  not people I would want to have next to us. I don't want them in my  country. But they are very good at what they do. The apprehensions in  2018 was 683,178.    Now, get this. If people will not come together in a bipartisan way,  they don't need to be in Congress.   When you hear these numbers, apprehensions year-to-date 2019--keep in  mind, 2017 is 527,000; 2018, 683,000 for the years. 2019, to date, the  end of June, 787,161.   Folks, when are we going to do this? If not now, when? Are we going  to wait until there are 20 million people here? 40 million people? 50  million people?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), a  great friend of mine, another great Texan.    Does the gentleman feel like it is politics being played  over policy for the next election?    Absolutely. It is sickening, sickening for this body,  sickening for America.    This is a threat. This is not about being racist. It is  about doing rule of law.   Our good friend   Steve King brought up a great point. This is rule  of law. That is all we are asking: Follow the rule of law.   This body has been derelict in their duty, and that is why this  problem is growing, because they put politics above policy. They are  afraid to stand up.   It is like I said. We have asked President Trump, reconvene Congress,  bring us back in at the August recess. And I would bring us back every  time until we fix this problem, period.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    They do. I appreciate the gentleman bringing that up. I  will talk about that at the end.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry),  my good friend and colleague, the brigadier general.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania's  passion and leadership on the things he has done.   He talked about it. Mr. Roy talked about it. Mr. Gohmert talked  about. It is edifying.   The ICE agents and the Customs and Border Patrol agents are doing a  job that this body created with laws and policies, and then hired them.  We have people on the other side of the aisle who are criminalizing the  very people we hired to do this job that they have to do. And it is a  thankless job.   I know our side, the Republican Party, and, I am sure, some Democrats  are truly thankful that our ICE agents and Customs and Border Patrol  are there. They are taking time away from their families, and they are  taking the time that they could be doing other things, but they are  keeping our Nation safe.   As Members of Congress, we here are thankful for them, and I know our  Nation is thankful for them.   I implore, again, President Trump to reconvene Congress, if it leaves  without solving this problem, in the August recess and every time. He  can be the first President since President Truman in 1948 to do this.   I implore anybody who is watching to call your Members and tell them  you want this problem solved. There is no reason that this does not get  solved. This is something we can do.   Throw politics out of it. Let's get good policies. Good policies for  America are good policies for the migrant, good policy for our  citizens, and good policy for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
