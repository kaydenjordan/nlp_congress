 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3755,  the supposed Women's Health Protection Act. The underlying bill would  be more aptly titled the women and babies health endangerment act, as  it eviscerates State pro-life laws that serve to protect women and  babies from dangerous and discriminatory abortion procedures. Simply  put, this bill will allow healthcare providers to perform an abortion  on anyone, for any reason, at any time up until birth.   By erasing state parental consent protections, informed consent laws,  and dangerous take-home chemical abortion prohibitions, this bill would  allow a 16-year-old pregnant minor to show up at an abortion clinic,  and without knowing how far along she is or any of the risks associated  with an abortion procedure be sent home to perform a chemical abortion  on herself without medical supervision and without her parents'  awareness. Abortion on anyone.   This bill also invalidates State antidiscrimination laws, which would  allow babies to be aborted solely because of unwanted characteristics,  such as their race, their sex, or disability. Abortion for any reason.   By prohibiting laws that restrict late-term abortions, this bill will  allow a baby to be aborted up until birth. As gestational age is the  strongest risk factor for abortion-related mortality, this bill marks  the most egregious abortion policy ever considered in Congress. In  fact, a woman seeking an abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more likely  to die from abortion than she was in the first trimester. At 21 weeks  or more, she is 91 times more likely to die from abortion than she was  in the first trimester. Abortion at any time.   This bill is bad for women, and it is bad for babies, directly  placing both in harm's way.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this appalling measure.
