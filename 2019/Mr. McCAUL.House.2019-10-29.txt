 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4695, the Protect Against  Conflict by Turkey Act.   The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi this past weekend is a major win in  our counter-ISIS campaign, and I congratulate our brave special  operators for a job well done, the men and women of our intelligence  community, and our President for a bold decision.   The world is better off without this sick and deranged leader of the  so-called caliphate. Baghdadi still has thousands of followers  committed to terrorism. While their leader's death is a huge blow, we  must stay vigilant to keep them from reconstituting or carrying out  attacks in the West and to our homeland.   With that, we cannot allow Turkey's invasion to hinder, in any way,  our counter-ISIS campaign.   My friend, Chairman Eliot Engel, and I coauthored this legislation to  give the White House additional congressional support to sanction  Turkey for its recent actions and the leverage to ensure Turkey upholds  the vital cease-fire negotiated by Vice President Pence.   In the President's own words: ``Should Turkey fail to honor its  obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic  minorities . . . we reserve the right to reimpose crippling  sanctions.''   In addition, our bill ensures there are Presidential waivers to  provide flexibility for the administration on how almost all the  sanctions are administered.   This bill incentivizes Turkey to comply with the cease-fire. If they  do not, there will be consequences in the form of crippling sanctions.   Turkey is also a vital NATO partner, and I am hopeful they will cease  their destabilizing actions and act as a responsible partner.   With that in mind, let's recap how we got here today.   On October 9, Erdogan's forces charged across the border, unleashing  a potential humanitarian crisis for the people in northern Syria. The  assault has expanded Assad and Putin's grip on Syrian territory.   As I said 2 weeks ago, I am concerned this incursion will damage U.S.  interests in the Middle East and the Syrian people, including the  Kurds, our ally. The only beneficiaries of more violence and more chaos  in Syria are America's adversaries, and that is Vladimir Putin, Bashar  al-Assad, Iran, and terror groups like ISIS.   On October 17, the administration brokered a cease-fire with Turkey,  which has held to date. This has helped to stabilize the situation and  prevent a worst-case scenario from taking place. I applaud the Vice  President and Secretary Pompeo for that delicate negotiation with  President Erdogan, and I believe that our bipartisan resolution, which  disapproved of the Turkish incursion last week, I believe, helped in  these negotiations.   Our bill today--my bill with Mr. Engel--codifies the administration's  agreement in Ankara and will help to strengthen the President's hand in  ensuring that Turkey upholds its commitments.   Our bill imposes penalties on Turkey if it continues its offensive in  northern Syria. Specifically, it sanctions Turkish officials involved  in the military operation in Syria. It blocks U.S. weapons sales to  Turkey that could be used in Syria and sanctions foreign entities  selling such weapons to Turkey. It sanctions banks supporting Turkey's  defense sector in the Syria campaign.   Our bill also requires the administration to develop plans to adjust  our counterterrorism strategy to respond to the changing situation on  the ground.   I am pleased that the administration heard our call for a residual  force in Syria. I can think of nothing more dangerous than withdrawing  all of our troops in Syria, as we saw when we withdrew, under the  previous administration, from Iraq to 10,000 forces. That is when we  saw the rise of ISIS and the so-called caliphate.   We will have a residual force in Syria working with the SDF and the  Kurds to help defeat and make sure ISIS is never again a threat to the  homeland.   Finally, it identifies Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 system  as a transaction subject to sanctions under the Countering America's  Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. That is very important.  How can you be a NATO ally and purchase Russian military equipment?   We let Turkey into NATO to protect them from the Soviet Union, and  now our NATO ally is buying Russian military equipment and, through its  invasion into Syria, threatening our allies.   For these reasons, I urge support of this bill and thank Chairman  Engel for, once again, coming to a bipartisan resolution. When, once  again, they said it couldn't be done, we got it done, and I thank him  for that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to echo Madam Speaker's comments. When we stand united on the  floor of the Congress, as Americans, that is when we send the strongest  message overseas to adversaries.   I want to thank Mr. Engel for his strong work in working with me to  get to a positive place where we can actually get to a solution to what  has been a challenging and very fluid situation. It is always an honor  to work with the gentleman on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   In these times of crises we are, I believe, strongest on the world  stage when the executive and legislative branch speak in one voice.   In his testimony before our committee, Ambassador Jeffrey, the  Special Envoy to Syria said:         I saw firsthand the effect of congressional sanctions when       we visited with the Turkish negotiating team; that these       sanctions have been helpful in getting the Turks to agree to       the cease-fire.    And I believe the resolution that we passed helped get Turkey to the  cease-fire as well.   Finally, I want to thank our partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces  for their ongoing dedication to countering ISIS. And I want to say to  the SDF, from the Nation's Capitol, on the House floor, that the  American people are grateful for everything you have done for us, for  everything you have worked for, and everything you have sacrificed to  keep the world safer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
