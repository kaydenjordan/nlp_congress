 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6237, the Matthew Young  Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.   Passing an annual intelligence authorization bill is the most  important tool Congress has to conduct effective oversight of the  intelligence activities of the United States Government.   Today, the Intelligence Committee is bringing its annual intelligence  authorization bill to the floor. Once again, the bill is a bipartisan  product that reflects contributions from all committee members. It was  reported out of the committee by a unanimous voice vote.   The legislation provides the intelligence community the necessary  resources and authorities to protect and defend the United States. For  example, this bill authorizes a committee initiative to streamline  defense intelligence related to the Defense Intelligence Agency. It  enhances congressional oversight of intelligence activities by  mandating intelligence community reports on threats to Federal  elections, leaks of classified information, security clearance  processing, and other vital activities. Furthermore, the bill increases  pay for employees with unique cyber skills and creates a security  center at the Department of Energy to protect our energy  infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, the bill authorizes enhanced injury benefits to CIA  employees injured overseas due to hostile acts of terrorist activities.  Moreover, it reauthorizes the Public Interest Declassification Board,  aligns the reporting structure of the intelligence community chief  financial officer and chief intelligence officer with statutes that  govern other Federal agencies, and codifies longstanding congressional  reporting requirements regarding the intelligence community information  technology environment.   Mr. Chairman, the intelligence community comprises thousands of  patriotic Americans who do difficult jobs, sometimes at great personal  risk, to keep Americans safe from foreign threats. Today, these threats  take many different forms and emanate from various parts of the world.   In the Middle East, the threat from ISIS has not ceased, despite its  dramatic loss of territory. In fact, our intelligence professionals now  face the daunting task of tracking ISIS fighters fleeing Syria for  countries throughout the region and beyond.   Meanwhile, Iran is solidifying its influence, often through armed  proxy militias, in its quest to control a Shiite Crescent across a wide  swath of the Middle East.   In Asia, China poses numerous security challenges related to its  expanding military capabilities, its growing international force  projection, and its extensive extraterritorial claims. Additionally,  the Chinese regime is engaged in widespread efforts, including licit  and illicit means, to acquire critical U.S. national security  technologies and intellectual property.   Furthermore, Russia continues to pose a pressing threat to the United  States and many of our allies.   This is just a small snapshot of the threats the intelligence  community addresses every day.   Additionally, our intelligence professionals confront an array of  challenges posed by failed states, cyber warfare, nuclear  proliferation, and many other matters.   This bill will ensure that the dedicated men and women of our  intelligence community have the funding authorities and support they  need to carry out the mission to keep the United States safe, while  providing Congress with the tools it needs to provide robust oversight  over their actions.   I would like to thank the men and women of this country who serve in  our intelligence community. I am honored to get to know so many of them  in the course of the committee's oversight work.   I would also like to thank all of the committee's members for their  contributions to our oversight over the past year, and especially to  our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members for their time and their  efforts. The many hearings, briefings, and oversight visits our members  carry out during the year provide the input for this authorization and  the direction of this bill.   Finally, I would like to thank all the committee staff for their hard  work and for their daily oversight of the intelligence community.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: I am writing to you regarding H.R.       6237, the ``Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization       Act for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.'' The bill includes       provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee       on Homeland Security.        I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Homeland Security will forego action on this bill. However,       this is conditional based on our mutual understanding that by       foregoing consideration of H.R. 6237 at this time does not       prejudice the Committee on Homeland Security with respect to       the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matter contained in this bill or       similar legislation.        This waiver is also given with the understanding that the       Committee on Homeland Security reserves its authority to seek       conferees on any provision within its jurisdiction during any       House-Senate conference that may be convened on this or       similar legislation, and requests your support for such a       request.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 6237, and ask that a       copy of this letter and your response be included in the       Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the       House floor. I look forward to working with the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence as this bill moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                     July 11, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       6237, the Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization       Act for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019. As you noted, certain       provisions of the bill are related to the jurisdictional       interests of the Committee on Homeland Security. I agree that       your letter in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdiction       of the Committee on the Homeland Security with respect to the       appointment of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim       over the subject matters contained in the bill or any similar       legislation.        I appreciate your willingness to assist in expediting this       legislation for floor consideration. I will include a copy of       your letter and this response in the Congressional Record       during consideration of the legislation on the House floor.       Thank you for your assistance with this matter.
