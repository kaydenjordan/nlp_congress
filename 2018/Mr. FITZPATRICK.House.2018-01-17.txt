 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  constituent Dr. Timothy M. Block, president of the Hepatitis B  Foundation, Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, and the Pennsylvania  Biotechnology Center in my district in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.  [[Page H421]]    Dr. Block was recently named as a fellow of the U.S. National Academy  of Inventors. Being elected as an NAI fellow is the highest  professional recognition for academic inventors who have shown a  lifelong commitment to innovation, specifically by facilitating or  creating inventions that make a measurable impact on quality of life,  economic development, and the welfare of society.   Dr. Block is being recognized for his contributions to therapeutic  drug and biomarker of disease screening and discovery. Dr. Block also  holds more than nine patents and has been involved, for more than 30  years, in viral hepatitis research.   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives thanks Dr. Block for the  work that he has done in this field, which has undoubtedly impacted the  lives of constituents in my district and people around the world.                            ____________________
