 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Louise  Abercrombie, a woman who has worked diligently serving the people of  Oklahoma through her journalism career for 50 years.   Louise began her career with the Ponca City News, gathering city  briefs, walking almost 30 blocks a day. This hard work eventually led  her to cover obituaries and religion and then the chamber of commerce  beat and politics.   Louise covered all aspects of community news in her career, becoming  widely known for her accurate reporting and keen research skills. She  has interviewed six Oklahoma Governors, covered five Presidents, many  international leaders, and several Members of Congress. I personally  had the privilege of working with her when she covered a countless  number of my fly-ins over the years.   I want to thank Louise Abercrombie on her years of service and wish  her well in her retirement. Well done, Louise.                            ____________________
