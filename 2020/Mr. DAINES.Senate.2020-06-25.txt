 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jackie Stratton of Toole County for her tremendous efforts  to support her community.   Jackie, a graduating senior at Shelby High School, took the  initiative to start a food bank at her school to help those in need.   Jackie's FFA and Ag teacher encouraged her to apply for a grant from  Montana State University to fund her idea. After applying for the  grant, she received $500 from the Alpha Gamm Rho fraternity at Montana  State University to start her food bank. Her selfless efforts then  caught the attention of community member Lynda Barker, who was able to  secure a $2,500 grant from the America's Farmers Build Community Bayer  Fund to help Jackie's efforts.   With these grants, Jackie was able to purchase a refrigerator,  shelving, food, and hygiene products. Jackie also collaborated with the  local Albertsons for dairy, breads, and frozen foods. Additionally,  Jackie secured the donation of 300 pounds of ground beef from Flesch  Angus in Shelby for her food bank.   It is my honor to recognize Jackie for her selfless efforts to help  her fellow students and community members in need of support during  this difficult time. Her bold initiatives inspired-- others to give as  well and demonstrated how Montanans can come together to help one  another.                            ____________________
