 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 108, Nickolas Guertin, to be an Assistant Secretary of the  Navy; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action  or debate; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action and the Senate resume legislative session.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
