 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor Harvey Skoog  of Prescott Valley, Arizona, who will be retiring next month after a  long career of public service. Mayor Skoog has served the community of  Prescott Valley for almost three decades on the city council, 19 years  of which he served as mayor.   Along with his many years of public service, Skoog is known for his  pride and appreciation for his family. He moved with his family from  the Valley of the Sun to Prescott Valley in 1982. He and Edna, his wife  of 60 years, have 9 children, 61 grandchildren, and 43 great  grandchildren.   During his time as mayor, he has received many honors, including  serving on the League of Arizona Cities and Towns executive board and  as the chairman of the Greater Arizona Mayors Association. He was also  appointed by Governor Jan Brewer to the Homeland Security Senior  Advisory Committee for the State of Arizona.   Outside of public service, Mayor Skoog has been a successful small- business owner, developing three accounting practices in the Prescott  Valley area.   Mayor Skoog has been a shining example of a true public servant and  an outstanding friend to me and my staff over my years in Congress. I  wish him well in his retirement and thank him for his service to the  Prescott Valley and the entire State of Arizona.                            ____________________
