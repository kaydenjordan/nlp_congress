SEC. 302. FUNDS FROM THE MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT FUND.         Section 1898(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1395iii(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``during and after       fiscal year 2021, $270,000,000'' and inserting ``during and       after fiscal year 2021, $245,000,000''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3178, currently  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, improving and strengthening Medicare for the long term  is a major priority for the American people and Members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle; but as we pursue this larger goal, we should  not pass up opportunities to make smart, focused improvements that will  help Medicare beneficiaries today. That is exactly what the Medicare  Part B Improvement Act will do.   I introduced this bill with Ways and Means Ranking Member Richard  Neal, Health Subcommittee Chairman Pat Tiberi, and Ranking Member  Sander Levin. This legislation delivers targeted, immediate reforms to  make Medicare work better for the American people, and it includes  solutions from roughly one dozen Members of Congress on both sides of  the aisle.   The Medicare Part B Improvement Act takes action on three primary  goals: first, expanding access to high-quality care; second, improving  efficiency in the delivery of care so that patients can better receive  the care they need when they need it; and, third, easing administrative  burdens on healthcare providers so they can spend less time on  paperwork and more time with patients.   Importantly, H.R. 3178 extends and improves Medicare home infusion  services, which allow patients to receive personalized care in the  comfort of their own home.   This legislation also extends an ongoing Medicare pilot program, the  IVIG demonstration program, that allows patients with weakened immune  systems to receive care in their homes.   This demonstration program carries a lot of meaning for me. I  introduced it in 2012 as a direct response to the challenges facing  patients with immunodeficiency diseases.                                time  1345    As I learned from Carol Ann Demaret, a constituent and friend of mine  whose son David suffered from severe combined immunodeficiency disease,  life with a severely weakened immune system can be an incredible  struggle. For children especially, it can be a daily fight just to  survive.   Allowing these vulnerable patients to receive treatment from the  safety of their own home cannot only improve the quality of care, it  can greatly enhance their quality of life. It can give a kid a real  chance to be a kid.   In addition to these important provisions, this bill contains  numerous solutions that will lower healthcare costs and increase access  to high-quality, coordinated care for beneficiaries.   More than that, the bill is an excellent example of what we can  accomplish through regular order. This legislation was approved  unanimously by the Ways and Means Committee on July 13. It demonstrates  how, working together, we can solve real challenges facing patients,  families, and healthcare providers in our communities.   I would like to thank all the Ways and Means members on both sides of  the aisle who helped craft the solutions in this bill. I would also  like to recognize Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone of the  Energy and Commerce Committee for their leadership and hard work in  helping us move this bill forward.   The Medicare Part B Improvement Act takes targeted action to make  Medicare work better for the American people. I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), chairman of the  Health Subcommittee, be permitted to control the remainder of the time.
