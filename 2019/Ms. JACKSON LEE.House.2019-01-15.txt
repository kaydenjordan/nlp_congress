 Mr. Speaker, today reflects two interesting  commemorations. First, it is the actual birthday of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., who lost his life in a fight for justice for public  employees. I wonder what he would say on this day while we are in the  longest shutdown that is really against the Nation's proud and needed  Federal employees across the Nation.   I think it is important for my colleagues to reflect that 80 percent  of those impacted who work for the Federal Government are outside of  the Capital of the United States.   The second commemoration is a founder's day for Alpha Kappa Alpha.  That is the group of young women who organized in a segregated America  at Howard University to stand for service to the Nation. They were  African American young women. As I have said, in a segregated Nation,  in the midst of Jim Crow-ism, these women stood up to be servants of  change and good business.   As I mention this, I do it because of where we are today. It is  important to note the tragic impact that we cannot see that are not the  headlines of Federal employees, their families, but even those who are  not Federal employees impacted by the lack of service, such as a  disabled woman who may not get her payments from HUD and may be evicted  from housing that she desperately needs.   So why are we here? It is interesting that for the 2 years that the  President has served after convincing every voter in America that any  wall will be paid for by the country of Mexico, our neighbor and our  friend, he never found a pathway for that to happen, because it was a  fantasy, untrue, and it would never happen.   But in the 2 years that he had the Presidency, the Republican Party,  the House and the Senate, he never made an issue of this wall. But when  the Nation wanted a change and elected Democrats to the House of  Representatives in the majority, all of a sudden in the close of the  Mueller investigation and a number of other investigations going  forward, indictments of various collaborators and close associates of  the White House, all of a sudden the wall becomes a major national  issue, rather than the crisis of dealing with the needs of the American  people from gun violence, to jobs, to dealing with our disasters, it is  that.   But, yet, we have worked as Democrats in the House to get the  government open and to stop the Trump shutdown. When we first were  sworn in, we voted on every bipartisan bill that the Senate had voted  on to open the government. That was the week of January 3. We then, in  the last week, voted for every Republican appropriations bill in order  to send to the Senate for the government to be open.   Then there were ideas of extending the homeland security funding for  a short period of time to February 8, 3 weeks. We supported that. We  were even eager to hear from the Senator from South Carolina to open  the government and then begin the negotiations.   None of these suggestions were taken. In fact, the suggestion of the  Senator from South Carolina, a Republican, was rejected out of hand on  this past Monday.   The President has not been able to provide his own solutions. He has  not understood smart border security means we can sit down and devise  ways to ensure more personnel, to be able to make sure there are TSO  officers, Border Patrol officers, Customs and Border Protection,  laptops, technology, drones, and scanners.                                time  1100    That is what the American people believe in. That is what the  American people believe in. The American people are smart. They know  that we can find a solution, and they also know the solution comes in  many forms, an infrastructure of some sort.   Those of us on the border States have been to the border. It is our  home. We have seen the 700 miles of border infrastructure. We have seen  construction going on.   I just came back from the border again. I am from Texas. I was there  in the space where Felipe, the little boy who died, came across. He  came across with family members. They turned themselves in seeking  asylum. More courts and more judges we need to ensure--   So there is a solution. In the name of Dr. Martin Luther King, I  would simply say: let us be a peace finder, and let us be a warrior for  justice and find the peace and solve the problem. Open the government  to this White House.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 135 the  ``Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination Act of 2019,'' which will  strengthen the policies governing federal agencies' management of Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs by amending the Notification and  Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002.   Equal Employment Opportunity programs enable federal employees or  applicants who believe they have been the victims of discrimination to  file a complaint about the alleged discrimination.  [[Page H562]]    I support this legislation because it works to expand accountability  within the federal government as federal agencies take appropriate  disciplinary action against federal employees who have been found to  have committed discriminatory or retaliatory acts.   In 2012, federal employees and applicants for employment filed nearly  16,000 EEO complaints; most of which were handled accordingly, but some  federal agencies still have not met the standards of a model EEO  program set forth by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC).   This legislation would require each federal agency to ensure its EEO  program is not under the control of the agency's human resources or  general counsel offices and that the head of the program reports  directly to the agency head.   Madam Speaker, this bill would also expand the notifications that  agencies are required to provide when discrimination is found to have  occurred, and it would require agencies to track and report whether  necessary disciplinary action has been taken.   Additionally, H.R. 135 would prohibit policies, forms, or agreements  that prohibit or restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the  Office of Special Counsel, or any Inspector General any information  that relates to any violation of any law, rule, or regulation or any  instance of waste, fraud, or abuse.   Fighting discrimination is a commitment the federal government needs  to make, beginning with their own employees at home and abroad.   Men, women, of every race and religion deserve the same  representation and protection under the United States government, and  in order to fulfill the requirements of their job to the best of their  ability, their right to not be discriminated against needs to be  upheld.   In 2013, Texas employers received almost 10 percent of the nation's  federal employment discrimination, harassment and retaliation  allegations, at about 9,000 total charges.   I support this legislation because I support the rights of federal  employees to feel safe and represented in their working environments,  and obtain the correct protection they desire and deserve.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  135 to strengthen the policies surrounding work place discrimination in  the federal government.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I beg to  differ with my good friend from Iowa. I do believe that we are all  created equal with certain inalienable rights. What I would say to him  is that Western civilization is what we all are. There is no  denigrating of Western civilization. It is what America is.   We are the greatest leader of Western civilization. We are the  greatest leader of the free world. But what we are speaking about is,  of course, the words ``white nationalism'' and ``white supremacy,'' for  it is clear that the FBI makes a direct point between dehumanizing and  derogatory comments, which come from white nationalists and white  supremacists, to the idea that it generates, as you have heard here on  the floor of the House. It generates the death of Dr. Martin Luther  King. It generates Charlottesville. It generates Charleston, South  Carolina. It generates hateful acts that result in death.   This is the kind of tolerating of this that we cannot suffer and the  intolerance that we cannot suffer. Because the idea of white  nationalism, as superior to others, and white supremacy indicates that  somebody else might die.   This resolution is an important resolution to affirm to this Congress  and this Nation that we believe that we all are created equal and, as  Dr. King said, that, ``We shall overcome.'' And, some day, we shall  overcome.    Madam Speaker, I can't even account for this  historic and devastating Trump shutdown.   When I say I can't account, I can't believe that the government is  now in the mix of a shutdown that has such far-reaching proportions of  impact, negative impact: not only my constituents who work for so many  Federal agencies, from TSOs to Border Patrol, to Customs and Border  Protection, to air traffic controllers, but those around the Nation-- the two Federal employee family that is now going into their son's  scholarship fund, the young mother who now needs food assistance, those  who are on the SNAP program, those who live in public housing, those  who are disabled.   Is there any empathy or sympathy in the White House to begin  intelligent and informed negotiations, allowing us to negotiate border  security after the fact but open the government now so that people can  be paid?   Madam Speaker, people are asking me whether their healthcare coverage  is going to lapse because they are not being paid. People are asking  about whether or not the credit scores that are impacted by not being  able to pay your bills, how they are going to make amends for that;  about the mortgages or the rent to landlords who are being insensitive.   Madam Speaker, the bottom line: Open the government, Mr. Trump, for  the American people.                            ____________________
