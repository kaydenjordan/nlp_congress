 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Mr. Shaw Carter, who passed away on August 9, 2017, at the age  of 24.   Shaw was a rare individual who touched the hearts of many people in  his life. He was a recent graduate of Young Harris College in north  Georgia, and was a graduate assistant at the University of Georgia,  where he was working on his master's degree in public administration.   Born with a heart defect, he underwent three open heart surgeries  before his third birthday and had a heart transplant before his 21st  birthday.   Through the obstacles with his illnesses, he preserved and selflessly  volunteered his time to uplift other kids who had other severe medical  issues. For example, he volunteered over 200 hours for Mended Hearts at  Northeast Georgia Medical Center.   When he was awarded the Young Harris Spirit Award, he was described  as the ``indefatigable Shaw Carter.'' There is no better way to  describe him. He will truly be missed.                            ____________________
