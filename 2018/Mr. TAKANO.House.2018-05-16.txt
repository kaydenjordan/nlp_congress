 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Walz for yielding me  [[Page H4042]]  the time and his steadfast leadership on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. He has been tireless in his support of veterans and their  families. I am, likewise, inspired by the gentleman from Texas' service  to our country. I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is the culmination of years of  ongoing discussion about how to guarantee veterans have timely access  to quality care. It streamlines existing programs that allow veterans  to get care in the community, creates a process for aligning VA  facilities to meet the changing needs of the veteran population, and it  expands the Caregiver Support Program to all veterans.                                time  1615    It should come as no surprise that I have serious concerns with this  bill. I voted against it when it was reported out of committee to  signal that it is not a perfect bill and that there are still  improvements to be made.   One of my biggest concerns has to do with funding. In that regard, I  share the concern of the ranking member. While previous funding for  Choice came from emergency mandatory funding, moving forward, the  program will receive discretionary funding and could break the budget  caps that trigger sequestration.   That is why I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee last night  that guaranteed that moving community care funding to the discretionary  side wouldn't count against the bipartisan budget caps we agreed to  just a few short months ago. It would help guarantee that we continue  to keep our promises to veterans by funding the full range of supports  and benefits that they are owed.   Unfortunately, that amendment was not made in order for us to  consider on the floor today. Without this critical amendment, I am  concerned we will be facing difficult choices, and I fear that veterans  will ultimately pay the price, and I mean that in a literal sense.   I have concerns about the process that brought us here today. I think  this bill needs a greater emphasis on building the VA's capacity, its  internal capacity, to provide veterans the specialized care that many  of them need. We need to do more to recruit and retain the best  providers to care for our veterans.   I wish that there were more guardrails in place as we begin asset  realignment, and I wish that we had a strong VA leadership in place  before moving forward with sweeping reforms. But, at the end of the  day, Mr. Speaker, I realize we can't keep doing emergency patches to  fund community care. We can't continue to look veterans in the eye when  we don't offer caregiver support services just because they served in  an era before 9/11. That is why I will reluctantly vote in favor of  this bill today.    I will reluctantly vote for this bill today.
