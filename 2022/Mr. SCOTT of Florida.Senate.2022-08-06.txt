 Madam President, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam President, I ask that the reading be  dispensed with.         [Mr. Scott of Florida] moves to commit the bill H.R. 5376       to the Committee on Finance of the Senate with instructions       to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day in which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would prohibit the hiring of any additional Internal       Revenue Service agents pursuant to section       10301(a)(1)(A)(i)(II) until such time as at least 18,000       additional agents (over the number of such agents employed as       of the date of enactment) are hired by the United States       Border Patrol.     Madam President, the historic crisis that the  Biden administration has created on the southern border by failing to  enforce our laws is threatening the national security of the United  States every day.   Savage cartels own our U.S. border now. This fiscal year, more than 2  million people have illegally entered the United States. Drugs are  pouring into our communities and killing thousands and thousands of  Americans. It must end now.   Sadly, Democrats are still doing nothing to support the Border Patrol  or actually securing the border. Instead, they want to supersize the  IRS and add 87,000 more agents to hunt down and audit even more  families and small businesses.   My amendment says that before one additional IRS agent is hired, we  must give Border Patrol the support it needs and double its forces with  18,000 more Border Patrol agents. It is time to first secure the border  and second, stop the Democrats from supersizing the IRS.   I urge my colleagues to vote for my commonsense amendment.  [[Page S4181]]     I ask for the yeas and nays.
