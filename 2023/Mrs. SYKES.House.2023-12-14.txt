 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the Walsh Jesuit  High School girls soccer team as Ohio 13's Congressional District  Champion of the Week.   Last month, the Walsh Jesuit Warriors girls soccer team won their  first Ohio High School Athletic Association Division I State  championship since 2016.   After a hard-fought game, the Warriors overcame Olentangy Liberty 2- 1. This win cements Walsh Jesuit's status as a soccer powerhouse with  their 11th State title win since the year 2000.   The program holds the record for the most girls soccer State titles  in Ohio, and their win is just more proof as to why Ohio's 13th  Congressional District is the birthplace of champions.   This victory is not only a major accomplishment for these hardworking  student athletes but also for their coaches, parents, and entire  community that supported them along the way.   Congratulations again to the incredible Walsh Jesuit girls soccer  team. I can't wait to see how you dominate on and off the pitch.                            ____________________
