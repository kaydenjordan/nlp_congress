 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Rosie the  Riveter National Historic Site Expansion Act.'' The Rosie the Riveter  WWII Home Front National Historical Park honors the history of  Richmond, California as the home of World War II shipyards and the  women and men who supported the war effort domestically.   Richmond, California was chosen as the site for this National  Historical Park because it has so many surviving sites and structures  from the World War II era that help tell the diverse stories of the  home front. According to the National Park Service, ``these stories  include the mobilization of America's industry and the changes in  production techniques; the struggle for women's and minority rights;  the labor movement; the growth of pre-paid medical care; advances in  early childhood education and day care; recycling and rationing; major  shifts in population; and changes in arts and culture.''   This legislation would add the Nystrom Elementary School to the  existing National Historical Park.   During World War II, the Nystrom Elementary school was built to teach  the children of shipyard workers. The school was part of a planned  development including the Maritime Child Development center, which has  already been preserved as part of the park, and the Nystrom housing  area, which has been scheduled for future preservation and  redevelopment by the city of Richmond.   The bill would also give the National Park Service the authority to  add additional sites to the park through cooperative agreements and to  acquire additional sites for inclusion in the park.   Having the Nystrom Elementary school identified as a site of the park  will help the National Historical Park better preserve, interpret, and  share that history with visitors. To understand the social changes that  occurred during World War II, it is important to have sites that  represent those changes as tangible evidence.   The City of Richmond and the West Contra Costa Unified School  District support adding the school to the site. I thank my colleague,  Representative Mark DeSaulnier, for championing this effort in the  House.   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the ``Rosie the  Riveter National Historic Site Expansion Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
