 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, all too often in Washington,  we mistake activity for progress, and in many cases we apply that  misguided framework onto the States.   There are few better examples of this than Washington's dabbling in  our election laws over the last 2 or 3 decades.   The National Voter Registration Act, our last big partisan bill,  aimed at increasing turnout, did not actually achieve that aim. It  increased voter registration, but as the Congressional Research Service  has said:         Its effect on turnout remains unclear. Its cost and       mandates on the States, however, were very clear.    That is exactly what I am talking about in terms of mistaking  activity for progress.   The centerpiece of division A's voting section is automatic  registration. According to my colleagues on the other side, it covers  all sorts of problems: updating the voter rolls, lack of participation,  et cetera.   No excuse vote by mail, same-day registration can be important, but  is the automatic voter registration section that is hoped for the  driver of participation?   This is an aggressive mandate in a bill full of aggressive mandates.   Fifteen States and Washington, D.C., have automatic registration.  Only five States do it at every welfare and government agency. Three  States require registrants to decline by postcard.   This bill would more or less include all three of these provisions.   This bill would also require the automatic preregistration of 16- year-olds.   If it went into law, it would amount to, at the very least, a top  three most aggressive automatic registration program all across the  country, but the bill says that if you are in a State where you have  already got an automatic registration program on the books, you don't  have to comply with all the mandates in the bill.   My amendment would do the same thing, but for outcomes instead of for  registration.   The outcome that this bill looks for is turnout.   States that have seen massive increases in turnout should get  rewarded, and that is what this amendment does.  [[Page H2532]]  It lets States who have achieved increased turnout be rewarded by  exemption from the mandates in this bill to continue the success that  they have been able to achieve with their own programs.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, the amendment that I have  offered is in keeping with the spirit of the bill. States are balancing  the right of everyone to have access to the polls.   Automatic voter registration has allowed so much access to the polls,  that it has created challenges for States to be able to comply, even  with people who are only supposed to vote legally. They have access to  voter registration through Motor Voter and other ways when they are not  even residents of the United States, and it puts burdens on States to  comply with that.   This would be a one-size-fits-all mandate from the Federal Government  that may be needed in some States where access has been challenging and  where voter turnout has been low, but in States that have had high  voter turnout, that do have effective regimes where you have not just  access, but you have participation at levels that have increased by 5  percent or more, to continue on the path of success that they have had  without disruption from Federal mandates that would potentially do  that.   The Brennan Center says:         Automatic voter registration is gaining momentum across the       country.    Currently, 15 States and D.C. have approved the policy, meaning that  over a third of Americans live in a jurisdiction that has either passed  or implemented automatic voter registration. This policy is winning at  the State level and overall push for turnout is also winning.   My amendment is complementary to this bill's enterprise and it would  do nothing to undermine the pushes that are already going on at the  State level.   It was Madison who said that States are:       . . . best acquainted with the situation of their people.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H2533]]     Madam Chairwoman, I want to quote from a speech  delivered by a former SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, chair:         Certain mandates, which invoke the Securities and Exchange       Commission's mandatory disclosure powers, seem more directed       at exerting societal pressure on companies to change       behavior, rather than to disclose financial information that       primarily informs investment decisions.        That is not to say that the goals of such mandates are not       laudable. Indeed, most are. Seeking to improve safety in       mines for workers or to end horrible human rights atrocities       in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are compelling       objectives, which, as a citizen, I wholeheartedly share.        But, as Chair of the SEC, I must question, as a policy       matter, using the Federal securities laws and the SEC's       powers of mandatory disclosure to accomplish these goals.    Those are the words of Mary Jo White, President Obama's SEC Chair.  She understood what this body understood when it adopted the rider in  the appropriations bill my amendment seeks to protect.   The SEC cannot and should not be used as a tool for social  engineering. The disclosure laws cannot be used as a method to compel  noneconomic behaviors. The SEC has known this since the 1970s, when it  received hundreds of different petitions to add dozens of different  disclosure requirements. It stated at the time, ``The Commission's  experience over the years in proposing and framing disclosure  requirements has not led it to question the basic decision of the  Congress that, insofar as investing is concerned, the primary interest  of investors is economic. After all, the principal if not the only  reason, why people invest their money in securities is to obtain a  return. A variety of other motives are probably present in the  investment decisions of numerous investors; but the only common thread  is the hope for a satisfactory return, and it is to this that a  disclosure scheme intended to be useful to all must be primarily  addressed.''   Madam Chair, we don't know what each individual investor wants,  disclosure requirements have proven very costly, and I urge my  colleagues to support the position of the Obama SEC Chair and the SEC  since the 1970s, which my amendment seeks to preserve.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, companies are already going  ahead and disclosing political donations. 196 of the Fortune 500  companies have disclosure policies in place, up from 174 in 2015. More  companies are deciding this is the right way to approach their  political giving.   But I don't have anything to say against their voluntary decision. I  do think it is a mistake to force compliance through disclosure laws at  a time when public markets are less attractive than ever for going  public.   Capital formation in the United States of America could easily be  improved and has, in fact, suffered by a heavyhanded regulatory  approach.   Corporations are not treated differently than individuals are. There  is nothing that compels an individual to disclose every single dollar  they donate and to whom. This would go in the other way.   If you decide to go public in the United States, you are treated  differently under the law than a private company or a private  individual. The reality is, under the law, you should be treated the  same way. In some cases, you are allowed to give a donation privately,  and in other cases, you are not. Corporations have to comply with that  law. The Federal Election Commission administers that law, not the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have  remaining.    I wonder, Madam Chairwoman, whether folks  opposed to my amendment would be in favor of requiring every single  person and corporation to disclose every dollar that they give. That is  essentially what you are saying here: We want to treat publicly traded  companies differently than we want to treat every other company and  every other individual. And we realize that the FEC isn't competent or  qualified to do that job, so we want to add another agency to do this.   President Obama's own Chair of the SEC stated: When disclosure gets  too complicated or strays from its core purposes, it can lead to  information overload, a phenomenon in which ever-increasing amounts of  disclosure make it difficult for investors to focus on the information  that is material and most relevant to the decisionmaking of investors  in the financial markets.    As has been stated, the fiduciary responsibility of the directors of  the company, of the shareholders, and of the people making investments  is a common denominator. There may be disparate political views in  these days--there surely are--and unpopular positions may be at odds  with the fiduciary responsibilities of companies.   This should have been debated in a Financial Services Committee--one  of the other flaws of this path that we are on today--subrogating all  of the authority of the other committees with only a handful of the  amount of participation.   Lastly, I would say that a majority of Democrats actually voted for  the appropriations bill with the riders that are at the heart of the  opposition's objection to my amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chairwoman, my amendment would uphold an  appropriations policy rider included in the FY 2019 appropriations  package that this body, on a bipartisan basis, just voted on last  month. That provision prevents the IRS from the collection of donor  information for 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.   In 2013, when the IRS attempted to issue rules that would clamp down  on these organizations, there was bipartisan pushback from groups as  disparate as the ACLU and Tea Party Patriots.   The IRS has a poor track record on the handling of donor information  of these organizations. The 2013 IRS scandal of targeting conservative  groups is the perfect example of this. The IRS asked groups  excruciatingly detailed questions, even as far as for the details of  the prayer meetings of pro-life organizations. Government agencies  investigating the intimate details of an organization's efforts to  participate in issue advocacy creates an unconstitutional chilling  effect on free speech.   The IRS is a tax collection agency, not an arbiter of the fitness of  an organization's political viewpoint. My amendment is about the  fundamental First Amendment rights for citizens and groups to  participate in public discourse.   Finally, H.R. 1's needless removal of a bipartisan policy rider does  not make sense in the context of this bill's inclusion of the DISCLOSE  Act. I oppose the First Amendment privacy issues raised by the DISCLOSE  Act provisions, like the ACLU opposes the DISCLOSE Act, but duplicative  collection of information, especially through a scandal-ridden agency  like the IRS, which has scandalously overstepped its bounds and  authority and jurisdiction, highlight what this amendment is all about.  It is inappropriate for the IRS to collect this sort of information.   It is my hope that we can maintain the well-considered appropriations  rider already included in the package passed just last month.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire of the amount of  time remaining.    Madam Chairwoman, even the scandal-ridden,  2013-era IRS that targeted conservative groups, overstepping its  jurisdiction by trying to shape the speech and conduct of organizations  rather than collect their taxes, withdrew the rulemaking process at the  heart of what is sought in this H.R. 1 bill. It is a chilling effect.   As we talk about one of our rights, access to the ballot box at the  Federal level, and we consider that, I think it is important to  remember the founding principles that led to the creation of this  country, and they are enshrined in the Federalist Papers.   I include in the Record a copy of Federalist Paper No. 59, wherein  Madison makes the case that Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution is  about the Federal Government's right to defend itself. It is not about  Congress being the prime driver of elections.                    congress gets to regulate elections         Federalist No. 59:        It is absolute not the first province of the federal       government. This is what Hamilton said in Federalist 59:        They have submitted the regulation of elections for the       federal government, in the first instance, to the local       administrations; which, in ordinary cases, and when no       improper views prevail, may be both more convenient and more       satisfactory; but they have reserved to the national       authority a right to interpose, whenever extraordinary       circumstances might render that interposition necessary to       its safety.        Article 1 section 4 is about the federal government's right       to defend itself. It is not about Congress being the prime       driver of elections.                                time  1430     As we look at this, we have the Federal  Election Commission. We have bodies of law that require disclosure, and  we have organizations that sometimes violate those disclosure laws, and  those companies are prosecuted when they do that.   Here, we want to take and add the IRS responsibility of shaping that  disclosure, and only for these types of groups and these types of  donations. It is intended to have a chilling effect on the speech, and  that is at the core of the objection for groups that don't agree on  much.   Between the ACLU and the NRA they don't often agree, but they agree  that H.R. 1 is bad, and this goes to the heart of their objection.   Madam Chair, I ask unanimous support for my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, in Alabama v. the NAACP, the  courts upheld the right to protect the privacy of donor information.   The right to privacy is fundamental to our Bill of Rights, and it is  threatened. It has a chilling effect, as has been enumerated from any  number of groups. My colleagues know this.   Just recently, social welfare groups, as defined by 501(c)(4),  engaged in social welfare to support infanticide, a bill that could not  get a vote to cloture in the Senate.   It would require the IRS, instead of the body of jurisdiction, the  Election Commission, to deal with donors.   The IRS should be narrowly focused on collecting tax revenue, not on  elections law, and we have seen abuses of their already-limited  jurisdiction.   This is the right thing to do. I encourage my colleagues to support  this amendment, and I ask for everyone who can find a way to see  through the distortion of information that is being presented here to  support our Bill of Rights, protect the right to privacy, and vote for  this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
