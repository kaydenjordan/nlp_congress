 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5247, or the Right to Try  Act of  [[Page H1523]]  2018. Supporters of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, have claimed that it  will provide seriously ill patients, who have exhausted all of their  available treatment options, access to experimental therapies free from  the barriers of FDA oversight.   While it is understandable that someone suffering from a disease who  has no more options would want to try anything that could help them  fight their disease, this legislation delivers the false hope to  patients and their families that they will receive a cure to their  underlying disease or condition.   In fact, this legislation provides patients and their families  nothing more than the right to ask a manufacturer for access to early  stage, unproven treatments. Like other so-called right-to-try  proposals, H.R. 5247 is based on the false premise that patients are  not receiving access to the investigational treatments as a result of  the Food and Drug Administration, and this simply not the case.   Through the FDA's existing expanded access program, seriously ill  patients are able to request access to investigational products. The  FDA approves 99 percent of all requests for investigational drugs or  biologics that it receives through this program.   Last year, FDA received more than 1,500 requests, and only 9 were not  approved. Despite this high-approval rate, supporters of right-to-try  laws have argued that the process is too slow and burdensome, but I  have not seen evidence that this is the case, Mr. Speaker. In fact, FDA  often grants emergency requests for expanded access immediately over  the phone, and nonemergency requests are processed in an average of 4  days.   FDA has even made improvements to streamline the process. For  example, FDA has revised the application for physicians to ensure that  it now takes less than an hour to complete. FDA has also released  additional guidance to industry, outlining the expanded access  program's requirements and addressing common questions related to the  different programs and submission process, and how outcomes will be  considered as part of the review process.   Last fall, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified on right-to-try  efforts and told our committee that: ``There is a perception that  certain products that aren't being offered under FDA expanded access .  . . will be offered under right-to-try. I don't see that,'' the  commissioner said. As I have said, the review process is working well,  but this legislation would completely take FDA out of the review  process. This is dangerous and could put patients at serious risk.   FDA is part of the process for a reason. It protects patients from  potentially bad actors or from experimental treatments that might do  more harm than good. While FDA approves 99 percent of the treatments it  reviews, it also revises applications for 11 percent of patients to  improve patient safety protections.   In order to protect patients, this review should continue. We must  protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments that  would make their lives worse. I am extremely concerned that the  legislation we are considering today is advancing a solution to address  barriers to investigational treatments that do not exist and could  expose seriously ill patients to greater harm instead of the greater  access that they are looking for.   The true barrier to any expanded access is the determination by the  manufacturer as to whether or not they will provide access to their  products that are under development. But nothing in the legislation  before us today would compel a manufacturer to grant access upon  request.   Further, H.R. 5247 would allow patients access to investigational  treatments that have only completed a phase I clinical trial. That is  an extremely small trial. It does not determine the effectiveness, or  the potential side effects of a drug. Access at this stage in the  development could expose patients to untested products, further harm,  and result in delaying access to a treatment that may be more  appropriate and more beneficial for their underlying disease or  condition.   H.R. 5247 also erodes important patient safeguards. It limits FDA's  ability to use clinical outcomes associated with the use of an  investigational product when reviewing a product for approval if it  could adversely impact its review. It also prevents any entity from  being held liable for use of the treatment.   And while I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, the intent of this bill, I can't  support it. The last thing I want to do is give patients false hope and  to potentially put them at risk by completely removing FDA from the  review and approval process.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous, in my opinion, that a bill of  this magnitude is being considered under a suspension of the rule. As  my Republican colleagues well know, bills considered under suspension  are traditionally bipartisan bills that have worked their way through  the appropriate committees with overwhelming bipartisan support.   This bill was never considered by the Energy and Commerce Committee.  In fact, it was only introduced today. A bill with such critical  patient safety implications should not be considered in this fashion.  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation and stand  with the more than 100 organizations that have come forward expressing  their concern for patients and the unnecessary risk this legislation  could expose our Nation's most vulnerable to.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), who is the ranking member of our  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I have said, I have great concerns that H.R. 5247  would expose our most vulnerable and desperate patients to unnecessary  risk.   Supporters of this legislation have argued that those patients who  are suffering from a terminal illness deserve the right to take their  health and treatment into their own hands, as they are faced without  any other treatment options. Some have even asked: What risk could be  worse than the risk of death?   As Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist from NYU, has pointed out: ``There  are things worse than death; being made to die faster, being made to  die more miserably.''   These are all very real scenarios that patients could be exposed to  under the misleading and ill-conceived right-to-try pathway.   As I stated before, while the FDA approved 99 percent of the requests  it received, of those, they revised 11 percent in order to protect  patients. If this bill becomes law, the FDA no longer will have the  opportunity to make those revisions and to protect vulnerable patients.   We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments  that might make their lives worse. That is why more than 100  organizations have written in opposition to this legislation, including  83 patient organizations like the National Organization for Rare  Disorders, the Friends of Cancer Research, the American Cancer Society,  Cancer Action Network.   In a letter to the Speaker and the Democratic leader, the patient  organizations noted that ``the alternative pathway in the latest  version of the legislation is still less safe for our patients than the  current expanded access process'' that the FDA uses.   Dr. Ellen Sigal, the chair and founder of Friends of Cancer Research,  said: ``In its current form, the proposed legislation does nothing for  patients other than provide false hope by allowing them to request a  drug with no evidence of efficacy they may never receive and, should  they receive it, may do more harm than good.''   So I think we should all be concerned about protecting patients.  Rather than rushing this bill through today, I would urge my colleagues  to oppose this legislation and to come back to the table to find a  solution that will streamline Expanded Access Programs while protecting  patients from unnecessary harm.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of reasons to oppose this bill today,  and I have given a number of them, but the primary reason being the  need to continue protecting patients by ensuring that the FDA remains a  part of the process.   While we are speaking about process, I have to also oppose this  legislation based on the inappropriate way the Republican majority is  bringing this bill to the floor. Bills considered under suspension have  traditionally gone through the committee process with overwhelming  bipartisan support, and neither of those things is the case with this  bill.   It was introduced today.   Does the majority really believe they are giving Members the  appropriate time to view this bill when it was introduced at 2 p.m.?   Patient access and patient safety should be shared goals among  Democrats and Republicans, goals that could be achieved if this  legislation was not being rushed to the floor under an arbitrary  deadline.   Legislation such as this, that carries such great risk of patient  harm, should be considered carefully, with attention paid to the  unintended consequences that could follow.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary  and risky legislation, and to return to the regular order of the  committee to consider legislation that would protect both patients from  harm and the FDA from the weakening of the agency's role in our drug  approval process.   We should not be voting on a bill of this consequence that was  introduced this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman how many speakers  he has left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H1527]]    Mr. Speaker, I just want to talk about two other aspects of this bill  that I haven't so far. One is the fact that States have actually  implemented right-to-try laws that have done little to expand access to  investigational treatment. Although 17 States and the District of  Columbia have enacted right-to-try laws, there is no evidence that  anyone has obtained an investigational treatment via these laws that  couldn't have been obtained through FDA's expanded access program.   Right-to-try laws do not compel companies to provide patients access  to investigational treatments. Therefore, under these State laws,  patients still do not have a right to try, only the right to request  the treatment from the company. State right-to-try laws do not address  the fundamental barriers of cost and accompanying restrictions.   Neither the FDA nor States require insurers or pharmaceutical  companies to cover the cost or reduce the cost of these expensive  treatments. Instead, these laws put patients at a higher risk by  prohibiting or weakening FDA oversight of investigational treatments.   With regard to clinical trials, the legislation could also expose  patients to unnecessary risk by allowing access to investigational  drugs that have only completed a phase I clinical trial. Phase I trials  are extremely small trials, in the range of 20 to 80 patients, and are  used primarily to determine toxicity. They do not determine  effectiveness or potential side effects. Patients could suffer from  harmful side effects or delay enrolling in a clinical trial program for  a treatment that actually has evidence of efficacy for their disease or  condition.   Finally, the bill would weaken the FDA's ability to oversee the  adverse events or other clinical outcomes from the use of  investigational drugs and provide broad liability protections for  manufacturers, leaving patients with no recourse in the case of an  adverse effect.   I just wanted to mention those.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to conclude, if I could, in opposition to  this bill by quoting some of the former FDA Commissioners.   This is from Dr. Margaret Hamburg, who said:         I am deeply concerned by the draft legislation       being considered to remove the FDA from the proposals       around right to try. Excluding the FDA will not benefit       those patients and would be a mistake. There is no need to       create a new potentially dangerous paradigm by passing       this legislation which does not address the real issues at       hand and could have unintended negative consequences,       leading to a possible impediment of the development and       approval of safe and effective therapies.    And then, finally, is the former FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner,  Joshua Sharfstein, who said:         FDA review allows doctors and patients to tell the       difference between a medication that works and one that does       not. Evidence also orients the pharmaceutical market towards       developing products that produce meaningful benefits for       patients instead of just hope. Undermining FDA review by       giving a right to patients to try anything at any time will       leave more patients in desperate situations with fewer       options and less understanding of what could really make a       difference.    Again, Mr. Speaker, I would urge opposition to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
