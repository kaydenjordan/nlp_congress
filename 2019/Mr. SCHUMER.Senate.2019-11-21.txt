 Madam President, first, let me thank my friend from  South Dakota for his wonderful words on Thanksgiving.   I was going to conclude with Thanksgiving, but I will start with it.  It is a great holiday. It is a great American holiday. I love it, and  my family loves it. I was born on Thanksgiving Day. My new grandson was  born on November 24, so he will have birthdays on Thanksgiving as well.  This year, for the first time, the Schumers will celebrate with four  generations, because my parents, who also served in the Army Air Force  in World War II--my dad, 96, and my mom, 91--will be there with their  little great-grandson, Noah. We are blessed.   Thanksgiving is family and food. What could be better than that? They  are two great parts of the holiday. I will not carve the turkey like  Thune does because it would get all screwed up, but I can dole out the  mashed potatoes--I am good at that--which is probably what they will  have me do. It is a great holiday, and we do have a great deal to thank  God and the country for.   The wonderful thing about Thanksgiving is, from its origins during  the Civil War--one of the worst, most horrible times in America, with  so much death and mayhem and division--people were still grateful for  America, and we are today. It is an amazing place. My father was an  exterminator, and I am a U.S. Senator. What an amazing country this is,  and we should never stop trying to make it better. I try to do that  every day. I am thankful that I live in a country in which you can try  to make it better.   I am thankful for many, many things--family, with our new addition  this year. Iris and I are so happy about that. We have great kids and a  great daughter-in-law and son-in-law. There is just a lot to be  thankful for, and it is nice to take a pause, amidst all the fighting  and partisanship here, to be grateful.
