 Mr. President, this Sunday, October 14, 2018, we  celebrate the 128th birthday of General and President Dwight D.  Eisenhower. The last President born, in the 19th century, Ike came of  age in both a changing nation and an ever-shrinking world. As Kansas'  favorite son, Ike left an indelible mark on the Nation and on the  world, from being appointed Supreme Allied Commander during the Second  World War, to being duly elected as our President. Ike's character- driven experiences guided him in all of his workings.   Many remember important dates and events surrounding the life of  General and President Eisenhower, but October 14, 1890, was probably  like any other day in this changing Nation, and the world could not  know that one of its staunchest supporters of peace and prosperity  would be birthed on that day. President Eisenhower once said, ``When  you finally find something that must be done, impossibilities disappear  and become merely major obstacles.'' This determination and dedicated  belief in America brought Ike from our Nation's heartland in Abilene,  KS, to the U.S. Military Academy, to an extraordinary career in the  Army, and to the Nation's Capital as a newly elected President.   Among many attributes, Eisenhower embodied the undying American ideal  that calls us to achieve more than the previous generation and to  strive for a safer and more prosperous world for generations to come.  Ike believed this to be his prime duty, and his determination and  ability enabled him to achieve that goal. Eisenhower's historical  achievements earned him the respect of most citizens in this Nation and  from many around the globe.   As Americans, we owe a great deal to the man who led the U.S. and  Allied Forces in the liberation of Europe and expelled from the world  the evil of Hitler's Nazism. Moreover, Ike's legacy as President  included the creation of the Interstate Highway System, NASA, the  Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, now known as HHS and the  Department of Education, and the FAA. He also brought Alaska and Hawaii  into the Union.   As the chairman of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, I am  pleased to report that the national memorialization of President and  General Eisenhower is well underway and that the construction of the  memorial honoring Ike is near the halfway point of completion. We have  a dedication scheduled for May 8, 2020, marking the 75th anniversary of  the Allied victory in Europe during the Second World War.   Today I ask my fellow citizens and Senators to celebrate and  memorialize this outstanding president, Kansan, and American by wishing  Ike a happy 128th birthday.                            ____________________
