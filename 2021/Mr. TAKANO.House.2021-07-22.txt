 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember an Inland Empire  resident and an excellent public servant, Lois Carson.   Lois was a beloved member of my community and a passionate advocate  for childcare, education, and welfare reform.   Lois served as the president of the San Bernardino Community College  District Board of Trustees while I served on the Riverside Community  College District Board of Trustees. I have fond memories of working  with her at trustee conferences where we would collaborate on improving  the lives of Inland Empire students.   During her 30 years as the executive director of Community Action  Partnership of Riverside County, Lois provided services for low-income  residents. Under her leadership the agency ran successfully and  received the first public sector Community Action Agency award for  excellence in 2005.   The Inland Empire was fortunate to benefit from Lois Carson's many  talents, and I am honored to have known her and believe that her legacy  will live on in the many lives she touched.                            ____________________
