 Madam Speaker, the Christmas season is  a time for families across America to be joyous. However, due to  irresponsible policies of Biden and Democrats, inflation has reached  40-year highs.   The Thanksgiving meal was particularly tough on the wallet, but now  with Christmas, prices continue to be unbearable. Even the cost of a  Christmas tree is expected to rise 15 percent.   According to a recent survey by RetailMeNot, more than half of  holiday shoppers plan to make fewer purchases due to higher prices.   Average national costs have increased. Airfare is up 42 percent,  public transportation up 28 percent, gas up 17 percent, food up 12  percent.   I was grateful this weekend for a daylong visit to Kyiv in Ukraine.  The people of Ukraine, with Poland and Germany, are courageous for  liberty and rule of law.   In the tradition of the American Revolution, they understand: Don't  tread on me. Appeal unto Heaven. Live free or die.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan's safe haven to America.                            ____________________
