 And I'm fighting.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk directed to  the House managers.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia has a  question for the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Would the President be made aware of the FBI and       intelligence information of a possible attack and would the       President be responsible for not preparing to protect the       Capitol and all elected officials of government with National       Guard and law enforcement as he did when he appeared in front       of the Saint John's Episcopal Church?    Ms. Manager PLASKETT. It is the responsibility of the President to  know.   The President of the United States, our Commander in Chief, gets  daily briefings on what is happening in the country that he has a duty  to protect. Additionally, the President would have known, just like the  rest of us know, all of the reports that were out there and publicly  available.   How many of you received calls saying to be careful on January 6, to  be careful that day?   I'm not--I'm seeing reports. It doesn't seem safe. How much more  would the President of the United States?   Donald Trump, as our Commander in Chief, absolutely had a duty and a  sworn oath to preserve, protect, and defend us and to do the same for  the officers under his command. And he was not just our Commander in  Chief. He incited the attack. The insurgents were following his  commands, as we saw when we read aloud his tweets attacking the Vice  President.   And with regard to the Vice President, I'm sure they did have a good  relationship, but we all know what can happen to one who has a good  relationship with the President when you decide to do something that he  doesn't like. I am sure some of you have experienced that when he turns  against you after you don't follow his command.   You heard from my colleagues that, when planning this attack, the  insurgents predicted that Donald Trump would command the National Guard  to help them. Well, he didn't do much better. He may not have commanded  the Guard to help them, but it took way, way too long for him to  command the Guard to help us.   This is all connected. We're talking about free speech? This was a  pattern and practice of months of activity. That was the incitement.  That is the incitement--the activity he was engaged in for months  before January 6, not just the speech on January 6. All of  [[Page S691]]  it, in its totality, is a dereliction of duty of the President of the  United States against the people who elected him--all of the people of  this country.
