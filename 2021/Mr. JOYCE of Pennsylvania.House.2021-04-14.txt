 Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment is a  fundamental piece of the U.S. Constitution. The right to keep and bear  arms is one of Americans' inalienable freedoms. This has been true for  centuries, and despite what the White House would like you to think,  this is still true.   Right now, the left is advancing unprecedented threats to Americans'  Second Amendment rights. Just last week, the President rolled out two  executive orders that would restrict the rights of law-abiding  citizens. The President proudly announced that he is willing to  undercut our core constitutional liberties. With his pen and, I might  add, without Congress, the President can singlehandedly unravel our  rights.  [[Page H1741]]    Mr. Speaker, I fear that we are embarking on a perilous path. Now,  more than ever, we must recommit to protecting this vital freedom.   Instead of stripping away Americans' constitutional rights, the U.S.  Government should be focused on enforcing law and order. Instead of  stripping away Americans' constitutional rights, the U.S. Government  should be focused on securing our southern border. Instead of stripping  away Americans' constitutional rights, the U.S. Government should be  focused on protecting our citizens from gang violence, stopping human  trafficking, and stopping the illicit drugs that cross our porous  southern border.   The President is correct that we have a public health crisis. We have  a public health crisis on the southern border. While the Commander in  Chief spends time plotting ways to subvert the U.S. Constitution, the  brave men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection are  encountering record numbers of migrants attempting to cross the border  unlawfully.   Last month alone, border agents encountered more than 170,000  migrants, a colossal 400 percent increase from the same time last year.  Yes, this is indeed a crisis. But the problem is not with the law- abiding citizens. The problem is not with the Second Amendment.   Here in Washington, our leaders need to get their priorities in  order. We need to uphold our oath to defend the U.S. Constitution. We  need to defend the American people from foreign threats. And we need to  protect our fundamental freedoms.                            ____________________
