 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S423]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                 Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Kuwait--Medical Information System for Kuwait Military Medical Command                                   (KMMC)         The Government of Kuwait has requested to buy planning,       integration, implementation, and maintenance of a Medical       Information System for its Kuwait Military Medical Command       (KMMC) that consists of: Health Information Systems       Information Technology (IT) hardware and software, IT       infrastructure, implementation of life-cycle management       practices, training, maintenance, support and warranty       services, along with U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical and logistics support services; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       estimated total cost is $250 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the infrastructure of a Major Non-NATO ally that       has been and continues to be an important force for political       stability and economic progress in the Middle East.        This proposed sale will improve Kuwait's capability to       provide greater health security for its KMMC infrastructure.       Kuwait will use the enhanced capability to strengthen its       medical services management. Kuwait will have no difficulty       absorbing this infrastructure, support, and associated       services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be the Cerner Corporation,       Kansas City, Missouri. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of as many as fifteen (15) additional U.S.       Government or U.S. contractor representatives to Kuwait for a       duration of up to seven (7) years to provide systems       planning, implementation, management, and oversight.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
