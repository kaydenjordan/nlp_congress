 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  yielding, and I also want to thank Majority Whip Clyburn for his  leadership in putting this resolution together.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which  sends a clear message that we will not accept hate or bigotry within  this House.   Let me be clear: While Congressman King's comments condoning white  supremacy were abhorrent, they were not a surprise to many of us. In  years past, Congressman King has implied that Dreamers are drug  dealers; he has endorsed far right, authoritarian, and neo-Nazis  sympathizers; and he has repeatedly reiterated the belief that  multicultural communities are a threat to our society. These racist  beliefs should not be espoused by anyone, let alone a United States  Congressman.   I grew up in the Jim Crow South, Madam Speaker. I know that racism  and discrimination don't just cause pain. When these beliefs become  policies, which Congressman King votes on and writes, they  institutionalize a vicious system that people of color have to deal  with as it relates to being denied equal rights and equal respect.  These are the consequences of white supremacy.    Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in both  parties to vote today, on what would have been Dr. King's 90th  birthday, to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this resolution.
