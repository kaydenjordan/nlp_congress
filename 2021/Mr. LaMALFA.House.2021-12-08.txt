 Mr. Speaker, this week, we pay tribute to the lives lost  on December 7, 1941.   Eighty years ago, Japan launched a surprise sneak attack on the U.S.  naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The attack on Pearl Harbor took  well over 2,000 military and civilian lives.   This unprovoked act of war served as a rallying cry for all Americans  to stand up for their brothers and sisters in the name of freedom,  liberty, and security.   In my home district, a local treasure, Lou Conter, one of the last  two living survivors of the USS Arizona, resides in Grass Valley. We  could not be more proud of Mr. Conter and what he fought for. It is my  honor to be his Representative.   This last September, Lou turned 100 years old. He is still full of  vigor, verve, and a smile for everybody. He is truly a pleasure to be  around.   Lou's efforts and our eventual triumph as a country over the evil at  Pearl Harbor and all through World War II is proof of the unbounded  determination of people like Lou and of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize today the lives lost at Pearl Harbor and  salute all who served to ensure the safety then and now of all of our  families in this great country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman of the Agriculture  Committee, Mr. Scott, and I have appreciated working with Ms. Schrier  from Washington and helping her lead this bill and letting me help do  so. I am glad to be able to support this bill here today.  [[Page H7491]]    Of course, this bill is just common sense. It will allow the Forest  Service to use the interests they gather on settlement accounts to  continue the important restoration work we have in our forests,  especially after so many horrific fires.   Currently, the U.S. Forest Service must transfer the interest they  collect to the General Treasury accounts. Now, this feels a little bit  like if my kids are out gathering aluminum cans and plastic bottles and  I keep the money when we take it down to be recycled.   The Federal Government should be allowing the money generated by  these settlement accounts to build up and go for the much-needed work  instead of skimming that money off the top.   Now, other agencies like the Department of the Interior are allowed  to retain the interest that accrues on their accounts and allows them  to spend that additional money on needed restoration in their projects.   The 2021 fire season, as we know--which is getting to be every year-- was devastating for the West and left millions of acres that will need  to be restored, including one in my district known as the Dixie fire,  which was right at a million acres. A million acres, one fire.   Without this legislation amending the Forest Service's ability to  retain this interest, the value of the settlement accounts diminishes  over time.   There already isn't enough money to replant and restore to get our  forests growing again after devastating fires, so why are we skimming  this interest off the top and thinking we are doing something by  putting it back in the Treasury? Why wouldn't we want the focus to be  on restoring and replanting our forests after so many devastating fires  year after year.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Schrier for stepping forward and sponsoring  this bill, and I look forward to hearing her comments on this. Somehow,  I got ahead of her in order here. I also look forward to working with  Ms. Schrier.
