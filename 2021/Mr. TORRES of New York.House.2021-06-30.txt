 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of my  amendment to the INVEST Act, which clarifies that the capping of  highways with deck parks shall qualify for funding under the  Reconnecting Neighborhoods Program.   The South Bronx is the most densely populated congressional district  with the highest concentration of diesel truck traffic. In Hunts Point  alone, there are 15,000 trucks traveling every day from and to the  Hunts Point Terminal Market. Children living near the Cross Bronx  Expressway are, through no fault of their own, breathing in air  pollutants that cause respiratory disease.   The sheer prevalence of asthma in the South Bronx is no accident. It  is a consequence of the Cross Bronx Expressway, which stands both  literally and metaphorically as a structure of racism.   My amendment to the INVEST Act would lay the groundwork for capping  the Cross Bronx Expressway in the hopes of preventing diesel truck  traffic from polluting the air we breathe in the Bronx.   There is no policy or project that would do more to fundamentally  improve the air quality and life expectancy in the South Bronx than the  long-overdue transformation of the Cross Bronx Expressway.                                time  1900
