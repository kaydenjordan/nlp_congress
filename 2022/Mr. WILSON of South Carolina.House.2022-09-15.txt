 Mr. Speaker, inflation is at the  highest in over 40 years. Yet, by passing the inflation expansion act,  Biden and the Democrats are further plunging American families into  debt and destroying jobs.   Signed into law by President Biden, the Congressional Budget Office  reports this bill will increase the deficit through 2026 and cost  working families an additional $60 billion.   Families are paying 14 percent more at the grocery store, according  to the Bureau of Labor Statistics--the largest 1-year jump since 1979.  Eggs are up 40 percent. Milk is up 17 percent. Bread is up 16 percent.   Since Biden took office, inflation has surged 13 percent, while wages  have only risen 8 percent over the same period. The inflation crisis  has cost the average American worker over $3,000 in annual income.   Bidenflation is a tax on all Americans.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism moves from a safe  haven in Afghanistan to America.   God bless victory for Ukraine.                            ____________________
