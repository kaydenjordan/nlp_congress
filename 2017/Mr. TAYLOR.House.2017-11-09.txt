 Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute all veterans on this day.   As veterans, you may forever and eternally take your place amongst  the unbroken line of patriots who have stepped forward, whether  voluntarily or drafted, with youth and rigor and bravery for your  Nation, for your family, and for the soldier on your left or right.   On this day, we bestow honor upon you for once standing the watch.   Because of the standard you have set, future generations will  continue to serve with pride in our American heritage and be willing to  preserve its providential promise, willing to uphold our God-given  inheritance as free people, and they shall fight for freedom, whatever  the cost, with dogged persistence and with an iron will handed down  from your legacy.   Happy Veterans Day, and may God lift you up, and may He always bless  these United States.                            ____________________
