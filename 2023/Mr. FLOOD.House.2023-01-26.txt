 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate National School Choice  Week.   School choice is about giving families the freedom to choose the best  education possible for their children, regardless of their learning  style or home address or financial situation.   Every parent in America wants to give their child the best education  possible, and Nebraska has great options: public, private, homeschools.  Not everyone has the means to access their option of choice.   I believe we should fund the students, not the systems. When funding  for education follows students to the school of their choice, families  win. Nebraska is one of only two States in the Nation that has not  passed a school choice program.   I am excited about these opportunities and look forward to giving  parents the choice.                            ____________________
