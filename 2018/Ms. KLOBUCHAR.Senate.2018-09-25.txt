 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Red  Arndt for his many years of service to the Lewis & Clark Regional Water  System, as well as his lifetime commitment to bringing safe and  reliable water to the rural corners of this country.   Born Lennis Arndt, but nicknamed ``Red,'' he started working in 1989  as the public utilities director in Luverne, MN. Shortly after  beginning his new position, Red heard about a proposal to bring water  from the Missouri River in South Dakota to the surrounding States.  Although it was a major undertaking with more people doubting the idea  than supporting it, Red saw the potential and recommended to the mayor  and city council that Luverne join the project as one of the first  members of the corporation that would later become the Lewis & Clark  Regional Water System.  [[Page S6300]]    Seeing Lewis & Clark develop from conception to construction was a  labor of love for Red and a mission he fought hard to achieve. He has  worked tirelessly on behalf of the project, serving as the vice  chairman of the board beginning in 1994, until becoming the board  chairman in 2006, a position he still holds. Under Red's leadership,  over $470 million in funding was directed to Lewis & Clark, and over  200 miles of pipeline have been laid in the ground that currently  deliver much-needed water to 14 member communities and rural water  projects, reaching over 300,000 people across South Dakota, Minnesota,  and Iowa.   In May 2016, Luverne, MN, was finally able to celebrate its  connection to Lewis & Clark, with Red reveling in taking the first swig  of water. It was at this ceremony that the meter building in Luverne  was dedicated in Red's honor. Red will be the first to acknowledge that  this endeavor, benefiting generations to come in the tristate area, was  a team effort. There is no question Red's vision for the future, as  well as his dedication and strong leadership have been a driving force  through the years. That is why he was a recipient in 2012 of the Lewis  & Clark Trailblazer Award, which is the organization's highest honor.   I am grateful for his commitment to public service, his hard work on  behalf of Lewis & Clark, and, more importantly, I am proud to call him  a friend. I commend Red Arndt for his many great contributions to Lewis  & Clark, the community of Luverne, and the entire State of Minnesota.   Thank you.                            ____________________
