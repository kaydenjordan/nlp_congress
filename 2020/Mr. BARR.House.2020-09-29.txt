 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the majestic and time- honored sport of thoroughbred racing, a beloved tradition in the United  States since the early days of the Republic and the signature industry  of my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Sometimes referred to as the sport of kings, Americans--and I would  dare to say, especially Kentuckians--have made this the sport of all  Americans through the inspiring stories of amazing athletes with names  like Sir Barton, Man o' War, War Admiral, Secretariat, Seattle Slew,  Affirmed, American Pharaoh, and Justify in recent years.   To that end, I further rise in favor of H.R. 1754, the Horseracing  Integrity and Safety Act, bipartisan legislation that I introduced in  one form or another during the last three terms of Congress with my  colleague and good friend, the gentleman from New York, Paul Tonko. I  thank Paul for his partnership in this long, tireless effort.   After many years of negotiation and deliberation, today I stand proud  to finally bring this legislation to the House floor for a vote.   Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked diligently to enact  policies that will promote economic growth and investment in this key  Kentucky industry. My district, Kentucky's Sixth Congressional  District, well-known as the Horse Capital of the World, is home to more  than 400 horse farms and the world-famous Keeneland Race Course in  Lexington, Kentucky, which not only serves as the global leader in  breeding stock sales, but also hosts many notable races, including the  great Toyota Blue Grass Stakes and Breeders' Cup, which will be, once  again, held at the racetrack this November.   Many of my constituents have a close connection to and an affinity  for both Keeneland and thoroughbred racing. My own grandfather, J.B.  Faulconer, was Keeneland's first publicist and later the vice president  of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations in New  [[Page H4982]]  York, where he was credited with naming the Eclipse Awards.   Several years ago, as I reviewed the minutes of the Jockey Club  roundtable meetings when my grandfather was active in the industry, I  noticed that, even then, four and five decades ago, leaders in the  industry lamented the lack of unity among the various constituencies  within the industry. They regretted the fact that there wasn't  uniformity in the rules of racing, and particularly in medication  rules.   Thoroughbred racing is not just about our culture and heritage. There  has always been immense pride in the enormous contributions of this  great sport to American culture. But it is also a major source of jobs  and economic opportunity for our people. In fact, the industry is  responsible for 44,100 direct jobs and over 16,000 indirect jobs in  Kentucky alone.   With the privilege of representing this unique industry comes the  responsibility of fighting for its future. This sport is not solely  relevant in those States that are home to the Triple Crown, like  Kentucky, Maryland, and New York. Horseracing is very much a national  sport, prominent in places like California, Florida, Arkansas, New  Jersey, Illinois, and Louisiana.   The horse industry contributes approximately $26 billion, as my  friend, Paul Tonko, pointed out, but in some estimates, up to $50  billion in direct economic impact to the U.S. economy; and it has a  direct employment impact of 988,394 jobs. Therefore, advocating for  this industry requires more than just celebrating its proud heritage.   I have always believed that the future prosperity of this sport  depends on uniformity of the rules of racing. Currently, as has been  noted, regulated by 38 separate racing jurisdictions, the thoroughbred  horseracing industry labors under a patchwork of conflicting and  inconsistent State-based rules governing prohibited substances, lab  accreditation, testing, and penalties for violations.   This lack of uniformity has impeded interstate commerce; it has  compromised the international competitiveness of the industry; it has  undermined public confidence in the safety and integrity of the sport;  and the industry is in desperate need of certainty.   As a conservative who believes in federalism and States' rights, I,  nevertheless, understand that the Constitution gives Congress the power  to regulate interstate commerce precisely for the purpose of  eliminating these kinds of impediments to interstate exchange.   As I have said many times, as a limited government conservative, this  legislative effort is not about more regulation. It is about creating a  single, nationwide set of rules that will result in smarter, more  effective, and streamlined regulation for the industry.   The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act will remedy this lack of  uniformity, the issue central to maintaining the integrity of the  sport, by authorizing the creation of a nongovernmental regulatory  safety authority and fairness, governed by representatives of all major  constituencies of the industry and responsible for implementing a  national uniform medication and track safety program.   Specifically, the legislation would recognize the horseracing  integrity and safety authority, which will be tasked with creating  uniform national standards regarding prohibited and permitted  substances for use in race horses, establishing an accreditation system  for laboratories to test drug samples, and developing regional  standards for racetrack safety.    As I have said, this legislation builds on the bipartisan legislation  Representative Tonko and I have introduced in previous Congresses and  incorporates feedback from an expanded group of industry stakeholders  to enact these much-needed reforms that will protect the safety of our  equine and human athletes.   I want to thank the coalition of organizations that have supported  this legislation from the very beginning, including the Water Hay Oats  Alliance; a special thanks goes to Arthur and Staci Hancock, my  constituents, of Stone Farm in Bourbon County, Kentucky, for their  tireless and relentless persistence and advocacy; the Jockey Club;  Breeders' Cup International, headquartered in my district; Keeneland,  Kentucky Thoroughbred Association; the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders  Association; and the Jockeys' Guild, because the jockeys know how  important safety is, with a special mention of Chris McCarron, for  advocating for their fellow jockeys and their safety.   I also want to thank members of our expanded coalition, including CEO  Bill Carstanjen and the board of directors of Churchill Downs  International and prominent trainer Dale Romans.   I want to thank Ed Whitfield, former Member of Congress from  Kentucky, who really trailblazed on this issue.   I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his  leadership in not only introducing companion legislation, but  legislation that I believe materially improves on our previous versions  by adding a focus on track surface safety and by making reasonable  minor changes that have enabled us to enlarge our coalition of support  and bring more organizations within the industry together in support of  our legislation.   Madam Speaker, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act was developed  through a highly deliberative and bipartisan process and takes into  consideration a diversity of perspectives from all parts of the  industry. I appreciate the willingness of all constituencies within the  industry to compromise and to forge a consensus product. This was not  easy, but it was necessary to get us to this historic day for this  great sport.                                time  1315    The result is support from the majority of Members of this House and  Senator McConnell's bipartisan companion legislation in the Senate.   Today's vote is a vitally important step in advancing reforms to  protect our equine athletes and jockeys, to ensure confidence in the  safety and integrity of the sport within the majority of the wagering  public, and enable the industry to attract a new generation of fans and  investors to strengthen the thoroughbred breed.   And because this is truly an international sport and industry, this  bill will make American thoroughbred racing and breeding stronger and  more internationally competitive. And it will also secure thousands of  both direct and indirect jobs in the Sixth Congressional District and  beyond that depend on a thriving thoroughbred horseracing and breeding  industry.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his leadership on this  issue, Ranking Member Walden for joining to help shepherd this  legislation through the process, and especially, again, my good friend,  Paul Tonko, who represents a great American racecourse in Saratoga  Springs.   I really appreciate, in this time of admitted partisanship and  polarization, an opportunity for this country to come together and  unite behind a great cause.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Horseracing  Integrity and Safety Act.
