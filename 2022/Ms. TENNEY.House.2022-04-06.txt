 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize seven amazing  students from the Camden Central School District Track and Field team,  who recently traveled to Mayfield, Kentucky, during their February  break to help residents after a devastating tornado ripped through the  State 2 months ago.   Led by Coach Phil Lucason, seven members of the team volunteered  their time: Lizzy Lucason, Will Carver, Ryan Beaulac, Joe Doran, Nate  Hurd, Ivy Murphy, and Dillon Melchoire. Incidentally, Dillon made a  special stop at the University of the Cumberlands in Kentucky on the  way back to sign a letter of intent to run track for them next year.  But these students worked in a large distribution center helping  hundreds of residents per day, who were seeking food and other  household supplies.   The students also spent time working alongside contractors who were  rebuilding the many buildings devastated by the storm.   Their tireless efforts on behalf of those whom they had never met is  a beautiful example of selfless service.   The 22nd District is so incredibly honored to have these excellent  students representing us and showing just how willing our community is  to help people in their greatest time of need. I thank them for their  tremendous service to our community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to represent New York's 22nd  Congressional District, which is home to generations of Burmese  refugees, dating back to the first family arriving in the early 2000s,  and where nearly 5,000 Burmese refugees reside.   On February 1 of last year, Burma's military seized power in a  violent coup, ending 5 years of flawed, but promising, democracy,  dragging Burma back into a brutal military rule.   Over the last year, the world has watched in horror as the military  targeted innocent Burmese men, women, and children. The latest  estimates indicate that over 1,700 people have been murdered and more  than 13,000 arrested by the junta.   In the face of this violence and repression, the resilience of the  people of Burma is no less than inspiring. The legislation we are  considering today is an important step forward in standing with the  people of Burma and holding their perpetrators accountable.   The BURMA Act will impose mandatory sanctions on the military regime,  as well as entities that continue to support it.   While the White House has begun to take steps to reimpose the  sanctions regime that the former Democratic administration prematurely  lifted, it is time that the Burmese military is again sanctioned as a  matter of law, especially now that the United States  [[Page H4211]]  has finally recognized that their crimes against the Rohingya amount to  genocide.   Now, more than ever, I urge all to remain committed to the people of  Burma's quest for democracy, for peace, and freedom, and to oppose this  affront to human dignity.   I thank Chairman Meeks and Congressman Chabot for championing this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America stands as free people against dictators and  despots. It is part of our values, and it is an important signal to the  world that the United States stands firm against autocrats, whether in  Burma or Russia.   Last Friday, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, showed the world how  true this is. He met with his counterpart from the Burmese junta regime  and said that the Chinese Communist Party would back the Tatmadaw ``no  matter how the situation changes.''   We are at a critical point in history. Authoritarian regimes like  China are partnering with their autocratic allies around the world to  make the globe less free; to undermine human dignity and individual  freedom; and to oppress those who stand up and have the courage to  speak out as the Burmese people have. It is sickening, and it is one  more reason why this legislation is so timely.   It is critical that America stands united in supporting the people of  Burma and championing their fundamental human rights in the face of  military oppression. I will continue to be a voice for this community  as we fight to oppose this affront to the people of Burma's dignity and  freedom and quest for peace.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this measure. I yield  back the balance of my time.
