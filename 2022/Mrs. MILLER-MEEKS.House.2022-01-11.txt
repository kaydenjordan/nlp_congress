 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a record- setting student-athlete at the University of Iowa.   On January 2, sophomore guard Caitlin Clark became the fastest player  in Big Ten history to reach 1,000 career points. She accomplished this  in just 40 games, passing the previous record holder from Ohio State.   Reaching this mark against Evansville University, Caitlin put up a  career-high 44 points in the 93-56 win for the Hawkeyes.   A lifelong Iowan, Caitlin was named a high school All-American before  coming to Iowa City and earning numerous accolades as a freshman,  including Big Ten Freshman of the Year, First Team All-Big Ten,  National Freshman of the Year, and First Team All-American honors.   Congratulations to Caitlin. I look forward to watching her continue  to dominate for the next 2 years. Go Iowa, and Go Hawkeyes.                            ____________________
