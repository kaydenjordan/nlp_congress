 Mr. Chair, I have to say there are things where I agree  with my colleagues, the Republicans. It is good to have healthy  dialogue and discussion. We are a free institution here. I actually  agree that we need to defend our borders, too. I actually agree that we  need to have better oversight and go to better security assistance and  not some other things, too.   I actually agree with them that we need to have the fiscal issues  resolved at the Department of Defense and offered amendments, but I  disagree that Ukraine is not a national interest.   Stopping this war and deterring aggressors like China and Russia is  in our national interest. Many Americans were killed by Russian-made  weapons around the world, and we need to learn from the mistakes of  World War II that weakness invites aggression.   I truly believe this administration didn't do that good of a job  deterring it, but now we need to help Ukraine. We need to understand  that there are a lot of lives that are going to be lost for Ukrainians.  We need to make sure that we don't have never-ending war, and better  security assistance will help to restore peace.
