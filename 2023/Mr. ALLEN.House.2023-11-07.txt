 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the formal  renaming of Fort Gordon to Fort Eisenhower, a well-known name in  history throughout the world.   Located in Augusta, Georgia, this military base has experienced a  major transformation over the last 10 years and is widely considered a  top-tier installation that will continue to grow, all while training  and housing thousands of the best and brightest who serve our country.   As the home of the Eisenhower Medical Center, which provides top- notch healthcare services for our veterans and men and women in  uniform, as well as the U.S. Army Cyber Command and the U.S. Army Cyber  Center of Excellence, this renaming is a true representation of  President Eisenhower's commitment to science and innovation and his  love for the surrounding community that he so frequently visited for  fellowship and sport.   A beloved visitor of Augusta, President Eisenhower's deep ties and  admiration for the area were well known. My team and I worked side by  side with local community members to ensure that if the base was to be  renamed, its new name would reflect both the history of our community  and the significance of the mission.   President Eisenhower made 45 trips to Augusta--5 before he became  President, 29 while in office, and 11 after his first term--taking full  advantage of all that our community has to offer, including the world- renowned Augusta National Golf Club, one of his favorite destinations.   President Eisenhower always found time for his faith, as well. At the  Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church in Augusta, there is a pew known as  the Eisenhower pew. It has a plaque on it where the former President  would worship when he was in town.   With a name like Fort Eisenhower and the international renown that  comes with it, as well as the critical missions housed there, this  military base will endure from now on.   As President Eisenhower's granddaughter Susan Eisenhower stated at  the renaming ceremony: ``If Dwight Eisenhower were here today, he would  be full of heartfelt appreciation for the focus and dedication this  community has placed on serving our country and keeping it safe.''   I couldn't agree more.                            ____________________
