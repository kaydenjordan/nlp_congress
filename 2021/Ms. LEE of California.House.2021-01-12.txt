 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution. I thank our Speaker for scheduling this, and Rep. Raskin  for his leadership and deep knowledge of our Constitution.   I speak today with sadness in my heart but purpose in my bones. This  Congress must take action to remove Donald Trump from office as soon as  possible, for the clear and present danger he poses to our Democracy,  our national security, and to the American people.   Last Wednesday, we saw Donald Trump incite a violent and deadly  insurrection at our U.S. Capitol in an attempt to reverse the results  of a free and fair election. The risk that he might do so again in the  next week is why he cannot be trusted for another minute as commander  in chief, overseeing the nuclear codes and the U.S. Military.   The fastest way to protect our republic from Donald Trump is for the  Vice President and the cabinet to take action under the 25th Amendment.  I implore them to do so. But if they do not, my colleagues and I stand  ready to defend our democracy from Donald Trump.
