 Mr. Speaker, I would ask the President or the Members  of this body to weigh in with the President and try to come to some  sort of conclusion on the war with Ukraine.   It seems to me that there are two groups: people who want us to pull  out and people who want us to be all in for years and years. However,  the longer this war drags on, the worse long-term relationships get  between Russia and the United States.   Russia has a very low birthrate and has had a lot of their young  people leave for the United States and other parts of the world  recently. Ukraine has the second lowest birthrate in the world. Neither  of these countries can afford to lose any more of their young people to  this war. The sooner the war wraps up, the better.   I am very disappointed that the press is not asking questions of the  Biden administration and that the Biden administration seems completely  uninterested in negotiating some settlement of the war.   I am aware of the fact that the U.S. cannot appear an impartial  broker, but we should strongly encourage Turkiye, Israel, or France to  step in and try to negotiate an end to this war. I do not know why it  seems like the Biden administration does not want it to end.                            ____________________
