 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor John Burke of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly passed  away on September 17 at the age of 91.   John served his community by sharing his passion for sports and the  outdoors through his writing. A native of Maine, John began his life in  the Coastal Empire when he was stationed as a Marine at Parris Island,  South Carolina. After leaving the Marine Corps, John began his career  as a reporter with the Savannah Morning News where he worked for over  50 years.   John's passion for life and the outdoors inspired him to document his  travels to Alaska. A recipient of many honors throughout his lifetime,  John's most cherished memory was being the grand marshal of the 2007  Savannah, Saint Patrick's Day Parade.   As a devoted outdoorsman, John served the Savannah community as an  advocate for hunting and fishing conservation.   I am grateful for John's service to his country and community, and I  know his impact will never be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for doing this tonight. This is extremely important, and I  appreciate his leadership on that.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration has been waging a war on  American energy and energy jobs since his first day in office. Of  course, on President Biden's first day in office, he killed over 11,000  American jobs, which were created by the Keystone pipeline.   Then the administration banned new energy leases that will cost  500,000 American jobs by 2040. Then he reentered the U.S. into the  Paris Agreement that will destroy our competitiveness and reduce  employment in the U.S. by 2.7 million jobs in 2025.   If that wasn't bad enough, the administration will destroy what high- paying jobs are remaining in our energy sector with this reconciliation  package. It includes a devastating tax on natural gas. By taxing it  more, we will disincentivize the continued transition away from dirtier  fuels.   It will increase global emissions by giving foreign adversaries a  competitive advantage exporting energy. This will also jeopardize  American energy security. Taxing natural gas is designed to push us to  use more wind and solar energy.   But just this week it was reported that energy prices in Europe are  hitting record highs as their increased dependence on wind power has  failed to be consistently reliable. It would be a cold and dark winter  in places like Europe and California if there was not natural gas  available this year. This again demonstrates how we must continue to  pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy.   Then there are the giveaways to the richest in America. The  President's massive socialist wish list subsidizes electric vehicles,  despite the fact that the average owner of an electric vehicle makes  well over six figures.   Perhaps worst of all is the pursuit of all of these policies with the  absolute and arrogant certainty that it will reduce emissions. However,  it will likely reverse the progress we have already made reducing  emissions.   The Paris Agreement allows for the world's worst polluters to  continue polluting well into the future. The use of lower emission  natural gas instead of other fossil fuels is largely responsible for  the enormous reduction of American emissions over the past couple of  decades.   But instead of embracing that success, the President proposes taxing  it into oblivion and picking his winners and losers. We saw how that  worked out with Solyndra. We are sacrificing growth and prosperity for  American families in the name of political posturing.   This is too heavy of a price for a policy that will not better our  environment or make us energy independent. Democratic proposals will  lead to higher energy prices, reduce the reliability of electricity for  many communities, and take away good paying jobs.   We had a witness on the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis make  an excellent point. Killing jobs connected to fossil fuels, like coal  and gas, has already destroyed communities years ago and they have  never recovered. The very same may happen to healthy, thriving  communities that have relied on good paying oil and gas jobs for  generations.   These are good jobs. Often these are the only jobs in rural areas.  Destroying these jobs will only further the disparity between urban and  rural America.   Madam Speaker, I urge this President to support all Americans and  stop his war on American energy, and I thank the gentleman for  sponsoring this tonight.
