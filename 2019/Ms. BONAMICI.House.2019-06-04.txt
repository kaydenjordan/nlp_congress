 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the American  Dream and Promise Act, to stand with the thousands of Dreamers across  the country and in Oregon, Dreamers like Gustavo and Brenda, who are  living in and serving in our community.   Gustavo graduated from Forest Grove High School. He knew he was  ineligible for Federal student aid, yet he found a way to go to college  because he knows that education cannot be taken away from him.   Gustavo wrote: ``I have found my calling in the nonprofit work I do.  I am here to give back to the Latino community that believed in me and  helped me achieve my dream.''   Brenda is an educator in Hillsboro, Oregon. Last summer, her students  asked her: ``Are you coming back next year?'' Despite uncertainty about  her status, Brenda will watch her students graduate this Saturday, and  she hopes to continue supporting kids and families in the very same  school district from which she graduated.   It is long past time for Dreamers like Brenda and Gustavo, Americans  in every way except on paper, to live out of the shadows. Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
