 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize as the  August Granite Staters of the Month the team behind Nashua's Positive  Street Art for their work remembering those lost to substance use  disorders and supporting those undergoing treatment.   New Hampshire is one of the States that has been hardest hit by the  fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic. This epidemic has devastated  communities across the Granite State, and far too many people have lost  loved ones to substance use disorders. We must continue to honor the  memories of those lost and continue to find ways to support individuals  who are going through recovery. In Nashua, Positive Street Art is  helping to remember those lost and support those on the road to  recovery with a mural called ``Take Courage.''   Since 2012, Positive Street Art has promoted the arts in Nashua  through urban and public art projects, including murals, workshops,  afterschool programs, and events like the Downtown Arts Festival. Their  newest mural, ``Take Courage,'' has come together primarily through the  efforts of artists Tom Lopez and Manuel Ramirez, as well as through the  support of Ric Everhard, Alison Bankowski, and community volunteers  Alyssa O'Mara, Victor Luce, Patrick Paraggio, Blake Bankowski, John  Stein, Lance lsaksen, Paul Alvarez, Valerie Galvao, Ashley Young, and  Jessica Ayala. The mural is meant to honor those community members who  were lost to substance misuse and inspire those seeking recovery.   When completed, the mural will bear an important and hopeful message  for people in Nashua and across the Granite State who have been  impacted by this horrific crisis: ``Take Courage. When the road is long  you must never forget you are never alone.''   In addition to their latest work, Positive Street Art has completed  numerous other murals. These include the ``Hearts and Minds'' mural  that honors our veterans, the ``Gratitude'' mural which reminds viewers  to be thankful for the blessings in their daily lives, and the  ``Nostalgia'' mural which highlights the vintage theaters that used to  occupy downtown Nashua. They have become beloved additions to the  streets of the city.   For their efforts to raise awareness and support those who have been  impacted by substance use disorders, as well as their general work to  support the arts in Nashua, I am proud to recognize the Positive Street  Art team as the August Granite Staters of the Month.                            ____________________
