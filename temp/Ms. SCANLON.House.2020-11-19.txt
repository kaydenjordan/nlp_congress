 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Transgender  Day of Remembrance and honor the memories of far too many transgender  or gender-nonconforming people, at least 36 of whom were lost this year  to fatal violence, the majority of whom were Black and Latinx  transgender women.   I want to take a moment to lift up the names and stories of a few of  the Black transgender women who faced violence this year in the city of  Philadelphia to honor their memory, because when we fail to acknowledge  this issue, we cannot begin to address it.   Dominique ``Rem'mie'' Fells was murdered on July 9. A friend  described her as a beautiful and unique soul. We are heartened by the  fact that an arrest in her murder has finally occurred.   Tracy ``Mia'' Green was murdered on September 28. Her friends and  family shared how ``her smile was so perfect and so contagious'' and  how she always made people laugh.   Kendall Stephens was brutally attacked in her own home on August 24.  As she was beaten, her attackers yelled transphobic slurs and said they  would ``come back to finish the job.'' Thankfully, Kendall survived the  assault and dedicates her work to healing the transgender community in  Philadelphia.    This violence is motivated by anti-transgender bigotry, and the  intersections of employment, housing, and other forms of discrimination  put too many transgender people, particularly transgender women of  color, at risk of violence.   This Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor those lost, honor their  survivors. As an ally, I rededicate myself to working for change to  protect this community from discrimination and violence.                            ____________________
