 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there are many reasons to vote against the  tax bill. A new one has come to light in examining these 1,100 pages,  and that is with regard to Puerto Rico and what it does to Puerto Rico.   It ought to be enough that $1.5 trillion is borrowed in order to  finance a huge tax cut for multinational corporations, with incentives  to send American jobs overseas. That ought to be enough, and it ought  to be enough that compared to that, there are just crumbs for the hard- working, middle-class families, but there is more.   In this tax bill, indeed, CBO has said that 13 million people will  lose health insurance as a result of something that was done to the  Affordable Care Act.   Now, if all of that were not enough, and if you care about the people  on the island of Puerto Rico who are reeling from two storms that hit  them--a good part of the island still doesn't have electricity and  still does not have potable water--and who were already in economic  straits to begin with and wanting to keep jobs on the island so people  don't have to flee--lo and behold, in the tax bill, what is given to  American mainlanders is an increase in the child tax credit from $1,000  to $2,000 per child and making that refundable for low-income people up  to $1,400 per child--that increase to help poor, working families with  children was not given to Puerto Rico.   That doesn't make sense, and it is just another reason why we should  vote against the tax bill.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
