 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Minnesota for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the combined rule and to  the underlying measures, including H.R. 842, the PRO Act.   We find ourselves today, Madam Speaker, at a time when businesses are  struggling just to stay afloat, and in many States, unemployment  numbers remain high. The last thing Congress should be doing at a time  like this is making it harder for workers to find good employment.   But that is just what the PRO Act would do. It cuts the opportunity  for employers to make decisions based on what is right for their  businesses, takes away the freedom of choice for workers who want to  keep more of their paychecks, and makes it impossible for entrepreneurs  to operate as independent contractors.   Proponents of this bill don't want you to know that the so-called ABC  test, based off a flawed California State law and used in this bill to  define employment, would essentially abolish independent contracting  and upend the gig economy.   There is a reason that in the last few decades 27 States, including  my home State of Oklahoma, have passed right-to-work laws. We the  people want freedom in the marketplace, not a bill that does the  bidding for union bosses. I implore my colleagues to oppose this bill  and instead focus on solutions that make it easier for Americans to  find good jobs in the economy.
