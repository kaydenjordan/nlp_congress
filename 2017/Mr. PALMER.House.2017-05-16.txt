 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Ratcliffe and the  committee for their work on this bill.   The internet is an ever-increasing medium for criminals to carry out  crimes, such as sex trafficking, credit card theft, and identity theft.  We are currently witnessing an unprecedented global cyber attack.  Attacks such as this threaten our economy and our national security.  This highlights the need for law enforcement to be trained at local,  State, and national levels to recognize and combat this activity.   Prior to 2008, training for State and local law enforcement and  cybercrimes was difficult to find. Recognizing this problem in 2007,  the State of Alabama offered the Secret Service and the Department of  Homeland Security property and funds to construct a state-of-the-art  facility if the Federal Government would fund the training and allow  the Secret Service to operate it. I am proud to say this facility is  located in my district in the city of Hoover.   The National Computer Forensics Institute, NCFI, opened its doors in  May of 2008. State and local law enforcement officers come from all  across the Nation to be trained at this one-of-a-kind facility, where  they are trained by Secret Service agents on the same equipment and  same software that our Secret Service agents use.   NCFI has trained law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges  from all 50 States, and its graduates represent over 500 agencies. They  are not only trained in solving crimes but also in prosecution.   I am pleased that the work that NCFI does is being recognized, and I  am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1616. I urge my colleagues  to support it.
