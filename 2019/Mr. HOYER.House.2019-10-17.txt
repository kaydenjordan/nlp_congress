 Mr. Speaker, I have the sad task of announcing what  probably most of you already know. We have lost a great American, a  decent American, a wonderful Member of this body, Elijah Cummings, who  died early this morning of illnesses he had been suffering from for a  significant period of time.   Members of the House, the people of Maryland, and the people of the  United States of America woke up to this sad and shocking news that we  had lost this dear friend, a devoted public servant, and a dedicated  patriot, who reflected courtesy and respect for all.   At a time of confrontation, disagreement, anger, and, yes, sometimes  hate, he was a beacon of civility, of fairness, and of justice. He was  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. He passed away too  early at 68 years of age.   All of us who served with him knew his passion for justice; his sharp  intellect, having graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University,  where he was president of the student government association; his wit;  and his devotion to the cause of making government work for the people.   It will be surely said of Elijah that he worked hard until the very  end. He was on a telephone call with all of us on Sunday talking about  how we ought to proceed with the heavy duties that confronted him, his  committee, and the Congress.   He never wavered in his dedication to the causes he made the  hallmarks of his career, even in recent days when, as I said, his  health was waning.   Those causes were equality and opportunity for all, the son of a  sharecropper who rose to be a great leader in this country. He was  concerned about voting rights, civil rights, alleviating poverty,  establishing justice, and ensuring that those entrusted with high  office are held accountable and carry out their responsibilities  lawfully and ethically.   Elijah Cummings was, of course, a true son of Baltimore, a city of  grit and hope, a city of dreams and hard work. He was loved in the city  of Baltimore. At a time of great distress in the city of Baltimore, it  was Elijah Cummings in the streets bringing calm and peace to that  city.   His life will forever be an example to all of us of striving to  better one's community and one's country, a passion and service to  one's fellow man and woman, and a perseverance in the face of adversity  while in pursuit of making this country and the world a better place.   Whenever he believed we were falling short of the vision of our  Founders--and many of you will hear this resonate in your ears--he  would say to all of us in a loving way, as he said throughout our State  at a time of trouble and difference: ``We are better than this.''   As we see conflict, as we see people disparaging one another, we want  to think to ourselves, ``we are better than this,'' and think of Elijah  Cummings, a man of great faith, of great humility, of great humanity,  and of great service.   We will miss Elijah Cummings. We are a lesser place for losing him.  Like the prophet for whom he was named, he was taken from us too young,  too soon, too suddenly. We can say, with Shakespeare: He should have  died hereafter. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.   Elijah will not have those tomorrows, and we will not have them with  him. We will miss him dearly.   My thoughts are with his wife, Maya, and his three children.   I offer my condolences to the people of Maryland's Seventh  Congressional District, who loved their Congressman. They had  confidence in their Congressman, and they knew that he was, in fact,  better, and they were better for his service.   May God bless Elijah Cummings, his family, all of us, and this great  country.                            ____________________     Today, Mr. Speaker, is a sad day. It is a sad day for us;  it is a sad day for this institution; and it is a sad day for America.  We have lost a wonderful human being, a good and decent human being, a  human being who made a difference for this institution, for all of us  who knew him and were his friend, for his constituents, and for all  Americans. All of us in this House lost a respected colleague. Many of  us lost a dear, longtime, and good friend.   He came in 1996 to this body, and every time I ran for a leadership  position, my friend Elijah Cummings nominated me. The passing this  morning of Chairman Elijah Cummings of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform was a painful shock to all who have served with him, more, of  course, to his family, Dr. Rockeymoore Cummings, his wife, and his  three children.   Elijah was a prophet of God whose name means ``my God is the Lord.''  Elijah Cummings was true to his name.   He was a leader for our country and for our State of Maryland, and we  have the Members, including our favorite daughter. He was a leader for  our State. He was a leader, like our brother   John Lewis, for  principle, for comity, and for civility.   He was a quiet man who did not seek the limelight, but he was not  afraid to step out into the arena and fight hard for the causes in  which he believed strongly. As all of us know, those causes were  justice, equality, opportunity, civil rights, education, and children.  He liked to say that children are the message we send to a future that  we will never see. His parents sent Elijah into the future, and how  much better the future was.   He was beloved by his constituents, both those in the city of  Baltimore and those in its suburbs. Indeed, Elijah was probably better  loved in my district than I am. Most of my colleagues will understand  that, of course.   He worked hard, even in his final days. The Speaker is going to  speak, and I am sure she will say something about the telephone call  she had with him just days ago, doing the people's business. As his  health faltered, his passion for his work did not.   In the days ahead, we will have many opportunities, of course, to  speak about our friend, Elijah, about his passion for service, his many  contributions to Maryland and our Nation, and his deep convictions as a  moral leader and a man of decency and love for his neighbor.   Some of you recall Elijah at the time of great distress in  Baltimore--anger, outbursts. Elijah walked among them as a man of peace  and, like no other person in our State, brought peace where there was  no peace. We will have opportunities to remember that. And we have a  chance to reflect on the love he had for his wife, Maya, and his three  children.   Today, in remembering Elijah Cummings, we have a chance to promote  the vision he held of the people's House coming together in a spirit of  unity and purpose. Sadly, today, that purpose is to mourn his passing  and remember a dear friend who will no longer be with us as we continue  his work to which he gave his all. But, hopefully, his example will be  with us.   Elijah used to say, when he saw conflict and confrontation, when he  saw things he thought were not up to the standards we had set for our  country and for ourselves because of our faith, our Constitution, and  our Declaration, he would say, ``We are better than that.''   As we human beings do things, from time to time, that are not kind to  one another, not thoughtful, and not respectful to one another, let us  say to ourselves: We are better than that. That is what Elijah said to  himself.   Mr. Speaker, in that spirit of unity, I will be yielding shortly to  the Republican leader to share his reflections. But first, as I  referred to her as Maryland's favorite daughter, I am honored to yield  to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi D'Alesandro. Now she would  say Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi. I understand that. We are so proud of our  Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), Speaker of the House, for her remarks.   I know Elijah felt very strongly about her and his support of her and  her leadership and how proud he was that she was from the city of  Baltimore that he loved so greatly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy),  my friend, the minority leader, and another good friend of Elijah's.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, in that spirit, I will ask for a moment of silence. But  before I do that, let me mirror the remarks of the leader on the other  side of the aisle.   A moment of silence will not be enough to respect the life of Elijah  Cummings. What will be enough is we follow his example for a lifetime-- not for a moment, but for a lifetime--if we give one another the  respect that he would give to us, if we give one another the  consideration that the leader indicated that he gave to him.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we stand for a moment of silence and a  lifetime of following an example.    Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 635         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings, a       Representative from the State of Maryland.        Resolved, That a committee of such Members of the House as       the Speaker may designate, together with such Members of the       Senate as may be joined, be appointed to attend the funeral.        Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House be       authorized and directed to take such steps as may be       necessary for carrying out the provisions of these       resolutions and that the necessary expenses in connection       therewith be paid out of applicable accounts of the House.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), pursuant to House Resolution 635, the House adjourned until  tomorrow, Friday, October 18, 2019, at 9 a.m., as a further mark of  respect to the memory of the late Honorable Elijah E. Cummings.                            ____________________
