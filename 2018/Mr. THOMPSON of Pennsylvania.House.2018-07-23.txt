 Mr. Speaker, earlier today I met with  Christie Glick in my Bellefonte office. Christie is an Alzheimer's  ambassador in my district, and through the Alzheimer's Ambassador  Program, people like Christie work throughout the country to connect  with Members of Congress and share their personal experiences with  Alzheimer's disease.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States,  and it has reached crisis proportions. There is no effective treatment,  no means of prevention, and no method of slowing the progression of  this disease. Sadly, one in three seniors will die with the disease.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5  million Americans were living with Alzheimer's disease in the year  2013. That number is expected to almost triple to 14 million by the  year 2050.   Mr. Speaker, Alzheimer's not only has a devastating impact on those  who are diagnosed with the disease, but also their caregivers and loved  ones. My own mom, Mary Thompson, lived with Alzheimer's for 10 years  until it took her life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Christie and all of the Alzheimer's ambassadors  for the important work that they do to raise awareness about  Alzheimer's disease and to never stop searching for a cure.                            ____________________
