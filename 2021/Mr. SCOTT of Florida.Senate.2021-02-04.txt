 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 872,  and I ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, President Biden's proposed plan  of open borders and amnesty isn't about practical reforms; it is a  radical and dangerous subversion of law and order with no effort to  secure the border. We can and must do better.   To proceed is reckless and unfair to the American people, kills  American jobs, and prevents countless families from pursuing the  opportunity to chase their American dream. American innovation and our  unique culture are built on legal immigration.   I am from the great State of Florida. We love immigration in Florida,  but it has to be legal. We have to give law enforcement and Border  Patrol the resources they need to do their job, protect American  families, and stem the tide of the rampant and unyielding illegal  immigration we have seen for decades at the southern border.   This amendment ensures that all applicable U.S. Government agencies  enforce all immigration laws and provides $20 billion for border  security. I ask everyone to support this amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
