 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Corporal Chris Bryant, an  American hero who has served his country and community for the past 26  years.   In January of 1997, he left the Knox County Sheriff's Office to join  the Marine Corps. He graduated basic training as an infantry machine  gunner and was assigned to Kings Bay, Georgia, where he was stationed  to watch over the nuclear sub base.   In 2002, he returned to the Knox County Sheriff's Department. In  2004, he was assigned full time to the narcotics division along with  his K9 dog, Storm.   During his 12 years in the narcotics division, he has worked for the  FBI Drug Task Force and has been promoted to lieutenant. In 2023, he  enlisted in the Tennessee Army National Guard and is currently  attending military police training in Smyrna, Tennessee.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces like  Corporal Bryant, who have served and sacrificed for our freedom and  protected our communities.   It is my honor to recognize Corporal Chris Bryant as Tennessee's  Second District's April 2023 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
