 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and an honor to be  recognized to address you here on the floor of the House of  Representatives. I come here to the floor to address the circumstances  that are historic in the way they are shaking the very foundation of  this Republic.   Our Constitution is under threat, and our Republic is under threat.  There are secret meetings taking place down in the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence, the most confidential place in this  place, but they are talking about finding a way to impeach the  President of the United States.   They don't have a charge yet. They are still looking for one. We went  through 2 years of the Mueller investigations, and now we are grinding  through this under the guidance of Adam Schiff, who has a resolution  here that has been presented to this floor to censure him for the  misinformation that came out clearly in front of all the public.   They are cherry-picking quotes from the people who are testifying.  They refused to allow us, just an hour ago, to go in and even read the  Volker transcript. They are allowing no exculpatory evidence that is  coming in that might defend our President. There is no representation  for the President. They have turned this committee into a partisan  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I will submit that it is going to be awfully hard for  this select committee to ever function again if it is going to be a  partisan, secret committee attempting to overturn the election of the  President of the United States.                            ____________________
