 Madam Speaker, in June, we celebrate Pride  Month, a time to not only uplift members of our LGBTQ+ community and  honor those who have fought for LGBTQ+ rights and equality but also to  recommit ourselves to ensuring and advancing those rights.   Last week, President Biden signed an executive order to build on the  historic progress his administration has made for LGBTQ+ people. I am  thrilled that with this executive order, President Biden will address  discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQ+ people, prevent  harmful conversion therapy, safeguard healthcare and mental health  programs, support LGBTQ+ foster youth, prevent homelessness, and  improve connections to the Federal programs that keep LGBTQ+ people  safe and healthy.   No one should face discrimination because of who they are. Rising  hate and violence against the LGBTQ+ community is unacceptable. I will  continue working to ensure our LGBTQ+ Americans are protected.                            ____________________
