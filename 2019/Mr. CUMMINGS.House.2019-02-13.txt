 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as  National Children's Dental Health Month and to raise awareness around  the critically important issue of access to quality dental care for our  Nation's children.   The most prevalent chronic infectious disease among children in the  United States is tooth decay. This disease is responsible for countless  health problems in children and more than 51 million hours lost at  school every year.   However, this disease is preventable with basic dental care. Sadly,  even with improvements in recent years, too many children are not able  to access the quality dental care they need to simply stay healthy.   I have a long history of advocating for increased access to dental  care for all, particularly our Nation's young people. I have often said  that our children are the living messengers we send to a future we will  never see. That means that we must do everything in our power to ensure  that they are healthy and given every opportunity to succeed.   Today, I also rise to share the story of a young Maryland boy named  Deamonte Driver. He died because of a lack of access to basic dental  care.   In February of 2007, 12-year-old Deamonte Driver came home from  school with a simple headache, which had started as a toothache. His  mother worked hard to make ends meet with all kinds of low-paying jobs.  She searched for a dentist who would accept Medicaid for her children,  but she found no dentist who would care for children's teeth.   Deamonte's mother took him to the emergency room, where he received  medication for pain, a sinus infection, and a dental abscess.  Unfortunately, that was not enough. The bacteria from Deamonte's cavity  spread to his brain, and, at 12 years old, Deamonte Driver died--12  years old. Deamonte could be alive today if it were not for the lack of  a simple procedure and the early removal of one tooth.   Deamonte's story is one we must never, ever forget. We must imprint  it in the DNA of every cell of our brains.  [[Page H1531]]    Fortunately, we have made great strides in access to dental care,  particularly for children, since Deamonte's death in 2007. Passage of  the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and the  Affordable Care Act have filled the gaps in dental care for children  who are eligible for these programs. This has given many children  across this great Nation access to dental care and many families  greater peace of mind regarding their children's health.    Maryland has also made significant progress in access to dental  healthcare over the last several years and now stands as a national  model thanks, sadly, to Deamonte Driver.   Through the work of many groups and organizations, more Maryland  children are visiting a dentist, and dental health is a priority in our  great State. In 2017, almost 70 percent of the Maryland children  enrolled in Medicaid received at least one dental care service.   The Maryland Department of Health also funds specific programs, such  as the Oral Disease and Injury Prevention Program and the Dental  Sealants Program, that cares for and educates thousands of children,  including right there at the schools.   Yet, even with these improvements in access to education, there is  more that must be done to protect dental health in honor of that little  boy, Deamonte Driver. That is why I am proud to rise in support of  dental care during Children's Dental Health Month and encourage  everyone to take advantage of oral health education, screenings,  preventive care, and restorative services in their community.   It is also why I plan to reintroduce my Comprehensive Dental Reform  Act this Congress, which, among other things, would provide  comprehensive dental coverage to all Medicare, Medicaid, and VA  beneficiaries and make dental care an essential health benefit for  adults under the Affordable Care Act.   Dental services must no longer be thought of as an optional health  benefit for children or adults.                            ____________________
