 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CARES  Act.   Families and businesses across America and Arizona are struggling,  and healthcare workers and first responders are being asked to perform  their important work without proper protective gear.   In my district, the Navajo Nation is dealing with a  disproportionately high amount of COVID-19 cases. There were 71  confirmed cases in the community as of last night. This bill allocates  over $1 billion to the Indian healthcare service and to Tribal  healthcare providers and over $400 million to Tribal governments for  equipment.   I urge my fellow colleagues to vote for this legislative package that  will provide relief to struggling American families and ensure the  Tribal communities are not overlooked.   There is no excuse for our healthcare professionals to not be  protected and our first responders.
