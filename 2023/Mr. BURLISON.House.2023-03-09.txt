 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Graves for his amazing  leadership on this important topic.   The arrogance of liberal bureaucrats knows no bounds. When we think  that they cannot go any further, they decide that they can regulate the  rain that falls from the sky.   The waters of the U.S. regulation will cost our citizens, especially  farmers in my State of Missouri, who, on average, own 300 acres, which  is mostly small farms, it will saddle them with red tape.   Of course, we know why the Biden administration is imposing this on  our citizens and our farmers. The administration is not at all  interested in helping the average American farmer or supporting them.  They are more interested in appealing to the radical environmentalists  that want to control our lives.   Farmers have been hit hard with fuel costs, fertilizer costs, and  supply chain challenges recently. The last thing they need is this. The  EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers should rescind this rule and leave  our farmers alone.   Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this resolution, I fully support it  and urge my colleagues to pass it.
