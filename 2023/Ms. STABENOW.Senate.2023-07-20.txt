 Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator  Blumenthal for his comments.   I thank Senator Klobuchar, who has been dogged on this issue of  Afghan refugees, and I thank her for her leadership on this.   I want to thank Senator Lee, who is allowing me to take a moment in  the middle of a very important issue that we are still discussing  today. I thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to take a moment of  personal privilege to speak about someone who has been with me for a  long time but who is moving on to other opportunities; and I appreciate  his family and friends in the Galleries who want to have an opportunity  to salute him.                         Tribute to Matthew Williams    Mr. President, I have a phenomenal member of my staff who has been a  critical part of my team for a long time, Matthew Williams. We are  excited for his new opportunities, but we are still not sure we are  going to let him go because he has been so incredibly important to my  success over a lot of years.   All the way back to 2006, as a recent graduate of the University of  Michigan, he joined my Senate campaign as a press assistant. Matthew  Williams did such a great job that I hired him as a staff assistant in  my East Lansing office. Over the next 17 years, Matt took on so many  different roles and did each one of them so successfully--from press  assistant to press secretary to my regional manager in Detroit to  deputy communications director to now my staff director of the Senate  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. He is the best  communications director on Capitol Hill, for sure. He has been a part  of my team for so long that the last time, I think, Matt quit a job was  when he was in college--at Joe's Crab Shack.   His time with me has taken him from Michigan to DC, back to Michigan,  and now back to DC. Along the way, he married Amber, his wonderful  wife, and they have since added two wonderful boys to their family, Max  and Ben. I think Max is with us today. When Matt is not in the office,  there is a pretty good chance he is at a school event or at a Little  League game.   Over the years, he has spoken with a lot of reporters, has planned a  lot of press conferences, has taken a lot of my calls, and has never  passed up the opportunity to remind me which Michigan university he  thinks is better. He is wrong, of course. I think the Presiding Officer  actually would agree with Matt on this, but he is wrong. Yet he has  been right on so many things over the years that I have been able to  overlook his love for all things Wolverine.   One of the first things you will notice about Matt is his positivity,  his good-natured smile, and his wonderful sense of humor. It is partly  what makes him such a great leader. He is also a great team player who  is unfailingly levelheaded and reasonable. It takes a lot to get Matt  Williams flustered. He is also incredibly knowledgeable about our State  and the people who live there, about our 10 media markets and, if we  are going to be honest, about the best places to golf.   Matt has also done a wonderful job as the staff director of the  Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee for our caucus.  All of us are very, very grateful.   Under his leadership, we have modernized the committee services,  including launching the first-ever DPCC FloorWatch app, and we have  strengthened the ``C'' in DPCC by working with the caucus to amplify  our accomplishments and to highlight policy differences between the two  parties.   Matt is from Flint. So, to him, I know the Flint water crisis was  personal. He fought by my side to do everything we could to make things  right for the people of Flint--the families and the community.   Some of my fondest memories with Matt are from our bipartisan 2019  codel to South Korea and Vietnam, organized by Senator Leahy. I will  never forget standing at the DMZ with Matt and taking pictures with  North Korean soldiers while they were taking pictures of us. Matt was a  wonderful travel partner, and I was really honored to be with him as he  experienced the country where he was born.   Matt, thank you so much for your 17 years of hard work, your  wonderful talent, and your dedication to Michigan and our country. We  are all going to miss your optimism and your smiling face around the  office, and I know that folks are going to miss your candy  [[Page S3448]]  bowl. You will always be a part of Team Stabenow and a part of my  extended family, for sure. I wish you and Amber and the boys every  happiness and success always.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
