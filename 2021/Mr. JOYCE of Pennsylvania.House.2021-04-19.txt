 Madam Speaker, as the son of a civil  engineer, I was raised with an understanding of the value of  infrastructure that serves people and benefits communities. My  commitment to infrastructure has spanned decades. As a young man, I put  shovel to the road for the construction of highways and bridges; and  now, today, I advocate for infrastructure improvements in Congress.   As we know all too well in rural Pennsylvania, infrastructure has  real-life consequences for communities. At its core, improving roads,  bridges, and other key infrastructure should be a commonsense,  bipartisan priority. Failing infrastructure does not discriminate. A  broken bridge can harm Democrats just as it can harm Republicans.   Unfortunately, the so-called infrastructure reform put forth by  President Biden fails to take seriously the challenges that we are  currently facing in Pennsylvania and around the entire country. In the  rural district that I represent, we know the importance of true  infrastructure. We need to make our roadways and bridges safer, we need  to improve our transportation systems, and we desperately need to  deploy reliable internet to those lacking access to broadband. This is  what true infrastructure is. But, unfortunately, that is not the Biden  plan.   Let's look at the facts. In President Biden's infrastructure plan,  less than 6 percent would go to roads and bridges; less than 2 percent  would go to waterways, locks, dams, ports, and airports; and less than  5 percent, unfortunately, would go to broadband.   With $600 billion devoted to the Green New Deal, this has never been  about infrastructure. In Pennsylvania, the extreme policies championed  in the Biden plan will crush our vital manufacturing and energy  industries. This plan prioritizes the progressive agenda over the needs  of the American workers and small businesses.   In the name of infrastructure, Democrats want to kill jobs, raise  taxes, burden families, and stunt our recovery from the COVID-19  pandemic.   Today, I ask a very simple question: Is it worth it?   As we seek to define infrastructure and consider improvements to our  Nation's fundamental infrastructure needs, I urge all of my colleagues  to dispense with the political games. We need roads, bridges, and  reliable internet. We do not need the Green New Deal. Stop calling this  infrastructure. Stop hiding progressive policies in trojan horses. Stop  trying to trick the American people.   While I stand ready to work with the President and House Democrats on  what is true infrastructure reform, this plan is further evidence that  the Biden-Harris administration are more happy to push their radical  agenda at the expense of hardworking Americans.   Instead of propelling these radical policies, this could be a good- faith opportunity to deliver results for the American people. If we  work together, we can get this job done. From deploying rural broadband  to sustaining our basic roads, we must bridge this divide.                            ____________________
