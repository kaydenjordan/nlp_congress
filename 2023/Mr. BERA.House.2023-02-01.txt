 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the first day of Black History  Month to recognize the importance of studying African-American history  and Black history in the United States.   It is incredibly important for us to recognize Black history and  teach it not only to our young students from elementary school to  middle school to high school, but to all Americans. We have to  understand the good and the bad. We have to understand the legacy of  slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration.   We need to understand--as I stand her on the floor of the House of  Representatives in the United States Capitol, a beacon of democracy and  freedom--that this is a building that was built by enslaved people. It  is important for us to understand that because we need to recognize  that and get better at teaching that to future generations of  Americans.   We also need to recognize the accomplishments of a few individuals:  the moral character of our former colleague, John Lewis, who really was  the moral backbone of this institution; the first President that I  served under, Barack Obama, the accomplishments, not just as President  but as a great human being, father, and husband; my close friend, the  first female Vice President, the first African-American Vice President,  the first Asian-American Vice President, Vice President Kamala Harris  who is a role model for my daughter and future women across the  spectrum in the United States; and our good friend, the minority leader  of the Democratic Party, Hakeem Jeffries, someone who we are all proud  of.    Let's understand African-American history. Let's teach it. Let's not  try to erase the parts that we don't want to teach. If we don't teach  Black history, we will be condemned to repeat some of those mistakes.  We need to learn from the past, and we need to get better. Let's teach  it to all of our students.                             Honoring Ken Cooley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Assemblyman Ken Cooley  for his decades of service to Sacramento County and the State of  California.   Ken served in the California State Assembly for 10 years representing  the Eighth Assembly District, which covered the eastern half of  Sacramento County.   Assemblyman Cooley started his public service career in Sacramento as  the chief of staff to the State assemblyman, and later as chief counsel  to the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee.   He was elected to the Rancho Cordova's first city council in 2002 and  twice served as mayor to Rancho Cordova. Ken was a constant presence  and continues to be a constant presence throughout our community.   I have had the privilege to go to many events with Ken, and he is a  close friend. He is an Eagle Scout, as well, and his commitment to  Scouting helped recognize youth achievement through the Boy Scouts of  America.   The City of Rancho Cordova and all of us in Sacramento County are  better off thanks to his hard work and determination, and I wish him  all the best in the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
