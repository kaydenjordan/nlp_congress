 Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification from my  colleague from California.   Mr. President, let me say what a privilege it is to have the  opportunity to make this speech in front of you, the fifth longest  serving Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate--somebody who has  been in the Senate for 46 years. I was 11 when you came to the U.S.  Senate, and I am not a young man anymore. I am 57 years old.    Somebody said: ``You are young.'' Only in the U.S. Senate  would that be true.   But I know the Presiding Officer, who is the chair of the important  Appropriations Committee, is retiring this year. I was sitting here as  I was getting ready to speak, thinking that you have seen it all, Mr.  President. You have seen it all.   Unlike almost anybody else in this Chamber, you have actually seen a  functioning U.S. Senate. You have seen the Senate where the floor was  filled with people having a debate; where filibusters actually had to  happen out in public, not in secret in a Senator's office; where people  were not spending 80 percent of their time in call rooms fundraising  instead of being out here on the floor doing the American people's  business, as Senators will see; that actually passed important pieces  of legislation that made a difference to the American people and made  our country more competitive, made us stronger. You are one of the last  people here who saw a Senate that worked like that.   The Republican leader has been here long enough to have seen a Senate  that worked like that.   You were here, I am sure--I know you were, Mr. President--in 2006  when you were passing the Voting Rights Act here with 98 votes. Ninety- eight to zero the Voting Rights Act passed in 2006.   The Republican leader of the Senate then, the senior Senator from  Kentucky, Senator McConnell, voted for that bill. It wasn't even close,  from his perspective. I have a number of quotes from him, but one was  ``The Voting Rights Act has proved to be a success for America'' and  has ``brought about greater justice for all.''   Amen, Leader McConnell, taking that principled position in 2006. It  was part of an honorable tradition that the Republican Party has had in  this country going back really to Abraham Lincoln and the votes that  were taken here to put Reconstruction in place, to fight the redeemers.  It was true in 1965 when they passed the Voting Rights Act by 77 to 19  on this floor. Lyndon Johnson could not have done that without Everett  Dirksen, a Republican, the Republican leader, who was for that.   As you know, I say to the Presiding Officer, because you saw it--you  probably were there--four Republican Presidents--Nixon, Ford, Reagan,  and George W. Bush--all signed versions of the Voting Rights Act. They  showed the country every time they did it that there is nothing  partisan about voting rights.   Senator McConnell said:         [O]ur country will and must continue its progress toward a       society in which every person, of every background, can       realize the American Dream. With the passage of the Voting       Rights Act, we are reaffirming that Dream.    He was right back then when he said that, but today, he is leading  the blockade.   There are 16 Republican Senators here who voted for the Voting Rights  Act back then in 2006, and today, they are all part of this blockade.  What has changed? What has changed?   One of the things that changed was the Supreme Court's decision in  the Shelby case that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act by getting rid  of preclearance for States that had historically discriminated against  African-American people, among others.   But do you know what is interesting about that, I say to the  Presiding Officer? The Supreme Court said in that decision that  Congress can fix this problem. We have a constitutional problem, but  Congress can fix this problem.   That is exactly the same thing they said, by the way, when they wrote  that horrendous decision in Citizens United. They said that Congress  can fix this problem. But they may not have detected the paralysis that  now exists--not in Pat Leahy's Senate from when the Presiding Officer  got here but in Mitch McConnell's Senate today, in the modern-day  Senate where people are willing to let a decision like Shelby  [[Page S298]]  just lie, not address it; where people are willing to accept a decision  like Citizens United that says that we are going to let billionaires  buy elections in this country instead of favoring people's right to  vote. And we, the Congress, won't do anything about it even when the  Supreme Court tells us we could do something about it.   I think it is worth quoting the Notorious RBG in her dissent in that  case, in the Shelby case, when she said that ``throwing out  preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop  discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a  rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   She was 100 percent right. State after State after State started to  adopt restrictive voting statutes.   Last July, the Supreme Court issued another opinion that makes it  harder to challenge State laws that disproportionately hurt certain  voters.   By the way, none of this could have come at a worst time because we  have a former President traversing the United States of America,  perpetrating the Big Lie that he didn't lose the election, that the  election was stolen from him, that Joe Biden is not the legitimate  President of the United States. There are politicians, I am sad to say,  elected leaders all over this Nation, who are parroting--including in  this Chamber--that Big Lie when they know that it is a lie, when they  know that it is false, who are unwilling, as Mitt Romney said, to  respect their own voters enough that they actually tell them the truth.   In every State except one--I say to Senator Leahy, it is your State,  Vermont--in every State except yours, people are introducing  legislation to take away the vote of other people. There are 500 such  bills.   Arizona has adopted changes that would purge up to 150,000 voters  from the rolls.   Montana has gotten rid of same-day voter registration to make it  harder for students.   Texas is down to one drop box per county. In Harris County, a  county--I am sorry to say to my friend Sheldon Whitehouse--that is  actually larger than Rhode Island, that means there is a drop box for  2.5 million voters.    I am glad to use Rhode Island as a unit of measure. It is  also smaller than a number of Colorado counties, but it has its charm.  It has its charm. It has water, which we don't have in the State of  Colorado.   But just let me say--because I am here with my colleague from  Colorado who, when he was Governor, did a lot to make sure that people  would have the right to vote in our State--in contrast to Houston,  where there is 1 drop box, in my hometown of Denver, where there are  500,000 registered voters, we have 40 drop boxes in Denver. We are a  lot smaller. We have 40 times the number of drop boxes that they have  in Houston.   After Georgia's Republican secretary of state refused to buckle to  President Trump's demand to find, somehow, another 11,000 votes--you  remember the phone call. I am not making it up. You heard it with your  own ears.   He called him up, and he said: Well, find 11,000 votes.   The guy said: No, I am not going to do that.   Now the legislature has removed him from the State election board.   So this isn't just about making it harder for people to vote,  although it is making it harder for people to vote; this is shoring up  the soft spots that prevented Donald Trump from being able to assert,  credibly, that somehow the election had been stolen from him.   So 1 year after January 6 happened--1 year after this Capitol was  invaded, 1 year after there was a guy in horns standing up on the top  of that Gallery behind me--the majority leader who once came to this  floor to proclaim the importance of the Voting Rights Act is saying  that this is all a ``fake panic.'' That is the language he used today.   Boy, given what we are seeing in this country, if we ever needed him  to summon the principle that he articulated or espoused in 2006, Mr.  President, when you were here, it is now. It is now. That is an  important principle to defend.   So he comes to the floor today and says: I am going to defend the  Senate. That is what I am here to do. I am here to defend the Senate.   Let me say something that might offend you, Mr. President. And I  don't mean to offend you, and I apologize if it offends you. But no one  in America knows what the cloture rule is. No one. No one in America.  My mom doesn't know what the cloture rule is, and she is a pretty close  watcher of the Senate. No one knows what the cloture rule is.   No one in America knows, I would assert, what the filibuster is. But  let me tell you what it is--not what it says; what it is. It is a rule  that was created to let 60 Senators cut off debate so 51 Senators could  make a decision that has been warped into a rule that allows 41  Senators to stop any debate and prevent the Senate from ever having a  vote.   That is what the cloture rule is. That is not what it says, but that  is what it is, which is why every time you turn your television set on  at home, you see a crawl at the bottom of your screen that says  ``Quorum Call,'' and you can't find a U.S. Senator anywhere because  they are probably back in a phone booth making fundraising phone calls.   Until this century, there was virtually not any filibuster used.   By the way, I should say how much I appreciate Senator Thune coming  to the floor here today and saying that President Trump lost the  election. I appreciate it. I really do. He is an honorable person.   But it is important to know that one place the filibuster does not  exist is in the U.S. Constitution. For most of the country's history,  we never had the filibuster. It was almost never used until the modern  era.   When I got here in President Obama's first term, the Republican  leader, Mitch McConnell, used the filibuster a record number of times.  He filibustered everything in his attempt to first make Barack Obama a  one-term President and then basically to bring down his Presidency.   He came out to the floor the other day and he said: ``Sometimes the  effect of the filibuster is to block bills outright.'' Sometimes?  Sometimes? It happens all the time. This is why we never do anything.  This is why we can't make decisions. This is why we can't even have  debates.   The American people have no idea whom to blame. They don't know  because no one in America knows what the cloture rule is. And when they  elect a majority and they expect things to get done, they don't get  done.   Senator McConnell argues that the filibuster ``gives all kinds of  citizens and all kinds of States a meaningful voice in nearly  everything we do.'' We have heard that over and over again today--the  voice that somehow we are shutting out.   I haven't met anybody who thinks that their voice is meaningfully  represented in the U.S. Senate instead of special interests or the most  powerful people--nobody--and it is because we can't have a debate on  anything they care about.   Take background checks. Eighty-four percent of voters, including 77  percent of Republicans, support them. We can't even have a debate on  the floor.   Let Medicare negotiate drug prices on behalf of people. Seventy-seven  percent of the American people support that. We can't even have a  debate here.   Seventy-four percent of people support the Dreamers--something  Senator Durbin has been working on for a million years since you have  been here?    And we can't get a vote on that.   The Freedom to Vote Act. Seventy percent of all voters, including 54  percent of Republicans, support it.   All of them have been blocked by Senator McConnell and his abuse of  the Senate rules--not some great, venerable tradition of the U.S.  Senate but his modern-day abuse, his caricature of the Senate rules.  And it has created a minority veto--something that the Founders of this  country would never ever in a million years have imagined that this  place would be perverted into. They knew the trouble that would cause  because they had had the Articles of Confederation, which is what they  were trying to replace at the Constitutional Convention.   I am coming to an end, so I apologize to colleagues. But let me just  say, none of this has stopped us from cutting  [[Page S299]]  taxes by $8 trillion, mostly for the wealthiest people in this country,  and none of this has stopped us from putting lots of rightwing judges  on the court when Donald Trump was here because you can do those things  with 51 votes. That is about the extent of Senator McConnell's  legislative agenda, so I am not surprised that he prefers the status  quo. But for the majority of Americans who believe that the next  generation actually demands something greater than that from the Senate  and from all of us, from each of us, we need a Senate that works.   Mr. President, think about this. Think about this. It is easy to  forget. The Clean Water Act of 1972 passed 74 to 0.   By the way, I worked with the Senator from Louisiana on that surprise  medical bill. I am proud of that bill, but it is not the Clean Water  Act of 1972.   The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 91 to 6; the children's  health insurance plan, 85 to 15 in 1997; comprehensive immigration  reform--we were part of that effort--68 votes in the Senate before it  completely collapsed into smithereens; and, of course, the  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Does anybody think--Mr.  President, do you think that any of those bills would pass with a  bipartisan majority like that today? Not a single one. We wouldn't even  get to the vote.   We are still on a temporary budget. I don't need to tell you, the  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, that we haven't passed any of  the 12 appropriations bills this year. We have taken three times as  long to confirm President Biden's nominees--103 days--compared to  President Reagan. This is no way to compete in the world, Mr.  President. This is no way to compete with the Chinese Government's  totalitarian approach to humanity.   I know we can compete, but we have to restore the Senate, and the  most basic part of our job is protecting the right to vote. That is why  we are here. Every American should be able to vote like we do in  Colorado, thanks to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Hickenlooper,  and what he did when he was Governor.   As Dr. King said, ``The history of our Nation is the history of a  long and tireless effort to broaden . . . the franchise of American  citizens.'' That is what this bill is about--to broaden the franchise  of American citizens.   If we look back at our history, this is only the latest example of  how the Senate has impeded American progress, and it wouldn't be the  first time that the Senate rules were changed in response to that.   Before the Civil War--a time even before you were in the Senate, Mr.  President--the Senate sheltered the minority interests of slaveholders  on this floor. After the war, it enabled monopolists and robber barons  and isolationists to profit from the misery of the conflict and its  aftermath.   Each time in our country's history, crises forced the Senate to  fundamentally change the way it worked, and each change has led to  meaningful progress, including clearing the way for the passage of the  14th and 15th Amendments to emancipate and enfranchise former slaves,  sweeping antitrust reforms, and long-delayed legislation to protect  civil rights.   The bottom line is that the Senate rules are not suspended in amber,  especially when they are being abused the way they are being abused  today. They can and they always have changed with the times.   Finally, let me say this: As we consider these reforms, the last  thing we should do is make another House of Representatives. That is  not what I want to do. I want to have a Senate where you have to come  out here and debate; where you can't filibuster in secret in your  office but you have to be out here to persuade the American people of  the righteousness of your cause; where the minority has the right to  offer amendments; and where, in the end, 51 Senators can actually make  a decision so that we can move this country forward and so that each  one of us, whether we are in the majority today or sometime in the  minority, can live under the rules that we have constructed to make the  Senate actually function for the American people.   That, Mr. President, I think is why most of us have been sent here,  and it is what I hope we are going to accomplish today. If we don't, we  have to keep fighting.   The Senator from Louisiana mentioned that this isn't 1965. Let me end  by saying this: The economic gap between White Americans and Black  Americans is as great today as it was in 1968. That is a brutal fact  about the state of our economy, and it is why we need a Senate that  actually can respond to the needs of the American people.   With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your patience and your  indulgence. I apologize that you are having to consume part of your  last year listening to a yearslong speech.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President.    Thank you, I appreciate that from the Senator from  Arkansas.   Just along the lines of what my colleagues have said, I would also  say that I want to be very clear that I don't want this place to turn  into the House of Representatives. I think that would be a huge  mistake. But it is not behaving the way that the Founders designed it  to behave.    And the history, admittedly, is opaque, but it is very clear to me  that the modern abuse of the filibuster represents very little in the  way of traditional Senate practice or what the Framers were  considering.   So I can imagine finding ourselves in a place where we actually have  extended debate, where we actually have a public filibuster like we  used to have--everybody remembers the movie version of that; they  actually did that on the floor of the Senate--versus the secret  filibuster that acts as a perpetual veto by the minority on the  majority, something that the Framers clearly were trying to avoid and,  at the same time, gives the minority the chance to hold the floor,  persuade the American people of their point of view, amend legislation  in ways that is unimaginable in the House and then, in the end, gives  the majority the chance to actually make a decision so we can  effectively compete with countries all over the world that aren't held  up by the kind of veto we are talking about.   There is not a legislative body in the world that I am aware of, in  any of the other countries with which we compete, that has a  filibuster.   So I would say that other piece of this, the idea that we are going  to seesaw back and forth and back and forth and back and forth--I think  the reality is that is not the reality of what happens in other places  that don't have the filibuster. And I believe we have the opportunity,  if we are actually having a public debate--not sitting in our office or  off fundraising but, instead, having a public debate on the floor of  this Senate--that the American people can actually begin to hold people  here accountable again for their position on healthcare or guns or  whatever it is.   We don't ever get the chance to do that here because we never even  have a debate in the world's most deliberative body.   So if we have a disagreement tonight about the form of all this, my  hope is that, in the wake of this, if we are not successful, we  actually do the American people a favor by creating a set of rules that  actually will make this place work.   I have been here now for 12 years. It is hard to believe. I can tell  you, the Senate doesn't work. It can't get its basic business done,  much less make hard decisions. I think we can do better than that, and  I hope we will.
