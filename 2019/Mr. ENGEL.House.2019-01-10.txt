 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 115) to require the Department of State to establish a policy  regarding the use of location-tracking consumer devices by employees at  diplomatic and consular facilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 115         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Diplomats from       Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act''.       SEC. 2. SECURING UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR                     FACILITIES AGAINST CYBERSURVEILLANCE.         (a) Policy on Location-Tracking Consumer Devices.--Not       later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of State shall establish a policy on the       use of location-tracking consumer devices, including GPS-      enabled devices, at United States diplomatic and consular       facilities by United States Government employees,       contractors, locally employed staff, and members of other       agencies deployed to or stationed at such facilities.        (b) Security Briefing.--Existing and new employees at       United States diplomatic and consular facilities, including       contractors, locally employed staff, and members of other       agencies deployed to or stationed at such facilities, shall,       as a part of the security briefings provided to such       employees, be informed of the policy described in subsection       (a) and given instructions on the use of location-tracking       consumer devices both on and off the premises of such       facilities.        (c) Coordination.--The Secretary of State shall coordinate       with the heads of any other agencies whose employees are       deployed to or stationed at United States diplomatic and       consular facilities in the formulation of the policy       described in subsection (a) and the dissemination of such       policy pursuant to subsection (b).        (d) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the formulation       of the policy described in subsection (a), the Secretary of       State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate a report on the details of such       policy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 115, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I talk about the bill, I want to very briefly  acknowledge the fact that this is the first debate we have had with  bills in the Foreign Affairs Committee since the new Congress. I want  to welcome Mr. McCaul to the very important position--which I had for  the past 6 years--of ranking member. And I know that, as chairman, the  Foreign Affairs Committee for the past 6 years has had a record of  being the most bipartisan committee in the Congress. I hope and I know  that that will continue with this Congress, and that the respect that  all Members have shown each other will continue the tradition of the  Foreign Affairs Committee. I look forward to working with Mr. McCaul in  that regard.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 115, the Protecting Diplomats  from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act. I thank Mr. Castro for  introducing this legislation.   Before I get into the merits of this particular bill, which is  designed to protect diplomats from cyber snooping, I would be remiss if  I failed to express my deep concern that thousands of Department of  State employees and diplomats are furloughed without pay.                                time  1500    I am hearing stories of State Department officials struggling to make  ends meet, taking up side jobs and having garage sales to stay afloat.  By keeping America's diplomats away from their jobs, we are harming our  national security. We need to end this shutdown, and we need to end it  now.   Now, I will turn to the excellent bill before us today. This measure  aims to ensure the Department of State has policies in place to help  prevent our adversaries from tracking the locations  [[Page H430]]  of our foreign service officers through their electronic devices.   From Fitbits and smartwatches to phones and cars, most of us have at  least one tracking device with us at all times. Many of us would  literally be lost without these devices, but they pose security risks  as well.   This commonsense measure would make sure the Secretary of State has a  policy in place on using location tracking consumer devices at our  diplomatic and consular facilities around the world.   This is a good bill that passed the House unanimously in the last  Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage again today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that the Protecting  Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act is a  commonsense way to improve the safety of U.S. personnel overseas.   I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 133) to promote economic partnership and cooperation between the  United States and Mexico.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 133         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Mexico       Economic Partnership Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States and Mexico have benefitted from a       bilateral, mutually beneficial partnership focused on       advancing the economic interests of both countries.        (2) In 2013, Mexico adopted major energy reforms that       opened its energy sector to private investment, increasing       energy cooperation between Mexico and the United States and       opening new opportunities for United States energy       engagement.        (3) On January 18, 2018, the Principal Deputy Assistant       Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs at the       Department of State stated, ``Our exchange programs build       enduring relationships and networks to advance U.S. national       interests and foreign policy goals . . . The role of our       exchanges . . . in advancing U.S. national security and       economic interests enjoys broad bipartisan support from       Congress and other stakeholders, and provides a strong return       on investment.''.        (4) According to the Institute of International Education,       in the 2015-2016 academic year, more than 56,000 United       States students studied in other countries in the Western       Hemisphere region while more than 84,000 non-United States       students from the region studied in the United States, but       only 5,000 of those United States students studied  [[Page H431]]       in Mexico and only 16,000 of those non-United States students       were from Mexico.        (5) In March 2011, the United States launched the 100,000       Strong in the Americas Initiative, which seeks to increase       educational exchanges between the United States and other       countries in the Western Hemisphere region so that 100,000       United States students are studying in other countries in the       Western Hemisphere region and 100,000 non-United States       students from the region are studying in the United States       per year by 2020.        (6) In January 2014, the United States established the       100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund, which seeks       to realize the goals of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas       Initiative by facilitating a public-private partnership       between the Department of State and nongovernmental       organizations, corporations, and universities in the United       States and other countries of the Western Hemisphere region.        (7) To date, the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation       Fund has awarded more than 100 grants to more than 250 higher       education institutions from 25 countries in the Western       Hemisphere region, and has raised $9,000,000 in investments,       75 percent of which was from corporations, foundations, and       regional governments.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to continue deepening economic cooperation between the       United States and Mexico; and        (2) to seek to prioritize and expand educational and       professional exchange programs with Mexico, including through       the framework of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas       Initiative.       SEC. 4. STRATEGY TO PRIORITIZE AND EXPAND EDUCATIONAL AND                     PROFESSIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH MEXICO.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State shall develop a       strategy to carry out the policy described in section 3, to       include prioritizing and expanding educational and       professional exchange programs with Mexico through the       framework of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative.        (b) Elements.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall--        (1) encourage more academic exchanges between the United       States and Mexico at the secondary, post-secondary, and post-      graduate levels, especially with communities and through       academic institutions in the covered United States-Mexico       border region;        (2) encourage United States and Mexican academic       institutions and businesses to collaborate to assist       prospective and developing entrepreneurs in strengthening       their business skills and promoting cooperation and joint       business initiatives across the United States and Mexico,       with a focus on initiatives in the covered United States-      Mexico border region;        (3) promote energy infrastructure coordination and       cooperation through support of vocational-level education,       internships, and exchanges between the United States and       Mexico, particularly in the region in which the Eagle Ford       Shale is located and in proximity to such region; and        (4) assess the feasibility of fostering partnerships       between universities in the United States and medical school       and nursing programs in Mexico to ensure that medical school       and nursing programs in Mexico have comparable accreditation       standards as medical school and nursing programs in the       United States by the Accreditation and Standards in Foreign       Medical Education, in addition to the Accreditation       Commission For Education in Nursing, so that medical students       can pass medical licensing board exams, and nursing students       can pass nursing licensing exams, in the United States.        (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       Congress a report on the strategy required under subsection       (a).       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) 100,000 strong in the americas initiative.--The term       ``100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative'' means the       initiative established in March 2011 by the United States       Government to increase educational exchanges in the Western       Hemisphere.        (2) Covered united states-mexico border region.--The term       ``covered United States-Mexico border region'' means those       portions of the United States and Mexico that are within 100       kilometers of the international boundary between those       countries.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 133, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this measure. I thank Representative Cuellar for  introducing this measure, and I will discuss its merits in a moment.   But I can't stand in good conscience on the House floor to talk about  our economic partnership with Mexico and not speak for a moment on what  is happening right now on our southern border.   The government is currently shut down, with thousands of workers  furloughed and prevented from doing their jobs. This is something that  should be ameliorated quickly. Government should open.   The measure before us today deals with the incredibly important  relationship with our neighbor to the south, Mexico. Mexico is our  close friend and ally and a country with which we have extraordinarily  close cultural and person-to-person ties.   This bill builds on the Obama administration's 100,000 Strong in the  Americas initiative by requiring the Secretary of State to expand the  exchange programs and allow our students and business leaders to share  and learn from each other.   It is also crucial that we send a strong message to the Mexican  people that the United States Congress will not walk away from them  despite the damage done to the relationship.   As I have said many times in the House Foreign Affairs Committee and  on the House floor, the United States should be in the business of  building bridges, not walls, to our friends in Mexico.   By passing this measure today, the House of Representatives is  recommitting itself to our bilateral relationship. I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to close by again emphasizing the  importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship.  [[Page H432]]    Twenty years ago, it would have been hard to imagine coming to the  House floor in support of a bipartisan bill on educational exchanges  with Mexico. Now, a bill like this will glide through the House with  little, if any, opposition, just as it did last year. But we cannot  take cooperation for granted. We have to keep on working with Mexico to  improve our relationship.   I thank my colleagues for supporting me and joining me in supporting  this legislation to double down on the successes in the U.S.-Mexico  partnership, and I urge its immediate passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 192) to establish an interagency program to assist countries in  North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities  to counter terrorist threats, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 192         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trans-Sahara       Counterterrorism Partnership Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership, launched       in 2005, is an interagency program to assist partner       countries in the Sahel and Maghreb regions of Africa on their       immediate and long-term capabilities to address terrorist       threats and prevent the spread of violent extremism;        (2) armed groups and violent Islamist terrorist       organizations, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko       Haram, the Islamic State of West Africa, and other affiliated       groups, have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians,       displaced populations, destabilized local and national       governments, and caused mass human suffering in the affected       communities;        (3) it is in the national security interest of the United       States to combat the spread of radical Islamist extremism and       build partner countries' capacity to combat these threats in       Africa;        (4) extremist movements exploit vulnerable and marginalized       communities suffering from poverty, lack of economic       opportunity (particularly among youth populations), and weak       governance; and        (5) to address critical security, political, economic, and       humanitarian challenges in these regions of Africa, a       coordinated, interagency approach is needed to appropriately       allocate resources, share responsibility, de-conflict       programs, and maximize the effectiveness of United States       defense, diplomatic, and development capabilities.       SEC. 3. TRANS-SAHARA COUNTERTERRORISM PARTNERSHIP.         (a) Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership.--        (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in consultation       with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development, shall       establish a partnership, to be known as the ``Trans-Sahara       Counterterrorism Partnership'' (TSCTP), to coordinate all       United States programs, projects, and activities in North and       West Africa that are conducted for any of the following       purposes:        (A) To build the capacity of foreign military and law       enforcement entities in such regions to conduct       counterterrorism operations.        (B) To improve the ability of foreign military and law       enforcement entities in such regions to cooperate with the       United States and other partner countries on counterterrorism       efforts.        (C) To enhance the border security capacity of partner       countries in such regions, including the ability to monitor,       restrain, and interdict terrorists.        (D) To strengthen the rule of law in such countries,       including access to justice, and the ability of the law       enforcement entities of such partner countries to detect,       disrupt, respond to, investigate, and prosecute terrorist       activity.        (E) To monitor and counter the financing of terrorism.        (F) To further reduce any vulnerabilities among affected       populations in such regions to recruitment or incitement of       terrorist activities through public diplomacy efforts, such       as supporting youth employment, promoting meaningful       participation of women, strengthening local governance and       civil society capacity, and improving access to economic       opportunities and education.        (G) To support independent, local-language media,       particularly in rural areas, to counter media operations and       recruitment propaganda by terrorist organizations.        (2) Consultation.--In coordinating programs through the       TSCTP, the Secretary of State shall also consult, as       appropriate, with the Director of National Intelligence, the       Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Chief       Executive Officer of the United States Agency for Global       Media (formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of       Governors), and the heads of other relevant Federal       departments and agencies.        (3) Congressional notification.--Not later than 15 days       before obligating amounts for an activity coordinated by the       TSCTP pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall       submit a notification, in accordance with the requirements of       section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.       2394-1), that includes the following:        (A) The foreign country and entity, as applicable, whose       capabilities are to be enhanced in accordance with the       purposes specified in paragraph (1).        (B) The amount, type, and purpose of support to be       provided.        (C) An assessment of the capacity of the foreign country or       entity to absorb the assistance to be provided.        (D) The estimated cost and anticipated implementation       timeline for assistance.        (E) As applicable, a description of the arrangements to       sustain any equipment provided by the activity beyond the       completion date of such activity, if applicable, and the       estimated cost and source of funds to support such       sustainment.        (F) The amount, type, statutory authorization, and purpose       of any United States security assistance provided to such       foreign country during the three preceding fiscal years       pursuant to authorities under title 10, United States Code,       the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.),       or any other ``train and equip'' authorities of the       Department of Defense.        (b) Comprehensive Strategy for Counterterrorism Efforts.--        (1) Development.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, shall submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a comprehensive, interagency strategy that--        (A) states the objectives of the United States       counterterrorism effort in North and West Africa with respect       to the use of all forms of United States assistance to       counter violent extremism;        (B) includes a plan by the Secretary of State for the       manner in which programs shall be coordinated by the TSCTP       pursuant to subsection (a)(1), including which agency or       bureau of the Department of State, as applicable, will be       responsible for leading and coordinating each such program;       and        (C) outlines a plan to monitor and evaluate TSCTP programs       and identifies the key indicators that will be used to       measure performance and progress under the strategy.  [[Page H433]]         (2) Supporting material in annual budget request.--The       Secretary of State shall include, in the budget materials       submitted in support of the budget of the President       (submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31,       United States Code) for each fiscal year beginning after the       date of the enactment of this Act, a description of the       requirements, activities, and planned allocation of amounts       requested by the TSCTP.        (c) Monitoring and Evaluation of Programs and Activities.--        (1) Monitoring and evaluation.--The Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, shall monitor and evaluate the programs       coordinated by the TSCTP pursuant to subsection (a)(1) in       accordance with the plan outlined pursuant to subsection       (b)(1)(C).        (2) Report.--For the 5-year period beginning 180 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State       shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an       annual report on monitoring and evaluation efforts pursuant       to paragraph (1) that describes--        (A) the progress made in meeting the objectives listed in       the strategy required by subsection (b)(1), including any       lessons learned in carrying out TSCTP programs and activities       and any recommendations for improving such programs and       activities;        (B) the efforts taken to coordinate, de-conflict, and       streamline TSCTP programs to maximize resource effectiveness;        (C) the extent to which each partner country has       demonstrated the ability to absorb the equipment or training       provided in the year previous under TSCTP programs, and where       applicable, the ability to maintain and appropriately utilize       such equipment provided;        (D) the extent to which each partner country is investing       its own resources to advance the goals described in       subsection (a)(1) or demonstrated a commitment and       willingness to cooperate with the United States to advance       such goals; and        (E) the actions taken by the government of each partner       country receiving assistance through programs coordinated by       the TSCTP to combat corruption, improve transparency and       accountability, and promote other forms of good governance.        (d) Form.--The strategy required by subsection (b)(1) and       the report required by subsection (c)(2) shall be submitted       in unclassified form but may include a classified annex.        (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on       Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Appropriations, and the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on       Foreign Relations, the Committee on Appropriations, and the       Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 192, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this measure. I would like to begin by again  thanking Mr. McCaul for once again putting forward this legislation. I  look forward to working with him, as I mentioned before, as he begins  his role as the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   The bill before us today authorizes the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism  Partnership. This interagency program was established in 2005 to help  America's partners in the Sahel and Maghreb regions counter terrorism  and violent extremism.   In places where instability leads to terrorism and conflict, it is  important that we collaborate with our allies and that our policy is  driven by a united interagency effort. That is why this bill is so  important.   By coordinating our diplomatic, military, and development efforts in  our own government and with partners abroad, the Trans-Sahara  Counterterrorism Partnership strengthens our response to the  international security threats facing these regions of Africa.   Passing this legislation, which authorizes an existing program, will  also enhance the ability of Congress to conduct thorough oversight.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which already  passed the House last year, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again thank Mr. McCaul for his  work on this measure and state again that I look forward to working  side by side with him as chairman and ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee. This bill authorizes an important program that  strengthens our efforts to assist partners in the Sahel and Maghreb to  counter terrorism and violent extremism.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 221) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956  to monitor and combat anti-Semitism globally, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 221         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Special Envoy to Monitor and       Combat Anti-Semitism Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDING.         Congress finds that since the Global Anti-Semitism Review       Act of 2004 was enacted, in many foreign countries acts of       anti-Semitism have been frequent and wide in scope, the       perpetrators and variety of threats to Jewish communities and       their institutions have proliferated, and in some countries       anti-Semitic attacks have increased in frequency, scope,       violence, and deadliness.       SEC. 3. MONITORING AND COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM.         (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 59 of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2731) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in subparagraph (A)--        (i) by inserting before the period at the end the       following: ``, who shall be appointed by the President, by       and with the advice and consent of the Senate''; and        (ii) by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``The       Special Envoy shall report directly to the Secretary.''; and        (B) in subparagraph (B)--        (i) in the heading, by striking ``Appointment'' and       inserting ``Nomination'';        (ii) by striking the first sentence;        (iii) in the second sentence, by striking ``If the       Secretary determines that such is appropriate, the Secretary       may appoint'' and inserting ``If the President determines       that such is appropriate, the President may nominate''; and        (iv) in the third sentence, by striking ``The Secretary may       allow such officer or employee to retain the position (and       the responsibilities associated with such position) held by       such officer or employee prior to the appointment'' and       inserting ``Such officer or employee may not retain the       position (or the responsibilities associated with such       position) held by such officer or employee prior to the       nomination''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(3) Duties.--The Special Envoy shall serve as the primary       advisor to, and coordinate efforts across, the United States       Government relating to monitoring and combating anti-Semitism       and anti-Semitic incitement that occur in foreign countries.        ``(4) Rank and status of ambassador.--The Special Envoy       shall have the rank of ambassador.        ``(5) Qualifications.--The Special Envoy should be a person       of recognized distinction in the field of--        ``(A) combating anti-Semitism;        ``(B) religious freedom; or        ``(C) law enforcement.''.        (b) Nomination.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and not later than 120 after any       such position becomes vacant, the President shall nominate       the Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism       under section 59 of the State Department Basic Authorities       Act of 1956, as amended by subsection (a) of this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 221, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 221. I am a proud original  cosponsor of this bill, and I am pleased we are considering it today.  We passed it with bipartisan, unanimous support in the last Congress,  and I am looking forward to seeing us show that broad support again. In  this Congress, we must continue to stand against anti-Semitism.   I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this effort: Congressman  Chris Smith, the author of this legislation, and my fellow co-chairs of  the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. I am proud to  stand with a group of legislators committed to fighting intolerance and  hatred.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen a sickening increase in anti-Semitism over  the past few years. Just a few months ago, a gunman stormed a synagogue  in Pittsburgh, attacking peaceful congregants and killing 11 people. We  have seen people who embrace hatred and bigotry given a new, loud  megaphone to spread their poison. Across the United States, we have  seen an uptick in anti-Semitic language and an increase in threats of  violence against Jewish communities. In my home State of New York, NYPD  officials have reported an alarming surge of anti-Semitic hate crimes.   Every day, more and more alarming anti-Semitic incidents are  happening across the world: Holocaust survivors recently assaulted,  rallies and parades glorifying Nazi leaders, and swastikas graffitied  to incite fear and terror. The list goes on and on.   This is appalling, and it demands immediate action.   As a country, we need to come together to say enough is enough. We  need to confront evil, call it by its name, and say there is no place  for it anywhere in the United States or around the world. We need to do  it as citizens. We need to do so in our laws and in our policies. We  need to make sure that we fill the positions that are supposed to be  dealing with this issue. The Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism  position at the State Department is still vacant, and that is simply  unacceptable.  [[Page H435]]    We must have a senior official push back against intolerance and  hatred of anti-Semitism. American leadership is desperately needed in  the fight against this ancient form of hatred. I am sick and tired of  foot-dragging on filling this critical position.   That is why I am glad we are moving this bill forward. This  legislation would elevate the Special Envoy position and require the  President to put forward a nominee no more than 120 days after a  vacancy. This is essential for making sure that a prolonged vacancy  like we have right now never happens again. We must have a senior State  Department official dedicated to coordinating U.S. Government efforts  to combat anti-Semitism abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure. I ask my colleagues to  join me in doing so, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is the Democratic lead on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), one of my fellow co-chairs of a bipartisan task  force to combat anti-Semitism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend. She and I have districts that border  each other.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).   (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me say that I strongly support this bipartisan bill.  As all of my colleagues have said, we can never become complacent when  we see anti-Semitism rear its ugly head. We need to reject it. We need  to fight it. We need to shine a light in all the dark corners so it has  no place to hide and fester.   What does that look like when it comes to foreign policy?   It starts by appointing a senior diplomat, someone we can point to  with confidence and say, ``You are leading America's effort to grapple  with this problem around the world.''   This bill would make sure that that seat will not remain vacant the  way it has for the last 2 years. I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of this legislation. I am proud that we have such bipartisan support  for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
