 Mr. Speaker, I was saddened to hear of the passing  of Russ Jollivette, an important and revered leader in education,  health, and philanthropy, and someone who Dexter and I proudly called  our friend.   Cyrus, or Russ to those who knew him, sadly passed away on April 30,  leaving behind an incredible legacy of good works and major  achievements. Russ dedicated 24 years of his life to my alma mater, the  University of Miami, including raising significant funds for the UM  Sylvester Cancer Center and Hospital for diabetes research and for  environmental health sciences.   But Russ' impact went far beyond the University of Miami. He went on  to serve as senior vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of  Florida and served as the director of The Blue Foundation for a Healthy  Florida.   Truth be told, Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on, but the role for  which Russ will always be known for far and wide is friend. Russ  Jollivette cared so selflessly for so many in our south Florida  community and our State, and so many cared for him, including his  daughter, Lynn Jollivette Johns; his two sisters, Regina Jollivette  Frazier and Cleo Jollivette; as well as two grandchildren.   Farewell, my friend, Russ Jollivette.                            ____________________
