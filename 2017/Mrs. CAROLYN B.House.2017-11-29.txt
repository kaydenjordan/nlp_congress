 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend,  as Americans across this country were enjoying Thanksgiving with their  families, over 438 Americans were victims of gun violence.   So what is the response of the House Republican leadership?   Advancing the misguided Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act that would  eviscerate State laws meant to keep people safe from gun violence.   This bill being marked up today in the Judiciary Committee would put  lives at risk by forcing all States to recognize weapon permits from  other States, regardless of how lax State permitting laws may be.   House Republicans have no right to curtail the safety reforms that  New York and other States have put in place to protect their citizens.  That is why law enforcement organizations from across the country  strongly oppose this legislation. It should never come to the floor.   Americans deserve a better deal and more protection from gun  violence, not less.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to revise and extend her remarks.)                                time  1515     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Brady for his leadership; Chairman Harper for moving so swiftly  on this issue; and my colleague, Jackie Speier, who has selflessly  worked on this issue for many years, along with Barbara Comstock.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.   Too often, harassment is treated just like it is part of the job; and  if anyone complained, they were fired, punished, or paid off to be  silent. This is an important cultural change where harassment, which is  illegal, is treated seriously as a crime that needs to stop; and to  train staff, Members, and officers on how to know what is right and  what is wrong so that there is no misunderstanding.   This is a first step. I strongly support Congresswoman Speier's bill  that has a comprehensive approach, which bans the use of taxpayer money  to silence victims and to settle this.
