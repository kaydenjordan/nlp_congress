 Mr. President, I also rise to acknowledge my dear, dear  friend Doug, but I do it in a different vein. So many good things have  been said, and I think anyone who knows Doug or who has paid attention  to what has been said today had found it has been very accurate as far  as his having a commitment to the rule of law and his compassion for  any person, especially for those who haven't had the same opportunities  as all of us have had in life. That is what has moved us all. Yet I  have gotten to see him in a different light.   He and Louise invited me down. I got to campaign with them, and it  was all about Alabama. I got to go down and spend a couple of days.  That tells you of the true person. It not only tells you what he  believes and what he feels for the people of his State and how he  represents them, but it truly tells us what the people of his State  think of him. I saw it firsthand. I saw it at a football game. Now,  Nick Saban and I grew up together in a small, little coal mining  community.   I want you to know that Coach Saban and Terry, his wife, send their  best. They want to thank you for your service.   To see the fans gather around Doug and to see the happiness that he  and Louise had when we were just out, going through the tailgates, was  a wonderful, wonderful sight. That tells me everything about his  purpose for being here. I hope those in Alabama know how truly  fortunate they are to have this gentleman, who loves Alabama with every  fiber and bone in his body. He has given them everything he has and has  represented their State better than any State I have ever seen  represented with the true passion that he has.   I love you, buddy. Thank you
