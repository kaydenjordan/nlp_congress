 Mr. Speaker, in January 2020, the United States signed a  Phase 1 trade agreement with China in which China agreed to purchase at  least $80 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products through 2020 and  2021. In 2020, the U.S. exported over $27 billion worth of ag products  to China, including soybeans, corn, pork, and wheat.   America's farmers and ranchers were eager to get back to business  globally, and restoring our ability to be competitive in China was key  to that. Unfortunately, China has deflected on their part of the  agreement, thanks in part to President Biden's softness on the world  stage.   Now, President Biden is considering rolling back tariffs on cheap  Chinese-made import products. Let's be clear. Rolling back these  tariffs won't reduce inflation; it will only reward bad policy.   Instead, the Biden administration should be rolling back the  regulatory assault on American manufacturing and production to  encourage innovation here on U.S. soil, as well as moving forward on  energy production domestically.    In the meantime, China should start pulling their weight and import  the American products that they agreed to. Otherwise, why do we import  so much stuff from China?   We need to send the signal to China and others that we will not stand  for the predatory economic policies that we are enduring and that are  hurting American jobs and hurting the American economy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana again  for leading us here tonight and getting the message out to the American  people that this doesn't have to be this way. What we are going  through--what we are all going through--together, with the increased  costs and with shortages is unnecessary.   This isn't caused by nature with a hurricane or a tornado or a fire  or an earthquake or even a war, though some are trying to point to the  actions by Putin and Russia and Ukraine being responsible for  everything. This is a government-caused situation we are seeing with  inflation in fuel and energy. It doesn't have to be this way.   So what is really disheartening as a Representative of folks is that  we know our constituents, good people, are suffering from inflation. It  is impacting everyday Americans and northern Californians in my  district, everybody.   I have firsthand accounts from people in my district who are  struggling financially due to these rising prices and inflation.  Inflation is a tax on every American, as my colleagues have been  saying. And we are hoping people will hear.   Rural Americans are feeling additional financial struggles even more  so probably than the urban dwellers, but maybe it is the same. Maybe it  is just different.   Rural residents tend to drive more. They have to drive farther  distances to do what they do if they work on a ranch or live on a  ranch, a timber operation or a mining operation, or they just live out.  Maybe they are a park ranger. Maybe they take care of the parks. There  are many reasons why you would live in a rural part of the State of  California or any part of America, Madam Speaker.   That puts more mileage on your vehicle and uses more gas. You may  tend to have a four-wheel drive vehicle in those areas, Madam Speaker,  because you might have snow. There are other reasons that you might  have to have a vehicle that has a little more oomph, a little more  ability to get around than perhaps one in southern California. So it is  likely they are going to use a little more gasoline to go where they  need to go, and getting gasoline delivered to areas like that costs a  little more. It is a little higher.   In my northern California district it is not uncommon to see $6 on  the sign for diesel or even premium gasoline--$6. It is routinely $6  for diesel. A lot of people drive diesel vehicles.   They have less retail options nearby. Their stores ship from farther  distances, so the trucks that brought it--``if you got it, a truck  brought it'' is the saying--have to ship it farther to get there. So  that store might need to  [[Page H7244]]  have just a little higher price to cover shipment. So further shipping,  all these things just add up, especially for rural residents, on that.  But they have a reason why they are rural residents, and we need them  to be for producing what they produce in rural areas that we all use.   So a couple of residents in northern California, I would like to  share what their issue is and what their struggle is.   The first story is about an elderly woman from Redding in northern  California, which is one of the large cities in my district. She has  had a tough life and grew up in an abusive household. She is very smart  and very artistically talented, actually. But as she aged she began  dealing with mental illness and confided she has begun to think of  death as an alternative to her struggling. What a cheery situation for  her.   After her mental health struggles became too much, it forced her out  of the workforce. She began living on a fixed income of $900 a month.  With $900--money is already tight--and she has had even more setbacks.  Now, like most people, she has a family pet. She has a dog. Well, that  dog happened to get sick, like it happens, and the bill for that was  $500.   Where is she going to get $500 on a $900 monthly income?   Maybe she can spread it out over time if the veterinarian works with  her. So she ended up having to sell her truck for $180 because she  could no longer afford the gasoline and needed the money to pay  utilities and other bills. Recently she ran out of food completely and  went without food for several days. Even the local food bank--God bless  them, they are doing really good work and they are becoming even more  stretched and more tapped--the food bank had run out.   She ended up calling a friend who bought some groceries for her. She  said that the cost of everything is so expensive now that even cutting  out spending any personal money on personal things or elective things  or maybe luxuries by having maybe a little meat on your plate, she is  still unable to pay her bills.   She doesn't have cable or TV. She listens to the free books on tape  from the Library of Congress. She said that she holds President Biden  directly responsible for what is happening, the President and the  policies of the majority here in Congress and even in Sacramento, in my  home State of California. She does hope that President Biden can hear  how the economy doesn't work for low-income people.   I think she understands that trillions and trillions of dollars of  debt, and spending money you don't have and printing more money-- inflation-causing money--isn't going to get her out of it either. We  have to have an economy that works for normal people, productive  people, and so folks like her can be helped.   Even after all this, though, you have to admire her. She said she  considers herself lucky because she still has a roof over her head.   Another story in a different sector is about a family who lives just  south of the Oregon border in what is known as the Klamath Basin, the  Klamath River area. There are a lot of farmers up there. There are  issues with the dams that are in place that help make low-cost  hydroelectric power.   So one day after the public comment period closed on the Klamath Dam  destruction that is being put in place with the help of the Federal  Government and a lot of lawsuits--this was in April--the family  patriarch suffered a stroke and was found by his children unconscious  and unresponsive.    Madam Speaker, if you don't think the stress of being put out of  business by a government that has taken away your water, your  electricity, and driving your costs through the roof wouldn't have a  part in that stroke for that family member, the family patriarch, you  are not paying attention.   He was airlifted to Klamath Falls in Oregon which is only a 15-minute  flight but a 2\1/2\ hour drive. You are getting the picture, I think,  of what rural issues we are dealing with, the challenges of people  trying to farm so the country has food in this case.   Now, every week the entire family has to make the trek back up to  Klamath Falls since it is the closest specialist in occupational  therapy. So they schlep that trip back and forth with expensive fuel  and long distance, but they need to do it in order to do what they do.  They need to stay the night in a hotel since the drive over and back is  a little too much to do in 1 day given the appointment schedule.   So the husband is only getting a little less than $500 a month from  disability for the family to live on, and each week they must make that  5-hour trip, gas, hotels, meals, et cetera. Of course, these costs are  devastating to them. Inflation is driving much of this cost.   Things are going to happen to people--that we know. But at least  making them a little more affordable by having an economy that works  for the American people, especially lower- and middle-income folks who  are suffering firsthand from the high cost of everything driven by a  government policy that is hurting us.   This green new deal stuff is not an answer for low-and middle-income  people. Forcing them to be in an electric car--let them eat cake is  what it practically sounds like when the Transportation Secretary says  that we can just replace it with electric cars.   No, we have to endure some pain. Nobody in Washington is enduring any  pain, not in the Cabinet and not in Congress. No one would feel sorry  for us anyway, and they shouldn't. It is the American public who is  enduring the pain while people just callously say: Well, these high  prices on fuel are just part of the transition to an electric future.   Well, in my home State, electricity barely stays on as it is now  because they are pulling out the hydroelectric dams, as I just  mentioned, on the Klamath. The water they are running out of Lake  Oroville and Lake Shasta down through the river and out through the  delta, that doesn't make hydroelectric power during part of the year.   Lake Oroville, for example, ran out of the ability to make hydropower  because the lake reached historic lows in its entire history. We are  seeing that getting ready to happen in Nevada on Lake Mead, dead pools  soon.   These are government policies that drive inflation, the cost of food,  the cost of electricity, and everything that is harming the American  public.   So I have to ask the question, once again, to President Biden, his  Cabinet, and even the majority in these two Houses here: Whose side are  you on? A green new deal, a la-di-da agenda, or the struggles of the  American people?   I hope the American public asks that question of themselves: Who is  trying to help and who is causing the harm?   Think about that really hard I ask you. We are not here just for  kicks. I am not here because I love to wear a suit. We are fighting for  you. We are fighting for what is right. So please pay attention and  decide for yourself who is trying to help and who is causing the harm.   I know Mr. Johnson is doing great work by helping us with this  message. If people aren't going to pay attention to what is really  causing it, then I don't know how we can help them. But please take  this message away with you and we will do what we can. We are fighting  here in Congress. We are fighting to get the message out and put policy  reforms in place that indeed are going to help.   So I thank the gentleman for the time tonight and for his faithful  efforts here.
