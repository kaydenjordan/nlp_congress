 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:        The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CASEY] moves to commit       the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance with instructions       to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) establish an exception to reduced rates for certain       corporations in order to ensure any tax windfall to       profitable corporations also goes to increasing worker wages       by--        (A) requiring corporations to annually determine whether       their aggregate worker wages, excluding executive wages,       increase by an amount at least equal to increases in       executive compensation, stock buy backs, and dividends to       shareholders; and        (B) with respect to companies failing this test, providing       that the corporate rate reduction shall not apply for the       following year and the corporate rate under the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 shall be applied and administered as if       the provisions reducing such rates had not been enacted.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about this motion to  commit. The amendment I am offering is very simple. It states that if  companies are giving executives a raise and giving more money to  shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks because of this tax  windfall, then workers who help make these profits possible in the  first place, and who also need a break, would see their wages go up. It  is as simple as that.   I hope every Member of the Senate will support this sensible  amendment. By one estimate, over the last 16 years, there seems to be  little to no correlation between rising corporate profits and increased  wages. We have seen record corporate profits over years, and in fact  profits as a percentage of the economy have nearly doubled over the  past 20 years.   The New York Times tells us:         In the United States, the richest 1 percent have seen their       share of national income roughly double since 1980, to 20       percent in 2014 from 11 percent. No other nation in the 35-      member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development       is as unequal among those with comparable tax data, and none       have experienced such a sharp rise in inequality.   Let me review that again.   From 1980 to 2014, the richest 1 percent has had its share of  national income roughly double to 20 percent from 11 percent. So, since  1980, the top 1 percent has had a bonanza. It has done quite well.   What has been the case with workers?  [[Page S7520]]    At the same time, wage growth has stagnated. Many have seen the  reports over the last couple of years, one by the Economic Policy  Institute, which indicated that, if you compare wage growth after World  War II, from 1948 to about 1973, wage growth was 91 percent. Then from  1973 forward, to about 2014 or 2015, wage growth was only a total of 11  percent growth. So there was 91 percent wage growth after World War II  and only 11 since then, and in many years, it was not even 11. It was  stagnating.   People can go to the Economic Policy Institute's website and read  that series of reports about wages and about workers, which I thought  was the focus--the prime focus, I had hoped--of both parties when it  came to this bill. Apparently, it is not with regard to what the  majority is presenting. Those at the top are not only getting richer;  they have been getting richer in a big way since 1980. That increasing  rate of benefits to the wealthy continues at a fast pace in this bill  and continues year after year.   The Republican tax plan gives hundreds and hundreds of billions of  dollars of net tax cuts to major corporations. By one estimate, the  total corporate tax cut exceeds $1.3 trillion. That is trillion with a  ``t.'' Some estimate that the number is even higher than that, but I  will go with that lower number. There is no requirement with that  corporate tax cut that any benefits go to workers' wages and no  requirement that companies invest in the United States of America--no  requirement at all.   So what should we do about that?   We can pass an amendment like mine to make sure that, if the  executives benefit and if the shareholders benefit, the workers  benefit. The workers have a lot to do with the profits. The workers  have a lot to do with the productivity of the corporation. In fact,  many large corporations have told shareholders exactly what they are  going to do with the money they get, with the benefits that are derived  from this corporate tax cut. Here is the conclusion, unfortunately: All  they are going to do is to increase dividends.   Here is a report from Bloomberg. This report is dated November 29,  2017, with the headline: ``Trump's Tax Promises Undercut by CEO Plans  to Reward Investors.''   Here is the opening paragraph of the story: ``Major companies  including Cisco Systems Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Coca-Cola Co. say  they'll turn over most gains from proposed corporate tax cuts to their  shareholders.''   This undercuts President Donald Trump's promise that his plan will  create jobs and boost wages for the middle class.   That is what that report that I am quoting from says. I will quote  from it more a little bit later. That is what they tell us in that  report.   What about the workers? What about the workers and their wages, which  have not gone up very much over decades and, in some measure, have  stagnated?   The Republicans have promised over and over that this corporate tax  cut would lead to higher wages. In fact, they even put a number on it.  They said $4,000, and then they said that it might go higher than  $4,000 if you give this corporate tax cut. So they were not just making  a broad, unspecific promise. They were making a very specific promise  about what would flow from this corporate tax cut, which I would call a  corporate tax giveaway. Workers are the reason that those profits exist  when a corporation is profitable, and they should see the benefit of  the gains from their labor.   I will go back to this Bloomberg report. It quotes Jack Bogle, the  founder of the Vanguard Group, which is a major company in  Pennsylvania. Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, spoke in  New York on this very topic this week. He is quoted in this Bloomberg  story from November 29.   I will just read you part of what he said: The tax proposals being  debated in Washington are a ``moral abomination''--those are his words,  not mine--because they favor corporations at the expense of workers--my  words not his.   Here is what Jack Bogle goes on to say:         Just think about this: Corporate profits after taxes last       year were the highest they've ever been in the history of GDP       going back to 1929 . . . and we are thinking of giving relief       to the corporations at the highest levels ever. Individual       wages are at the lowest level in about 15 years as a percent       of GDP.    That is what Jack Bogle said.   He goes on to say:         So we are helping people who are doing very well and doing       nothing for the people doing very badly. One of the flaws is       that corporations are putting their shareholders ahead of the       people that built the corporation, the people who put their       heart and soul on the line and are committed to the company.        It is just the unfairness.    That is Jack Bogle of the Vanguard Group, not some Democratic source.   He finishes with these words:         But the worst part of it is that corporations are making so       much money now that they don't know what to do with it. They       aren't investing in new equipment, in innovation. They're       buying back their own stock, which helps the stock price.    He goes on to say the following:         I'm all for capitalism . . . I'm a capitalist myself. But       there is such a thing as too much.    That is what Jack Bogle said about this bill and about the effects of  the corporate tax break.   Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that corporate leaders are saying the  tax cut proceeds will go to shareholders, as I said, which is the exact  concern that many people have about this bill, among many other  concerns.   Republicans say that this tax cut is to help competitiveness and wage  growth. This amendment would simply put some teeth into that promise.  If because of a tax cut a company spends, say, $50 million more on  executives' raises and increased dividends and stock buybacks, then it  ought to have to spend $50 million, as well, to increase workers'  wages. That is the effect of the amendment.   If you are truly reinvesting in your company, your complying with  this amendment shouldn't be an issue, but if your only goal is to put  more money at the top, then without this amendment, this tax bill is  grossly unfair to workers. If you don't want to take my word for it,  talk to Jack Bogle   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute before the vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, this motion is pretty simple. If  corporations get a windfall because of a corporate tax break, the  workers should benefit as well. Worker wages should go up.   Let me read directly from the motion itself. We want to ensure that  ``any tax windfall to profitable corporations . . . goes to . . .  worker wages.'' Aggregate worker wages would increase by an amount  equal to the increases in executive compensation, stock buy backs, and  dividends to shareholders.   It is that simple.  [[Page S7527]]    I urge a ``yes'' vote. I wish to thank my colleagues for their  support: Senators Stabenow, Whitehouse, Van Hollen, Udall, and Baldwin.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Casey  motion to commit.    Mr. President, on December 1, we mark World AIDS Day,  reflect on the more than 35 million people who have died of HIV or  AIDS, and recommit to leading the way to an AIDS-free generation.   For more than a decade, the United States has been a leader in the  global fight against HIV/AIDS, and this investment has shown real  returns. The progress in treatment of both adults and children living  with HIV/AIDS has been dramatic. According to the World Health  Organization, in 2005, only 14 percent of women received services for  the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. By 2016, that number  had grown to 76 percent. Since 2001, the number of children born HIV- positive has decreased by more than half.   We should not interpret these metrics of progress to mean that our  work is done or that we can afford to pull back from our commitment to  eradicate this epidemic. Children, in particular, remain especially  vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. The Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation  notes that there are still 2.1 million children living with HIV, and  these children are receiving treatment at rates far below that of  adults. The failure to support effective and acceptable HIV services  for adolescents has resulted in a 50 percent increase in reported AIDS- related deaths in this group compared with the 30 percent decline seen  in the general population from 2005 to 2012, according to the World  Health Organization. We must do better.   The challenge of protecting children from HIV/AIDS is not just about  access to treatment. We must also continue to work to prevent mother- to-child transmission, which is the leading cause of HIV infection in  children, by improving services to pregnant mothers. We do this by  strengthening healthcare systems in the most affected countries and by  continuing to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief,  or PEPFAR, and local nongovernmental organizations in the fight against  HIV/AIDS.   The bipartisan commitment to addressing the complex challenges of the  HIV/AIDS epidemic remains strong. However, this year, the Trump  administration proposed cutting roughly 30 percent of the international  affairs budget. This is risky, short-sighted, wrong, and will  dramatically impact our leadership on global health issues.   The international affairs budget supports programs that have been  both instrumental in preventing and treating pediatric AIDS and in  encouraging other donor countries and organizations to match our  participation. Drastic cuts will impact not only our reputation and our  partnerships in the international community, but will have long-term  consequences we cannot clearly predict today.   The international effort to combat pediatric AIDS exemplifies the  ways in which countries, local NGOs, and the private sector can come  together to protect the most vulnerable among us. Last month, I was  proud to work with Senator Rubio to introduce S. Res. 310, a resolution  to recognize the importance of a continued commitment to ending  pediatric AIDS worldwide. I want to acknowledge the leadership of  Congresswomen Ros-Lehtinen and Lee on a companion resolution in the  House of Representatives and thank my colleagues who have joined as  cosponsors of S. Res. 310 thus far: Senators Blumenthal, Booker,  Boozman, Coons, Durbin, Feinstein, Franken, Hatch, Isakson, King,  Klobuchar, Markey, Nelson, Rubio, and Van Hollen.   This bipartisan effort represents one of many steps to reinforce U.S.  leadership in combating HIV and AIDS and in protecting children around  the world. On World AIDS Day, I call on my colleagues to redouble our  support of U.S. Government programs that fight HIV/AIDS and build  healthcare capacity towards an AIDS-free generation.                            ____________________
