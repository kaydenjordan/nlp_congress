 Mr. President, this week, the Senate will begin  consideration of the first package of full-year appropriations for the  coming fiscal year. This is an important milestone and a downpayment on  our goal of funding the Federal Government through regular order.   Our progress on this front has been due in large part to the  leadership of Senator Collins and Senator Murray of the Appropriations  Committee. For months--months--our colleagues have worked diligently to  build consensus and process as many bills as possible with deadlines  looming large.   The legislation before us this week is designed to address a trio of  important commitments--to America's farmers, to our veterans, and to  investing in transportation infrastructure.   Seven percent of American adults are veterans of the Armed Forces.  Ten percent of American jobs are supported by agriculture. And our  entire economy hinges on safe and efficient airports, roads, bridges,  and ports. So it is difficult to overstate the importance of this  legislation, but it is especially important that we get it right. To  that end, I hope and expect that all Senators will receive ample  opportunity to offer amendments for consideration.   Ultimately, our work will need to earn the support of a divided  Congress and earn the President's signature. So I am grateful to our  colleagues' commitment to regular order appropriations, and I look  forward to supporting a sensible step forward in the coming days.
