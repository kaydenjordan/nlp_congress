 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Staff Sergeant Paul Lincoln Olmstead, who passed away on September 21,  2021.   Born with an instinct to protect and defend others, Lincoln embodied  the Green Beret motto to ``de oppresso liber'' or ``to free the  oppressed.''   Lincoln served as a special forces engineer in the Utah National  Guard's 19th Special Forces Group. This elite group of operators serves  as the tip of the spear of the greatest fighting force the world has  ever known.   Just 5 years into his service, Sergeant Olmstead had become a Green  Beret and a special forces sniper.   Lincoln will always be known as a disciplined professional with a  steadfast commitment to the mission at hand. Lincoln proudly served his  country, and we owe him our deepest gratitude. Lincoln will be  remembered as a loving husband to his wife, Danaya, and a dedicated  father to his son, Tavian, and daughter, Alexa.

My  colleagues have highlighted many concerns and many issues that this  tax-and-spend monstrosity will advance, partisan priorities like  taxpayer-funded abortions, the Green New Deal, a $2.1 trillion tax  increase on businesses and hardworking American families. The provision  that I am speaking of specifically threatens our individual freedoms  and personal privacy.    This provision is an expansive IRS mandate that would give the  government unprecedented access into our wallets and spending patterns.  This provision would force our neighborhood banks and local credit  unions to hand over constituents' private financial information  directly to the IRS.   This decree levies an outrageous compliance cost on the credit unions  and banks that serve my community, meaning higher fees and lower saving  yields for First District families.   More importantly, this intrusion into our transactions poses  extraordinary privacy concerns and subjects Utahns' financial  information to hacking, political targeting, and government  surveillance. This abusive provision will collect massive amounts of  personal financial data on middle-class families.   Imagine the ways that any administration, Democrat or Republican,  could be tempted to use that information and to intrude on our private  businesses and lifestyle choices.   Even still, this will not close the tax gap. This provision isn't  targeting wealthy tax evaders, as President Biden claims. It is  targeting normal, working-class, everyday Americans. $3.5 trillion, and  for President Biden to say it is not going to cost us anything?   Democrats know they can't tax enough to make up that difference, so  they are finding these unique, obscure ways to employ or to basically  deploy the IRS on everyday working Americans in their regular checking  accounts.   I condemn this unconstitutional and invasive Federal overreach, and I  stand with Utah families who depend on the security and privacy that  their financial institutions provide.   I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to oppose  this provision, and I look forward to voting against the entirety of  Speaker Pelosi's reconciliation package.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Hern for  leading this entire session and the opportunity to close.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to close today's session by remembering  the sacrifice and heroism of Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover who bravely  gave his life while defending Abbey Gate from violent extremists in  Kabul, Afghanistan, on August 26, 2021.   After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Staff Sergeant Hoover  knew he wanted to be a marine. At the time of his death, Staff Sergeant  Hoover had served as a marine for 11 years and was on his third tour in  Afghanistan.   In Utah we have been devastated by this news.   On Sunday after the attacks, I joined hundreds of Utahns gathered at  the State capitol for a memorial vigil to honor Staff Sergeant Hoover.  I also attended his funeral service before being laid to rest in  Arlington National Cemetery and was overwhelmed by memories shared by  his family and friends. He was treasured, loved, and admired, and he  gave all for our freedoms.   Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover will rightly be remembered as a hero in  the Halls of Congress, in Utah, and across the Nation that he served.
