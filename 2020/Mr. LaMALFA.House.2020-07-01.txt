 Mr. Speaker, wildfire season has begun, especially in  California. In 2020 so far, 3,100 fires have started, twice as many as  the same period in 2019.   Ongoing drought is part of the problem. We will be on the way to  surpassing 2019 for the entire season as, indeed, we do have a head  start.   We shouldn't leave our fire preparedness plans completely to our  firefighters having to go out and do it after the fact. We need to get  ahead of the curve.   There are real solutions to getting fires under control in the West.  A big part of it is forest management, especially on Federal lands.   There are 100 million dead trees in California. When coupled with  years of  [[Page H2994]]  drought, the risks of turning our forests into tinder boxes is higher  than ever. Responsible thinning and hazardous trees removal is an  essential portion of what we need to be doing.   My bill, the CLEAR Zones Act, which is Clearing Lines, Electrical At- Risk Zones Act, would reduce the bureaucracy and the timelines to  actually get the work done after permitting within 60 days and increase  the buffer zone along power lines so there is less danger and more  ability to fight fire at a smaller level.   Mismanaged forests lead to more fire. Without better practices, we  will see more and more of the West go up in smoke.                            ____________________
