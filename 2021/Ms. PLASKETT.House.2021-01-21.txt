 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the requested  waiver of the Secretary of Defense nominee, retired four-star General  Lloyd S. Austin, III.   President Biden recognizes the need to have the most qualified  individuals in his Cabinet to right the ship from day one. The issues  of instability of our Department of Defense, morale, and a desire to  engage more vigorously with the world require that a nominee be one who  has the type of career that General Austin does.   General Austin's distinguished career and experience as a commander  of the U.S. Central Command and Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army  have prepared him to be ideal for the task at hand.   We agree that the separation of Active Duty military and civilian is  important. Moreover, I have full confidence, however, that the  Secretary-designate shares these values, in that he came to the House,  reaching out to this body in a way that shows reverence for the  continued promotion and defense of civilian control of the military.   Lastly, having an African-American Secretary of Defense is highly  important at this time, as the military must address the growing  evidence of sympathy towards dangerous conspiracies and White  supremacist causes amongst servicemembers--evidence made exponentially  troubling due to the fact that a large percentage of servicemembers are  people of color.   General Lloyd Austin is the right person for the job at the time at  hand, and Congress must allow him to get through and get the job done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the waiver for General  Austin.
