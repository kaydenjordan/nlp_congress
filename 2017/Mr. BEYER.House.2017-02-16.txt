 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed to be part of this discussion of H.J. Res.  69.   Day in and day out, we have meaningful debate in committees and the  House floor that reflect very real philosophical differences about the  responsibilities and the limits of the Federal Government. These  differences and world views inevitably reflect differences in values.   Today, I can't understand how my Republican friends can defend values  that allow and promote the cruelest possible killing methods.   Humans have hunted for millennia. This hunting traditionally requires  patience, skill, cunning and encourage, but not sugar doughnuts,  helicopters, gasses, or leg traps.   Today's House joint resolution would overturn this incredibly fair  and reasonable U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service regulation that would  rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically justified killing  methods on 76 million acres of Federal wildlife refuge lands--76  million acres that belong to the American people.                                time  1245    The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska  National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize--and, in fact,  require--the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural  diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This  includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves  and bears.   So this rule would prohibit the inhumane and indiscriminate killing  of keystone species in the national wildlife refuges. This does not  interfere with fair chase hunting methods. It doesn't even prevent  inhumane and indiscriminate killing on State and private lands.   Anyone voting to support this Congressional Review Act resolution  today is tacitly supporting using airplanes and helicopters to scout  land and shoot grizzly bears, killing wolves, black bears, coyote  mothers and their pups and cubs in dens, actually gassing them, and the  trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leg-hold  traps and wire snares, where they are trapped, bleeding, frightened,  slowly dying of thirst and starvation. Statewide polls show that  Alaskans strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting  practices.   Alaska also gains over $2 billion in economic activity for wildlife  viewing, which is five times what it earns from hunting. This makes  economic sense. It is a huge driver of tourism. Many come to Alaska for  the unique opportunity to see bears, wolves, and other keystone  species. They are the very ones at risk if we pass this resolution.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, to oppose these cruel  and  [[Page H1261]]  inhumane practices. They are not sporting practices, and they violate  any understanding of humane values and respect for nature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the ranking member of the Committee on Natural  Resources.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the former ranking member of the Committee on  Natural Resources.    Mr. Speaker, a quick response to the notion that the fears  of inhumane practices are utterly false. In a Los Angeles Times story  in 2012, the headline is: ``Alaska officials expand aerial shooting of  bears.''   It goes on to say:   ``The controversial `intensive management' moves are the latest in a  series of increasingly aggressive control methods targeting bears and  wolves in Alaska. In some areas, wolf pups can be gassed in their dens,  bear cubs and sows can be hunted, and wolves shot from helicopters.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis).    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, one quick point is that these national wildlife  refuges are U.S. public lands paid for by U.S. taxpayers and should be  managed for the benefit of all. So let me quote former Fish and  Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, recently departed, who said these  ``are not game farms managed for a slice of their diversity for the  benefit of a few people who would call themselves hunters.''   Much has been made in this debate this afternoon, Madam Speaker,  about whether ANILCA prohibits this Fish and Wildlife rule. We have  gone back and forth with different cases. Let me just quote a few key  paragraphs.   Section 302 and 303 of ANILCA establishes 16 national wildlife  refuges, and for each one, the purpose is stated for which the refuge  is to be established and shall be managed, including: ``to conserve  fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity.''   The law doesn't say wildlife should be managed in some alternate  state of unnatural diversity where no wolves, no bears, and  overpopulated moose herds can destroy the landscape.   Both the ANILCA, and the Improvement Act, the 1998 law that  reorganized the National Wildlife Refuge System, managed Alaska's  Federal refuge managers to conserve natural diversity, a value that the  Fish and Wildlife Services correctly noted is incompatible with  indiscriminate predator culls.   Every Federal court to consider the question, including the Ninth  Circuit, which contains Alaska, has held the States lack the authority  to overrule Fish and Wildlife Service management decisions concerning  Federal refuge management. So this has already been before the courts.  The courts, I believe, have already decided.   Madam Speaker, in the few minutes I have left, let me just quote a  few of the letters we received from Alaska residents in opposition to  the resolution before us.   Elizabeth Figus, from Juneau, writes: ``I am an Alaskan. I hunt and  fish, and I support regulations that prohibit cruel killing. This rule  would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically unjustified  killing methods on over 76 million acres of Federal lands in Alaska.   ``A hunter who cannot comply with humane methods of the trade/sport  is simply lazy and undeserving of the right to harvest the flesh of  another living thing.   ``This is the 21st century, not the 1800s. We must carry out our  hunting in a careful and organized fashion to ensure the safety of  Alaskan residents as well as the sustainability of the wild animal  resources into the future.''   This from Elisabeth Moorehead from Eagle River: ``My husband and I  owned and operated a successful wildlife tourism business in Alaska for  27 years. The business still continues in the capable hands of one of  our guides. . . . I am writing to convey my displeasure over the  content of the joint resolution you recently introduced in response to  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations that ban cruel and  unsporting methods of killing bears, wolves and coyotes on Federal  wildlife refuges in Alaska.''   And from Fran Mauer in Fairbanks: ``Over the last 15 years I have  watched the state hunting regulations for wolves and bears get  progressively more extreme. These methods go far beyond any common  sense, are not supported by science, and have no place in our Alaskan  National Wildlife Refuges. This is the result of the special interest  lobby of extreme pro-hunting groups. . . . I for one, and many other  Alaskan hunters, do not want to see the State of Alaska turn our  National Wildlife Refuges into game farms.''   And, finally, from Jeff Fair from Palmer: ``I write you as a 23-year  Alaskan wildlife biologist . . . Currently 64 years of age, I hunt and  fish and enjoy a permanent license to do so in The Great Land.   ``As a biologist, I recognize that predator control does not work in  the long run to stabilize or maximize cervid populations. I also  recognize that an attempt to repeal U.S. Fish and Wildlife regs on  these lands would be an attempt to circumvent, contradict, overturn, or  simply break the Federal law that establishes the Fish and Wildlife  Service's mission and authority for these lands. And as a hunter I fear  for the reputation of the hunting tradition, including conservation and  fair-chase, when some service anti-predator techniques are allowed  anywhere, including on federal lands.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, just in mild response, I am, I believe,  heartened to know--that may be the wrong verb--but, at least, respect  my friend and colleague from Alaska's notion or assertion that these  terrible, inhumane hunting practices, which we have talked about for  the last hour--whether it is gassing wolves in the den or shooting  bears from the helicopter or using bait for the bears or many of the  iron leg traps--that all these things do not occur in Alaska on the  wildlife refuges; that they are illegal in Alaska. If that is so, that  is an excellent thing.   I wonder why the need for the Congressional Review Act resolution to  overturn the Fish and Wildlife regulations if none of these are, in  fact, happening.   In any case, there is still a legitimate debate about whether the  Fish and Wildlife regulation contravenes ANILCA and the state  establishment act. Hopefully, this doesn't have to go to court in order  to do that, but I think there seems to be enough judicial precedent  that if it did go to court, the Fish and Wildlife regulations would be  upheld.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
