 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of  H.R. 5, the Equality Act. We have made much progress in recent years,  but the reality is that many still face discrimination because of who  they are and whom they love.   As has been well-documented during the legislative record for H.R. 5,  there are currently no Federal protections for LGBTQ people in the  United States. So let's refocus on what this bill is really about.   In 30 States, LGBTQ people can be fired, refused housing, or denied  services simply because of who they are. The Equality Act would greatly  extend civil rights for this community, providing protections across  key areas of life, including employment, housing, credit, and jury  duty.   In Texas, that means having explicit protections for LGBTQ people for  the first time in our history. Updating Federal law will tear down  barriers to prosperity and lead to better outcomes for our families,  neighbors, and loved ones.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation will benefit  nearly 1 million LGBTQ Texans and countless other Americans.   Finally, in Texas, when we say y'all, we will mean all.   Mr. Speaker, I want to add that as a woman and as a Catholic, I know  I am not forfeiting any of my rights, not my women's rights or my  religious rights. We need to go back and make sure that we pass this  bill because for once, when we say justice for all at the end of our  pledge, it should mean justice for all.
