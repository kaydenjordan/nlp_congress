 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 469.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am glad to be here on H.R. 469. We have had the  opportunity, through rule debate yesterday, to discuss this.   What we are coming forward with today is a bill that I have  introduced that basically breaks down to what we know is a sue and  settlement ban on this part of my bill. There are other parts that we  are going to get to as we go forward in this.   But I think I want to start off this debate today by simply stating  some of the foundational issues--things that we come here and talk  about many times on the floor of the House have to do with bills and  discussions. But one of the things I think that has been very  disturbing for me--and I know many of our colleagues as we have come up  here--is the disturbing trend of moving away from Congress relieving  its powers and taking ownership of its Article I authority, and doing  the oversight, doing the planning, doing the budgeting, and then sort  of moving that more toward the executive branch or letting the judicial  system take responsibility.   And I think one of the things that we are starting out with today in  these bills, that we have taken up over the past 2 days, is a general  discussion to move back toward Article I authority, which Congress is  doing the legislating and the oversight that it is supposed to be, and  the executive branch is following through in their role of actually  executing the laws that are made, judicial, of course, being the  interpretive branch.   What we are seeing in this bill--and one of the reasons for our sue  and settlement legislation, which is my part of this bill, and I want  to start here, and we will continue as we go through this through the  other parts as we go--is really a fairness issue. And this is not  specific to one party in the executive branch. I stated this yesterday.  Sometimes it gets mixed up. But hear me clearly: I don't care the party  of the resident at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I do not care who they may  be in the sense of what they do in that job. What I want to know is:  Are they fulfilling the executive branch role and not overstepping  Congress' role?   What we have seen over previous administrations, including the last  one and the previous administration, especially under this area of sue  and settlement that increased greatly during the last administration,  was this idea of taking a law that we have passed, having the  regulatory agency's job to execute that law; but, at the same point in  time, being sued by a friendly party, or another party, on a deadline  of the bill, or something that they want to, they go into, say, with  EPA or another agency, and they discuss this lawsuit. They come to an  agreement, and they  [[Page H8195]]  file the suit. Many times the suit and the consent were filed on the  same day.   The consent decree--now, look, consent decrees are good judicial  tools. They have been used, and will continue to be used, even under  this bill. But what we don't want to have happen is when the consent  decree basically comes at the time of the suit, or just shortly  thereafter, where the party that wants to see a specific agenda pushed,  along with a willing agency, goes to a judge, is able to get that  consent decree, and then turn around and give it to somebody else and  say: You now have to live under this without any emphasis or any input  from the other party.    So we are simply saying: Let's make this a little fair. You are going  to have to publicize notice, you are going to have to actually include  others who may have a problem with this consent decree, and you are  going to have to do it a little more transparently.   So we are going to start here today, Mr. Chairman. We are going to  talk about these issues and coming forward. We can talk about many  other things as the day progresses, but, at the end of the day, it is  about Congress itself taking control of its Article I authority and  saying, ``We are going to be the legislative branch that we are called  to be,'' and the executive taking their role and judiciary taking  theirs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments,  especially of my friend from Rhode Island. I would agree in principle  with the Meese amendment as well. The problem is that, through the  Clinton administration and through preceding administrations, it has  been watered  [[Page H8197]]  down. I would actually go back to that. The problem is lack of  transparency and the lack of a coherent voice here as we go further,  but I do appreciate the comments.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Chairman, I don't believe, as was just  stated, that there is a nefarious plot here. It is to get government  doing the regulation it should with transparency--and that is what  needs to be done--and have Congress do what it should be doing, and  that is writing laws and having the regulatory process start from here.  That is simply what we are looking at. If that is too much, I  understand.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Stewart).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I just want to say that this is not just something that  has  [[Page H8199]]  been dreamed up, as far as from a bill perspective. And they can point  to studies that say this may or may not be a part, but even the outside  organization, the Environmental Council of the States, sent a letter  and basically did a resolution that said there is a need to reform  State participation in EPA consent decrees which settled through  citizen lawsuits. I mean, this is an issue because there is not the  transparency that is needed. That is why these bills are here.   I would just like to remind everyone why we are considering this bill  today, going back to where we first started, and why the House passed  the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act and the Congressional Subpoena  Compliance and Enforcement Act earlier this week: to help restore and  reinforce the powers the people gave Congress in Article I of the  Constitution.   Restoring and reinforcing these powers is not some academic issue;  this is something that we practice every day. It goes back to as early  as our elementary school days dealing with our simple civics, saying  this is the way our government is set up.   I have said this before, Mr. Chairman, from this podium, and I will  say it again. If the people in agencies down the street would like to  make law, then I encourage them to leave their job, run for Congress,  and come up here and make law. This is not their job to do it from a  cubicle down the street through a lawsuit. We need to do it up here, as  it should be properly done.   So, for far too long, Congress has been giving away its power. We  want to see that change. We are going to see that. That is why this  bill is here. And although this bill alone is certainly not a silver  bullet for restoring the power the Congress has ceded, just as powers  are gradually lost over time, they will be regained by Congress  gradually reasserting itself.   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to  reassert congressional authority and to ensure that individual liberty  protected by the powers of separation of powers between the branches is  maintained.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of  Chairman Goodlatte, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Department of the  Treasury's interpretation of current law prohibits it from making  public the names of plaintiffs. My amendment clarifies that these  names, which this bill requires to be disclosed, will, in fact, be  disclosed.   In January 2016, it was reported that the United States agreed to pay  $1.7 billion to Iran in a settlement arising from an agreement to sell  military equipment to Iran prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. At the  time, it was known that $400 million in cash had been transferred to  Iran, but it was unclear, even after public inquiry, how the remaining  $1.3 billion had been paid.   On August 22, 2016, the New York Sun reported that, while conducting  an ongoing but fruitless search of ``Iran'' as a claimant in the  Treasury database, it found 13 payments totaling 13 cents less than  $1.3 billion, as well as an additional payment of just over $10  million. Without further context, however, the New York Sun could not  confirm whether these payments were, in fact, part of the settlement.   It was only after months of increased public scrutiny, long after the  money had been disbursed, that the previous administration acknowledges  that these payments were indeed part of the Iran settlement.   My amendment will ensure that the public knows about the conduct of  its government and the laws that are being faithfully executed and that  justice is being served. The information that this bill requires to be  disclosed, which, in many cases is already publicly available in court  documents, informs Congress and the public in new ways, particularly  with regard to systemic government abuse.   Furthermore, any concerns about the disclosure of the plaintiffs'  names are mitigated by the fact that this amendment does not foreclose  a court's ability to protect private information. Indeed, the  information required to be made public in title II will not be  disclosed if such disclosure is prohibited by a court order. Moreover,  Federal judges have ample discretion to allow a plaintiff to proceed  under the pseudonym as a ``Doe plaintiff'' or to seal and redact  intimate records.   My amendment is necessary to prevent future government abuse by  increasing the overall transparency of the Judgment Fund and, in turn,  increasing government accountability.   I urge my colleagues to support this important clarification, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, you can also go home and tell  them, if they filed a suit, that it is already currently in the PACER  system, probably with more information than just that, or they could  have filed it under a pseudonym or had their lawyers have this  suppressed. This is an issue that is already out there; and as we look  at this, this is moving forward. So I would just ask that this  amendment be reported favorably.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, with much respect for my  ranking member on my committee--we have served together; we have worked  on a lot of issues together, namely, the Police Working Group, and  other things, and his work has been very helpful in that regard--I do  have to oppose this amendment because, really, what this amendment does  is seek less transparency, public participation, and judicial review  for consent decrees and settlement agreements for regulations that  allegedly will help to protect civil rights.   With all due respect, I believe this has matters backwards. More  transparency, public input, and judicial scrutiny will only help to  produce regulations that better protect civil rights.   Further, since the bill promotes the participation of regulated  entities and State, local, and Tribal entities that may be affected by  or help to enforce the regulations, it will promote buy-in from these  groups. That will help the regulation to be better and more promptly  implemented and not held for years in litigation challenging the rules.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    I was just sitting here, Mr. Chairman, and I  am excited and welcome my friend from Georgia to the fight for  broadband. I have been leading on this fight now for several years,  especially in my district, which is rural, which has a company called  Windstream that does not provide for its citizens. I am excited to have  the acknowledgment that rural broadband is something that we need to be  fighting for.   My district has areas in which Windstream was supposed to use its  Connect America funds to widen its footprint on rural broadband.  Instead, they have shrunk it, only to compete in areas where they are  competing against other companies, and only widening it in areas where  they already had technology which they could have widened years before.   I think it is really interesting, and I am so glad about this because  it also gives me the opportunity to talk about the GO Act, the Gigabyte  Opportunity Act, which actually will provide real solutions into these  districts for broadband opportunity.   I would encourage my friends from Georgia and from Michigan, and  anybody else, to sign on to this bill. It is a good bill that has  support across the way in the Senate, and also working with the  administration to provide the way for States to actually look at their  own States and provide gigabyte opportunity zones so that they can  actually make ways and get these companies that are monopolizing the  areas and not serving their constituents.   By the way, Mr. Chairman, it is sad because, in some of my districts  right now, it has been over really about 6 weeks or so since Irma came  through northeast Georgia and knocked out power and delayed broadband,  and I still have customers in my district who do not have phone service  or broadband this long after that fact.   This is just unacceptable, so I appreciate the concern here. The only  problem is, this amendment doesn't help. This amendment is not one that  does--again, it just is another amendment, unfortunately, like the last  amendment, that seeks less transparency and public participation. It  does not do anything to discourage people from working to find rural  broadband solutions.   What this actually does, it just, again, tries to seek less  transparency instead of more. But I think there is a positive here. I  choose to look at the positive. I disagree with this amendment and  would ask that it be voted ``no.'' But I look at the positive to say,  as someone from Georgia, we have got a fight we can connect on, and  that is rural broadband, because there is no longer a digital divide.  There is a hope and dream divide. It is not a digital divide. It is a  hope and dream for those students, and those moms, and those dads, and  those families in those areas who cannot access the internet.    For me, it was a radio and a book. It took me all over the world.  Nowadays, it is the internet and a phone where our students can  actually get what they want. Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't do  it. I have to oppose this amendment, but I am glad to welcome to the  fight another friend against the evils of not being able to expand  broadband.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman  bringing it forward. Again, we have never said that consent decrees  can't be used. The issue here is how they are used in transparency.  Justice delayed, as has been said, is not one that is denied, but also  transparency not used is also things that are done in the dark and away  from the public view which also can have issues that we go forward.  Very few of these cases are actually brought by Joe Private Citizen.  They are brought by groups with interest.   Even in the Chesapeake Bay, which has an $18 billion compliance tag,  the rushed timeframe did not allow others' input and buy-in from other  localities.   So, again, nowhere has abuse of sue and settle tactics been seen so  much as in the environmental regulation. In fact, the Judiciary  Committee's report on this bill highlights 10 environmental sue and  settle regulations from the Obama administration that equaled up to  $125 billion of cost.   Even the Environmental Council, as I stated earlier, in 2013, adopted  a resolution calling upon the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to  adopt reforms like the ones in this bill.   This amendment would deny reform to precisely the area of regulation  that needs it most and, thereby, substantially gut the bill. We can  have good environmental regulations without shady, backroom dealing of  sue and settle litigation skewing the results and excessively  heightening the burden.   I appreciate the gentleman bringing the amendment, but I would oppose  it, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the gentleman  bringing in the Meese memo. We discussed this earlier that if we  actually went back to the actual intent of the Meese memo which said  the Attorney General would be the part, we could probably agree on  that. But let's get some things straight. There has been nothing  codified. This is a regulation. It has not been codified. Codification  would have to come from actual legislation passed by this body, and it  is not.   The amendment would seek to carve out of the bill consent decrees and  settlements entered into under Department of Justice regulations  ostensibly written to implement this Meese memo.   The Meese memo was a Reagan-era Department policy, issued by Attorney  General Meese, that prohibited the Department from entering into  specified categories of decrees or settlements--particularly those that  allowed the judiciary, through judicial orders, from invading the  constitutionally exclusive authority of the executive branch.   Current regulations, however, require less scrutiny by, and less  accountability for, such consent decrees on the part of the Attorney  General.   What we need is not less Department of Justice accountability for  backroom deals that trespass constitutional lines of authority, but  more accountability. The bill would restore full accountability  consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Meese memo itself.   Further, the amendment would carve out any and all decrees and  settlements entered by the approval of officials as low as the  Assistant Attorneys General--meaning most of the relevant decrees and  settlements entered into by the Department. As a result, the amendment  would gut the bill's consent decree and settlement reforms.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
