 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)  [[Page H6479]]         Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for  debate.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate a Republican sense of  Congress resolution proclaiming that a carbon tax would be bad for the  U.S. economy. That is it. That is how this majority is choosing to  spend its precious legislative time. I mean, this is a big nothing  burger.   Instead of considering legislation to address the administration's  horrific child separation policy at the border or addressing the  surging cost of prescription drugs or taking action to address gun  safety, or finally, finally holding Russia accountable for their  interference in the 2016 election, something the President himself has  trouble acknowledging, we are here considering a sense of Congress  stating that a carbon tax would be bad for America.   You know, I don't know how many of my Republican colleagues are  scientists, but you might want to meet some and talk to some of them.  They are smart people. They deal in facts. They deal in evidence. They  deal in results.   Look, Mr. Speaker, as any third grader knows, the Earth revolves  around the Sun, and if I drop a pen, it will fall to the table because  of gravity. We know that smoking causes cancer, and we know that the  Earth is not flat. We also know that climate change is real and that 97  percent of climate scientists agree that humans are the main cause. But  Republicans are burying their heads in the sand with this glorified  press release attacking a potential tool to combat it.   But even worse than what we are doing is what the Republican majority  is blocking from consideration. This week they blocked an amendment  that would have provided much needed funding to the Election Assistance  Commission to protect our elections from further Russian interference.  This is outrageous. Just days after President Trump sided with Putin  over our own intelligence community, Republicans blocked funding to  protect our elections. Essentially, the President sold out America in  Helsinki.   So Republicans want to vote on a sense of Congress, let's consider  the resolution reiterating Speaker Ryan's statement in response to the  President's terrible performance in Helsinki. It acknowledges Russia's  role in interfering in our election, and it affirms our support for the  intelligence community. But, of course, the majority has blocked that  resolution.   Instead, we are now debating our 92nd closed rule this Congress. This  is the most closed Congress in history, with zero open rules. And for  those in the gallery, the reason why this is important is because the  majority of bills that have come to this floor have come in a way that  nobody can amend them. Nobody can change even a word in the bill. I  mean, this is supposed to be the people's House, not the Russia house.   Mr. Speaker, this, what we are doing today, is a waste of time. We  have real issues to address--substantive issues to address. The  American people deserve more than show votes that throw red meat to the  oil lobby. I would say to my Republican colleagues: Do your job. Listen  to the American people. Start addressing some of their concerns, like  the fact that we need to protect our election system from more Russian  interference. That is a serious matter. All of our intelligence  agencies have said it is a serious matter, that it happened.                                time  1245    And what is your response? You zero out money in an appropriations  bill to help protect our election system. Then you block an amendment  that would allow us to put the money back in.   All we want is a fair fight. If you want to vote ``no'' on it, vote  ``no'' on it. But the American people are concerned, even if you are  not. Do your job.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I tried to get the gentleman from Kentucky to yield, but  I guess he didn't want to get into an exchange. But he said that he is  worried about Kentucky jobs. There is nothing in this bill that will  protect one job anywhere.   We are not debating a carbon tax. This is a sense of Congress. This  is a press release. This is not going to protect anybody's paycheck.  This is ridiculous. Are you going to go home to your constituents and  say, ``Oh, I did something for you. I passed a press release''? I mean,  give me a break.   The gentleman talks about the poor. If he is worried about the poor,  then stop cutting Medicaid. If he is worried about the poor, stop  cutting food assistance from people struggling in poverty, because that  is what the Republican majority has been doing consistently in this  Congress. So I don't need any lectures about that.   To the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my colleague, let me  again say, because I think people need to have this sink in, this is  the most closed Congress in the history of our country: 92 closed  rules. That means that the majority of bills--I want my Republican  colleagues to listen to this as well--the majority of bills have come  to the floor where nobody, even Republicans, are allowed to offer any  amendments--nothing.   Is this the people's House? Is this what you came to Washington to  do, to shut out debate, to shut out good ideas?   It is a disgrace. My hope is that the people of this country are  watching and that they will send you a message in November.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act, introduced by my colleague,  Representative  John Lewis, which would ensure equal access to the  ballot, modernize the voter registration system, and take steps to  eliminate deceptive practices that deter voters from casting their  ballots.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), to discuss that proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week, Republicans have brought to the floor a bill  that zeros out funding for a grant program to the Election Assistance  Commission to help States and local governments secure our elections.   Now, a news flash, Mr. Speaker--I hope my Republican friends are  listening--Russia was just caught meddling in our election. In fact,  meddling is not strong enough. They attacked our country.   When we discovered this, Mr. Quigley offered an amendment to restore  this critical funding, and it was blocked in the Rules Committee. My  friends in the Rules Committee won't even let us vote on it.   People may ask why, why can't we have a vote on putting money back in  to secure our election system. Well, the reason why, I think, is  because we might win and that Democrats--and there are probably a lot  of Republicans--would join with us in supporting the amendment.                                time  1300    They denied it because it makes sense. It is common sense.   We should be funding this program and, instead, we are debating a  press release that my friends on the other side are so passionate  about, that will do nothing for anybody. It is just a press release. We  are not debating a carbon tax. We are debating a press release. We  ought to be protecting our election system.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore)  for  [[Page H6481]]  the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I am now proud to yield to the gentleman  from my home State of Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii  (Ms. Gabbard) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Kildee) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Tonko) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren) for the purpose of a unanimous consent  request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gonzalez) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the hell else we can do  over  [[Page H6482]]  here. I mean, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Washington  only wants to yield for debate only, but how about yielding so that we  can act?   I mean, I think the American people want us to do something. I mean,  what happened in the 2016 election, what Russia did to our country, was  a serious matter. And I am going to tell you, it is not just Democrats  that are concerned. I know Republicans and Independents are concerned  as well.   This is an American issue, and when our Nation is attacked, we come  together. We put partisanship aside. We act. We just don't talk. We  act.   We have been trying, using every procedural means we know. We have  been appealing in the Rules Committee. We have been trying to bring  these issues to the floor, and we get shut down every single time. This  is unbelievable.   I mean, history is going to look back on the inaction of this  Congress with great shame.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sometimes I can't believe what is said on this House  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend, the distinguished chair of the  Rules Committee, if he is so sure of his arguments on this issue, then  bring the amendment to the floor, present your case, and let the  majority of this House determine what we should do. I guarantee you the  majority of this House would vote to provide the money to the States  and to local communities, because they are hearing from their  constituencies about how concerned they are about potential Russian  meddling in our election.   They are doubly concerned after the President's horrific performance  in Helsinki where he seemed to go out of his way to cozy up to Putin.  So people are concerned.   So the vote that we lost in the Rules Committee was not to enact this  amendment, the Quigley amendment, to put the money back in so that the  grants could go to States and local communities, the vote we lost-- people need to understand this: the vote we lost was to have the  ability to debate it and vote on it.   This is the United States House of Representatives. That is what we  are supposed to do. Stop the obstructionism, especially on an issue  like this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Will the gentleman yield?    That is correct, we cannot vote on that.    If the gentleman will continue to yield, when I offered  the Quigley amendment, which would have allowed us to have this vote,  all the Republicans voted ``no.''    We can try one more time. We have been trying and  [[Page H6483]]  trying and trying, but they are insistent on blocking this amendment  from even being considered.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  What this House needs is a little democracy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, all these excuses. As the gentleman knows, hundreds of  Members of this House don't sit on the Appropriations Committee. Should  they not have a voice on this issue?   And, by the way, since that vote in the Appropriations Committee, a  lot has changed in this country. If you are reading the news, 12  Russians were indicted for meddling in our election. The President of  the United States went over to Helsinki and made nice with Vladimir  Putin. That shocked not only the citizens of the United States, but the  entire world.   So I disagree with the gentleman when he says there is no crisis.  There is a crisis and we need to address it. We need to do everything  we can to prepare ourselves for another attack. All we are asking for  is a vote.   If the gentleman doesn't think there is a crisis, doesn't want to  vote for this, he can vote ``no,'' that is his right, but for the  hundreds of Members of this Chamber who would like a debate and a vote  on this, give them that opportunity.   The Rules Committee ought not to be a place where democracy goes to  die, especially on issues like this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Lowenthal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, may I make an inquiry of the gentleman  from Washington?   I know the gentleman said he has no further speakers, but we are  being inundated with speakers on this side. Does the gentleman want to  maybe send a few minutes our way?    I yield to the gentleman from Washington.    I thought I would ask.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Delaney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, can I just double-check and inquire of the  gentleman whether he has any additional speakers over there?    Mr. Speaker, is my understanding correct that I have  1\1/2\ minutes remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that we are here debating a press  release. We are not debating a carbon tax. We are debating a press  release.   I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you are  against the carbon tax, go back to your office and issue a press  release and send it to your local newspapers, because that is what this  is.   We are wasting precious time on this floor when there are other  issues. We have children being separated from their parents at the  border. We have prescription drug prices that are skyrocketing. We need  an infrastructure bill. We have gun violence in this country that is  out of control, where there are massacres occurring on a regular basis.  And what are we doing? We are doing a press release. This is shameful.   And on the issue of Russian interference in our elections, we ought  to be having a debate on an amendment to provide more funds to States  and local authorities to protect their election systems.   The gentleman from Washington says: Oh, there is still 39 percent of  the money left. They don't need it. I think his information is old,  because we are told that every single State has put in a request for  additional assistance. Why don't we debate that and vote on it and do  the right thing?   I am looking at a New York Times article that just appeared today  where the President of the United States, Donald Trump, says Russia is  no longer targeting the U.S. I mean, is this for real? What is wrong  with him?   It is time for Congress to stage an intervention with him and tell  him to listen to his intelligence agencies who contradict what he has  just said this morning. This is urgent.   We can't count on the President of the United States to do the right  thing. Congress needs to stand up. Congress needs to be counted.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Vote ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
