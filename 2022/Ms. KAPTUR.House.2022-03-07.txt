 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to call attention to the  continuing horror being unleashed in Ukraine by the treacherous tyrant  Vladimir Putin, a pitiful creature of darkness.   Forty-four million freedom-loving Ukrainians deserve to live in peace  and freedom. They voted for liberty, 90 percent of them. They have done  nothing to Putin. They pose no threat to Russia.   Putin invaded a sovereign nation and is committing war crimes against  civilians. He is creating a humanitarian crisis flooding across Europe.  The trains aren't big enough to haul all of the people seeking peace.   In the 11 days since he invaded, and since 2014, he has murdered  hundreds of Ukrainians, in addition to the 14,000 Russians killed in  Ukraine, and over 1.5 million have fled across the border into  neighboring countries.   The American people are opening their hearts with humanitarian aid,  but the free world must help provide more fighter jets, Javelins,  Stingers, small arms, ammunition, body armor, and air defense.   Ukraine is the scrimmage line for liberty in Europe. Here, at the  beginning of the 21st century, liberty requires vigilance for Ukraine.                            ____________________
