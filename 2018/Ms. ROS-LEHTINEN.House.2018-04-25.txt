 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the Deferment  for Active Cancer Treatment Act. I introduced this bill with my friend,  Congressman Ed Perlmutter, with the support of Critical Mass: The Young  Adult Cancer Alliance.   This commonsense and bipartisan measure will enable cancer patients  to defer payments on public student loans while actively receiving  treatment, without interest accruing during the deferment period.   Sadly, in 2018 alone, Mr. Speaker, more than 1.7 million Americans  will be newly diagnosed with cancer. Beyond the terrible news of this  cancer diagnosis, these individuals have to endure exhaustive treatment  and staggering medical expenses, often leading to under- or  unemployment. This reality makes it incredibly difficult for many  cancer patients to make payments on their student loans on time.   By passing the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act, we will  help so many cancer patients and stimulate the economy. These patients  will be prevented from defaulting on their student loans, which they so  desperately need.   Mr. Speaker, Ed and I encourage our colleagues to stand with cancer  patients across our Nation and support and cosponsor the Deferment for  Active Cancer Treatment Act                            ____________________
