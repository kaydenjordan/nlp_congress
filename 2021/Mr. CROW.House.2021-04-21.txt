 Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the life  of Cody Lyster, son of Kevin and Lea Ann Lyster, of Aurora, Colorado.   Cody passed away on April 8, 2020, and is Colorado's second youngest  victim to die from COVID-19. He was a criminal justice major at  Colorado Mesa University, following in his father's footsteps to become  a law enforcement officer.   Cody was an avid baseball player. As a freshman, Cody was named team  captain of his school's club baseball team, a first for Colorado Mesa  University history. He helped others through his love for the game and  had a knack for bringing people together and could be counted on during  times of calm and times of crisis.   Cody made his community better. In his honor, a $1 million  scholarship was established at Colorado Mesa University, and a  sportsmanship award and scholarship at Arapahoe Little League were  dedicated to a life well-lived.   Cody was an inspiration to others, and I can think of few as  deserving of this honor today. I honor Cody and thank the Lysters for  drawing strength from tragedy to make sure Cody's story is heard and to  save as many lives as they can during this pandemic.                            ____________________
