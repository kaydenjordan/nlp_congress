 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my good  friend from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as well as my fellow  Pennsylvanian, another great Commonwealth. You know which one I am  partial toward.   Madam Speaker, I not only thank Chairman Keating for his leadership  in pushing this resolution but also thank him for the eloquent words  that he just spoke. He laid out the situation quite clearly. I would  like to just briefly elaborate.                                time  1345    Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, to his great credit,  said these words about a decade ago: ``There is no doubt, there is  nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody  Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.'' He  further went on to say: ``I am deeply sorry on behalf of the British  Government.''   Now, despite those truly admirable words and despite the findings and  acknowledgment made by successive British Governments, shamefully, none  of the individuals involved in the murder of 14 innocent civilians on  Bloody Sunday have ever been held accountable.   This resolution says: ``The lack of accountability and justice  provided to those who perished from the unlawful use of force on Bloody  Sunday is both shameful and dangerous.''   Madam Speaker, we remember those who perished. We also recognize the  family members of those who were harmed and killed on Bloody Sunday who  fought for decades and decades to finally get justice.   But we must go further than that. A few weeks ago, I led a bipartisan  letter--and, again, this whole effort has been bipartisan, which is  always the case when it comes to the issue of peace in Ireland here in  the United States. I led a bipartisan letter to object to the British  Government's latest plan to institute an amnesty, a blanket amnesty. I  quote from this resolution, which is similar to the letter that we  sent.   ``We oppose any attempt by the British Government to implement  amnesty or statute of limitation laws that would end or inhibit  investigations and prosecutions of crimes committed during the  Troubles, including on Bloody Sunday.''   The resolution further goes on to talk about today and: ``Calls upon  the involved parties to fully implement the Northern Ireland Protocol  as agreed upon in the interest of maintaining peace and stability on  the island of Ireland.''   Madam Speaker, today, in the United States and around the world, as  we celebrate St. Patrick's Day, all of us, whether like me of Irish  descent or not, let us also make sure that we don't lose sight of this  important civil rights issue.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the world right  now, not just Ukraine, but indeed the world, is engaged in a fight  between democracy and autocracy. That is what is at stake on what is  now the battlefields of Ukraine.   I was in Brussels 3 weeks ago at NATO, and I am proud to say I have  never seen the West and the transatlantic alliance this united.  Certainly, not since the days of the Cold War.   Madam Speaker, our trade policy must work in sync with our foreign  policy. That is what we are doing here today by revoking this status on  Russia as well as Belarus. I strongly support it. I am proud of the  fact that the United States and other countries have acted so quickly,  in just a matter of a few weeks, to put the strongest sanctions on  Russia in American history.   We must do this, and we must do even more.
