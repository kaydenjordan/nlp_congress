 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the  Russia questions that are on the minds of so many Americans. We had--I  think, in the midst of all of the debate and controversy and genuine  concern across the country--some good news yesterday when it was  announced that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein had made the decision  to appoint a special counsel and, in this case, former FBI Director  Mueller. That was good news because, No. 1, there was a special counsel  who would undertake a review of these questions and in an independent  fashion. I think people across not just Washington but even across the  country were heartened by the fact that it was someone of the caliber,  the experience, and the dedicated law enforcement commitment that  Director Mueller demonstrated in his years with the FBI as Director, as  a prosecutor. That was good news.   We are grateful for that. I know we will have a chance in a little  while to talk to the Deputy Attorney General about these issues. I  think we have to examine a couple more questions that arise.   So to review, on January 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates  informed the Trump administration that General Flynn had apparently  lied about having conversations with the Russian Ambassador, warning  that it could open him up to blackmail. On May 8, Yates testified  before the Senate Judiciary Committee and stated, contrary to claims by  White House officials, that Flynn had discussed Russian sanctions in  his those conversations with the Russian Ambassador.   On January 27, President Trump hosted Director Comey at the White  House, where the New York Times reported he asked Director Comey to  pledge his loyalty. Director Comey reportedly promised only honesty.   On January 30, President Trump fired Acting Attorney General Yates,  claiming her dismissal was over a matter unrelated to Russia.   On February 13, fully 18 days after the White House was originally  informed by Yates of General Flynn's misconduct, General Flynn was  relieved of his job after it became public that he lied about his  conversations with the Russian Ambassador.   The day after General Flynn was pushed out, the President reportedly  summoned Director Comey to a private meeting in which he took the  extraordinary step of asking him to drop the FBI investigation into  Flynn.   In March and again in May, Director Comey publicly confirmed that  Trump associates were under investigation for possible coordination  with Russia to interfere in the election. On May 9, President Trump  fired Director Comey. His administration initially said it was based on  a recommendation from Attorney General Sessions, who was supposed to be  recused from anything to do with the Russia investigation, and Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who reportedly had been asked by  Director Comey just days earlier for additional funding for the Russia  investigation. But then the President himself revealed he fired  Director Comey explicitly because of the Russia investigation.   The day after, the President tweeted a veiled threat that Director  Comey ``better hope that there are no `tapes' '' of their conversation,  raising the question of whether the President was surreptitiously  recording his Oval Office meetings and whether tapes exist.   While it may be unrelated, it also bears mentioning that, this week,  it was also reported that President Trump revealed highly classified  information to Russian officials in a private Oval Office meeting-- information that could jeopardize critical intelligence assets and risk  undermining relationships with allies.   I think there are some serious questions, even with the special  counsel who has been named, even with two Intelligence Committees  reviewing these matters. I would hope that, in addition to those  reviews that are being undertaken--those investigations--that we also  have an independent commission to get all of the answers we need so  that we can ensure the American people that this will never happen  again--that no foreign government, in this case, a foreign adversary,  can interfere in an election at any time in our future.   That guarantee will not be ironclad unless we know exactly what  happened and why it happened, and then we take a series of steps to  prevent it from happening. We should be very clear with the Russian  Federation that if they do this again, they will be sanctioned, and  there will be a consequence in response to their actions. We won't be  able to do any of that unless we find the answers.   Here are a couple of basic questions I hope would be a part of the  deliberations, not just of the two committees or other committees that  might review this but also the deliberations and work of the special  counsel and his team.   The first question is, Why does the President believe that the  Russian election interference investigation is baseless, which is  contrary to the unanimous finding of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies?  These agencies issued a ``high confidence'' assessment of the  determination they made. That is a technical term in the intelligence  circles that they don't use lightly.   Based upon the findings of those intelligence agencies and that  finding being of high confidence, why does the President continue to  question or even undermine that determination?   Question No. 2 is, Why did Attorney General Sessions, who had to  recuse himself from the Russian investigation, weigh in on the firing  of the FBI Director responsible for that very investigation? That is a  question, I think, a number of people are asking.   Question No. 3 is, Can the Justice Department's political leaders-- individuals who have just come in with this administration and  officials in the Justice Department--be trusted not to interfere in the  ongoing FBI investigation? That is a question.   Question No. 4 is, Why, immediately after firing Director Comey and  amid the uproar about interference in the Russian investigation that it  created, did the President convene a private meeting with the Russian  Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador in the Oval Office and  allow the Russian state media--the Soviet-era state media entity--to  cover that meeting while keeping out the U.S. media? I think that is a  question that a lot of people have.   Question No. 5 is, Why did the President reveal highly classified  information to the Russian Federation, according to the reporting by  the Washington Post and others, during this meeting with the Russian  Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador, and what are the  implications of that disclosure? That is something that we need to have  answers to.   At least these five questions--you could add many more--are  critically important questions. In some respects, there are even more  urgent questions in front of us, and I will focus a little bit on those  today--basically, three, I guess.   No. 1, did the President intentionally interfere with the ongoing FBI  investigation into his associates, people that were on his campaign or  on the campaign or working in the government now? The interference  question  [[Page S3039]]  seems more likely than not based upon the reporting, but we have to  know for sure, one way or the other: Did the President intentionally  interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation?   No. 2, are any such efforts to interfere ongoing?   If the answer to the first question is yes--and we don't know for  certain if it is question yes, but if it is yes--if there was  intentional interference with the investigation by the President, the  second question would be, Are there any such efforts to interfere that  are ongoing?   No. 3, do they extend--meaning this potential alleged interference-- past the FBI inquiry, to the investigations in the Senate and the House  of Representatives? I think that is a question that is rather urgent as  well.   Will this attempt to interfere, or alleged attempt to interfere,  carry over into other investigations?   In essence now, we have three inquiries. One is the House  Intelligence Committee, the other is the Senate Intelligence Committee,  and the third would be Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. They  are all critically important.   I would hope that we could add a fourth to that, which would be an  independent commission, like the 9/11 Commission, where we came to  definitive conclusions with regard to what happened on 9/11. Then,  added to those conclusions, there were a series of recommendations so  that we could prevent another 9/11. The same could be said here--that  we want to make sure we get answers to these questions, have  conclusions made, have accountability with regard to those conclusions,  but then have a series of recommendations about how to prevent Russian  interference or the interference of any foreign adversary in our  election ever again.   Director Comey himself warned about the danger of undue influence on  FBI investigations in an exchange during a May 3 Senate Judiciary  Committee hearing. In this case, it was Senator Hirono, a Democratic  Senator from Hawaii, who asked if the Attorney General or senior  Justice Department officials had ever ordered the FBI to halt an  investigation.   Interestingly, here is what Director Comey replied to that question:  ``Not in my experience,'' meaning not in his experience does he know of  an instance where the Justice Department officials interfered with an  FBI investigation.   I will read it again.         Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to       tell the FBI to stop doing something.    Then, he continues on, and it picks up with this:         [W]ithout an appropriate purpose. . . . a situation where       we were told to stop something for a political reason, that       would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.    That is the now former FBI Director saying that there is no  precedence for the idea that the Justice Department would ask the FBI  to take an action, which would be interference.   Director Comey was talking about the Department of Justice in this  case--actions by the Department of Justice to interfere with an FBI  investigation. In retrospect, perhaps a better question would have been  whether the political interference he thought would be a ``very big  deal'' might have been coming directly from the Oval Office. It is  essential that we get to the bottom of this--a number of these  questions.   An issue of this importance requires that the full investigative  power of the Federal Government be brought to bear. The House and  Senate Intel Committees are doing their investigation, as I said. The  FBI investigation continues as well, despite concerns about  independence in the wake of Director Comey's firing.   I hope, and I expect, that the next FBI Director will be someone who  will be as independent, as capable, and as committed as Director  Mueller is as the new special counsel.   We know there are dedicated professionals running these  investigations. It has long been my belief that these extraordinary  circumstances demand even more. I have been repeating for some time  that we need a greater level of independence to insulate this  critically important investigation from any suspicion of partisan  interference. That is why I have been calling--for many weeks now,  since early March--for a special counsel. I am glad the Justice  Department now agrees with me.   Suffice it to say that we have a lot more work to do. Ultimately,  this will be the work of everyone here, even if you are not a member of  the Intel Committee or any other committee that is doing work that is  directly relevant to this because, ultimately, the Congress has to take  actions to get to the bottom of these questions but also be part of the  process, at least, of imposing accountability and, also, especially the  Congress is going to have to play a major role--the leading role--in  making sure we put in place policies and procedures and laws that  prevent this from ever happening again.    I hope the administration will join us in taking every step necessary  to get to the bottom of these questions and to insist and to ensure  that this never happens again to any American election. That is not  just a goal, that has to be a guarantee as a result of this process. If  the administration is not committed to that, I am not sure what they  are committed to.   To take lightly or to ignore a problem that is this great and this  serious, to undermine our democracy is, I think, to put at risk the  very foundation of our Nation as a nation of laws and not of men, a  nation that is committed to the rule of law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
