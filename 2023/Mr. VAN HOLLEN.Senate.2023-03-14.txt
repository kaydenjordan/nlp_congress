 Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge Bernard E.  ``Bernie'' Doyle, who is retiring on 20 April 2023, after more than 40  years of combined military and Federal civil service to our country.  After graduating from the George Washington University with a bachelor  of arts degree in journalism and speech, Mr. Doyle received his Air  Force officer commission in April 1979 as a public affairs officer.  With unbounded ambition, Mr. Doyle was selected for the Air Force's  Funded Legal Education Program and attended the University of Maryland  Law School from 1981 to 1984. Upon his graduation from law school in  October 1984, Mr. Doyle entered the second chapter of his military  service as a judge advocate in the U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate  General's Corps and never looked back.   Rising through military ranks and responsibilities through the years,  Mr. Doyle was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and oversaw 11  attorneys in the Air Force Legal Service Agency's Employment Litigation  Branch. He also personally conducted over 200 trials and appellate  litigation in Federal employment discrimination cases and trial and  appellate litigation before military courts martial and the appellate  courts for the Air Force and the Armed Forces. Among the highlights of  his military legal career was his experience defending the accused in  three capital murder courts martial. With humility, he would share the  profound impact that this experience had on his formative years as a  military officer and an attorney in finding courage and compassion  within the military justice system.   After his retirement from the Air Force in December 1998, Mr. Doyle  continued his public service as an administrative judge with the Merit  Systems Protection Board--MSPB--an appeals counsel in the MSPB's Office  of the Appeals Counsel, and then as an assistant general counsel for  the MSPB Office of the General Counsel. To no one's surprise, Mr.  Doyle's managerial skills and legal acumen were quickly recognized by  his leaders and peers, which led to his selection as the chief counsel  to the vice chairman in a non-career Senior Executive Service position.  During Mr. Doyle's 11-year tenure at MSPB, he worked extensively on  MSPB precedential opinions and successfully defended MSPB final  decisions before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Several of his cases, such as Ward v. U.S. Postal Service, Kirkendall  v. Army, Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice, and Becker v. Department  of Veterans Affairs, continue to serve as the guiding principles on due  process rights for Federal employees and employment benefits and  protections for veterans and military servicemembers.   Mr. Doyle joined the National Guard Bureau Office of the General  Counsel as an associate general counsel in the Litigation and  Employment Law Division in September 2014. His leadership and  dedication to excellence was critical in managing and advocating for  [[Page S771]]  the National Guard's interests in the most complex novel litigation  against the National Guard. Specifically, he worked tirelessly with the  Office of the Solicitor General on several cases concerning National  Guard members' State and Federal military service, benefits, and  employment protections before the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Doyle was  also instrumental in drafting and implementing key reform legislation  that improved the workplace conditions and benefits for 54,000 National  Guard military technicians and civil service employees in the 54  States, Territories, and the District of Columbia. He also led the  effort to overhaul the National Guard Discrimination Complaint Program,  the first in the program's 21 years of existence, to ensure that the  National Guard in the 54 States, Territories, and the District of  Columbia maintains a workplace free of unlawful employment  discrimination.   Mr. Doyle has dedicated his entire career to public service,  improving the quality of employment conditions for Federal civilian  employees and Air Force and National Guard servicemembers. He did so by  changing minds person by person, by litigating case by case, and by  providing technical assistance for statutory drafting line by line.  Throughout his career, Mr. Doyle also mentored countless employment and  labor relations military and civil service attorneys nationwide. For  many attorneys, Mr. Doyle was often their first port of call when  facing a complicated employment law case or when they just needed words  of encouragement. Because of his legal advocacy and effect on those  whom he influenced, Mr. Doyle's impact on labor and employment law will  be felt for many years to come, as will his impact on the many, many  lives he changed for the better.                            ____________________
