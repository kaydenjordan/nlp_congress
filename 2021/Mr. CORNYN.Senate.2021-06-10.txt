 Madam President, last year, our friends across the aisle  painted a picture of doom and gloom of what governing with a Republican  Senate minority might look like. They forecasted unprecedented  obstruction, endless stonewalling, and the inability to get anything  done.   Now, there is nothing more popular than the myth that Congress is  unable to get anything done. It is pretty popular. The press,  uncritically, reports it, even when it is demonstrably false. But it is  safe to say the vision painted by our Democratic colleagues of doom and  gloom with a Republican Senate minority of unprecedented obstruction,  endless stonewalling, and inability to get things done--well, that  hadn't come to pass.   Actually, I feel like I am doing a Washington Post fact check. But  over the past few months, Republicans and Democrats have actually  worked together to make progress on a number of issues.   One, I am sure the Biden administration would confirm that we have  been able to confirm a number of nominees for high-ranking positions in  the Federal Government with broad bipartisan support.   We extended the popular Paycheck Protection Program that was part of  the CARES Act, which was the major COVID-19 relief bill that passed  overwhelmingly last year on a bipartisan basis. We did that because we  all recognized the importance of small businesses continuing to take  advantage of this lifeline until they could safely reopen.   We took action, on a bipartisan basis, to combat the increase in hate  crimes against Asian Americans. We provided States with additional  resources to upgrade their drinking and wastewater infrastructure.   And this week we passed historic legislation to improve the way we  counter the threat from the Chinese Communist Party, the so-called  Endless Frontier Act. It included a $52 billion emergency appropriation  to make sure that we weren't dependent on imports of semiconductors,  which are so essential to our economy and to our national security.   That is not all. The Environment and Public Works Committee advanced  a bipartisan surface transportation bill. That is actually the second  time--first under Republican leadership, now under Democratic  leadership--that the Environment and Public Works Committee has  advanced a bipartisan, unanimously supported surface transportation  bill.   The Judiciary Committee that I serve on unanimously has approved  three bills to support our men and women in blue. And two committees,  the Rules Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, just released a bipartisan report--127 pages long, if I am  not mistaken--on the events surrounding January 6.   You would be hard pressed to count the number of bipartisan bills  that have actually been introduced in the  [[Page S4039]]  last few months, just in 6 months of the Biden administration:  legislation to bring down prescription drug prices, enhance cyber  security, which is an increasingly scary and frightening issue,  especially with the Colonial Pipeline, the JBS hack, and the SolarWinds  hack by the Russians.   We also know we need to improve our electric grid infrastructure,  which we have bills doing that. And then we also have even a bipartisan  bill to address the humanitarian crisis on the southern border-- bipartisan, bicameral.   These are some of the bills that I have introduced, and when you add  to it the work being done by other Members of the Senate, you have a  long list of opportunities for us to work together on behalf of the  American people. I believe this is the type of results and consensus  that the American people had hoped for after the last election because,  the truth is, neither party got a mandate after the last election.   I know President Biden won the election, but we have a 50-50 Senate,  and Speaker Pelosi has a very slim majority in the House. And we have a  President who, I think, inspired all of us when he started talking  about healing the separations in our Nation and appealing to a promise  of unity.   I can tell you one thing, that 2020 wasn't a mandate to pass a  radical agenda. It was a call for us to work together. I don't know any  other way you can interpret a 50-50 Senate. And I believe there is no  better time for us to get work done on behalf of our constituents in  the Senate.   There is, perhaps, the apocryphal story of George Washington, who  told Thomas Jefferson that the Senate was meant to be the saucer to  cool House legislation, like how a saucer apparently was used at the  time to cool hot tea. There certainly is a lot of hot tea in the House  these days, and the filibuster, I believe, and the 60-vote requirement  to cut off debate is core to the Senate's ability to perform its  constitutional function--to cool off the debate and to talk about the  greater good and to force us to do something that maybe we don't do  naturally, which is to force us to work together.   The Founders understood that if you passed legislation on a purely  partisan basis, well, the next 2 years after the election, the next 4  years after a new President, the new majority, the new President, could  simply undo it. And we have seen a lot of that, unfortunately-- admittedly, on both sides of the aisle.   But when you have to get 60 votes in the Senate to pass legislation  that impacts the lives of 330 million Americans, it strikes me that is  a pretty commonsense way to force us to do, again, maybe what might  seem unnatural to us but we have to do for the benefit of the American  people. It forces us to pass bipartisan bills and makes passing  partisan bills impossible.   Now, I know both parties. There is a reason why people are Democrats  and a reason why people are Republicans. We have different ideas,  different priorities, different ways of going about doing things,  perhaps to achieve a result that we would all agree on, a different  means to an end. But the fact of the matter is, notwithstanding our  preference, perhaps, to have our policies succeed over those of our  Democratic colleagues, that is not always necessarily in the best  interest of the American people. What is in the best interest of the  American people is to have us work together.   Just 4 years ago--it is amazing how time flies and how much people's  positions change depending on where they sit. Well, 4 years ago, now- Majority Leader Senator Schumer, the Senator from New York, said we  should ``build a firewall around the legislative filibuster.''   Believe me, that 60-vote requirement looks a lot better when you are  in the minority than it does when you are in the majority. As a matter  of fact, when President Trump was in the White House and we had a  Republican majority in the Senate, I can't tell you how many times he  pressed on Leader McConnell to eliminate the filibuster because it was  an impediment to him getting what he wanted done. But he wasn't looking  at the long game or the long-term consequences of doing that. Senator  McConnell, on the other hand, having been in the Senate a long time,  understood that short-term gain was not worth the long-term pain.   But Senator Schumer called it the most important distinction between  the House and the Senate, this consensus-building mechanism known as  the filibuster. But, today, Senator Schumer perhaps has succumbed to  the temptation, once you are in the majority, to say: Anything that  gets in my way, any impediment to getting what I want, like the 60-vote  requirement, we need to do away with it. So he has done a complete 180.  Clearing the way for a radical agenda is priority No. 1.    I understand the political pressures that come within our political  parties, and it is pretty clear to me that the pressure on our friends  in the Democratic Party is from the progressive left, who want to push  the party farther and farther to the left. But that is not a reason for  us to give up our previous convictions or principles.   Apparently, our Democratic colleagues--not all, but some of our  Democratic colleagues--apparently have abandoned the long-held belief  that the filibuster is a vital stabilizing force, and they are on the  warpath to eliminate it. You can tell by the language that is being  used. Some have called the filibuster a ``weapon of mass destruction,''  ``a death grip of democracy.''   And here is perhaps the most despicable description when, I think it  was, President Obama himself, who spoke at John Lewis's funeral, called  the filibuster a ``Jim Crow relic,'' essentially suggesting that  anybody who supported this vital stabilizing mechanism was a racist.  And he gave tacit permission to other people to play the race card when  it comes to the filibuster.   Well, it hasn't even been a year since our Democratic colleagues used  this ``Jim Crow relic'' to block an anti-lynching bill. This was part  of the police reform bill that Senator Tim Scott led that was  filibustered by our Democratic friends.   I still remember being on the floor when then-Senator Kamala Harris  and Cory Booker, who were the chief advocates for this anti-lynching  provision in the police reform bill, were part of the core of Democrats  who filibustered that bill. They filibustered their own anti-lynching  bill. So when somebody wants to play the race card and say that this is  used for improper purposes, their own actions demonstrate the hypocrisy  of that argument.   The inconvenient truth for our Democratic colleagues is that they  have filibustered bill after bill when they were the minority party  over the last 6 years. But I know memories are short around here. The  impulse to get something done today may cause people to do things that  they later would regret. We certainly have seen that in the George W.  Bush administration when then-Leader Reid decided to raise the bar for  judicial confirmations to 60 votes for cloture and blocked a number of  George W. Bush's judges.   Of course, we know how that story ended. Ultimately, we got back to  the status quo ante after we went through years of fights, gangs  meeting and coming up with tentative compromises. And then, ultimately,  with the use of the same precedent setting or the appeal of the ruling  of the Chair, that then was used to bring the number back down to 51,  where it had, in essence, been forever, when Neil Gorsuch was  confirmed. So it is important for us to remember that what goes around  comes around here, and what might seem expedient today may prove to be  pretty painful tomorrow.   Well, we know our Democratic colleagues have used this so-called Jim  Crow relic--and, again, I think that is completely inaccurate to use it  that way. This is how the Senate functions. Our Democrats are within  their rights when they employ the filibuster to kill countless pieces  of legislation, whether it is pandemic relief, government funding, pro- life legislation, or police reform. The list goes on and on.   Again, I don't particularly like it when the minority filibusters  legislation I would like to see passed, but what that means is it is an  invitation and, really, a command to us to roll up our sleeves and work  harder to try to find common ground. Really, if you think about it,  eliminating the filibuster is a lazy way of legislating because it  means you don't have to do the hard work. You don't have to build  bipartisan consensus. You don't have to worry about stabilizing our  laws so  [[Page S4040]]  that they don't change dramatically every 2 years or every 4 years  depending on who is in charge.   So we don't have to wonder how our Democratic colleagues felt about  the filibuster when it was of benefit to them because they made  countless statements and even put their feelings in writing. When  Republicans held control of the House and the Senate and the White  House, our Democratic colleagues were afraid the filibuster would be  eliminated. They were afraid we would do what we did not do but that  which Leader Schumer and others are advocating now, which is to  eliminate the filibuster so we could get--they were worried that we  would eliminate the filibuster to get what we wanted rather than have  to work together on a bipartisan basis.   So the shoe is truly on the other foot now that Democrats have a  nominal majority in a 50-50 Senate but with the tie-breaking vote of  the Vice President. That is why Senator Schumer gets to be the floor  leader even though he doesn't command a majority of Senators.   Back then, when Democrats were in the minority and they were worried  about eliminating the filibuster, 33 of them--33--signed a letter  insisting that the filibuster be preserved. Among them was the now Vice  President, then Senator Kamala Harris.   Senator McConnell, being an institutionalist at heart, agreed, and he  never wavered to pressure from anyone, even President Trump, to  eliminate the filibuster. But now the tables have turned, and so have  many of our colleagues' views on the filibuster.   Instead of resisting pressure to blow up the rules of the Senate and  perhaps change it forever, Leader Schumer has gladly accepted his  marching orders from the radical left, and he is trying to dismantle  the longstanding rules of the Senate, what makes it exceptional, as he  said, different from the House--way back when.   Senator Schumer banked on Republican obstruction to justify going  nuclear. He is trying to set up a series of votes in order to justify  going nuclear to change the Senate into the House, to eliminate the  bipartisan command of that 60-vote requirement.   So he engaged in a lot of doom-and-gloom forecasting to predict that  Republicans would willy-nilly filibuster Democrat legislation, but it  hasn't come to pass. So now he is trying to orchestrate a series of  votes that are designed to fail. And they are just that--designed to  fail--because they don't represent the kind of hard work that goes into  building bipartisan consensus in the Senate.   We kicked things off earlier this week with a vote on a bill that  would exploit the cause of pay fairness to line the pockets of trial  lawyers.   We will soon vote on the Democratic Party's attempt to seize  authority from the States to run elections. This is a bill so extreme  that a number of Democrats have said they will not vote for it.   Who knows what might be next, whether it is packing the Supreme  Court, making Puerto Rico or Washington, DC, a State with two  Democratic Senators each, or whether they will try to use this to erode  the constitutional rights of American citizens, for example, under the  Second Amendment. But blocking these bills isn't an example of  Republican obstruction; it is a destructive act of political theater.   Well, thank goodness there are enough Democrats who are opposed to  eliminating the filibuster, apparently. So it appears that Democrats  don't have the votes to make this horribly miscalculated rules change.  Two of our colleagues have made clear in their statement that they have  the courage to stand up for what they believe is right, despite the  pressure they are receiving from the far left.   Senators Manchin and Sinema have repeatedly said they will oppose  efforts to eliminate the filibuster. They won't accept the short-term  gain for long-term pain. Unlike the rest of their conference, their  caucus, they recognize the inherent dangers of making this strictly a  51-vote majority institution. They seem to be following the advice of  what then-Senator Barack Obama gave back in 2005 when then-Senator  Obama said:         If the majority chooses to end the filibuster . . . then       the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only       get worse.    The American people deserve better than that. Chipping away at the  right of the minority may seem expedient now, but Democrats would be  sure to regret those changes one day, just as they now regret the day  that Harry Reid cleared an easy path for hundreds of conservative  Federal judges.   In two years, Republicans could win the majority in either or both of  the Chambers. In 4, a Republican could win the White House, as well.  How would our Democratic colleagues feel then when their rights as  Members of the minority are disparaged and ignored? Would our  Democratic colleagues support their rule changes then? Would they then  believe the Senate minority should be silenced and made irrelevant, as  apparently some believe now?   Well, I find it hard to believe that that would be the case. The  thing about power in Washington is it is never permanent. Majorities  and Presidents change. And there is a reason why the rules should stay  the same. If Democrats had the votes to eliminate the filibuster, our  country would face a tidal wave of changes: defunding the police,  election law hijacking by the Federal Government over the States and  local jurisdictions, tax hikes as high as the mind can conceive,  restricted rights under the Constitution. You get the picture.   But when the tide inevitably turns, which it will at some point, then  the temptation would be on the part of the Republicans to reverse all  of those changes. The economy, the government, the average American  family would be in a constant whiplash.   The requirement to get 60 votes to close off debate in the Senate is  designed to protect our country from the relatively rapid changes of  majorities and Presidents, and eliminating it would do serious,  irreparable harm, as many of the quoted comments by distinguished  Democrats have stated in the past, if not today, at least in the past.  So I agree with what Senator Schumer said 4 years ago: We should build  a firewall around it.   But in the meantime, there is still a lot of bipartisan work being  done here in the Senate, even under the current rules, without the  thermonuclear device of blowing up the 60-vote cloture requirement  known as the filibuster. But every day that the Democratic leader  wastes on political theater, which he knows is not going to succeed, is  a day we have wasted in passing bipartisan legislation that will  benefit all of the American people, not just a partisan majority.   This is the world's greatest deliberative body. It may be one of the  last ones in existence. I don't know any other place in our country or  around the world where Senators can come down to the Senate floor and  express their views no matter how unpopular, no matter how politically  incorrect, but engage in actual debate and exchange of views, which  ultimately give the American people the best opportunity to make up  their own minds about what policies they agree with and who they trust  to protect their welfare.   This is the world's greatest deliberative body. There are far more  important ways to spend our time than on political theater.   I yield the floor.
