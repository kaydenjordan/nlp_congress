 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the Russell County High  School baseball team, the Kentucky State High School runners-up. Their  head coach, David Rexroat, has led the Lakers baseball team since 2002.  He is the all-time winningest baseball coach at Russell County, and he  was recently inducted into the Kentucky High School Baseball Coaches  Hall of Fame.   Russell County began their journey to the State tournament by winning  the 16th District baseball tournament, which includes my home school of  Monroe County. They have won the 16th District 9 of the last 10 years.  They won the region, the 4th Region in Bowling Green, and went on to  Louisville to the State. They made it all the way to the State finals,  to the State championship game.   The Russell County Lakers baseball team had nine seniors on that team  that had played together most of their lives. They finished the season  31-7, the most wins in Russell County school history.   Madam Speaker, that State championship game was in Louisville,  Kentucky, against St. Xavier, which is one of the largest high schools  in the State. It is about a 2\1/2\ hour drive from Russell County to  Louisville. Ninety-five percent of the crowd was from the small county  of Russell County. This community is proud of this baseball team and  their great accomplishment. I commend them for a tremendous baseball  season.                            ____________________
