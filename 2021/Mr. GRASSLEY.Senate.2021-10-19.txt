 Thank you, Senator Crapo, for leading this effort to  point out what is wrong with this $4.2-trillion reckless tax-and- spending spree. It is a massive government intrusion into the daily  lives of American families.   Under their vision for America, there isn't any aspect of life in  which the government shouldn't perform a leading role. From cradle to  grave, childcare to healthcare, college to career, the Federal  Government will be  [[Page S7056]]  there in your lives, shaping your every decision.   Their plans go well beyond shoring up the social safety net to  prevent those in need from falling through the cracks. And everybody  agrees that people that have needs, there is a role for government. But  that doesn't include 320 million Americans.   No longer, then, will the Federal Government's primary role be about  lending a helping hand so individuals can get back on their own feet.  Instead, government would be the ultimate helicopter parent, constantly  hovering, regardless of need.   Even wealthy households would be in line for generous handouts to  procure Federal Government-approved childcare, send their kids to a  Federal Government-structured preschool, purchase Federal Government- approved health insurance on the individual market, and obtain Federal  Government-provided paid family leave.   Isn't that a staggering list of things that the Democrats are  proposing in this 4.2 tax-and-spending spree they are pushing?   On the one hand, my Democratic colleagues rail against the wealthy  paying too little tax. On the other hand, they want to shower the  wealthy with government benefits, not to mention hand the wealthy, for  instance, $12,500 to purchase a luxury electric car and make Federal  taxpayers subsidize the State tax bills of millionaires.   Can you believe the inconsistency of their arguments?   Tax the wealthy; give to the wealthy. At the same time, Democrats  have decided that the best way to crack down on billionaires evading  taxes is to snoop on the middle class. You just heard Senator Crapo  speak at length about that. Under their proposal, every American's bank  account with $600, or even if it is $10,000, of annual taxations would  be subject to the peering eyes of the IRS.   Democrats are betting the promise of free gifts will be too enticing  for Americans to resist. However, Americans understand anything  advertised as free comes with strings. Particularly, if it is free from  the government, there is going to be strings attached. Those strings  include higher taxes today and in the future and any loss of control  over intimate family decisions.   Liberal Democrats, in their progressive bubble, are under the  mistaken impression the general public is clamoring for evermore  government programs. Now, in reality, Americans have long held a  healthy skepticism of Big Government. A recent Gallup poll shows this  continues to be true to this very day. According to Gallup--I think it  was a weekend poll--nearly 80 percent of Americans say that they prefer  lower taxes and less government, or would like to see no change in  either. Only 19 percent said they wanted more taxes and more  government.   President Clinton--up until 21 years ago, the President of the United  States--understood this well when, in 1996, he declared in a State of  Union message, ``the era of big government is over,'' and then worked  with Republicans on comprehensive welfare reform.   Why can't those things go on today?   Hopefully, President Biden and Senate Democrats come to their senses  and realize this before taking our Nation down the path of fiscal ruin.  And I would define ``fiscal ruin'' by a Democrat by the name of Larry  Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton  administration--and I think he also had some posts in the Obama  administration--anyway, he told us in January, he told us in April, he  told us in August, and I saw it again on television just last week:  Spending all this money is feeding the fires of inflation like gasoline  on that fire, and we ought to learn not to go through what we did in  the seventies and eighties with inflation out of control.   Listen to that, fellow Democrats, today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I hear about rising costs of  prescription drugs at nearly every one of my townhall meetings.   Three years ago, I began a bipartisan effort to lower prescription  drug costs. Following our Finance Committee hearings at that time, we  had a markup, and we had bipartisan negotiations. Senator Wyden, now  chairman of the Finance Committee, and I introduced, at that time, the  Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act.   The bill caps yearly out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors at $3,100.  It prevents drug costs from growing faster than the consumer price  index on a yearly basis. It ends uncapped taxpayer-funded subsidies to  Big Pharma. It creates more sunshine, more competition, and it even has  oversight into the world of drug pricing. It brings meaningful reform  while driving down costs. It has $72 billion in savings for seniors-- that is out-of-pocket costs to them--and $95 billion savings of  taxpayers' money through Medicare.   An important goal that we accomplish in our bill is lowering drug  costs without hurting innovation. We did this by keeping government out  of the business of setting prices and indirectly keep the government  out of your medicine cabinet.   Democrats have proposed the irresponsible idea of government  dictating drug prices. They would do this by getting rid of the  noninterference clause in the Part D part of Medicare. It is better  known as so-called drug price negotiations, but it is not negotiation;  it is dictating prices.   Eighteen years ago, I was the principle architect of the Medicare  Part D Program. Adding a prescription drug benefit for seniors was the  right thing to do then, and it is still the right thing to do, but it  needed to be done in the right way, and that right way is for the  patients.   In creating Part D, we enacted a very key policy: keeping the  government out of the business of dictating drug prices. Governments  don't negotiate; they dictate. Competition is the only thing that  drives innovation, curbs costs, expands coverage, and improves  outcomes.    The Congressional Budget Office has consistently stated that  government negotiations of drug prices would not achieve greater  savings than the current market-based system, unless you restrict the  formulary or dictate the price through reference pricing based upon  what socialist healthcare systems pay in other countries. That is the  outcome. The government gets between you and your doctors prescribing.   Democrats propose so-called drug price negotiations in their reckless  tax-and-spending spree to save hundreds of billions of dollars. Who is  hurt by this policy? Of course, patients are.   The Democrats would have government dictate drug pricing based upon  an international reference pricing index. Study after study has shown  so-called drug pricing negotiations will reduce the number of new drugs  produced. What your doctor wants to prescribe for you might not be on  that formulary.   This policy would be devastating if one of those drugs was the cure  for Alzheimer's or diabetes or cancer. I don't believe that is what  Americans want.   While Democrats attempt to advance their partisan drug pricing  scheme, I hope common sense will prevail, and we pass a bipartisan  prescription drug bill. I have engaged with colleagues on both sides of  the aisle and in a bicameral way. I did this so common sense would  prevail, if we ever get to the point of Democrats realizing that the  government dictating prices on an international basis of what the  prices are in other countries will never get 60 votes here in the U.S.  Senate.   All of the Republicans and Democrats I have contacted have expressed  eagerness to find a solution to meaningfully lower prescription drug  costs. Holding Big Pharma accountable has historically been a  bipartisan effort.   Delivering new reforms to fight price hikes should be no different.  Democrats should stop pursuing their reckless tax-and-spending spree  that will hurt innovation and produce less cures. Instead, we should  act by passing my bipartisan prescription drug bill.   I think maybe there is an inkling of good news coming from the  Speaker of the House--and I have had a chance to visit with her at  least three times in the last 2 years on this very subject about my  bill--when she said that she didn't think--I don't know whether she  referred to the number H.R. 3, but that is the bill that has their main  effort on reducing prescription drugs--when she said that she didn't  think that that would have the votes to get passed.   I hope there is some awakening to the fact that we need to do  something and that this bipartisan approach is the answer.                             Trump Investigation    Mr. President, today I would like to discuss the media's complete  misrepresentation of the Republican report on Senator Durbin's Trump  investigation, in which my staff participated according to Committee  rules.   I gave an October 7 speech on this subject, and you wouldn't know  that anybody read my speech based upon what has been reported on TV.  But as I noted in that October 7 speech, Senator Durbin publicly  released a Democratic staff report on his investigation. We Republicans  did the same thing that very same day.   I came to the floor that same day to describe the Republican report.  In so doing, I laid out what the available facts and evidence showed  within the scope of the inquiry. That scope was from December 14, 2020,  to January 3, 2021. But TV seemed to think we were talking about what  happened on Capitol Hill on January 6.   The Durbin investigation ended on January 3--or events leading up to  January 3. I say that date range yet again because many reporters have  wrongly conflated this investigation with the January 6, 2021, events  here on Capitol Hill. We know all the damage that was done to the  Capitol that day.   So I want to repeat: The scope of the investigation stopped on  January 3, not January 6, but you wouldn't know it from the TV reports.   I am not going to rehash my entire speech. I have incorporated it  here by reference. However, I will note, yet again for the media,  several key facts. This is not analysis, as I think TV was trying to  do, just the facts.   Fact 1. Records indicate that President Trump's focus was on  ``legitimate complaints and reports of crimes.'' And those words come  from the transcript.   Fact 2. Witnesses testified that President Trump's main focus was  making the Justice Department aware of the potential criminal  allegations and to  [[Page S7058]]  ensure the Department did its job. Trump's focus then wasn't to direct  or order specific investigative steps. And to that point, witnesses  said that Trump's focus was on the American people--not himself or his  campaign--being harmed by what he believed to be widespread election  fraud.   Fact 3, these witnesses testified under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which makes  it a crime to give false statements, that it was not unreasonable for  President Trump to question what the Justice Department was doing to  investigate election fraud and crime allegations.   In fact, one witness testified under 1001 that Trump had ``no  impact''--those two words--on the Department's actions to investigate  election allegations.   I would be remiss if I didn't also note that one witness testified  under 1001 that the Justice Department was ``dragging their feet and  maybe more to keep these investigations from going forward.''   Fact 4, my staff read former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District  of Georgia, BJ Pak, a press release from the Biden administration where  Biden set policy for the Justice Department by prohibiting it from  using subpoenas for records of reporters in criminal leak  investigations.   My staff then asked if any President has similar authority to set the  Department's policy with respect to investigating and reviewing voter  fraud and election crime allegations. This witness stated, ``I would  agree that the President has that duty.''   And the last fact, 5, President Trump twice rejected firing Acting  Attorney General Rosen, and twice rejected the notion of sending what  is called the ``draft Clark letter.''   Now, after giving you those facts, accordingly, on the basis of this  foundational evidence, with respect to the scope of this investigation  from December 14, 2020, to January 3, 2021, President Trump sought and  followed the advice and also the recommendations of his senior  advisers. I note with specific emphasis the fact that he followed their  advice and recommendations. This is a crucial fact.   The report is entitled ``In Their Own Words.'' It is based on actual  witness evidence, not CNN-style partisan analysis. I encourage everyone  to read the report and the transcripts and draw your own conclusions.  That is how I always approached my investigations in the years that I  have been in the U.S. Senate.   Now let's go to how my speech was reported on TV. Some on CNN have  said that I showed ``fealty'' to Trump by stating the facts. They  called these facts that I just recited ``delusional.'' I have never had  a problem following the facts wherever they lead, no matter who is in  power.   So I am going to refer to an investigation I did in the Trump  administration, and it involved some people in the Trump--and close to  President Trump.   I ran a transcribed interview on Donald Trump, Jr., during the Trump  administration. That was done as part of my Trump-Russia investigation  when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which focused on the  June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting.   I also subpoenaed Paul Manafort to appear at a hearing and provide  testimony. Instead of publicly testifying, Manafort voluntarily agreed  to an interview with my and then-Ranking Member Feinstein's staff. But  as the ranking member's staff then refused to interview him and  objected to my staff doing so without them there, that didn't move  forward.   Notably, the committee never received any--when I was chairman during  this investigation I am talking about, the committee never received any  emails from the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign,  even though we repeatedly asked for them. Of course, the Democrats  wouldn't support subpoenaing them, and you didn't hear a lot about that  from the media--the double standard media. The Trump campaign produced  records.   Just like there is a coverage vacuum, particularly by CNN, of Hunter  Biden and James Biden and their connection with the communist Chinese  Government, my and Senator Johnson's September 20 report on those  financial connections and their potential criminality was attacked as  Russian disinformation. Later on, Hunter Biden publicly admitted that  he was under criminal investigation for financial matters. I don't hear  much about that on CNN.   In my and Johnson's report, we made clear that based upon deep  financial connections between the Biden family and foreign governments,  Hunter Biden is a counterintelligence and extortion concern.   On that note, recently released emails have opened up the possibility  that Joe Biden mixed bank accounts and funds with Hunter Biden. Other  emails show that Joe Biden shared office space with individuals  connected to the communist Chinese regime.   Of course, my and Senator Johnson's report was the first to prove  that Hunter Biden, James Biden, and other family members had extensive  financial and business relationships with individuals not just  connected to the communist Chinese regime, but its intelligence and  military services.   About that Grassley and Johnson report, POLITICO ran the off-base  headline: ``GOP Senators' anti-Biden report repackages old claims.''   In contrast, one of their own reporters just very recently confirmed  the authenticity of some of Hunter Biden's emails for a book that he  was writing.   One Washington Post columnist said: ``Even after accepting  disinformation from Russian agents, Johnson and Grassley couldn't come  up with anything new or interesting on Hunter Biden.''   And NPR said about the New York Post Hunter Biden stories: ``We don't  want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we  don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that  are just pure distractions.''   Now, compare what I have said--how different Democrats and  Republicans are treated; how investigations are done differently by  Republicans and by Democrats--and then look at the state of journalism  today. What I just said is so much for investigative journalism.  Investigative journalism died without so much as a whimper.   The media's attack against the Republican Trump report is essentially  an attack on witness testimony received by the committee. Time and  again, many in the media have failed to meet the facts head-on in order  to fit their own biased story line.   So I say to everybody, including journalists that don't want to do  hard work: Read the testimony of those people that were taken on what  went on between December 14 and January 3. Read what I say about it.  Read what Senator Durbin says about it. But at least read the testimony  if you are going to make comments distorting what I said on October 7.  In other words, stop screwing up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
