 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend,  Simpson County Judge Executive Jim Henderson from the First  Congressional District of Kentucky.   Judge Henderson has served his community since 1998, when he was  elected as the youngest county judge executive in Kentucky, and has  continually devoted himself to organizations which advance the  development and prosperity of Simpson County.   Judge Henderson has decided to transition into a new role as deputy  director of the Kentucky Association of Counties, where he will be  overseeing their day-to-day operations and working with local  government officials in all 120 counties throughout the Commonwealth to  advocate for legislative solutions that best meet the needs of their  constituencies.   His previous leadership within KACo, combined with his personal and  professional networks, and his impeccable record of achievement have  prepared him to serve Kentucky's local officials in a direct and  expanded capacity.   Although he will be missed in his current role, I am grateful for his  steadfast leadership and tireless contributions to Simpson County, as  well as his friendship and guidance.   Mr. Speaker, I join his family, friends, and all those who have  benefited from his efforts throughout the years in wishing him great  success in his new role as deputy director of KACo.                            ____________________
