 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell Lucia Huete  Suarez' story. Lucia, an immigrant from Nicaragua, lives in Kendall.  Ten years ago, she was healthy, working at a job she enjoyed, living a  normal life.   Her life changed when she was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.  She was heartbroken when she had to stop working due to her illness.  Now, she pays high copays for monthly lab work and procedures even with  insurance.   Every time Trump threatens to repeal the Affordable Care Act and rip  away protections for preexisting conditions, it is Lucia and 300,000  others living in my district whose lives are on the line.   I was proud to stand with colleagues to introduce legislation to  protect Lucia and every other Floridian, every American living in fear  of Trump's attacks on healthcare.   I stand in opposition to Trump's heartless attacks and reiterate that  we must all support the Protecting Pre-existing Conditions and Making  Health Care More Affordable Act.
