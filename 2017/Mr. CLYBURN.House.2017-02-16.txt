 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as part of the observation of  Black History Month, to continue my series of remarks recognizing  HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I am asking my  colleagues to join me in celebrating Clinton College, in Rock Hill,  South Carolina, and Morris College, in my hometown of Sumter.   Clinton College was founded in 1894 by the A.M.E. Zion Church, under  the leadership of Presiding Elder Nero A. Crockett and Reverend W.M.  Robinson to combat illiteracy of former slaves. The institution was  named for Bishop Caleb Clinton, then the presiding bishop of the  Palmetto Annual Conference of the A.M.E. Zion Church. Originally named  Clinton Institute, in 1909, it was renamed Clinton Normal and  Industrial Institute, and was authorized to grant State teaching  certificates.   In the late 1940s, the school was again reorganized as Clinton Junior  College, offering various associate degrees in religion and other  liberal arts. Still affiliated with the A.M.E. Zion Church, the college  has grown and expanded under its current president, Dr. Elaine J.  Copeland, who has led the institution since 2002.   In 2013, the college, for the first time, was accredited to offer two  bachelor's degree programs, a bachelor of arts in religious studies,  and a bachelor of science in business administration. Subsequently, it  has changed its name to Clinton College, and enrollment is at a 15-year  high.   For the past 120 years, Clinton College has been providing academic  excellence, as well as instilling moral and spiritual growth into their  students. The college takes pride in being, and I quote its motto, ``A  Beacon of Light for Today's Scholars and Tomorrow's Leaders.''   I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in honoring Clinton  College today.   Morris College was established in my hometown of Sumter, South  Carolina, by the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention of South  Carolina in 1908, to provide religious and educational training to  African Americans. Originally, the college featured elementary and high  school education, as well as a college curriculum. Its college offered  teaching certificates and degrees in liberal arts and theology. In the  1930s and 1940s, Morris dropped its elementary and high school programs  and became solely a liberal arts and religious college.   Morris' graduates include First Lieutenant Leroy Bowman, who was part  of the original class of Tuskegee Airmen. These African-American pilots  trained in a segregated complex near Tuskegee, Alabama, and the  Walterboro Army Air Field in Colleton County, South Carolina.   First Lieutenant Bowman served in World War II, flew 36 combat  missions over Germany, and had a decorated service record. He was among  300 surviving Tuskegee Airmen honored with the Congressional Gold Medal  in 2007 by President George W. Bush.   My mother graduated from Morris College in 1953, when I was 12 years  old. My father studied theology at Morris in the early 1940s for 3  years, but was not allowed to finish his studies because he had not  graduated high school. Having been born in 1897, in segregated South  Carolina, he was not  [[Page H1250]]  allowed to advance beyond the seventh grade. But because he continued  to self-teach and study, he was able to pass the college entrance exam.  Though he was not allowed to graduate in 1945, as he should have, he  was posthumously awarded his bachelor of theology degree 58 years  later, in 2003.   Having been led by Dr. Luns Richardson for the past 43 years, Morris  College has grown to an enrollment over 1,000. Under President  Richardson, Morris has established an Army ROTC unit, joined the United  Negro College Fund, and has constructed 18 new campus buildings.   Reverend Dr. Charles Jackson, president and chairman of Morris' board  of trustees, recently announced that President Richardson will retire  this summer, leaving Morris well-poised for the future.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Clinton and Morris  Colleges in celebration of Black History Month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue honoring HBCUs,  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, for their significant  contributions to our Nation's history.   While only 3 percent of our Nation's higher education institutions  are Historically Black, HBCUs produce 20 percent of the African- American college graduates. Today, I recognize and celebrate two of the  seven HBCUs in my congressional district, Voorhees College and Denmark  Technical College, both in Denmark, South Carolina.   Voorhees College was founded as Denmark Industrial School in 1897 by  Elizabeth Evelyn Wright when she was just 23 years old. Wright studied  at Tuskegee Institute and was a devotee of Booker T. Washington. She  had previously led efforts to start schools for African Americans in  South Carolina, which were always met with arson and threats of  violence. She persisted in her efforts to offer African Americans an  opportunity for a better life and, with Voorhees, created an  institution that would stand the test of time.   Wright originally taught classes in an old store in Denmark, but, in  1902, New Jersey philanthropist Ralph Voorhees donated money to  purchase land and construct a building for the school. A high school at  first, Voorhees offered classes at this level for African Americans in  the area.   In 1924, the Episcopal Church partnered with Voorhees, and an  affiliation with that church continues to this day. The college began  to offer junior college degrees in 1947 and 4-year degrees in 1962.  While originally founded on the principles of Booker T. Washington to  teach job and trade skills to African Americans, Voorhees now proudly  claims to offer a blend of Washington's philosophy and that of W. E. B.  Du Bois, who believed a classical liberal arts education was vital to  the development of African Americans.    The college's recently retired president, Dr. Cleveland Sellers, is a  Denmark native who graduated from Voorhees High School. Sellers went on  to Howard University, where he became active with the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, participating in its 1966 March  against Fear.   In 1968, after returning to South Carolina, Sellers was arrested and  imprisoned for supposedly inciting the confrontation between students  and police that became known as the Orangeburg massacre, when police  opened fire on students, killing 3 and injuring 27.   Voorhees' College's new president, Dr. W. Franklin Evans, previously  served as interim president of my alma mater, South Carolina State. In  that role, he successfully led South Carolina State out of a financial  crisis. I sincerely believe that Voorhees College is well-positioned  for the future with Dr. Evans at its helm.   Denmark Technical College, whose campus is adjacent to Voorhees, was  originally a branch of the South Carolina Trade School System. It was  created in 1948 by the South Carolina General Assembly and mandated to  provide trade skills to African Americans. During the ``separate but  equal'' era, Denmark Tech was one of the few opportunities for trade  school education offered to African Americans by the State.   In the early 1960s, Governor Fritz Hollings and then-Senator John  West led the effort to create the South Carolina Technical College  System. In 1969, the existing trade school in Denmark was transferred  into the system and the modern Denmark Technical College was created.  Its total enrollment is approximately 2,000, 96 percent of whom are  minority students. Denmark Tech continues to provide technical  education and trade skills in its assigned region of Bamberg, Barnwell,  and Allendale Counties.   Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, like their fellow  HBCUs, have made an indelible impact on their communities, South  Carolina, and the Nation. They have provided generations of African  Americans educational opportunities, and I look forward to their  continued success.
