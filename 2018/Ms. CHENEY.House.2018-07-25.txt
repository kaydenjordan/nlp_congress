 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1009) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the lack of timely and predictable funding  unnecessarily undermines the mission of the United States Special  Operations Command and jeopardizes the security of the United States.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1009         Whereas the ability of the United States Special Operations       Command to successfully conduct operations relies on adequate       resourcing;        Whereas Special Operations Forces must prepare for a wide       array of missions to support and defend the United States in       various capacities around the world;        Whereas the training and development of Special Operations       Forces takes multiple years and cannot be created overnight;        Whereas the success of the United States Special Operations       Command requires close coordination between each branch of       the Armed Forces;        Whereas training shortfalls have been identified as posing       an unnecessary risk to Special Forces soldiers;        Whereas the lack of full, on-time funding undermines the       ability of the United States Special Operations Command to       work by, with, and through our partner nations;        Whereas the smaller operating footprint of Special       Operations Forces poses unique operational needs not found in       conventional forces;        Whereas the deployment cycle of Special Operations Forces       requires additional attention and resources be provided for       family and support programs before, during, and after       deployments; and        Whereas the United States Special Operations Command must       maintain a constant level of readiness that is significantly       undermined by budget uncertainty: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) finds that not providing the Department of Defense with       stable, predictable, and on-time funding unnecessarily       jeopardizes the safety and security of the United States;        (2) expresses a sense of gratitude for the incredible       sacrifices made by both Special Operators and their families;       and        (3) commits to meeting the needs of the United States       Special Operations Command as part of its efforts to restore       military readiness.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson) to discuss his resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleague from California's  support for this resolution.   As my colleague knows very well, we have done far more in this body,  and, as he mentioned, we have done far more in this body than these  resolutions of support. These resolutions of support are crucially  important, but we have, in this House, completed our work. We have  completed our work on the Defense Appropriations bill.   Last year, the Senate also completed its work, and we were able to  take the very first crucially important steps to begin to rebuild our  military with the $700 billion we were able to appropriate for fiscal  year 2018.   We have also done our work for this fiscal year, and we will be in a  position, hopefully in the next day or so, to be able to pass the  National Defense Authorization Act as well for fiscal year 2019.    So we in this House understand how crucially important it is that we  get the work done, that we pass this legislation. We need the Senate to  do the same.   We also, I think, need to recognize we have fundamental disagreements  and disputes about the impact of the tax cuts we passed. In fact, on  this side of the aisle, we believe that allowing Americans to keep more  of their money is really the secret to getting the kind of economic  growth we need to fundamentally deal with the deficit, that the answer  is not to raise people's taxes to have more money coming into the  Treasury. We need to actually let people keep more of what they have  got. We need to let people invest more of their own money.   We have seen jobs come back, and we have seen economic growth come  back. We have seen people at all income levels able to keep more money,  and they see the difference in their paychecks.   So we are very proud of that, and we do not believe that we should  ever be in a situation where we think that somehow we have to choose  expensive domestic spending if we want to fund the military.   I agree with my colleague's views on sequestration. Sequestration was  extremely damaging. The Budget Control Act is damaging, and we ought to  be in a position where we are repealing that as well.   So I am pleased that there will be support for this resolution on  behalf of our Special Operations Forces.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank very much my friend and colleague  from North Carolina for introducing this important bill highlighting  the crucial role our special operators play.   Mr. Speaker, they, more than any other segment of our forces, operate  in secret and undertake missions that keep us safe and that serve to  protect and defend us. We will not ever know most of the stories of the  service that they carry out for all of us.   They really are the watchmen on the walls of freedom. They stand  guard for all of us day and night, undertaking missions that are  incredibly complex, incredibly dangerous. And too often, they pay the  ultimate sacrifice, but they are willing to do that for our freedom.   It is crucially important, Mr. Speaker, that we don't in this House  and in this Congress continue to force them and all of our men and  women in uniform to pay the price for our dysfunction, and that is a  price that comes with funding delays and uncertainty.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1010) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States Air Force faces significant  readiness challenges due to insufficient personnel levels, a shrinking  and depleted aircraft fleet, and maintenance deferrals, all of which  are affected by budgetary uncertainty and impede the Air Force's  ability to meet ongoing and unexpected national security threats,  putting United States national security at risk.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows                                H. Res. 1010         Whereas according to Air Force Chief of Staff General David       Goldfein, the United States Air Force is ``the smallest we've       ever been'';        Whereas according to an April 2018 report from the       Government Accountability Office, more than a quarter of       fighter pilot positions are unfilled;        Whereas the Air Force has just 18,000 of the roughly 20,000       pilots it needs to crew its 5,500 fighters, bombers,       airlifters, cargo planes, and rescue helicopters;        Whereas this 10 percent gap in its air crew requirement       could, as Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in       November of 2017, ``break the force'';        Whereas almost \1/3\ of the Air Force's aircraft were not       flyable, or mission-capable, at any given time in fiscal year       2017;        Whereas over the last decade, the total number of aircraft       in the Air Force has been on a downward slope;        Whereas the total number of aircraft in the Air Force will       drop again from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018;        Whereas the average age of an aircraft, forcewide,       increased from 24 years in fiscal year 2010 to 27.6 years in       fiscal year 2017; and        Whereas between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, accidents       involving all Defense Department warplanes rose nearly 40       percent: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the United States Air Force faces significant readiness       challenges due to aging aircraft and depleted personnel;        (2) Congress must provide the Air Force regular and       sufficient funding to address procurement, maintenance, and       staffing shortfalls; and        (3) without this funding, United States national security       is at risk.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), my friend and colleague, to  discuss his resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to insert some facts into the debate about  the tax cuts. According to CBO estimates, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is  going to result in an increase in GDP of $1.7 trillion. We are going to  see 900,000 new jobs. Wages will increase by $1.2 trillion. Investments  will increase by $600 billion. The tax cuts that we passed in this  House--and my colleague is right, none of the Democrats voted for it.  In fact, the minority leader has said that  [[Page H7649]]  she thinks we ought to reverse those tax cuts, which would be  devastating to the economy.   We lived through the stagnation of the Obama years, and we passed a  tax cuts bill that fundamentally changed the trajectory of this  economy. We have seen 1.3 million jobs added. We have minority  unemployment at the lowest rates, I believe, in history.   So the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working, and it is helping to bring  jobs back. I am really pleased that we are looking at ways that we can  make those cuts permanent, that we can make sure that we are helping  the middle class, and that we are helping small businesses across this  country on a permanent basis.   We can spend all of the time my colleague from California would like  debating the tax cuts, debating the impact on our economy, but the  facts are clear, that those tax cuts, despite the politics and the  rhetoric, have had the kind of impact that, frankly, we knew they would  have.   So I am really proud of what we have done with respect to the tax  cuts, and now we need to make sure that we fund the military. If we  don't fund the military, it doesn't matter much what else we do if we  don't provide for the security of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank my colleague  from Oklahoma for his remarks. I also want to thank my colleague from  Texas for this important resolution.   I am honored, Mr. Speaker, to represent F.E. Warren Air Force Base,  located in Cheyenne. The missileers of the Mighty Ninety Missile Wing  are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and manning ICBMs that are  deployed throughout Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado. These missiles  remain on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They are one of our  most important deterrents against attack from our adversaries.   But these Minuteman 3 missiles, Mr. Speaker, were developed in the  1960s and deployed in the 1970s. We have made modernization and  modifications since then, but we desperately need additional  modernization to these ICBMs and to our force in general to keep pace  with adversaries like the Russians who have made significant  investments in their ICBM force. We cannot do that, Mr. Speaker,  without predictable and reliable funding that is required to complete  such a complicated and complex multiyear project.   The ICBM replacement program, known as the Ground-Based Strategic  Deterrent, is slated to receive the necessary increased funding in  fiscal year 2019 so that we can accelerate that program. But for these  resources to be effective, Mr. Speaker, we must make sure we get the  additional funding to the Air Force on time.   As my colleague from Texas talked about, Mr. Speaker, the Air Force  faces readiness and modernization challenges, and the ICBM replacement  is just one of those.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we have to stop allowing our dysfunction and  we have got to stop allowing the demands, frankly, by some on the other  side of the aisle to hold our defense funding hostage. We have got to  stop allowing those political debates to put our men and women in  uniform at greater risk and, frankly, the long-term national security  of this Nation at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1007) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that not fully resourcing the United States Army in a  timely manner erodes the Army's ability to maintain readiness and poses  risk to the Army's ability to conduct military operations.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1007         Whereas, in previous years, the United States Army delayed       supply transactions, and later had to order parts from       sources outside the Department of Defense supply system and       pay more to get parts fabricated or shipped quickly to keep       up with maintenance timelines;        Whereas, in previous years, the Army was forced to restrict       to home station training due to not having enough resources;        Whereas the Army, if not fully resourced, will postpone all       noncritical maintenance work orders until later in the year       when resourced correctly;        Whereas the Army is attempting to add military personnel to       meet critical skill gaps, and if not fully resourced, will       delay the recruitment of new personnel which will result in       units continuing to lack the full complement of personnel       needed to be 100-percent effective;        Whereas, if not fully resourced, noncritical travel, which       includes relocating soldiers' families (change of duty       station) will be postponed and may result in missed school       year timing for dependent spouses and their children;        Whereas United States Army Forces Command is responsible       for the training, mobilization, deployment, sustainment, and       transformation of conventional forces to provide relevant and       ready land power to combatant commanders;        Whereas global threats require the Army to prepare to fight       both terrorist organizations as well as possible near-peer       adversaries; and        Whereas it takes both significant time and resources to       build a professional Army: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) finds that not resourcing the Department of the Army in       a timely manner erodes readiness and puts the United States       Army at a disadvantage; and        (2) affirms that Congress should resource all our       warfighters prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell), who is my colleague from the  Armed Services Committee, to discuss his resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Garamendi from California, for  his support of these resolutions and for his time focusing on them  today on the floor.   I also want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma. There is no stronger  supporter of our men and women in uniform that I know of in this body  than Mr. Russell from Oklahoma. He understands, I would say, more than  most because of his own service that what we do in this body and what  we do on this floor has a direct impact on the levels of risk, on the  safety, and on the effectiveness of our men and women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution highlights the damage that we have seen  to the readiness of the United States Army over 9 years of continuing  resolutions, sequestration, and overall budget dysfunction.   I want to echo the remarks of my colleague from Oklahoma. Let's  change that. Let's make this a new start. Let's make this the year that  we don't hold military funding hostage and we pass a clean Defense  Appropriations bill. We have done it here in the House. We know they  can do it in the Senate. We need to get the bill, take it up, and pass  it.   All these other arguments and discussions are important. They are  important for the future of the Nation. They are important for our  economy. But we should not force our men and women in uniform to have  to wait, to have stand by and watch, not knowing whether we are going  to be able to pass the bills that they need for the funding they need  to continue to keep us all safe.   We did our job for fiscal year 2018, although we were too slow, but  we have now appropriated the $700 billion for that fiscal year. Let's  do it this year on time, with sufficient funding, and with a level of  accountability, and also making sure that our men and women in uniform  know that those funds are coming to them.   It is going to take us more than a single year to get ourselves out  of the crisis we face, Mr. Speaker. We have made a good start. But I  think we should all come together, both sides of the aisle and,  frankly, on both sides of Capitol Hill, to say: Look, this is an issue  on which we are going to agree.   The security of the Nation is an issue that ought to cross party  lines. The support that we are seeing for this resolution and for all  the resolutions we have done for our services demonstrates that. Let's  make this the year that we do it differently and we do it right, Mr.  Speaker.   With that, I thank everyone who has participated in this effort. I  thank Chairman Thornberry and Chairman Granger for their important  efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
