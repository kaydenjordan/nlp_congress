 Mr. Speaker, over 125,000 Americans dead,  economic destruction all around us, and cases spiking across the  country.   States and cities are facing budget gaps that are going to force our  essential workers to get kicked to the curb, all because Mitch  McConnell feels zero sense of urgency.   Rent and mortgage payments due tomorrow.   Taxes due in a few weeks.   Small businesses hanging on for their dear life.   And Mitch McConnell, sitting on his hands, caring only about  politics.   Mr. Speaker, what happened in my city is happening in Texas, Arizona,  and Florida. These States need our help, too. This is about the people  who saved our country, our essential workers, doctors, nurses, cops,  firefighters.   We passed the HEROES Act. Where is your bill, Mitch? Do something. Do  your job because the rest of America is doing theirs right now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  extraordinary leadership on this extraordinary bill.   Last year, I stood up right on this floor and asked, ``Where is our  infrastructure bill?'' Well, thanks to Chairman DeFazio, we finally  have one.   This bill allocates $300 billion to rebuild our roads and our bridges  so my constituents on Staten Island and in South Brooklyn don't have to  pay thousands of dollars a year to repair road damage to their cars.   This bill invests $100 billion for more reliable mass transit so my  constituents in Brooklyn aren't stuck waiting for an R train, F train,  D train, that never seems to arrive.   This bill includes my legislation to overturn outdated rules,  preventing agencies like the Port Authority and the MTA from using the  tolls they collect to provide discounts for commuters, with no other  choice but to pay the highest tolls in the country.   Eleven months ago, I stood here because we couldn't wait another  year. And now I am proud to be able to tell my constituents they won't  have to wait. The days of decrepit roads, endless congestion, delayed  trains and buses will soon be over.
