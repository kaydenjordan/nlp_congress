 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings  had during the recess be printed in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Renee Atkinson  of Aynor High School for being named South Carolina's Teacher of the  Year.   Aynor High School and the entire Horry County School District are  blessed to have such a dedicated public servant who has touched the  lives of so many of our children in her 20-year teaching career.   Not only is she exceptional in the classroom, but she devotes time to  helping other teachers in Horry County learn and grow.   Our country's future relies on great teachers like Ms. Atkinson who  mold and shape the lives of our young adults. I thank her for her  passion and service to our community.   Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the mark she has left on her students, our  community, and the great State of South Carolina. This is a much- deserved recognition.   Congratulations to Ms. Atkinson.
