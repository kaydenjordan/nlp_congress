 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 97, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 24) disapproving the action of the  District of Columbia Council in approving the Local Resident Voting  Rights Amendment Act of 2022, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 24, disapproving the  action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Local  Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022, introduced by the  chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability,    James Comer of Kentucky.   Our Nation's Capital City is in crisis. Crime is rampant. Students in  D.C. Public Schools suffered historic learning loss because Democrats  kept schools closed. Buildings are sitting empty while Federal workers  continue to work from home.   The D.C. Council has prioritized a bill to allow noncitizens,  including illegal immigrants and foreign employees at embassies openly  hostile to the United States to vote in local elections.   This move by the D.C. Council dilutes the votes of American citizens,  including the many residents of the District who struggled and  sacrificed to obtain legal citizenship the right way.   Voting is a pillar of American democracy and a constitutional right  that must be protected and preserved for citizens of our country.  Voting is how Americans exert their will upon their government.   Voting ultimately determines how laws are written and enforced so  that citizens can shape the rules under which they can earn a living  and be protected from harm.   Voting is an essential privilege and responsibility established at  great cost throughout our Nation's history.   To quote one of our Founding Fathers, Samuel Adams: ``Let each  citizen remember at the moment he is offering his vote . . . that he is  executing one of the most solemn trusts in human society.''   On November 21, 2022, the D.C. Council chose to trash this solemn  trust by granting this sacred right of voting to anyone residing in the  District, including those here illegally and other noncitizens.   Just think about the immediate implications of this law. Our Nation's  Capital City plays host to virtually hundreds of foreign organizations  and embassies. Many of these foreign nationals have interests directly  opposed to those of the United States, and they make no claim  otherwise.   D.C.'s law makes zero exceptions for such individuals whose role may  be to disrupt or destroy the American way of life and principles our  Nation stands upon.   For years, Democrats in Washington decried potential foreign  influence in our electoral process, but D.C.'s new law potentially  allows foreign agents from China, Russia, and other adversaries to  participate in local elections held within this Nation's Capital City.   It is no secret that President Biden's policies have created the  worst border crisis in American history, bar none. Just this week, the  Committee on Oversight and Accountability heard from the U.S. Border  Patrol about how the Biden administration's policies are undermining  their ability to secure our southern border. Now, D.C. Democrats are  providing another magnet for illegal immigration.   This law is so bad that the D.C. Council even lost the support of The  Washington Post's editorial board. In October of last year, The  Washington Post editorial board announced it opposed the bill declaring  that ``voting is a foundational right of citizenship.''   The Post went on to note that allowing an estimated 50,000 noncitizen  D.C. residents to vote is just simply a bridge too far. I think most of  us can agree on that, and I think most of the American people would  certainly agree with that.   Even D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser agrees with us. She chose to withhold  her own signature from this legislation. While the bill was ultimately  enacted without her support, it is shocking that even the progressive  Democrat Mayor of D.C. does not support the actions of this out-of- control D.C. Council. If a bill goes too far for Mayor Bowser, then the  alarm bells should be ringing in every State and locality across the  Nation.   Our free and fair elections are the hallmark of a healthy democracy,  and we must protect them. The D.C. Council's law intends to do the  opposite.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge you to support the resolution  of disapproval to stop this radical reform in its tracks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is talk about how people are accountable to  different levels of government.   But how are you accountable when there is no protection articulated  in this legislation for the voters on keeping two sets of voter lists?   D.C. residents are entitled to vote for the Presidency and for  Federal offices.   I need to ask the question out loud: Are Members of Congress okay  with members of the CCP who work at the Chinese Embassy voting in U.S.  elections?   Are you comfortable with employees and members of Putin's regime who  work at the Russian Federation Embassy voting in D.C. elections?   These are questions that this body must ask itself when considering  this legislation. And make no mistake, Mr.  [[Page H765]]  Speaker, two sets of books aren't going to work in any board of  elections in America. You are entitled to vote in this election but not  that. There is going to be commingling, and the volunteers who work the  polls are not going to have all of the tools necessary to stop people  from intermingling in those elections.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 8, 2023, on page H765, in the first column, the  following appeared:   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).  [[Page H766]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also have no further speakers. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The D.C. Council has once again put its radical agenda ahead of the  American people. This time, the District's progressive D.C. Council is  directly disenfranchising American citizens.   In this day and age, it is often the case that the only factor  differentiating the privileges of American citizens from noncitizens is  the right to vote. The D.C. Council wants to erase that distinction.   The United States Congress must exercise its constitutional oversight  role over the District of Columbia, the seat of our Nation's Capital,  and reject this offensive local legislation.   In a time when our democratic institutions must be protected more  than ever, it is imperative that the United States House of  Representatives, the people's House, unite in opposition to the Local  Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act. We must reject the D.C. Council's  misguided efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the sacred rights of the American citizenry by voting for  Representative James Comer of Kentucky's resolution of disapproval.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
