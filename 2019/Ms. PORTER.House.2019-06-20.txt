 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill that would increase funding for  the court-appointed special advocate, or CASA, and guardian ad litem  programs.   In 2017, nine out of every 1,000 American children were victims of  abuse or neglect. These experiences have a lasting effect, impacting a  child's future in ways that are often not apparent in the days, weeks,  or months after the trauma of abuse or neglect occurs. Providing  support and advocacy for these children can make an enormous difference  in their lives, and that is where the CASA program comes in.   CASA serves abused, neglected, and abandoned children through the  recruitment and training of volunteers who advocate on behalf of  children in courtrooms and other settings.   Mr. Chair, imagine being a 6-year-old child suffering from parental  abuse. Home is not a safe place, and the secret that you, at only 6  years old, carry with you every day prevents you from speaking to your  friends and your teachers and keeps you from making friends and  building relationships.   Now, Mr. Chair, imagine that a neighbor calls the police after  overhearing abuse. You are finally removed from a home that is filled  with traumatic memories, but you are now looking at a scary and  uncertain future in the foster system, and you will have to face your  abuser in court.   That is where the CASA program comes in. They step in to provide a  lifeline, a guide, a friend, and an advocate for the child. Every year,  more than 85,000 volunteers advocate on behalf of the 260,000 children  who experience abuse and neglect. CASA advocates help these children  find their voices or even speak for them as they navigate the child  welfare system.   CASA of Orange County has worked with more than 7,050 children in the  34 years that the program has served our community, and they have  trained nearly 3,500 volunteers.   CASA of Orange County used essential funding to support Malena, an  11-year-old Orange County resident diagnosed with autism. In the 2\1/2\  years that she was in foster care, Malena lived in a group home, a  foster home, a nurturing relative placement, and then a group home  again. Throughout all of those changes, Malena had one consistent  person in her life that she knew she could count on, her court- appointed special advocate.   That CASA was a steady force in attending countless meetings with her  team to support and advocate for her needs. But her relationship with  her CASA was so much more, teaching her things that she missed in  childhood, such as how to tie her shoes, how to count money, how to  write her name, and when her birthday was.   At CASA of Orange County and other CASAs across the country, their  mantra is ``I am for the child.''   As a mother of three children, I am proud to stand here as an  advocate for children in Orange County and across the country who  experience abuse and neglect.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill that would increase funding for  sexual assault kit backlogs, helping us to test the hundreds of  thousands of untested rape kits across the country.  [[Page H4938]]    I have 5 minutes to speak about my amendment today, and during this  time, three people in this country will suffer sexual assault.                                time  1130    That works out to every 92 seconds someone is sexually assaulted in  our country. Let me repeat that: every 92 seconds. And, in most cases,  the perpetrators of these sexual assaults will never be held  accountable. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network,  only 5 out of every 1,000 rapists will end up in prison.   We have an opportunity today to support victims of sexual assault by  increasing funding to process the backlog of sexual assault kits that  are waiting to be tested across the country. Having the data and  information that a sexual assault kit can provide is essential to  solving sexual assaults and preventing future assaults.   In my home State of California, there are 13,615 kits untested. We  are failing every single one of those 13,615 victims whose rape kit is  sitting and waiting for our attention, and we are failing tens of  thousands more across the country, including those who will be sexually  assaulted by a perpetrator whose DNA will sit untested for a crime  already committed.   It costs an average of $1,000 and $1,500 to test a single rape kit.  The lack of critical funding needed for these testing kits is the  primary factor in the ever-growing backlog of untested kits. In 2016,  the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance gave Orange  County a nearly $2 million grant to process more than 3,500 unprocessed  kits, to investigate and prosecute cases, and to reengage survivors.   My amendment, which increases the funding in this legislation by $1  million, could help test approximately another 1,000 rape kits in  California and across the country. The amendment would bring the total  funding up to $50 million, which will only provide enough Federal  funding for the testing of up to 50,000 kits. While that is enough to  give answers to the 13,000 sexual assault victims waiting for analysis  and help in California, because of a lack of data nationwide, we don't  know exactly how many sexual assault kits are waiting in this country.   This funding likely isn't enough, and we know that. But Congress must  do more to ensure that we are supporting the victims of sexual assault  in this country. Increasing funding can play an important role, while  it is not alone enough.   We need to support our State and local partners in addressing the  backlog of rape kits through increased funding, through new policies  for kit testing, and through improved training for those in the field.   I hope that this increase in funding helps us continue the  conversation and raise more awareness about sexual assault and about  the kit backlog.   I hope that survivors of sexual assault know that Members of Congress  are fighting for them, and I hope they hear me and believe that this  fight for justice won't end with this amendment. We need to support the  victims of sexual assault across this country who deserve to have their  kits tested, who deserve justice. We can and must do more.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
