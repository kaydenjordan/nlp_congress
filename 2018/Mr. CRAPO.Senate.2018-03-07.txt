 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Crapo  amendment at the desk be agreed to.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the Nuclear Energy  Innovation Capabilities Act, or NEICA. This measure is the result of a  strong bipartisan partnership among many Senators, including Senator  Whitehouse, Senator Risch, Senator Booker, Senator Hatch, Senator  Murkowski, and Senator Durbin, along with myself and a number of other  Senators who have worked with us on this legislation.   I want to give special thanks to Senator Whitehouse, who is here with  us today. He has been my tireless partner in this effort. I thank  Senator Whitehouse for his hard work and the assistance of his staff.  Sometimes, even on the easiest of legislation--and this is not in that  category; this is a critical, strong piece that has taken a lot of  attention--but sometimes it just takes a lot of work and effort and  time. I appreciate Senator Whitehouse's efforts to stick with us, as he  actually helped move this ball forward as we have tried to get this  across the finish line.   I also want to express strong thanks to Senator Risch, who also  deserves strong recognition for his tireless work to get this bill  advanced.   This is a Senate companion to a House measure of the very same name,  introduced by Representatives Weber, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Lamar  Smith. We have been working together to get this bill passed for some  time, and I am eager to work with my House colleagues to make sure that  NEICA is enacted as soon as possible.   We all recognize that innovation within the nuclear industry must  continue and must build on American preeminence in nuclear research and  development. Having grown up in Idaho Falls, ID, I am a strong  supporter of nuclear energy and the Idaho National Lab, which is a  world leader in R&D and a key partner in sustaining our Nation's  commercial nuclear power sector. The INL has been home to more than 50  one-of-a-kind nuclear test reactors. It has led innovation after  innovation and breakthrough after breakthrough. The imagination,  ingenuity, and hard work of the scientists at the Lab, along with the  scientists at Argonne and Oak Ridge, ensure that the United States  remains the leader in development and commercialization of nuclear  power.   Today, many in the industry are focusing on what it takes to keep the  current fleet of reactors alive and operational. Industry leaders are  worried about the waste issues, the economics of operation, and  navigating the requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Understandably, many are not focused on the future of nuclear power and  what lies beyond the current generation of reactors.   Congress must find a way to help industry deal with the very real  challenges that the current fleet faces. Congress must address the  waste issue, and we must evaluate the costs and benefits of regulations  that the government has placed on this industry. Many of the burdens on  the nuclear industry are government-created, and so they must be  government-solved. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the  Environment and Public Works Committee to provide sound solutions.  [[Page S1422]]    Congress can't ignore the challenges of the current fleet, but we  must not allow these challenges to keep us from looking forward. The  nuclear power industry in America is, for better or worse, increasingly  paralyzed by government redtape.   Congress must lead in focusing government agencies toward preparing  for the next generation of nuclear reactors. We should create an  environment in which industry can grow and advance. If we don't, we  will lose to foreign competitors as companies take their technologies  and business overseas. This is happening already. Companies are  increasingly going to places like China, Russia, South Korea, and  India. These countries want to export nuclear technology and are  investing heavily toward that goal. If we continue down our current  path, these countries will take the lead in setting the rules on  proliferation and safety in the advanced nuclear industry. I would  prefer that America continue to lead in this area.   The Senate version of NEICA does four very important things to  encourage innovation in advanced nuclear power.   No. 1, it directs the Department of Energy to carry out a modeling  and simulation program that aids in the development of new reactor  technologies.   This is an important first step in allowing the private sector to  have access to the capabilities of our National Laboratories to test  reactor designs and concepts.   No. 2, it requires the Department of Energy to report its plan to  establish a user facility for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron  source.   This is a critical step that will allow private companies the ability  to test principles of nuclear science and prove the science behind  their work.   No. 3, NEICA directs the Department of Energy to carry out a program  to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts proposed  and funded by the private sector.   This site is to be called the National Nuclear Innovation Center, and  it will function as a database to store and share knowledge on nuclear  science between Federal agencies and the private sector. The Senate  version of NEICA encourages the Department of Energy and the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission to work together in this effort. We would like to  see the Department of Energy lead the effort to establish and operate  the National Nuclear Innovation Center while consulting with the NRC  regarding safety issues. We would also like the NRC to have access to  the work done by the center in order to provide its staff with the  knowledge it will need to eventually license any new reactors coming  out of the center. If these reactors are ever to get to the market, the  NRC must be able to understand the ins and outs of the science and work  behind their development. The NRC needs the data in order to make data- driven licensing requirements.   No. 4, finally, it requires the NRC to report on its ability to  license advanced reactors within 4 years of receiving an application.   The NRC must explain any institutional or organizational barriers it  faces in moving forward with the licensing of advanced reactors.   NEICA is an important step in maintaining U.S. leadership in nuclear  energy. It will enable the private sector and our National Labs to work  together to create cutting-edge achievements in nuclear science. NEICA  encourages the smartest, most innovative and creative minds in nuclear  science to partner together to move the industry forward. This is a  very exciting piece of legislation, and I look forward to working with  my congressional colleagues to help American nuclear energy thrive  today and prepare for the future.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have been very encouraged by the reaction  of my colleagues and their support for the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act over the last few days.   We have heard many stories about how the regulatory burden on our  financial institutions has had a direct impact on Main Street.  Yesterday, Senator Moran talked about the ranchers who couldn't get a  loan because they lacked collateral in an emergency. Senators Heitkamp  and Perdue explained the benefits of relationship banking and the  advantage of lending based on a personal knowledge of the customer.  Senator Corker talked about Dodd-Frank's unintended consequences for  small financial institutions. Senator Tester discussed bank  consolidation and the real impact it has had on communities in Montana.  Senator Donnelly went through the various important consumer protection  items included in this bill. Senator Kennedy also talked about some of  the important consumer protection provisions and about the lack of  access to credit for small businesses in Louisiana. Senator Warner  spent a good amount of time defending this robust bipartisan bill  against its critics and some of the false information being shared  about the bill.   Today, we have heard even more Senators come to the floor with  similar stories and expressions of similar sentiments about the need to  help free up our small community banks and credit unions around this  country from the overpowering burdens they are facing right now in the  regulatory world.   Many of my colleagues who are not on the Banking Committee have asked  if they could have the time and opportunity to speak about the bill, as  well, and we will see them coming to the floor, as we have started to  see today, to discuss these kinds of issues. Senators McConnell,  Cornyn, Portman, Lankford, and others have been very supportive of  these efforts to enact pro-growth, pro-jobs legislation.   We also heard from the bill's critics yesterday. But the resounding  message from Congress was that our constituents have asked for  regulatory relief and consumer protection and economic growth, and we  stand ready to deliver it.   We and our neighbors have noticed that many of our community  financial institutions have closed their doors over the last decade. In  fact, we have seen almost no new community financial institutions  chartered or new branches being opened over the last few years.   These financial institutions, of all sizes and forms, provide  critical services in our communities. They help businesses manage  operations, help entrepreneurs get funding to start their businesses,  help families buy a home, help all of us save for our kids' educations,  and help us deal with financial emergencies.   Community financial institutions are the pillars of towns and  communities across America, particularly in rural States like my own,  Idaho. They have certain advantages compared with their larger  counterparts, operating with an understanding and history of their  customers and, therefore, a willingness to be flexible.   Unfortunately, increased regulatory burdens and one-size-fits-all  regulations have limited their ability to help customers. The operating  landscape of these institutions has changed dramatically over the last  few years, and community banks and credit unions across the country  have struggled to keep up with the ever-increasing regulatory  compliance and examiner demands coming out of Washington.   I regularly hear from small banks and credit unions in Idaho about  how one-size-fits-all regulatory approaches are impacting their  businesses and product offerings and hindering their ability to serve  their communities.   For example, Koreen Dursteler from the Bank of Commerce in Idaho  Falls, a small bank with just over $1 billion in assets, has written  about the avalanche of regulation over the past 8 to 10 years. Due to  excessive regulations related to qualified mortgage loans and the cost  of hiring extra compliance staff to help keep up with additional  regulation, her bank has had to stop offering consumer mortgages and  real estate loans. That is a big deal. This is not an isolated  incident. I hear stories like that all the time.   Another example: Val Brooks works at Simplot Employees Credit Union,  which serves Canyon County, ID. She noted that Simplot has long been  proud to serve this area, where some folks come from lower income  households and may be underserved. Simplot worked to obtain the  necessary education, compliance certification, and licensing standards  to better serve its customers and the community. However, after the  CFPB increased already burdensome mortgage regulations, such as the  qualified mortgage and HMDA, Simplot credit union had to make the very  difficult business decision to stop offering mortgage loans altogether.  It was just too cost prohibitive and resource-draining.   When these small financial institutions are not able to offer certain  products within the communities they serve, it is a direct hit to the  citizens of Idaho and to all of our States.   To be absolutely clear, it is not that folks are against all  regulation, but rather, to the people outside of Washington, it seems  as if regulatory changes are made without much thought as to how they  will truly affect customers and financial providers.  [[Page S1424]]  As policymakers, we have a responsibility to diligently and frequently  study the state of our economy, our regulatory framework, and how these  things are impacting our communities and citizens, including people's  access to financial services.   We must encourage regulations that not only ensure proper behavior  and safety for our markets but also are tailored appropriately to the  size and risk type that is being regulated. This means making sure the  burden on financial institutions is not so large that consumers,  businesses, and our communities are deprived of financial services and  suffer as a result.   This has been an important issue to Members on both sides of the  aisle. Congress has held numerous hearings in prior years exploring  many of these issues, including a series of hearings in the Banking  Committee in 2015. Then, in March of last year, the Banking Committee  issued a request for legislative proposals that would promote economic  growth. We held bipartisan hearings and briefings and meetings with  stakeholders across the spectrum, vetting potential ideas for right- sizing the regulatory dynamics. We began the process by holding a  hearing on the role of financial companies in fostering economic  growth, which included former regulators, stakeholders, and the chief  economist of the AFL-CIO.   At our next two hearings, we examined proposals that would tailor  existing laws and regulations to ensure that they are proportionate and  appropriate for small financial institutions and midsized regional  banks. Then, in June, the financial regulators provided feedback on  their Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or  EGRPRA, report and the proposals discussed in previous hearings. As a  result of this process, we introduced the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which is now S. 2155.   I repeat that often there are those who say we are dismantling the  regulatory system. This legislation focuses on the smallest financial  institutions in our country. The legislative system that was put into  place was marketed as being aimed at Wall Street excesses, but I held a  townhall meeting when we were debating this legislation on Main Street  in Boise, ID, and said then that although the justification for some of  these regulations was focused on Wall Street, the crosshairs were on  Main Street. Unfortunately, that has turned out to be all too true.  Large banks have profited tremendously in the last 6 to 10 years. Small  banks and credit unions have suffered dramatically. We have lost many  of our banks and credit unions across this country. As I indicated  earlier, very few new ones have started up because they simply cannot  meet the compliance burdens of being required to meet regulatory  requirements that are designed, in the first instance, for huge banks.   What we need is a regulatory system that recognizes there is a  difference between a community bank or a credit union in a small  community and a megabank on Wall Street that is doing its business  globally. We need to have our regulatory system tailored so the risk  posed by a particular financial institution is taken into consideration  in the regulations applied. That is what this legislation seeks to  accomplish. Like I said at the outset, I am very glad we have had broad  support for this.   I would like to take a minute and go over some of the specific  provisions in the bill. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act is aimed at rightsizing regulation for  financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions,  making it easier for consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.   As I have often said, the real victims of what I am talking about are  not really the community banks and the credit unions but the people,  the small businesses--those who need to have access to credit and need  to have the ability to get a loan to purchase a house or to start a  small business or to expand a small business or other important needs.   This bill also increases important consumer protections for veterans,  for senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough  financial times. The provisions in this bill will directly address some  of the problems I frequently hear about from the financial institutions  in Idaho. Community banks and credit unions are simple institutions  focused on relationship lending and have a special relationship  providing credit to traditionally underserved and rural communities  where it may be harder to access banking products and services or to  get a loan.   Dodd-Frank instituted numerous new mortgage rules and complex capital  requirements on community banks and credit unions that have hindered  consumers' access to mortgage credit and lending more broadly. On July  20, 2016, the American Action Forum attempted to estimate the number of  paperwork hours and final costs associated with the Dodd-Frank rules.  In total, the forum estimated that the bill had imposed more than $36  billion in final rule costs and 73 million paperwork hours as of July  2016.   To put those figures into perspective, the costs are nearly $112 per  person, or $310 per household. Additionally, it would take 36,950  employees working full time to complete a single year of the law's  paperwork based on agency calculations.   Our bill is focused on providing meaningful relief to community banks  and credit unions, helping them to prudently lend to consumers, home  buyers, and small businesses.   I have more I want to say. I want to take a brief break right now,  and I will come back in a few minutes.   At this point, I yield back my time until I return.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have polled the committee, and on behalf  of the committee, I withdraw the committee-reported amendments.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2152.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we  are now on the bill, S. 2155. We have offered a bipartisan substitute  that reflects the priorities from Members on both sides of the aisle.  We are ready to begin the process of voting on further amendments.   I have discussed the path forward with the majority leader, and we  would like to begin alternating amendments and setting votes on them  with limited time agreements. The first two amendments on the  Republican side are a Paul amendment to audit the Federal Reserve and a  Moran amendment to restructure the management and funding of the CFPB.  I understand there are several amendments on the Democratic side, as  well, and we are willing to start setting those votes in an alternating  fashion. It is my understanding, however, that there are objections on  the Democratic side to setting votes at this time, but I hope we can  convene tomorrow and start the process of voting on amendments and work  together in cooperation to finalize the amendment process.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, March 8; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 2155.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 8, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
