 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  legislation because it presents us with a choice that we should not  have to make. I take a backseat to nobody in this institution in terms  of fighting for children and families.   But we live in the United States of America, the greatest Nation in  the world. I reject the notion that we have to rob Peter to pay Paul  or, in this instance, jeopardize the future of Medicare and steal $6  billion from critical prevention programs to pay for children's  healthcare. They are all equal priorities, and we shouldn't have to  sacrifice the health of one population to pay for another. It is that  simple.   The changes that the bill makes to Medicare may sound innocuous--and  I have great respect for the chairman--but the reality is they will  threaten the future of Medicare.   Means testing Social Security is a good sound bite, but it is a very  slippery slope. I'm not worried about whether wealthy families can be  able to afford to pay for increased Medicare premiums, but I am worried  that these changes will result in wealthy people abandoning the program  in large numbers, which would worsen the risk pool and ultimately  increase the costs for middle- and lower-income seniors. It would  fracture completely the universal nature of Medicare and put the entire  program at risk. It is an unwise proposal that should be rejected.
