 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to lead a Special  Order alongside my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to discuss a  crisis afflicting our Nation. It is the crisis of missing and murdered  indigenous women.   Each of the Members speaking tonight represents different regions of  the United States and different native communities that are all  affected by the disproportionate number of crimes against Native  American and Alaska Native women.   My colleagues and I have introduced several pieces of legislation,  including Savanna's Act and the BADGES for Native Communities Act, in  an attempt to improve collaboration between law enforcement agencies  and empower them to seriously work toward solving many of these  unsolved cases.    Over the next hour, I look forward to hearing each of these Member's  unique perspective on ways we can work to solve this crisis and bring  justice to these women.   I have spoken on this topic a number of times here on the floor, in  the House Judiciary Committee, and at home with my constituents who  have been directly affected by this crisis.   While a lot that I might say here tonight, Mr. Speaker, may sound  like a broken record--I apologize for that--I cannot stress enough how  important it is that we use our voices as U.S. Representatives to  address a crisis of this magnitude and offer solutions for these women  and their families and their communities.   Native women throughout the country face a murder rate 10 times  higher than the national average, with 84 percent experiencing some  kind of violence in their lifetime.   In my home State of Washington, Native Americans make up about 2  percent of the population, but a recent report by the Washington State  Patrol shows that indigenous women account for 7 percent of the State's  reported missing women.   This crisis is one that affects communities in both highly populated,  urban areas, as well as rural districts, in districts like the one I  represent in central Washington.   I have seen firsthand how these injustices affect local communities,  and I have vowed to exercise my position in Congress to help deliver  justice for these women.   My congressional district sits at the epicenter of this crisis. There  are currently over 100 open cases in Washington State, with 31 open  cases on or near the Yakama Indian Reservation in central Washington  alone. This includes seven new cases in just the past 5 years.   The number of open cases is alarming, but the truth is we don't even  have accurate data to truly understand the breadth of this problem. Due  to a lack of shared information, data, and reporting, there is no real  way to know exactly how many Native American women have gone missing or  whose fate hangs in the balance of an unsolved murder case.                                time  1615    The complicated jurisdiction between Federal, Tribal, and local law  enforcement causes serious problems throughout many investigations, and  far too many Tribal law enforcement agencies lack the resources and  access to information that would help solve missing persons cases and  murders.   This leaves the families and the communities of these victims  frustrated, without answers, and begging for solutions. And while we  represent them in the people's House, it is the voices of those who are  directly affected that we should be listening to.   Our communities in my district in central Washington have not been  silent. Just this past Monday, the YWCA in Yakima hosted their annual  vigil for the victims of domestic violence. This year, the organization  partnered with the Yakama Nation to bring attention to the missing and  murdered indigenous women crisis and to honor those who have lost their  lives to domestic violence.   Citizens of the Yakama Nation and other local Tribes have hosted  rallies of support in large public forums to raise awareness of the  crisis and to demand action.   A reporter by the name of Tammy Ayer from the Yakima-Herald Republic  has done a truly excellent job of keeping the public informed of these  ongoing efforts, diligently highlighting the activism on the ground and  providing resources for families and friends of missing Native women.  The voice she lends to the voiceless has and will continue to be a  powerful agent for change.   I hosted a roundtable earlier this year with Tribal members, with law  enforcement officers, Bureau of Indian Affairs officials, and other  local advocates to learn directly from these pillars of our local  community about how we can assist them in their efforts.   I have lived just outside of the Yakama Nation Reservation my entire  life, Mr. Speaker, but hearing the heartfelt testimonies of the  families and the loved ones of missing Native women from just down the  road from me was truly an eye-opening experience, and a deeply heart- wrenching experience. I believe it is one that all Members of Congress  need to hear, and that is why we are here tonight.   That is also why in June I sent letters to the House Judiciary and  the Natural Resources Committees asking them to hold field hearings in  central Washington on this matter. The voices of communities impacted  by this crisis must be heard. My request was echoed by numerous local  Tribes, by advocacy groups, and by women's organizations who have all  sent their own letters to the committees inviting Members to come meet  with them, listen to the voices on the ground, and discuss solutions  for missing and murdered indigenous women.   The Yakama Nation has generously offered to host the hearing, which  would provide Members with the opportunity to hear firsthand from both  the Tribes, law enforcement officers, and families of these victims who  are dealing with this crisis every day, about how we can best move  forward.   Their testimony would help demonstrate the impact this crisis is  having on our communities in central Washington and in other regions  around the country.   Mr. Speaker, I hate to say it, but it has been 4 months since these  letters were first delivered to the House Judiciary and Natural  Resources Committees, but we have received no response. It has been  nearly a month since I testified before the Judiciary Committee to ask  for committee action and a response to my letter. Still, nothing.   Thankfully, the current administration has been actively pursuing our  local input. The Department of the Interior is conducting a series of  roundtable events with Tribes and law enforcement agencies across the  country, most recently in Arizona and Alaska.   While the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs  certainly have a role to play in implementing these solutions for the  women and their loved ones, Congress must also pay attention and we  must do our part to listen and then legislate.   The two legislative proposals I mentioned earlier, Savanna's Act and  the BADGES for Native Communities Act, would provide immediate  assistance to Tribes and law enforcement in addressing this crisis. As  you will hear tonight, Mr. Speaker, these bills have strong bipartisan  support.   I know my colleagues and I stand ready to develop solutions that will  work for local Tribal communities and  [[Page H8179]]  law enforcement, and I look forward to hearing from my friends and  colleagues from around the country over the next hour to discuss the  impact the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women has had on  their communities and about what actions this body can help take to  stop it.   I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte), my good friend  who represents the great State of Montana, as well as the Northern  Cheyenne and Blackfeet Tribes. Montana is a large State and with  understaffed law enforcement agencies, reporting an investigation of  crimes against Native American women can slip through the cracks.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate Mr. Gianforte  putting a face to this very serious issue that we are experiencing all  over the United States, and particularly in Montana, and pointing out  some of the ways that this legislation could potentially benefit our  communities.   I thank the gentleman very much for sharing tonight.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, one of the pieces of legislation  that my colleagues and I have introduced this Congress, is Savanna's  Act, named after a young lady, Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was a  member of the Spirit Lake Tribe and was tragically murdered in August  of 2017.   Earlier this year, I worked with a bipartisan group of colleagues to  improve this legislation from the previous version of the bill that was  introduced in the 115th Congress. It does a lot of things, but two  things I want to point out, it aims to develop guidelines and best  practices for law enforcement agencies and encourages agencies to  enhance reporting and recordkeeping for better coordination.   It also aims to improve communication between law enforcement and the  families of the loved ones of the victims, which is an issue that was  brought to my attention by the central Washington families who, in some  cases, have waited for months just for an update on their loved one's  case.   So it is with that background that I want to yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres), my good friend. I really appreciate her  leadership and her partnership in this effort on bringing this issue  forward and bringing some good solutions forward as we work to improve  law enforcement's response in the cases of these missing and murdered  indigenous women. I can't say enough about the contribution of  Congresswoman Norma Torres, and I would like her to share some things  from her perspective.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for sharing with  us her experiences, and I thank her for her leadership and being the  lead sponsor on Savanna's Act, as well. It is truly a pleasure to work  with my friend. I hope that, with her leadership, we will be able to  get this across the finish line and get it to the President.   It is my honor now, Mr. Speaker, to introduce someone who truly is in  the middle of much of this issue. He cosponsors Savanna's Act, and he  is a leader on not only bringing solutions to help solve this problem  but probably just as importantly, if not more importantly, he is also  helping to shine a bright light on an issue that, frankly, many  Americans just are not aware of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.  Armstrong).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. This is a serious  issue. As the gentleman said, something this serious should be  bipartisan, and the good thing is that it is bipartisan. People on both  sides of the aisle recognize the horrific nature of these unsolved  crimes and are wanting to do something about it.   I am really heartened by the fact that in this day and age, and in  this climate here in Washington, D.C., there are some issues that we  can rally around together in a bipartisan fashion.   I think that is a perfect segue into introducing a friend of mine  from the Bipartisan Working Group, someone who embodies the desire to  find solutions and to find common ground on issues so that we can move  forward. This is a great example of the work that we can accomplish  when we put our heads together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from New Mexico (Ms. Torres  Small).    Mr. Speaker, it truly is a great thing that we can come  together on an issue of such importance. I thank the gentlewoman for  her contributions and her sponsorship of Savanna's Act. Together, we  can get this done. I thank the gentlewoman very much for coming  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, it may not be obvious to many of us, but some States are  taking action. Some specific States have accomplished some things. In  my own State of Washington, I have to mention the name of State  Representative Gina Mosbrucker, who has been a critical ally in  addressing this crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women.   We have 29 federally recognized Tribes in Washington State, so it is  critical that we have the State's support to help address this crisis.  Representative Mosbrucker has spearheaded legislation to improve the  reporting of crimes on and off the reservations and enhance  coordination between the Washington State Patrol as well as Tribal law  enforcement.  [[Page H8181]]    Earlier this year, the Washington State Patrol released a report, as  mandated by Representative Mosbrucker's legislation, outlining the  number and status of cases of missing and murdered indigenous women  throughout the State. The report revealed that there is much more work  to be done in order to empower law enforcement of all jurisdictions-- State, Federal, Tribal, and local--to accurately report and investigate  these crimes.   I know Washington State is not the only State that is doing things. I  welcome my friend, Representative   Don Bacon from Nebraska, to the  podium. His State, for example, has one of the highest rates of crime  against Native American women. Like Washington State, Nebraska has been  active in tackling some of the shortcomings we see in the coordination  between Tribes and law enforcement.   I thank my friend, Representative Bacon, for his leadership on this  issue and his help in getting this legislation through. He has been a  strong supporter not only here but also in his home State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bacon very much for his  participation tonight and helping shed light on this very important  issue in our Tribal communities around the country.   I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, that I held a public meeting in  Yakima earlier this year. The reporter that I had mentioned asked me a  very pointed question. This issue had been brought to light in the  early 1990s by one of my predecessors who held this seat. That person  vowed to do something about this, and here we are, 20-some years later,  almost 30 years later, and nothing has been done.   She asked me: What is different today?   I think the right answer to that, Mr. Speaker, is that the  difference, from what I have seen, personally, is that the men and  women in our Tribal communities are standing up. They are saying: We  are tired of this, and we are just not going to take it anymore.                                time  1645    They are making their voices heard loud and clear and demanding  action, and this is something that we need to deliver in order to help  our Native American communities around the country.   It truly is a pleasure for me to yield to the gentleman from South  Dakota (Mr. Johnson), who has been a true leader on this issue, helping  bring focus to this issue so that we can find solutions.    Mr. Speaker, I thank and appreciate the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson). I thank him for his leadership in making  sure that people understand the gravity of the situation that we face,  so I thank him very much.   Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot about both these bills, probably  more, though, about Savanna's Act. Let me talk a little bit about the  BADGES for Native Communities Act.  [[Page H8182]]    It is a bill that strengthens Tribal communities' ability to  investigate crimes related to missing and murdered indigenous women and  better enforce pubic safety.   BADGES stands for Bridging Agency Gaps and Ensuring Safety for Native  communities. It gives Tribes and Tribal law enforcement agencies access  to Federal resources and databases so that they can more effectively  investigate open cases.   It will always provide resources for Tribes to recruit and retain  qualified law enforcement personnel, which addresses an issue facing  Native communities across the country.   Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico and Representative Tom Cole,  the two lead sponsors of the BADGES for Native Communities Act and co- chairs of the House Native American Caucus, could not be here with us  this evening, but I know their advocacy has inspired many Members of  Congress, myself included, to work to bridge those gaps on behalf of  Native communities across the country.   This legislation, like Savanna's Act, has strong bipartisan support,  and tonight, I call upon the Committee on the Judiciary to give this  legislation a hearing.   Mr. Speaker, another strong advocate in the people's House who fights  day in and day out on the behalf of American Indian and Alaska Native  communities is the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), dean of the House  and my friend.   Mr. Speaker, the good dean couldn't be with us here this evening, but  he will include a statement in the Congressional Record. In his  statement, Representative Young speaks of the extreme isolation and  lack of law enforcement in remote Native communities and the concerning  fact that Native communities lack full access to criminal databases,  undermining Tribal law enforcement in court systems.   I thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my friend, for his  years of leadership and for his original cosponsorship for both  Savanna's Act and the BADGES for Native Communities Act.   Also, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I have  requested a field hearing in central Washington on Yakama Nation  Reservation. I also mentioned that several local Tribes have echoed my  request to both the House Committee on the Judiciary and House  Committee on Natural Resources.   I include the following letters in the Record from the Yakama Nation,  also from The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, from the  YWCA, from the Samish Indian Nation, from the Puyallup Tribe, from the  Missing and Murdered Native Americans, from the Washington State  Women's Commission, and also from the Muckleshoot Tribal Council.                                       Confederated Tribes and Bands                                            of the Yakama Nation,                                       Toppenish, WA, June 20, 2019.       Hon, Jerrold Nadler,       Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Raul Grijalva,       Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.       Hon. Doug Collins, Ranking Member,       House Committee of the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Rob Bishop, Ranking Member,       House Committee on Natural Resources,       Washington, DC.         Dear Chairman Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: Shix Patchway. On behalf of the       Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, I am       writing to in support of Savannah's Act, H.R. 2733 and to       invite the House Committee on the Judiciary and House       Committee on Natural Resources to conduct a field hearing on       the proposed legislation at the Yakama Reservation.        We are truly to grateful to Representatives Dan Newhouse,       Norma Tones and Deb Haaland for introducing Savanna's Act.       For many years the Yakama Nation has made formal requests to       the Department of Justice and Bureau of Indian Affairs to       assistant with locating missing persons, and solving the       unsolved homicide cases that have occurred on and around the       Yakama Reservation--with no response or action by the       Governmental Agencies.        The Yakama Nation Tribal Council has formed a Special       Committee for this very important issue, The Yakama Nation       Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Committee. The       Committee has been gathering community input through informal       and formal processes, and working to implement action items       in response. On January 14, 2019, the Committee hosted a       meeting at the Yakama Nation Legends Casino that gathered       input and shared actions item and was well attended by many       law enforcement agencies and a representative from Governor       Jay Inlsee's Office.        The Yakama Nation has supported the Washington State       Legislature's work to address the ongoing MMIW crisis,       specifically Washington State HB 2951 and SB 1713. As the       Yakama Nation testified in Olympia, there needs to be a       genuine response to the reports of missing and murdered       Native women and girls across Tribal lands. Also, all new       legislation needs to be guided by a clear strategic framework       and principles to move beyond the current conditions       endangering our lives and future generations of Native women       and girls.        The Yakama Nation is formally requesting a field hearing on       our Yakama Lands to address the issues relating to the       missing and murdered women and peoples and the need for       Savanna's Act, H.R. 2733. We would like your Committees to       have an opportunity to hear firsthand from our community as       well as other impacted Tribes.        The Yakama Nation offers our assistance to the Committees       to facilitate true action by the United States to address the       crisis facing Native communities nationwide.        Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward       to your response.                                              JoDe Goudy, Chairman,      Yakama Nation Tribal Council.                                   ____                                             The Confederated Tribes                                     of the Colville Reservation,                                        Nespelem, WA, June 19, 2019.       Hon. Jerrold Nadler,       Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Raul Grijalva,       Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.       Hon. Doug Collins, Ranking Member,       House Committee of the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Rob Bishop, Ranking Member,       House Committee on Natural Resources,       Washington, DC.         Dear Chairmen Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: On behalf of the Confederated Tribes of       the Colville Reservation (``CCT''), I am writing to request       that one or both of your committees hold a field hearing in       Washington state to examine issues relating to missing and       murdered Indian women and the need for enactment of Savanna's       Act, H.R. 2733.        The CCT worked with Rep. Dan Newhouse when the House       version of H.R. 2733 was being developed. The CCT joins Rep.       Newhouse's request that a field hearing be held on the Yakama       Nation Reservation as explained in his June 6, 2019, letter       to your committees.        As explained in Rep. Newhouse's letter, information on many       open cases involving missing and murdered Yakama Nation women       was recently made available by local media. Previously, the       CCT made personnel from the Colville Tribal Police Department       available to assist the Yakama Nation in an attempt to       resolve cases of missing Yakama women.        Thank you for your consideration of this request. Please       feel free to contact me directly with any questions.            Sincerely,                                                    Rodney Cawston,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                             YWCA,       Yakima, WA, June 18, 2019.        Dear Representative Newhouse: The YWCA of Yakima calls on       you and Congress to take aggressive action to find answers       and protective solutions to the Missing and Murdered Native       Women in Yakima County and throughout our country. We support       your efforts with Savanna's Act. It's time for the violence       against women to stop.        We request field hearings in Yakima County to learn more       from our Yakama Tribal members and others with information on       what is happening in Yakima County. We are highly concerned       about the level of violence against women in our area.        For 110 years the YWCA of Yakima has been providing       services to women and children in our community. Last year       alone we helped over 13,000 women, children, and men who were       experiencing domestic violence. Our emergency shelter       frequently helps Native women reclaim their lives and build       new futures for them and their children.        Thank you for leading an effort to bring these issues       forward. This is a crisis that needs attention now. How many       more women will we allow to go missing or be murdered? How       many more children will grow up not knowing where their       mother is?            Sincerely,                                                       Cheri Kilty,                                                Executive Director.  [[Page H8183]]                                          ____                                          Samish Indian Nation,                                       Anacortes, WA, June 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerry Nadler,      Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Doug Collins,      Ranking Member, House Committee of the Judiciary, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: I am writing on behalf of the Samish       Indian Nation to share the importance to our people of       Savanna's Act, introduced by Representatives Dan Newhouse (R-      WA), Norma Torres (D-CA), and Deb Haaland (D-OK) to address       the devastating issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous       Women (MMIW) that impacts tribal communities here in       Washington and across the country. I am also writing to       underscore the importance of hearing directly from the tribal       communities that have been impacted by this epidemic.        Indigenous Women in Washington have especially been       impacted by the crisis, with currently 71 open cases       statewide. Samish Indian Nation has not escaped this impact,       as our late former Chairwoman lost her daughter-in-law in a       violent criminal act over 30 years ago, and that case has       even to this day never been solved.        With this in mind, we ask you to hold a field hearing in       Central Washington to bring together Tribal leaders, local       and Tribal law enforcement, and other community stakeholders       and hear firsthand accounts of the MMIW crisis and how       legislation like Savanna's Act would help ensure justice for       Native Women and their families.        Thank you for your consideration and for your leadership       and advocacy for our Nation's Native Communities. I look       forward to welcoming you to Washington and to a collective       response to this crisis.            Sincerely,                                                  Thomas D. Wooten,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Puyallup Tribe of Indians,                                                      June 27, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Doug Collins,      Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: I.am writing on behalf of the Puyallup       Tribe of Indians to share our collective support of Savanna's       Act, H.R. 2733 introduced by Representatives Dan Newhouse (R-      WA), Norma Torres (D-CA), and Deb Haaland (D-OK). The issue       of missing and murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) has had       devastating impacts on tribal communities in Washington State       and across Indian Country. The Puyallup Tribe has not been       immune to this crisis as we have several missing or murdered       tribal members whose cases remain unsolved.        The Urban Indian Health Institute reports that Washington       State ranks second in the nation for missing and murdered       indigenous women. In data collected on urban areas, Seattle       is number one, and Tacoma is number two. With this data in       mind we respectfully and urgently stress the importance for       the committees to hear directly from the communities hit the       hardest as you discuss policies that will impact them the       most.        We support Yakama Nation's invitation to the House       Committee on the Judiciary and House Committee on Natural       Resources to conduct a field hearing on the proposed       legislation. Hosting a field hearing in Central Washington       would be a meaningful opportunity to gather a diverse       community of Tribal leaders, law enforcement, and community       stakeholders and hear firsthand how legislation like       Savanna's Act is needed to assure justice for Native women       and the loved ones they've left behind.        Thank you for your consideration, and advocacy. We look       forward to your response.            Sincerely,                                                     David Z. Bean,      Chairman Puyallup Tribal Council.                                   ____                                                Missing and Murdered                                                Native Americans,                                            Yelm, WA, June 27, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Doug Collins,      Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: I am writing as an advocate for families       of the missing and murdered and as a family member who has       lost my mother and my cousin to share our collective support       of Savannah's Act, H.R. 2733. Please accept the invitation to       conduct a field hearing on the proposed legislation. The       crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) is       gaining momentum across the nation with tragic stories like       Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was pregnant with her first       child when she was murdered in August 2017. Savanna's story       is heartbreaking; and, tragically, there are thousands of       these stories across the country. There are over 40 missing       or murdered women on the Yakama reservation, each with its       share of horrific details and failed investigations.        Native American's are the only race in our country where no       thorough data is collected, thus there is no reliable way of       knowing how many Native Women go missing. Outdated databases       and a lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies       are creating a literal joke of ``Who's on First'' where no       one wants to take jurisdiction. This bad joke played out this       winter in the death of 14 year old Henny Scott. The family       fought to get law enforcement to take a missing report or       help find Henny wasting critical time. Henny was found dead       by a volunteer search party on the Norther Cheyenne       reservation in December 2018. This could have been prevented       and is unacceptable, and yet, Henny's is just one story.        The Urban Indian Health Institute reports that Washington       State ranks second in the nation for missing and murdered       indigenous women. Seattle holds sadly is number one and       Tacoma is number two. I must respectfully and urgently       request your committees to hear directly from the communities       hit the hardest as you discuss policies that will impact them       the most.        Thank you for your consideration and for your strong       leadership and advocacy for our nation's Native communities.       We look forward to your response.            Sincerely,      Carolyn DeFord,        Founder, Missing and Murdered Native Americans, MMIW Family       Member, Daughter of Leona Kinsey.                                   ____                                                    Washington State                                              Women's Commission,                                         Olympia, WA, July 10, 2019.       Hon. Jerrold Nadler,       House Committee on the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Raul Grijalva,       House Committee on Natural Resources,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Doug Collins,       House Committee of the Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Rob Bishop,       House Committee on Natural Resources,       Washington, DC.         Dear Chairs Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: I am the Director of the Washington State       Women's Commission, a government agency focused on       eliminating systemic barriers for women. I am writing in       support of Savanna's Act (H.R. 2733), introduced by       Representatives Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Norma Torres (D-CA), and       Deb Haaland (D-OK). Savanna's Act is a bipartisan effort that       will help address the crisis of missing and murdered       Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) across the country. I also       support holding a field hearing on the Yakama Nation       Reservation.        In April 2019, two Native girls, Mary Gates (age 14) and       Myra Queahpama (age 15), went missing from Yakima County in       Washington state. Every day they are missing makes it more       difficult to find them. Their families deserve to be heard. I       am writing to support a field hearing on the Yakama Nation       reservation to learn more from our Yakima Tribal members       about this issue. Of the 56 missing Native American women in       Washington, 20 are from Yakima County, according to the       National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.        The Women's Commission shares the concern of many about the       level of violence against women in the area. I respectfully       request your committees hold a field hearing at the Yakama       Reservation, and to support the passage of Savanna's Act.        Thank you for your consideration and for your strong       leadership and advocacy for our nation's Native communities.            Sincerely,                                                 Michelle Gonzalez,      Director.                                   ____                                       Muckleshoot Tribal Council,                                          Auburn, WA, July 12, 2019.       Re Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Epidemic.        Hon. Jerrold Nadler,       House Committee on Judiciary,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Raul Grijalva,       House Committee on Natural Resources,       Washington, DC.       Hon. Doug Collins,       Ranking Member, House Committee Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Hon. Rob Bishop,       Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.         Dear Chairmen Nadler and Grijalva and Ranking Members       Collins and Bishop: On behalf of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe       (``Tribe''), I am writing to request that the Committee on       the Judiciary and Committee on Natural Resources conduct a       joint field hearing in Washington State on the Missing and       Murdered Indigenous Women (``MMIW'') epidemic.  [[Page H8184]]         The MMIW crisis is a heart-wrenching problem impacting       Indian country. Over recent decades, thousands of American       Indian and Alaska Native (``AI/AN'') women have disappeared.       The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that       murder is the third-leading cause of death among AI/AN women       and that rates of violence on reservations can be up to ten       times higher than the national average.        This crisis is plaguing Washington State at an alarming       rate. A 2018 report by the Urban Indian Health Institute       found that Washington State ranked second in the nation for       the number of MMIW cases (71 cases). Further, the study       determined that Seattle was the city with the highest number       of MMIW cases (45). This is extremely concerning for the       Tribe considering we are located less than 30 miles from       Seattle.        While there is no single cause for the high rates of MMIW,       experts suggest several explanations, including       jurisdictional barriers; lack of cross jurisdictional       communication and planning; failure to adequately fund tribal       justice systems; and the targeting of Native women by sex       traffickers.        Legislation pending in the Judiciary and Natural Resources       committees, including Savanna's Act (H.R. 2733) would help       address the MMIW crisis. Savanna's Act, introduced by       Representatives Norma Torres, Deb Haaland, and Dan Newhouse,       would increase coordination among all levels of law       enforcement; increase data collection and information       sharing; and empower tribal governments with the resources       needed in cases involving MMIW.        In closing, the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe strongly       encourages the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on       Natural Resources to conduct a joint field hearing in the       State of Washington on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous       Women epidemic and related legislation.            Respectfully,                                                  Jaison Elkins,                                                           Chairman,                                          Muckleshoot Indian Tribe.     Mr. Speaker, these letters outline the importance to  both our Native communities in Washington State and the futures of  indigenous people around the country.   To quote from the Yakama Nation, Chairman Goudy's letter: ``As the  Yakama Nation testified in Olympia, there needs to be a genuine  response to the reports of missing and murdered Native women and girls  across Tribal lands.''   Chairman Goudy continues: ``Also, all new legislation needs to be  guided by a clear strategic framework and principles to move beyond the  current conditions endangering the lives and future generations of  Native women and girls.''   The unique perspective of Native communities like that of the Yakama  Nation are invaluable, Mr. Speaker, as we continue to debate the best  policies moving forward that will actually provide solutions to this  crisis. So I respectfully repeat my invitation to the House Committee  on the Judiciary and Committee on Natural Resources to come to my  congressional district in central Washington, and I can promise all  those members and chairmen the insight they will gain will help them  realize how this crisis truly affects our friends and neighbors on and  off Tribal lands.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard tonight how this devastating crisis  affects Tribes, States, and congressional districts across the country.  It is easy to focus on these heartbreaking statistics, but these women  are more than just numbers. They are mothers, daughters, sisters,  aunts, neighbors, and friends.   There are those who are missing, like:   18-year-old Rosalita Longee, who was last seen in Wapato in 2015;   37-year-old Roberta Jean Raines, last seen in Toppenish in 2001;   29-year-old Daisy Mae Tallman, who went missing in October of 1987;  Daisy's backpack and keys were found northwest of White Swan;   29-year-old Karen Louise Johnley, who was last seen by a friend at  the Lazy R Tavern in Harrah, Washington in 1987;   16-year-old Janice Hannigan, who, in 1971, went missing after she was  discharged by the hospital on Christmas Eve. She never arrived home and  has never been heard from again.   Then there are also the unsolved murders, including:   31-year-old Rosenda Strong, who was last seen alive in Wapato on  October 2 of last year. Her body was found in July outside of  Toppenish, and no arrests have been made;   23-year-old Destiny Louise Lloyd, who went missing on Christmas Day  2017. She was found days later south of Harrah;   31-year-old Minnie Andy. Minnie was assaulted in Wapato in July 2017.  She died from her injuries;   39-year-old Linda Dave, whose remains were found in Toppenish in  February of 2017 under a bridge;   33-year-old mother of eight, Naoma George. She was beaten to death in  an alley in Wapato in the fall of 2013;   44-year-old Barbara Celestine. Barbara died of blunt trauma to the  head in 2005;   30-year-old Shari Dee Sampson Elwell of Wapato. Shari was found dead  in White Swan in 1992;   44-year-old JoAnne Betty John. The mother of 11 had been missing for  2\1/2\ years before her remains were found in 1992. She was identified  by her dental records;   13-year-old Rozelia Sohappy, who was last seen New Year's Eve in  1988. Her remains were found outside of Brownstone;   20-year-old Jenece Wilson of Toppenish. She died of a severe blow to  the head in the summer of 1987;   26-year old Babette Crystall Green, a member of the Warm Springs  Tribe in Oregon. Her remains were found in 1987 near Wapato;   25-year-old Clydell Alice Sampson, who, after being missing for 2  years, was found in 1986 by hunters outside of Granger. She died of a  shotgun blast to the head;   33-year-old Mavis Josephine McKay. Mavis' remains were found in 1957  in Satus. Mavis was a citizen of the Umatilla Tribe.   These are just some of the women with open cases from on or near the  Yakama Nation reservation in central Washington, and this does not even  begin to cover the number of open cases in other parts of the country.   This is not an issue we can ignore, Mr. Speaker. The Native  communities we represent deserve action. Congress must, as to provide  answers to their friends, families, and loved ones, act to deliver  justice to missing and murdered indigenous women across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
