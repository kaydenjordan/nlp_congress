 Madam Speaker, I, too, offer you my and my family's  sympathies on the loss of your father.   Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in support of this historic  bill, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Enough is enough.   Racial injustice has been right before our eyes for far too long-- Amadou Diallo, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard  Brooks, and George Floyd. We can no longer turn a blind eye. We need to  meet this civil rights moment of national anguish. We must insist on  bold change, not surrender to a bare minimum.   Unarmed Black Americans are being murdered in the street by those who  have sworn to protect and serve. This is not a Black problem. It is my  problem. It is your problem. It is our American problem.   We must ban chokeholds, no-knock warrants, and finally hold officers  accountable.   George Floyd's daughter said, ``My daddy changed the world.'' Let's  come together and honor her words. Let's change the world with this  transformative bill.
