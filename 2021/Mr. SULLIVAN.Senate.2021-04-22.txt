 Madam President, it is Thursday, and by now many know-- particularly our members of our press corps--that it is time for what I  feel is probably one of the best moments in the Senate each week. It is  time for the ``Alaskan of the Week.''   We get to talk about Alaska, talk about somebody who is doing  extraordinary things for our State, for our country a lot of times, and  I like to give an update when I do my ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech on  what is going on in Alaska.   It is spring, of course. The Sun is high in most parts of the State-- actually, in all parts of the State. Spring--we call it breakup,  actually, relating to the ice on the rivers--it is upon us.   Now, of course, it can still snow, and it still gets pretty cold in a  lot of places in Alaska, but winter is on the run. The promise of  summer is in the air, and what a glorious summer it is going to be.   We aren't out of the woods yet on the pandemic in Alaska, but we have  managed--we are proud of it, I am proud of my fellow Alaskans--the  pandemic, the virus, as well as possible.   One of the things that is happening right now, our vaccination rates  have been, almost from the beginning when we got the vaccine, the  highest per capita in the country. Despite our huge challenges in terms  of size, limited population, it is really kind of a minimiracle--No. 1  vaccination rates in America in Alaska. We did it by dog sled, snow  machine, small airplanes to make that happen.   So if you are watching, America, please come on up to Alaska. It is  safe. It is open for tourism. This summer we want you to come on up.   By the way, not only will you have an amazing experience, our State  just announced a few days ago you will get a vaccine if you come to  Alaska. If your State is too inefficient or bureaucratic to actually  get a vaccine, come on up to Alaska. You can have the trip of a  lifetime, and you and your family can get vaccinated. We want you up  there. We are open for business. We want to see Americans come on up  and enjoy our great State as we are getting through this pandemic.   It is a naturally beautiful place, you will see, but the people in my  State work hard to keep it pristine and are really what makes it such a  great place.   So, today, in honor of Earth Day, I wanted to honor Homer, AK,  resident Beth Trowbridge, who has spent her career--about 40 years,  four decades--working to keep our waters in Alaska and our beaches  clean and pristine.   So let me tell you a little bit about Beth. Originally from St.  Louis, Beth first came to Alaska in 1981 as a college student to work  on the Youth Conservation Corps in Fairbanks, AK, the interior.   She only intended to stay a year or so--by the way, this is a very  common story--only intended to stay a year or so, but as so many do,  she got to Alaska and fell in love with the State so she transferred to  the University of Alaska in Fairbanks where she got her degree in  Northern and Alaska Native studies.   Now, Beth loves the wilderness. She loves living off the land,  studying the plants, studying the animals. She said: ``There are  beautiful and amazing people and amazing resources'' in Alaska. She  said she always loved the sense that, while we can all live there,  nature in Alaska is always in control--the earthquakes, the volcanoes,  the extreme weather, the coldness. They are a constant reminder that,  in her words, in Alaska ``there are the bigger forces out there''--a  lot bigger, and she wants to keep it that way.   So she became a steward of her environment and dedicated her life to  educating others so that they, too, could become stewards.   With all the talk about climate change, I fear that not nearly enough  attention is given to those outside of politics, like in this town, who  work day in and day out to care for the environment in the place they  call home--in their communities, in their States, every day on the  ground at home, making a difference.  [[Page S2159]]    That is what Beth has done. After college, she got a job as the  education coordinator for the Prince William Sound Science Center,  where she authored the ``Alaska Oil Spill Curriculum.''   Then, in 2000, she began her work--in many ways, her life's work--for  the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies, or CACS, in the drop-dead  gorgeous community of Homer, AK, surrounded by the beautiful Kachemak  Bay. Some people call Homer ``the place where the land ends and the sea  begins''; others, ``the cosmic hamlet by the sea''; and others, ``the  halibut capital of the world.''   If you haven't visited Homer, America, you have got to go to Homer.  My goodness, it is beautiful. In Alaska, we just call it awesome, in  part because of people like Beth and organizations like hers that keep  it that way.   In 2012, Beth became the organization's executive director and helped  expand the good work that CACS has been doing since 1982.   Now, this organization is primarily an educational organization and  offers people of all ages, really from across the globe--not just  Alaska, not just America, everywhere--opportunities to connect with the  outdoors, learn about coastal environments through guided walks, tours,  educational programs, overnight school programs, and so much more.   So think about this impact. Homer, where CACS is located, is a town  of about 6,000 people. CACS educates roughly 16,000 people through  these science-based programs every year. That is a big impact. They  have camps for everyone, and I would encourage anyone who is listening  who is going to go to Homer to sign up for one of these camps to  explore the unique marine ecology, the tidal pools, and the abundant  sea life; to watch whales, seals, and sea lions; to swim against the  backdrop of the Kenai Mountains; and to go into the forest and learn  about the forest, wildlife, and adaptation in the forest. There is so  much to do.   One of the big initiatives of this important organization is to deal  with marine debris. So today, on Earth Day, let me put a plug in for  the marine debris programs in my State and across the country. This is  an issue that I have been very focused on since my time as a U.S.  Senator, working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have  gotten a lot done.   We passed the Save Our Seas Act a couple of Congresses ago, and we  passed the Save Our Seas Act 2.0, which the Congressional Research  Service called the most comprehensive ocean cleanup legislation ever in  the history of the Senate. It was just passed and signed into law in  December. So we are making progress.   I do want to give a shout-out to one of my good friends, Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse. You know, some of us miss his weekly ``Wake Up''  speeches. I think mine is the only weekly speech anymore. Senator  Whitehouse, I am not sure what happened. But Senator Whitehouse and I  have worked closely on this kind of legislation--ocean debris, ocean  cleanup, and to help organizations like CACS with marine debris cleanup  and to call attention to this issue that is solvable. We can solve  this--marine debris, ocean plastics--and it is bringing a lot of people  in America and across the world together.   One of CACS's biggest annual events is the annual Kachemak Bay Coast  Walk. It involves more than 200 volunteers who adopt a section of  Kachemak Bay shoreline. And, again, you have got to visit Kachemak Bay,  one of the most beautiful places on the planet Earth. Trust me.  Surveying changes, collecting data on marine life and human impact and  cleaning up beach litter and marine debris is what people do every year  with the Kachemak Bay Coast Walk. It is the kind of great local work  that really makes a difference. It brings people from all across Alaska  together--people who know how special and beautiful Kachemak Bay is-- and it creates community. It creates community, and that is so  important, not just for our State but for our oceans and the coastline.   So that is one of the many things Beth has done.   Beth and her husband, Charlie, who is a retired shellfish biologist  with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game have four children. The  youngest is finishing eighth grade, and the oldest is 33.   Beth develops environmental curriculums for schools. She is a  Rotarian, a Girl Scout leader, and keeps CACS running seamlessly. She  says she does all of this because she has a passion for sharing the  outdoors with people--Alaskans, Americans, people from all over the  world, but especially the next generation--and she hopes that her work  not only will have an immediate impact on the environment but helps  people to understand the challenges of our oceans and to focus more on  cleanup, because who doesn't want to clean up our oceans?   Local businesses, she is noticing, are using more recyclable  material. People are leaving less trash behind. People are talking more  about cleanup and ownership, and that is how you make a difference at  the local level, and it spreads out all over the State and the country.   Beth said:         I hope that, through my work, we can provide the       opportunities to understand and appreciate nature. I am proud       of where I live. I love Homer. I want to take care of it. I       hope that others [in the community] feel that way too.    Beth, that is a great sentiment, and it is also one of the many  reasons we are proud to honor you today with this very prestigious  award, being our Alaskan of the Week. Congratulations.   I yield the floor.
