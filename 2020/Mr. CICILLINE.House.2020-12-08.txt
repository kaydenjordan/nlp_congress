 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act  of 2019, and I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.  [[Page H6991]]    I want to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Congressman  Moulton, who has led this effort in the House, and my Senator, Senator  Whitehouse, in the Senate, and all the cosponsors.   As we all know, ALS is a terribly debilitating disease. For those of  us who have friends or family members who have been diagnosed with  this, we know what a family endures when the diagnosis is made, and  they are overwrought with how they are going to manage this very  serious health challenge. Imagine, in addition to all of that, if  people have to worry about whether or not they have access to care in  those critical first months of this disease.   So, I applaud everyone who has cosponsored this bill. Patients and  families will benefit enormously from this legislation. They will have  one less thing to worry about when they are confronting this very  serious diagnosis.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank the  gentleman again for yielding.    Madam Speaker, for the roughly 10 million people who,  each year, reenter communities from jail or prison, the consequences of  a criminal sentence can last a lifetime, creating barriers to accessing  safe housing, employment, and even something as basic as a government  ID.   As the mayor of Providence, I assembled a reentry council to bring  together community leaders, including religious leaders, employers, and  housing professionals, to help people returning to their communities  with the goal of giving people a chance to fully reenter society after  they have completed their sentence.   During my time as mayor, I saw how providing community-based reentry  services helps to ensure that justice-involved individuals have the  support they need for smooth transition back into society.   When formerly incarcerated people have access to their basic needs  being met, like food assistance and employment opportunities, it can  significantly reduce the likelihood they will commit a new offense and,  as a result, make our communities safer. It gives returning citizens  the ability to provide for themselves, for their families, and to be  productive members of their communities.   That is why I am proud to support H.R. 8161, the One Stop Shop  Community Reentry Program Act, which provides 5-year grants to  community-based organizations and other eligible entities to create  community reentry centers.   The One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act incentivizes  community-based solutions to overcoming barriers to housing, education,  employment, and healthcare. It seeks to end the revolving door of  recidivism. It promotes healing by encouraging treatment and family  counseling. It helps people navigate life after prison and successfully  reenter their communities. It makes our communities safer and gives  people a fair shot at a second chance, a chance at redemption, and a  chance at success.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Bass for her extraordinary  leadership on H.R. 8161, and I urge all of my colleagues to support  this excellent legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2258, the  Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, which was introduced in the  House by Congressman Neguse, that is H.R. 8226, a piece of legislation  that he relentlessly championed and it finally is before us for final  passage.   This important legislation protects whistleblowers who report  criminal misconduct under the antitrust laws.   As my good friend just mentioned, I would also like to acknowledge  the leadership of Jim Sensenbrenner, who will be retiring from  Congress, but who has made protection of whistleblowers an important  part of his work here, and we will miss him on the Antitrust,  Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee.   This important bill provides employees with a mechanism for reporting  retaliation to the Department of Labor. Whistleblowers who report on  criminal antitrust conduct and are retaliated against, such as through  wrongful discharge, demotion, or harassment will have a path for  reinstatement, be able to be compensated for harms that they suffer and  reimbursed for litigation expenses for meritorious claims.   By extending these protections to employees who report criminal  violations of antitrust laws to the Federal Government, this important  measure will encourage whistleblowers to come forward to report extreme  criminal violations of the antitrust laws, such as price and wage  fixing, which are the supreme evil of antitrust.   Moreover, this legislation brings the criminal antitrust laws in line  with other important laws, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which  protects whistleblowers who report corporate wrongdoing.  [[Page H7009]]    No worker in America should fear for their job or economic livelihood  for exposing corporations that engage in criminal activity, and  exposing this misconduct is critical for antitrust enforcement  purposes.   I want to end where I began by applauding Congressman Neguse, the  vice chair of the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and  Administrative Law Subcommittee, a really valued and deeply respected  member of the subcommittee, for his extraordinary leadership on this  vital legislation, which has already been passed unanimously by the  Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 683) to impose requirements on the payment of compensation  to professional persons employed in voluntary cases commenced under  title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic  Stability Act (commonly known as ``PROMESA''), as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 683         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Puerto Rico Recovery       Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2020'' or ``PRRADA''.       SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE BY PROFESSIONAL PERSONS SEEKING APPROVAL                     OF COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 316 OR 317 OF                     PROMESA.         (a) Required Disclosure.--        (1) In general.--In a voluntary case commenced under       section 304 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), no attorney,       accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, agent, consultant, or       other professional person may be compensated under section       316 or 317 of that Act (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177) unless prior to       making a request for compensation, the professional person       has submitted a verified statement conforming to the       disclosure requirements of rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules       of Bankruptcy Procedure setting forth the connection of the       professional person with--        (A) the debtor;        (B) any creditor;        (C) any other party in interest, including any attorney or       accountant;        (D) the Financial Oversight and Management Board       established in accordance with section 101 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2121); and        (E) any person employed by the Oversight Board described in       subparagraph (D).        (2) Other requirements.--A professional person that submits       a statement under paragraph (1) shall--        (A) supplement the statement with any additional relevant       information that becomes known to the person; and        (B) file annually a notice confirming the accuracy of the       statement.        (b) Review.--        (1) In general.--The United States Trustee shall review       each verified statement submitted pursuant to subsection (a)       and may file with the court comments on such verified       statements before the professionals filing such statements       seek compensation under section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2176, 2177).        (2) Objection.--The United States Trustee may object to       compensation applications filed under section 316 or 317 of       PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177) that fail to satisfy the       requirements of subsection (e).        (3) Right to be heard.--Each person described in section       1109 of title 11, United States Code, may appear and be heard       on any issue in a case under this section.        (c) Jurisdiction.--The district courts of the United States       shall have jurisdiction of all cases under this section.        (d) Retroactivity.--        (1) In general.--If a court has entered an order approving       compensation under a case commenced under section 304 of       PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), each professional person subject to       the order shall file a verified statement in accordance with       subsection (a) not later than 60 days after the date of       enactment of this Act.        (2) No delay.--A court may not delay any proceeding in       connection with a case commenced under section 304 of PROMESA       (48 U.S.C. 2164) pending the filing of a verified statement       under paragraph (1).        (e) Limitation on Compensation.--        (1) In general.--In a voluntary case commenced under       section 304 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), in connection with       the review and approval of professional compensation under       section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177), the       court may deny allowance of compensation for services and       reimbursement of expenses, accruing after the date of the       enactment of this Act of a professional person if the       professional person--        (A) has failed to file statements of connections required       by subsection (a) or has filed inadequate statements of       connections;        (B) except as provided in paragraph (3), is on or after the       date of enactment of this Act not a disinterested person, as       defined in section 101 of title 11, United States Code; or        (C) except as provided in paragraph (3), represents, or       holds an interest adverse to, the interest of the estate with       respect to the matter on which such professional person is       employed.        (2) Considerations.--In making a determination under       paragraph (1), the court may take into consideration whether       the services and expenses are in the best interests of       creditors and the estate.        (3) Committee professional standards.--An attorney or       accountant described in section 1103(b) of title 11, United       States Code, shall be deemed to have violated paragraph (1)       if the attorney or accountant violates section 1103(b) of       title 11, United States Code.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 683, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in  Disclosures Act, or PRRADA, is bipartisan legislation that would  promote greater transparency and integrity with respect to  [[Page H7010]]  the ongoing financial reorganization of Puerto Rico.   In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time,  Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic  Stability Act, or PROMESA, in 2016.   That legislation established the Financial Oversight and Management  Board with control over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans,  and regulations and the authority to retain professionals to assist the  board in executing its responsibilities.   Although largely patterned on Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  PROMESA did not incorporate all facets of Chapter 11 and other relevant  provisions of the code.   Importantly, this includes the code's mandatory disclosure  requirements regarding actual or potential conflicts of interest that  professional persons seeking to be retained in a bankruptcy case must  make to the court prior to their retention.   This bill would close that loophole by conditioning the compensation  of professional persons retained under PROMESA upon certain disclosures  similar to those required under the Bankruptcy Code.   Additionally, the bill would require the United States trustee to  review these disclosures and submit comments in response to the Court,  and also authorizes the United States trustee to object to compensation  requested by professionals.   And finally, H.R. 683 would allow courts to deny the compensation for  services and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person did  not comply with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested  person, or represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy  estate.   I thank Chairwoman Velazquez for her leadership in championing this  bill and for her relentless dedication to ensuring that the people of  Puerto Rico receive the fair, efficient, and transparent restructuring  process they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which was  favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous vote,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 683 closes a loophole under current law by  establishing disclosure requirements regarding actual or potential  conflicts of interest in the Bankruptcy Code process under PROMESA. In  doing so this legislation promotes transparency and accountability in  the Puerto Rico restructuring process.   I, again, thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), the author of this bill, for her leadership on this issue,  and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.   Before closing, since this will likely be the final bill within this  subcommittee's jurisdiction considered on the floor of this Congress, I  want to take a moment to recognize the outstanding career of the  ranking member of the subcommittee and my friend, Congressman Jim  Sensenbrenner.   As part of his distinguished career, he has left an indelible mark on  the Judiciary Committee, on Congress, and on our country.  [[Page H7011]]    We recently celebrated those contributions in a ceremony held by the  committee.   Congressman Sensenbrenner has never hesitated to work across party  lines in service of hardworking Americans. As the incoming chairman of  the subcommittee, I looked to him for leadership in the beginning of  the Congress. Since then, he has been a tremendous source of advice and  wisdom over the past 2 years.   It has been a real pleasure working with him this Congress, and I  thank him for his incredible service and wish him well in his  retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 134) to amend title 18, United States Code, with regard to  stalking.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 134         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combat Online Predators       Act''.       SEC. 2. ENHANCED PENALTY FOR STALKERS OF CHILDREN.         (a) In General.--Chapter 110A of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 2261A the       following:       ``Sec. 2261B. Enhanced penalty for stalkers of children         ``(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if       the victim of an offense under section 2261A is under the age       of 18 years, the maximum imprisonment for the offense is 5       years greater than the maximum term of imprisonment otherwise       provided for that offense in section 2261.        ``(b) Limitation.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to a       person who violates section 2261A if--        ``(1) the person is subject to a sentence under section       2261(b)(5); and        ``(2)(A) the person is under the age of 18 at the time the       offense occurred; or        ``(B) the victim of the offense is not less than 15 nor       more than 17 years of age and not more than 3 years younger       than the person who committed the offense at the time the       offense occurred.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 110A of  [[Page H7012]]       title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 2261A the following new item:  ``2261B. Enhanced penalty for stalkers of children.''.        (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 2261A of title 18,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``section 2261(b)       of this title'' and inserting ``section 2261(b) or section       2261B, as the case may be''.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON BEST PRACTICES REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF                     ANTI-STALKING LAWS.         Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a report to       Congress, which shall--        (1) include an evaluation of Federal, Tribal, State, and       local efforts to enforce laws relating to stalking; and        (2) identify and describe those elements of such efforts       that constitute the best practices for the enforcement of       such laws.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the safety of our children is paramount, and the  preservation of their future is critical.   Across this country and around the world, we have awakened to a new  normal where our lives are tethered to the internet like never before.  The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all of us to execute our daily  routines online.   Children and adolescents across this country are engaged in virtual  learning every day. Therefore, they are spending countless hours on the  internet.   While this approach to learning is vital in keeping our children safe  from the spread of the virus, the widespread use of the internet and  social media can make stalking easier to carry out, allowing predators  to exploit the easy access to our children.   The borderless nature of the internet has allowed these types of  internet crimes to transcend jurisdictional boundaries. Current Federal  law prohibits narrowly defined instances of stalking where they are  accomplished via interstate travel or through electronic means.   This is why we must make sensible modifications to the stalking  statute, especially given that children and adolescents are, in many  respects, among the most vulnerable of our population.   Stalking affects millions of men and women in the United States.  Stalking is common. About 1 in 6 women and 1 in 17 men have experienced  stalking in their lifetimes.   Stalking starts early. Nearly 54 percent of female victims and 41  percent of male victims experience stalking before the age of 25 and  16.3 percent of female victims and 20.5 percent of male victims before  the age of 18.   Stalking impacts the physical and mental health of victims. Research  shows that stalking can lead to depression and post-traumatic stress  disorder. About 68 percent of female victims and 78 percent of male  victims experience threats of physical harm during their lifetimes.   I support S. 134, the Combat Online Predators Act, because this bill  amends 18 U.S.C. 2261A, which criminalizes stalking when a person  travels in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to kill,  injure, harass, intimidate, or place under surveillance with the intent  to otherwise kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person.   This can be even more critical when young people are victimized in  this way, which may occur in person or online, via cellphones,  computers, email, text messages, and on social media platforms, which  is sometimes referred to as cyberstalking.   Consequently, this bill is timely because it increases the maximum  prison term for a stalking offense by adding 5 years if the victim is  under the age of 18. The increased maximum penalty for this crime when  committed against our children is reasonable.   This bill also understands that some behavior among young people  should not be subject to enhancement that would apply to individuals  who are older and more mature. Therefore, this bill makes an exception  where the enhanced penalty shall not apply for the person who violates  the stalking statute if the person is under the age of 18 at the time  of the offense, or the victim of the offense is not less than 15 nor  more than 17 years of age and not more than 3 years younger than the  person who committed the offense at the time the offense occurred.   The bill further requires that the Attorney General submit to  Congress a report which shall include an evaluation of Federal, State,  Tribal, and other local efforts to enforce laws related to stalking and  to identify and describe those elements of such efforts that constitute  the best practices for the enforcement of such laws.   Mr. Speaker, this is a sensible bipartisan bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished and respected member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan measure because stalking is a crime in which victims are  made to live in constant fear. The effects of stalking can manifest  both physically and mentally and have short-term and long-term  consequences.   In this digital and technological world that we have now all immersed  ourselves in, it is imperative that we remain more vigilant of the  nefarious activities of those lurking in the shadows to exploit our  children's vulnerabilities.   Hence, I support the Combat Online Predators Act and I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
