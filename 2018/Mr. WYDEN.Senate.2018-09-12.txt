 Mr. President, the Senate is a bit behind in terms of the  schedule. I ask unanimous consent, as the ranking Democrat on the  Senate Finance Committee--we will be voting on Mr. Rettig here  shortly--that I be allowed to speak for up to 15 minutes at the  conclusion of my colleague Senator Bennet's remarks.    Mr. President, the Senate is considering tonight the  nomination of Charles Rettig to lead the Internal Revenue Service.  Let's be clear. This is not a typical IRS Commissioner debate.   Over the last several months, the Trump administration has weaponized  the Tax Code to punish its political adversaries and benefit shadowy,  far-right groups that seek to buy American elections. Two months ago,  just hours after Maria Butina was outed as an alleged Russian spy who  sought to influence our elections, the Trump administration announced a  new rule, opening the floodgates to more dark money and foreign money  in American politics. Dark money groups used to be required to disclose  their donors to the IRS. With this new Trump rule, they will not be  required to disclose at all.   To my colleagues, here is what this all means. Over the next 2  months, while political ads flood the airwaves, millions of Americans  are going to wonder how much of this stuff is paid for by law-breaking  foreigners and special interests. Because of the new rule, the Internal  Revenue Service and law enforcement are going to be in the dark as  well. There are a few reasons this new rule is unjustifiable and  undemocratic.   First, it had no debate in the Finance Committee, where we have  jurisdiction over the Tax Code. It had no debate on the Senate floor. I  do recall my Republican colleagues bemoaning what they considered to be  anti-conservative political interference by the Internal Revenue  Service even when none was found. Now, with a Republican administration  in office, they are changing  [[Page S6132]]  the tax rules to allow for more political interference by creative  outside groups and foreigners.   Second, the timing of this announcement could not have more clearly  underscored the rotten corruption at the heart of this policy. The new  dark money rule was announced on a Monday night--the same day it was  revealed that Maria Butina had been indicted for using the National  Rifle Association as a conduit to influence our democracy with personal  and financial ties. Another administration, in seeing that kind of news  come down, might have said: Hey, we ought to hold off on making drastic  changes. It might have said: Let's put a little more space between the  indictment of an alleged Russian spy and the rollout of our dark money  rule that would make the spy's job even easier--not this Trump  administration. It was undeterred. It, obviously, decided it could not  wait to get this new rule on the books to make it easier for foreign  actors and special interests to hide in the shadows while their dollars  influence our elections.   The tax rules and election laws in America, with respect to who has  to disclose political spending, are already badly broken, especially  after Citizens United. Now the administration is taking an enormous  problem and making it much worse. The Trump dark money rule is only  going to mean that individual Americans will have even less faith that  they will be in control of our democracy. This takes us even further  from the true meaning of one person, one vote. It puts even more power  and more influence in the hands of the special interests.   The fact is, the arguments for this change do not add up. I have  heard members of the Trump administration say, including the Treasury  Secretary, that none of this information was public before, so there is  no reason to collect it; that there is just no big deal here.   To my colleagues, the overwhelming majority of Americans want more  disclosure, not less. The administration, in effect, admits it was not  using the information political donors used to have to turn over. It  sounds to me like the Trump argument for this dark money rule goes  pretty much like this: We were not going to enforce the campaign  spending laws anyway, so we decided not to bother collecting the  special interest information at all.   That is going to be cold comfort to the millions of Americans who are  going to get clobbered by enormously funded political ads for the next  2 months before our election.   The bottom line is, the Trump dark money rule is anti-law  enforcement, anti-democratic, and anti-disclosure. It puts a blindfold  on law enforcement at the exact moment Congress ought to be coming up  with new approaches to shed more sunlight on political spending and  defend American democracy from foreign influence.   The Finance Committee's vote on Mr. Rettig's nomination was,  coincidentally, scheduled to take place during the same week the rule  came down. Obviously, this issue was a focal point in the discussion. I  raised the issue during the markup. Mr. Rettig had an opportunity to  tell the committee he would try to fix it. He did not. He wouldn't even  acknowledge the serious problem here for the cause of transparency and  openness in our government.   In my view, this rule ought to be put up to the same standard of  scrutiny the majority has applied to several other rules that were put  in place by the previous administration. The Senate ought to use the  powers granted to it by the Congressional Review Act, and it ought to  vote on whether this rule should stand. Yet now the Trump  administration is taking unprecedented steps to hide its dark money  policy from that kind of scrutiny. Trump officials are keeping their  rule off the official books for as long as they can to prevent the  Senate from holding their dark money rule to the same standard that had  been applied to the Obama administration.   When it publishes the rule in the Federal Register or it confirms  that it will not be published there but will be published elsewhere,  the rule becomes eligible for a challenge under the Congressional  Review Act. So far, the Trump administration hasn't taken either step,  even though I asked for a response 3 weeks ago. As a result, in the  Senate, we have been unable to get a straight answer as to when it is  coming or whether it plans to publish the congressional review issue at  all. It looks to me like the administration has a policy on its hands  that it knows is corrupt, that it knows is undemocratic, so it is  playing hide the ball. The more the public hears about the dark money  rule, the less it likes it, and we are going to keep talking about it.   I close with one last point, in that there is a lot about the Trump  tax policy to be concerned about this evening. Senator Menendez talked  about how blue States, like Oregon, California, New Jersey, and others,  were hit with a gut punch. Capping the State and local tax deductions  to target people in those States reveals the rotten core of the Trump  tax policy. Tonight, as we consider the Rettig nomination, I don't know  of anything more corrupt in front of this body than to make it even  harder for the American people to know where dark money--foreign  money--is coming from.   For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Rettig  nomination. He was asked to acknowledge that this is a serious problem.  He wouldn't go there. He was asked to describe what he would do to  correct the problem. He wouldn't go there. This is as corrupt as  anything I know of before the U.S. Senate, and I will be working with  my colleagues to fix this dark money crisis and undo the damage the  Trump tax law has brought on, and I will be opposing the Rettig  nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I want to recognize and honor  the late Dr. Thomas C. Maness, dean of the College of Forestry at  Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR, for his outstanding  contributions to forest research and his efforts to grow the wood  product industry in my State and nationwide.   Dr. Maness served as dean of Oregon State University's College of  Forestry from 2012 until his death on July 12. He was a visionary  leader in my State and was known around the world for his advocacy of  science-based management in the stewardship of our lands and resources.  Under his guidance, the College of Forestry earned worldwide  recognition for its innovative research and is currently the top-ranked  program in the United States and second in the world. Dr. Maness's  leadership has improved the health of our lands, people, businesses,  and ecosystems by bringing credible, relevant, and timely information  and science to our public and private forest land managers.   Prior to arriving at Oregon State University, Dr. Maness worked in  both the private and public sectors, logging substantial achievements  managing lands in the northwest, honing his scholarship in forest  science and engineered timber products in both Europe and Canada, even  contributing to the research arm of the U.S. Forest Service here in  Washington, DC. He spent a decade in the industry as a research  engineer and founded the Canadian National Centre of Excellence in  Advancing Wood Processing at the University of British Columbia.  Working closely with industry, Dr. Maness advanced research in sawmill  optimization and real-time quality control systems and believed deeply  that his research efforts should be translated into practical use for  professional foresters and manufacturers.   Dr. Maness built his career on collaboration and believed it was key  to effective forest management. He worked tirelessly to bridge the  urban-rural divide and bring new economic life to our forest-dependent  rural communities by starting what is now a nationwide movement to use  mass timber building components such as cross-laminated timber in tall  buildings. He called it the Forest to Frame movement. Dr. Maness truly  represents what I call the Oregon Way: bringing everyone together,  using science, collaboration, and cooperation to foster healthy,  working landscapes capable of supporting local economies and our strong  stewardship values.   Healthy forests, people, businesses, and ecosystems are the heart of  the Pacific Northwest, and Oregonians feel a strong connection to these  values. Dr. Maness sought balance between these ideals and provided not  only Oregonians, but the Nation, with sound guidance on all matters  related to one of our greatest natural resources. Dr.  [[Page S6139]]  Maness will be remembered for his tremendous contributions to forest  management and science.                            ____________________
