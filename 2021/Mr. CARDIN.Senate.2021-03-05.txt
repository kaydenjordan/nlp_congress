 Mr. President, similar to Senator Cantwell, I want to  talk a little bit about the small business provisions in the American  Rescue Plan and the urgency of passing the recovery act as soon as  possible. We need to act in order to deal with the recovery of COVID-19  for our Nation.   As chair of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, it is  critically important to the health of small businesses that we act on  the American Rescue Plan. Small businesses are critically important to  our economy. I think the Members of this body understand that.   Two out of every three jobs in the private sector are created through  small companies. Innovation takes place in a much larger amount in  small companies. Just look at how small companies have adjusted to  COVID-19. We have seen curbside pickup. We have seen the use of the  online deliveries. We have seen ways in which small businesses have  shown that they can figure out ways to try to stay alive under any  circumstances.   But there is another factor about small businesses, and that is that  they are not as resilient to deal with an economic downturn as the  larger companies are. So whenever we go through any type of a  recession, small businesses suffer the most. So for all of those  reasons, it was critically important for us to act to help America's  small businesses.   Democrats and Republicans worked together to create a way in which we  could help small businesses during this pandemic. It is interesting  that the very first bill that we passed removed the restrictions in  regard to the EIDL Program so that those businesses that suffered as a  result of the pandemic could qualify for the Economic Injury and  Disaster Loan Program under the Small Business Administration. We did  that because we realized that government was imposing restrictions on  small businesses in their operations, and we had a responsibility to  act.   And then in mid-March of last year--not this year, but mid-March of  last year--we passed the CARES Act, almost a year ago. It recognized  that this pandemic was having a major impact on our small businesses.  We didn't realize how long the pandemic would last. We thought it would  last a few months. We certainly did not think it would last a full  year, and now beyond a year. We passed innovative programs in order to  save small businesses.   In the one that got perhaps the most attention, the PPP program--the  Paycheck Protection Program--we initially provided $350 billion. I  would like to think of the CARES Act as, really, a Marshall Plan. It  was a Marshall Plan to deal with COVID-19. It provided the  [[Page S1226]]  monies for vaccination, research, testing, and for public health, to  help our States and local governments, to help schools, but it also  provided money in a major way to help small businesses. So $350 billion  was initially provided through the Paycheck Protection Program because  we realized that rather than having to put more money into unemployment  insurance, wouldn't it be better to keep people on payroll so that  small businesses can retain their essential workforce? And it worked.  The program was very, very popular.   But we did more than just the Paycheck Protection Program. We also  expanded the Economic Injury and Disaster Loan Program, or the EIDL  Program, because we recognized that forgivable loans of a limited  amount of money was not enough to carry businesses over during the  pandemic. They were going to need longer term loans. EIDL is a 30-year  low-interest loan, up to 30 years. And we also created a new program  known as the EIDL Advance Program, which was cash--it was not a loan,  not a forgivable loan; it was a grant of up to $10,000--because we know  for many small businesses, particularly the most stressed and the most  challenged, taking on another loan was not a possibility. So we  provided an EIDL Advance of up to $10,000.   We also provided for loan forgiveness for those who had existing or  had recently taken out 7(a) or 504 loans under the Small Business  Administration.   These programs were exceedingly popular--so popular that, within just  about a matter of weeks, we started running out of resources. We had  appropriated, we thought, a significant amount of funds, but we found  that $350 billion went pretty quickly. So we came together, and we  replenished the funds. We put more money into the Paycheck Protection  Program, and we also recognized that we had to provide more flexibility  because businesses were suffering, and they needed more ability to be  able to use those funds. So we granted additional flexibility.   When we passed the CARES Act, we thought this pandemic would be over  with by last summer. Well, that was not the case. So we came back  together again and recognized we had to do more. We passed, as you  know, this past December in the Omnibus legislation another round of  help for America's small businesses. This time, it was $325 billion of  additional help.   We provided additional eligibility for entities that had not  qualified before for the Paycheck Protection Program, and we provided a  second round of the Paycheck Protection Program. But we targeted that  second round to those small businesses that were in underserved  communities, minority communities, and the smaller of the small  businesses. We helped mission lenders, such as CDFIs and minority  depository institutions so that we could really try to reach the  underserved communities.    And we established a program for shuttered venues. Why? Because  shuttered venues were shuttered. These were institutions that could not  operate because of a government order, and we recognized we had to do  something special in order to deal with that.   So when you put that all together, what happened? Well, we saved a  lot of small businesses, and we should be proud of that record. Seven  million Paycheck Protection Program loans--forgivable loans--were  granted for $678 billion. There were 3.7 million EIDL loans given for  $200 billion. And we were oversubscribed for the EIDL Advance of $20  billion. So we were able to really help, but more is needed.   When we passed the Omnibus bill in December, we recognized that that  would hold us until March. Well, it is now March. We need to act to  complete the work.   The Trump administration, in administering the SBA programs, did  things that we thought were unacceptable. They put a cap on the EIDL  loan of $150,000. The statute says $2 million. Many businesses needed  more help than was given by the administration of the EIDL loan  program. The EIDL Advance Program was supposed to be up to $10,000, but  the administration administered it at $1,000 per employee, making it  far less desirable than Congress intended.   And, quite frankly, the underserved communities were not being met at  the level that we had expected. I say that because Senator Shaheen and  I put a provision in the CARES Act, now known as page 30, that required  the SBA to make special efforts to get to the underbanked communities  because we realized the underbanked communities were going to have  difficulty getting loans that were forgivable. Their own inspector  general of the SBA said that the SBA did not carry out the intent of  Congress. So we needed to do more to reach those communities that were  being left behind.   That is why action is needed. I want to compliment the Biden  administration. They have taken administrative action to try to help us  on this. They have opened up for 14 days exclusivity under the PPP  program for those businesses that are 20 employees or less. The smaller  of the small businesses are those that are having the most difficulty  surviving in this climate. And they had a much more real--by Executive  order or by administrative action, they now have a much more realistic  formula for the self-employed as to how much they can receive under a  PPP loan. They were able to do that through Executive action, and they  removed the discriminatory nature against returning citizens being able  to qualify for these forgivable loans.   The Biden administration has taken action. Now it is necessary for us  to take action and come in with the American Rescue Plan. We need to  pass it, $50 billion of additional help directly--directly--to small  businesses to make the EIDL Advance really work for those in low-income  communities so they can get their full $10,000 grant that we intended  them to receive. So that we can make that work, we need to provide  another $15 billion to the EIDL Advance Program, targeting it to the  underserved communities.   We have a program to help our restaurants--why help the  restaurants?--with $25 billion. Here is the fact. Even with the  restaurants starting to come back, we are 2 million jobs less in the  restaurant field since the beginning of COVID-19--2 million jobs less.  The National Restaurant Association estimates that 110,000 restaurants  have either shuttered for good or are shuttered today as a result of  COVID-19. We need to direct help to the restaurant community.    The shuttered venue program needs additional support, so an extra  $1.25 billion is provided for shuttered venues. I will just give you  one example. The Merriweather Post Pavilion located in Howard County,  MD--I have been there many times--has not operated since last March.  They need help. A thousand jobs are dependent upon the Merriweather  Post Pavilion.   I am sure every one of my colleagues could mention the venues in  their own State that have been shuttered as a result of COVID-19 that  need that help.   We provide $7.25 billion for nonprofits, expanding eligibility, and  for the digital news platforms that need help. Johns Hopkins University  has done a study, and it has shown that the employment level in our  nonprofit community has dropped 1 million jobs since COVID-19 occurred.  We know the great work that they do, how they step up and help us  anytime, but particularly during a pandemic and during a national  crisis. They need help, and they should be eligible to be able to  receive the help under the Small Business PPP program. This bill will  provide that flexibility so they can get the help that they need-- another reason we have to pass the American Rescue Plan.   Then, lastly, let me mention the community navigators. There is a  modest amount of money here so we can have people who can help those  who are not as sophisticated to be able to get the help that they need  through a community navigator. Yes, we have the Women's Business  Centers. Yes, we have the Small Business Development Centers. But we  need more help. I think the record has shown that.   Then, lastly, let me say, yes, we need to pass the American Rescue  Plan for the direct help to small businesses, but they also need our  economy to return to some degree of normalcy. That is why there is help  for opening our schools, help for State and local governments, help for  families with direct payments and unemployment insurance, SNAP  benefits, COBRA protection; why the vaccine distribution is so  important, the Medicaid expansion, housing assistance. And I could go  on and on and on.   America needs the American Rescue Plan, and they need it now.  Democrats  [[Page S1227]]  worked with the Trump administration so that we could get help during  that administration. Republicans need to join us in helping the  American people.   Let's pass the American Rescue Plan, and let's do that as soon as  possible.   Mr. President, I rise today to go over with our colleagues the  importance of the American Rescue Plan as it relates to small  businesses.   As every member of this Chamber knows, small businesses are the  growth engine of the American economy. Small businesses are where jobs  are created--creating two of every three new jobs and employing almost  half of the Nation's private sector workforce during the years leading  up to the pandemic.   Just as important as the jobs they create, small businesses are where  innovation happens in our economy. They are the entities that are  figuring out better, more efficient ways of doing things.   Mr. President, we are 1 week away from the 1-year anniversary of the  historic day on March 11 of last year when the World Health  Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.   In the year since, we have seen small businesses nationwide struggle,  but we have also seen their creativity and ingenuity on display. We  have seen the restaurants that have moved to curbside pick-up and  online deliveries because it is unsafe to have in-person dining.   These small businesses are the reason why our economy is performing  at the level it is, which may not be the level we want it to be, but  the ingenuity of these small businesses have put us in a much better  position.   But Mr. President, there is another characteristic of small  businesses that I think we all understand.   We all understand that they don't have the same degree of resiliency  as larger businesses, because they operate on razor-thin margins, they  don't have deep pockets, and as a result, they often struggle to find  outside financing. So when our economy hits a bump in the road, small  businesses suffer the most.   So Mr. President, when the impact COVID-19 would have on our economy  became clear last year, it was particularly important for us to respond  to help our small businesses so that when we get out of this pandemic,  when our economy returns, our small businesses emerge in a position to  help our economy recover, and continue to grow.   We had to support our small businesses, because the public health  restrictions on public gatherings--which have saved thousands of lives  and kept our communities safe--have been especially challenging for  small businesses.   So Congress had to respond, and we did. Our first major response was  the CARES Act--a bold, bipartisan bill that was created to help small  businesses, families, and create a ``Marshall Plan'' for healthcare,  which put money into vaccine development, producing personal protective  equipment, and put money into testing and other public health measures.   Because we recognized then, and now, that we have a responsibility as  the federal government to control the pandemic.   So the very first bill we passed in response to the pandemic made  small businesses affected by the pandemic eligible for the Economic  Injury Disaster Loan program.   Traditionally used to help small businesses recover from a natural  disaster like a hurricane or a tornado, EIDL provides low interest,  long-term--up to 30 years--loans to help businesses recover.   IT was important that we include EIDL as a tool in the Small Business  Administration's toolkit, because we knew small businesses would need  the flexible, patient capital provided by EIDL.   Next we passed the CARES Act, which provided more than $370 billion  in direct aid to small businesses bearing the costs of keeping us safe.   It created the Paycheck Protection Program, a bipartisan program  designed to keep employees on payroll. And we appropriated $350 billion  to the program.   We did this because we recognized at the time that while a business  could lay off workers who could then collect unemployment, it would be  better to keep them on payroll.   PPP provided an immediate influx of aid to small businesses through  forgivable loans equivalent to 2 months of payroll costs that could be  used primarily for payroll, but for other business expenses as well.  For small businesses that used the appropriate portion of their PPP  loan for payroll, the loan would be forgiven.   To complement EIDL and PPP, we created the EIDL Advance grant program  for those small businesses that were unable to take out a loan because  they were struggling to pay their existing loans.   The EIDL Advance program would provide grants up to $10,000 for our  most vulnerable small businesses. For many businesses, the grants were  a lifesaver that provided an immediate cash infusion without having to  worry about additional loans of their books.   We also created the SBA Debt Relief program to cover the monthly  payments on new and existing traditional SBA loans, including SBA 7(a)  and 504 loans.   Mr. President, the CARES Act was signed on March 27, and according to  SBA, more than $340 billion in PPP loans were approved by April 16-- roughly 3 weeks after the bill was signed.   So we had to appropriate additional funds for the program due to the  demand for the loans. We also made PPP more flexible for small  businesses in recognition of the fact that our Nation would be  confronting the pandemic for months to come and that we would not have  the pandemic behind us by summer, as we had hoped.   PPP, EIDL, EIDL Advance grants, and the SBA Debt Relief program  helped save many small businesses.   We only need to look at the numbers.   Since the creation of PPP last March, SBA has approved more than 7  million PPP loans worth more than $678 billion. Most of those funds  went directly to the millions of employees at those small businesses to  care for themselves and their families. SBA has approved more than 3.7  million EIDL applications providing loans worth more than $200 billion.   The EIDL Advance grant program has exhausted its initial $20 billion  appropriation.   In the months since these programs have been up-and-running, Mr.  President, we have learned many lessons that we must now deploy in  order to finish the job of ensuring that small businesses are protected  through this pandemic.   We learned that the historic barriers that small businesses in  underserved communities, especially Black- and Latino-owned small  businesses, do not have relationships with the traditional banking  institutions that make PPP loans.   Senator Shaheen and I were concerned about this as we wrote the CARES  Act, which is why we put a provision in the bill that required SBA to  issue guidance to banks participating in PPP to prioritize loan  applications from underserved small businesses.   Unfortunately, SBA did not do that, which led the SBA IG to issue  report that found that SBA's implementation of PPP ``did not fully  align'' with the Congressional intent of the CARES Act.   In response to SBA's failure to issue that guidance, a group of  stakeholders advocating on behalf of minority businesses started a  group known as the Page 30 Coalition, because the provision I talked  about was on page 30 of the CARES Act.   PPP wasn't the only program harmed by the way it was implemented by  the Trump administration.   The Trump administration hindered the utility of EIDL by capping  loans at $150,000, which is far below the $2 million cap that is in  statute.   And EIDL Advance grants were made less useful to small businesses due  to the Trump administration's decision to provide EIDL applicants with  $1,000 per employee for up to 10 employees, instead of the $10,000  grant provided by the CARES Act.   So I was pleased that we finally lived up to our overdue  responsibility to pass more economic aid in December. The bipartisan  $900 billion relief bill provided an additional $325 billion in aid to  small businesses and included provisions to make PPP a more useful  program for more of our most vulnerable small businesses.   The bill provided $284 billion for first and second PPP loans, and it  set aside  [[Page S1228]]  $15 billion for mission lenders, as well as another $15 billion set- aside for certain smaller financial institutions, such as credit unions  and farm credit institutions.   The bill also made SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs more affordable  for borrowers and less risky for lenders; those programs helped  jumpstart the economy following the Great Recession.   The bill provided $20 billion for targeted EIDL Advance grants that  will be provided to small businesses in eligible low-income  communities. For small businesses in these communities that already  received an EIDL Advance grant, SBA will provide them with the  difference for a full $10,000 grant.   And we extended the Small Business Debt Relief Program for several  more months, which freed up cash flow for small businesses to use for  working capital.   Mr. President, I am proud to share that the changes to PPP are  already yielding results.   Data from SBA on this current round of PPP shows lower loan averages,  which indicates that more of the smaller, more vulnerable small  businesses are receiving loans this time than they did during the  initial months of PPP.   I was very proud last week after the Biden Administration announced  steps it was taking to make PPP a more equitable program and provide  relief to the many of Black- and Latino-owned small businesses that  were left out of, or underfunded, during previous rounds of relief.   The changes include a 14-day dedicated window for small businesses  with fewer than 20 employees to apply for PPP; an improved loan  calculation formula for sole proprietors, independent contractors, and  self-employed individuals; and the elimination of an unnecessary  restriction that prevented small business owners with a prior non-fraud  felony conviction from obtaining a PPP loan.   These changes will help many small businesses secure the aid they  need.   Now is the time to seize on that momentum.   The American Rescue Plan will deploy an additional $50 billion to the  communities and industries that still need help, and are likely to need  continuing support in the months to come.   Mr. President, this bill is necessary right now, because the  industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic are also the  industries that will take the longest to resume full operations after  the pandemic--some of which are reliant on large crowds to turn a  profit; others because they are already struggled to access capital  before the pandemic, and will only be worse off after it.   It is vital that we provide additional funding to these industries,  because they have accounted for a large portion of the jobs lost during  the pandemic.   According to the National Restaurant Association, as of December of  last year, 110,000 eating and drinking places were closed for business  temporarily, or for good, and the sector finished 2020 nearly 2.5  million jobs below its pre-COVID level. And at the peak of initial  closures last year, the group estimates that up to 8 million restaurant  employees were laid off or furloughed.   The live events industry also needs additional support, because they  are the most reliant on large crowds to turn a profit, and businesses  in the sector often support hundreds of jobs, both directly and through  their relationships with other businesses.   In my home state of Maryland, for example, Merriweather Post Pavilion  in Howard County supports nearly 1,000 jobs across the State.   We must also expand support to more nonprofits, because the job  losses caused by the pandemic have not been limited to the for-profit  entities. According to a report from the Johns Hopkins University,  there are nearly 1 million fewer nonprofit jobs today than there were  in February of last year, including the 50,000 jobs lost by the  nonprofit sector in December. The report projects that it will take 18  months to regain the nonprofit jobs lost during the pandemic.   It goes without saying that getting these jobs back as quickly as  possible will be key to a swift, robust recovery. And enacting the  American Rescue Plan will help us do just that.   What these small businesses need more of however, are not loans, but  grants.   That is why the American Rescue Plan includes $15 billion for  targeted EIDL grants to provide hard-hit, underserved small businesses  with increased flexible grant relief, which will be particularly  helpful for very small businesses and sole proprietors.   This provision is especially important for minority-owned businesses,  which are more likely to be sole proprietors and have fewer employees  on average.   The American Rescue Plan will also create a $25 billion dedicated  grant relief program for restaurants, and it will provide an additional  $1.25 billion to the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program, which was  created by the December bill.   The American Rescue Plan will expand PPP eligibility to additional  nonprofits that are providing essential social services, as well as  digital news services that are keeping our communities informed about  the pandemic.   The plan provides SBA with an additional $1.325 billion in  administrative funding to implement and scale up these grant programs.   And lastly, the plan provides $175 million for a community navigator  pilot program designed to help small businesses in underserved and  underbanked communities access the COVID-19 resources available to  them.   If we remember from the Affordable Care Act, community navigators  help get information out to hard-to-serve communities, and they will  help small business owners apply for the programs that best meet their  needs.   They are a good complement to SBA's existing resource partners, such  as the Women's Business Centers and Small Business Development Centers.   Mr. President, President Biden promised the American people that help  is on the way, and that is exactly what we intend to do by passing the  American Rescue Plan into law.   It is a bold approach, because the problems we are facing are so  great. We must pass this bill immediately.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. This is a matter  of basic fairness.   When we passed the Paycheck Protection Program, it included  nonprofits. We didn't have the cost estimates for all the (c)'s.  Originally we only included the (c)(3)'s. We added the (c)(6)'s during  the omnibus. This adds the rest of the (c)'s, other than (c)(4)'s, with  the protection against lobbying activities, et cetera, that is in the  bill. The standards are the same as they are for the other nonprofits.  This is just a matter of fairness.   Let me just point out, according to information that we have received  from a Johns Hopkins University study, we have lost over a million jobs  in the nonprofit sector as a result of COVID-19. This bill is needed,  and we need to be fair to all the nonprofits.   I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1014     Mr. President, I oppose this motion to recommit. This  moves us in the wrong direction.   We have had bipartisan support recognizing that those who have been  convicted of crime, once they paid their price, should be able to  participate in our society.   The motion to recommit would suggest that someone who may have  participated in a rally while they were in college 15 years ago and has  a perfectly clear record could be prevented from participating in the  SBA programs. That is moving in the wrong direction. I hope we would  have strong rejection of this amendment.   Mr. President, I want to correct the record or at least clarify the  record for Senator Lankford. He raised the point in regard to  administrative funds being made available to the SBA. There was a small  amount, $70 million, put into the program. That is additional funds.   The EIDL loan program is $200 billion worth of loans, so it is a much  larger program, and that was just some additional funds that were being  put into the program.    Mr. President, this month we are celebrating Women's  History Month, which is a time for us to look back on history and  recognize all of the barriers women have overcome, honor women's rights  champions, and strategize on the work we still have ahead of us. Our  country has made great strides and progress in recent decades. We  cannot let previous generations' hard work and sacrifices go to waste.   Dating back to the 1800s, women's history of philanthropists,  suffragists, and activists in my home State of Maryland is rich.  Margaret Briggs Gregory Hawkins, born in 1887, was instrumental in the  long-haul efforts of women earning the right to vote. Her dedicated  efforts for women's rights and civil rights were evident at the local  level in my hometown of Baltimore. Through her membership in women's  grassroots organizations, such as the Druid Hill Branch of the YWCA,  Civilian Defense Mobilization, and the Progressive Women's Suffrage  Club, she focused on cultivating meaningful relationships, leadership  skills, and advancing civil rights and voting rights for women of  color. We commemorate Margaret this Women's History Month as she is  inducted into the 2021 Maryland Women's Hall of Fame.   Women's History Month is a time for us to remember the fearless women  who shaped history as we know it. In 2020, we lost Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Affectionately known as the ``notorious  RBG,'' Justice Ginsburg paved the way for millions of women in her  relentless fight for justice and equality. She was a warrior in  guaranteeing women had a sound voice in the arena. Justice Ginsburg  challenged us to ``think about how you would like the world to be for  your daughters and granddaughters.''   While 2020 was tumultuous, it also brought anniversaries that are  worth noting. In August, we celebrated the milestone of the 100th  anniversary of women's suffrage. The right to vote is a central to the  heart of our democracy. I cannot think of a better way to ring in this  milestone than by electing our first female Vice President, Vice  President Kamala Harris.   It was a privilege and a joy to serve with my friend Kamala in the  Senate. She has been pivotal in women's history. Aside from her  groundbreaking role as our first female Vice President, she is the  first woman, first South Asian American, and first African American to  serve as attorny general in California's history. When looking back on  her achievements, she often quotes her mother, who would tell her,  ``Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are  not the last.'' I could not agree more.   While Vice President Harris made history and shattered the glass  ceiling with her election victory this past November, there is still  work we must do. The first step in leveling the playing field between  men and women, today and for future generations, is to pass the Equal  Rights Amendment, ERA. Justice Ginsburg once said that if she could  choose an amendment to add to the Constitution, it would be the Equal  Rights Amendment. That is because she would like her granddaughters,  [[Page S1273]]  when they pick up the Constitution, to see that notion--that women and  men are persons of equal stature--as a basic principle of our society.   To this day, the Constitution of the United States, our Nation's key  document and supreme law, does not consider men and women of equal  stature. For example, the Constitution does not protect equal pay under  the law. Women, especially women of color, are earning significantly  less than their male counterparts for the same work. Women make up a  majority of the population, yet are underrepresented in our government  institutions and the business world.   The ERA has reached the necessary 38-State ratification threshold for  this landmark legislation to be added to the Constitution of the United  States. The ERA would solidify and protect the rights of women where  our legislation currently falls short. The ERA would raise the standard  of scrutiny with which the courts analyze cases of discrimination on  the basis of sex and send the vital message that women and men are  citizens of equal stature in the United States.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation in the Senate, S.J. Res. 1,  with the senior Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, that would remove  the existing deadline and allow us to bring this meaningful legislation  to the finish line once and for all.                            ____________________
