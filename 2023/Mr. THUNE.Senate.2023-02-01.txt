Res. 21) was agreed to.    Madam President, later today, I will introduce the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, along with my colleague  Senator Lankford. It is a simple bill. It simply states that a baby  born alive after an attempted abortion is entitled to the same  protection and medical care that any other newborn baby is entitled to.  And you would think that it would be a simple ``yes'' vote from every  Member of this body, but unfortunately, that is not where we are.   Four years ago and then three years ago, the U.S. Senate took up this  bill, and almost every single Democrat in this body voted against it.  Just 3 weeks ago, the House of Representatives took up this bill, and  almost every single Democrat over there voted against it. Apparently  banning infanticide is now controversial because--let's be clear--that  is what we are talking about here.   Some Democrats have tried to cloak their opposition to this bill in  meaningless phrases about a private decision between a woman and her  doctor, but what is the decision we are talking about? We are talking  about whether or not a living baby, born after an attempted abortion,  should be provided with medical care or be left to die or, I suppose,  be killed outright by the abortionist. That is what we are talking  about. That is the ``decision'' Democrats are referring to. And that is  apparently the decision they think should be left up to patients and  their doctors--whether or not to let a living, breathing baby die.   The Senate voted on a previous version of this bill introduced by my  former colleague Senator Sasse 4 years ago when the Democratic Governor  of Virginia came right out and said you could keep a newly born baby  comfortable while you decided what to do with it--in other words, while  you decided whether to let the child die or, I guess, kill it or  whether to let it live. That chilling statement made it abundantly  clear that we needed to state explicitly that any baby, wherever he or  she is born, including in an abortion clinic, is entitled to medical  care. It is staggering that we have gotten to the point where we need  to debate this in Congress, staggering that this wouldn't be an  automatic ``yes'' vote from every Member of this body, but that is  where we are.   If anyone thinks that abortion isn't a slippery slope, that we can  somehow devalue unborn babies' lives while maintaining respect for  everyone else's, then I am here to tell them differently because the  Democratic Party has gotten to the point where its members not only  oppose legislation to protect unborn babies; they oppose legislation to  protect born ones as well. In Democrats' world, there are now  apparently two classes of born babies: the wanted ones born alive in  delivery rooms and the unwanted ones born alive in abortion clinics.  Apparently, only one of those classes of babies is entitled to the  equal protection of the laws.   Democrats talk a lot about abortion when they are talking about this  bill, but this bill, of course, would do absolutely nothing to restrict  abortion. It is not a bill protecting unborn babies; it is a bill  protecting born babies.   I do understand why Democrats are so worked up, though, because while  this bill may not do anything to restrict abortion, there is always the  chance that drawing attention to the humanity and dignity of the child  who has just been born will draw attention to the humanity and dignity  of the child who is about to be born--the child Democrats are  determined our laws should not protect. And Democrats are apparently so  determined to preserve the so-called right to kill unborn babies that  they are fully comfortable opposing a law that would protect born-- born--babies.   These are hard things to talk about, but they have to be said because  that is the reality of where we are right now.  [[Page S206]]  Roughly 50 percent of the U.S. Congress opposes giving the equal  protection of the law to born human beings if they happen to be born  alive following an attempted abortion.   Now, I think we are at a real inflection point as to where we want to  be as a nation. Do we want to be a country where the circumstances of  your birth determine whether or not your right to life is protected? Do  we want to be a country that endorses leaving living, breathing babies  to die, that discards born babies because they are, for a moment at  their birth, unwanted? I don't know. I think we are better than that.  We have to be better than that.   If we truly want to be a nation that protects human rights, that  stands for justice, that defends the vulnerable, then we cannot be a  nation that says it is acceptable to leave living, breathing, born  human beings to die in abortion clinics, that says there are two  classes of newborn babies and that only one of them deserves to be  protected. Every human being deserves to be protected, no matter the  circumstances of his or her birth.   I want to thank Senator Lankford for his leadership on this issue. We  will be working together to advance this legislation, and I pray that  sooner rather than later, we will get to the day when this bill will be  an automatic ``yes'' vote from every Member of this body.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 204         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a       hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the       protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or       for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other       facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a       patient within its care.
