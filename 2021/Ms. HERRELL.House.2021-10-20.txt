 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in defense of American  families who are worse off in every way since President Joe Biden took  office exactly 10 months ago.   Today, the average U.S. household now spends $175 more per month on  groceries, gas, and their homes. In New Mexico, gas is a full dollar  per gallon more than it was just 1 year ago. That may not mean much to  Washington politicians, but it means a lot to people in rural New  Mexico who have to drive long distances. It is the kind of cost that  can hurt a family.   Food is more expensive, jobs are not coming back fast enough, and the  Biden administration tells Americans that they will have to be happy  with no Christmas presents this year. In the middle of all this,  Democrats think that a Bernie Sanders' budget bill makes sense.   Here we sit, not even discussing the supplies and cargo sitting off  the California coast. If this is the Build Back Better plan, then count  me out because it looks like we need to start making America great  again.                            ____________________
