 Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about a  couple of items this morning. One is the nomination of Max Vekich to be  Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission and also to talk about  the very important issue of our colleagues working together on  America's innovation investment for the future. But let me just speak  first about the nomination of Max Vekich to be a Commissioner of the  Federal Maritime Commission.   The COVID pandemic has caused unprecedented congestion at our ports  and supply chain disruptions. Businesses and Americans are feeling the  pinch of the rising prices and shortages of products every day. The  news is that our colleagues can do something about that this morning.  They can do something about that this morning.   At a time when our country is in need of a strong Federal Maritime  Commission, it is important that they do their oversight role--that  they investigate, that they regulate unfair practices by foreign  shipping companies and make sure U.S. shippers, our growers, and  manufacturers get a fair deal. The Federal Maritime Commission is  particularly important when it comes to ensuring that American products  get access to markets around the globe.   While I don't agree with the conclusion of the minority leader on our  investment in helping Americans during the pandemic, I know this: Right  now, the Federal Maritime Commission should be investigating  international shippers who are overcharging U.S. exporters.   Farmers have been hard hit by congestion and shipping challenges.  U.S. agriculture exporters have experienced a 22-percent decrease in  exports. Agriculture accounts for about one-tenth of America's goods  exports, and roughly 20 percent of what U.S. farmers and ranchers  produce is sent abroad. That is why they deserve a fair deal on  shipping prices.   Many of these products move by containerized freight, and  containerized freight costs have more than doubled since the pandemic.  Washington hay producers estimate that the freight costs could be three  times more expensive by this winter.   In addition to freight costs, ships are returning to Asia with empty  containers and stranding U.S. exports at the docks. This is an  unprecedented nature of shipping and has had a major impact on American  exporters. It is important that we understand that we need to do  something about it.   The National Milk Producers Federation estimates that shipping  disruption cost the U.S. dairy industry nearly $1 billion in the first  half of 2021.   Apples are Washington's most valuable agricultural commodity, with  $2.1 billion in sales in 2020. About 30 percent of the State's product  is exported. According to the Washington State Apple Commission, port  congestion has producers concentrating this year more on North American  markets as opposed to overseas markets, cutting into their profit. For  every 1 million boxes of fresh apples shifted into the U.S. domestic  market, the price drops about 50 cents per box as supply begins to  overtake demand. These losses impact real American jobs and the  American economy.    But let's look at the other side of the equation. As Washington  growers and American growers and American manufacturers struggle,  foreign shipping companies are reporting more than $200 billion in  profits--more than double the profit they made over the last 20 years  combined. That is what these international shippers are profiting. So  it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that we helped Americans  get a paycheck during the pandemic; it has to do with foreign companies  that are overcharging U.S. producers of goods.   At this critical time in our country, we need a Federal Maritime  Commission to move decisively to put in place practices and regulations  to address port congestion and support U.S. exporters and help them not  be the target of unfair practices such as exorbitant shipping costs and  a lack of access to ships. We need a Commission that will take action  and improve the information flow at ports, investigate these illegal  practices, and take enforcement action against foreign bad actors who  are overcharging U.S. exporters and other shippers. We need a  Commission that will stand up to foreign shipping interests and protect  American manufacturers, farmers, and other exporters.   So, yes, there is something we can do about our supply chain woes,  particularly for States that have big export economies.   That is why American shippers and producers--``American shippers''  meaning the people who are actually shipping product--that is why  American shippers and producers are behind the nomination of Max  Vekich, because Mr. Vekich knows the ports, knows the shipping  community, and has spent more than 40 years working on the waterfront.  He spent his life working in the maritime industry and knows the  challenges we face in maritime, intermodal transportation, congestion,  and continuing to move forward on how we advance our ports.   If you have worked on the docks for 40 years, I guarantee you, you  know about every product, and you know what challenges we face from  this international competition.   We are on the precipice of moving important competitive legislation,  but part of that competitive legislation is getting our products on  vessels instead of being stranded at the docks and preventing shipping  companies from retaliating against U.S. exporters.   Again, the majority of this product is moved by international  shippers. It is an international business. So we need a Commission in  place that is willing to act, a Commission that is willing to use their  authority to enforce our current laws and to make sure we are  protecting American exporters.   That is why exporters like the Idaho Dairy Association support Max  Vekich, because they know he knows how to move product.  [[Page S623]]    That is why the American Association of Port Authorities, a trade  association representing more than 80 ports across the United States,  supports Max Vekich, citing his unique leadership as a longtime  maritime worker in the sector.   The Pacific Northwest Waterways Association represents ports, tug and  barge companies, steamship operators, grain elevator operators,  agricultural producers, forest products manufacturers, electric  utilities, irrigation districts, and other businesses throughout Idaho,  Oregon, and Washington. This organization does not typically endorse  candidates for these Federal offices, but today, they are calling for  Mr. Vekich to be confirmed on the basis of his ``firsthand knowledge of  maritime industry operations.''   Mr. Vekich knows what it takes to move product from the heartland. He  knows that in our Washington ports, we are helping U.S. farmers get  their products to market. So I know that whether it is wheat or  soybeans or other ag products, he knows what it takes to move them and  what it takes for us to continue to improve the efficiency of our  ports. Whether it is the Midwest manufactured products like cars and  jeeps, he knows what that takes and what it takes to continue to grow a  skilled workforce who will help us do that cost-effectively. He knows  how to work with industry, like agricultural producers and the  waterfront workforce alike.   So at a time when we are asking our dock workers and our longshoremen  to work around-the-clock to help elevate our efficiencies and improve  port congestion--and, I might say, at the loss of life. The amount of  death in the longshoreman community would break your heart. They  continued to work during the COVID-19 crisis and literally lost their  lives. This is what these people are doing. They are helping us keep  our supply chain going. So the least we can do is invest in somebody  who is going to help us understand what it takes to do that on a day- to-day basis.   We need to make sure that we have a competitive and fair environment  for U.S. companies. So I ask my colleagues to confirm Max Vekich as  Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission this morning.   Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a list of supporters I mentioned.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             List of Supporters         American Association of Port Authorities, Idaho Dairy       Association, Darigold, Northwest Dairy Association, Pacific       Northwest Waterways Association, International Longshore       Association, Tote Maritime, Saltchuk, Foss Maritime, Pasha,       Matson, SSA Marine, Carnival, Transportation Institute,       National Pilots Association.        American Maritime Congress, ILWU, Inland Boatman's Union,       Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, National Farmers       Union, Masters Mates and Pilots, American Radio Association,       Seafarers, TTD, AFL-CIO, Local Washington state teamsters,       Local chapters of the Farm Union, Northwest Seaport Alliance,       Port of Tacoma, Port of Seattle.                 United States Innovation and Competition Act     Madam President, now I would like to turn our attention  to an issue that is also dealing with our supply chain, and that is the  issue of Congress moving forward on the differences between the House  and Senate bills on America's investment in R&D and innovation.   As the chart shows, our investment today equals U.S. jobs in our  economy tomorrow. So the United States Competition Act or, as we passed  it here, the United States Innovation and Competition Act is at a  crossroads because we need to get it into conference.   Other countries definitely aren't waiting--I guarantee you that. They  are making investments in innovation and technology. Where we are in  the United States is we are at a 45-year low in the amount of  investment in R&D against our GDP. So we are not keeping pace.   Many times I have been out on the floor here talking about why we are  not keeping pace. We tried. Unfortunately, we tried several years ago  and then had an economic downturn. So everybody signed up: Let's put  more into R&D investment. Then we had an economic downturn, and we  never fulfilled that promise. So the real consequences of that are we  are now behind in some very key sectors that we need to make  investments in.   The good news for us is that people are willing to make those  investments, like the Intel company, which just decided recently to  make a multibillion-dollar investment in the State of Ohio to grow chip  fabrication there. So we have opportunities if we make these  investments.   When the world presents a challenge, the American people, the people  in our State--they rise to the challenge, and the American spirit has  never ceased to amaze me. I guarantee, innovation is in the DNA of  Americans. Why? Because we live in a country where you are free to do  what you want. You are free to go and start a company and try your  skill set. We encourage it. We need to have that same spirit here  working collaboratively to get this legislation rectified and onto the  President's desk. There isn't a moment to wait for revolutionizing  science, creating jobs, and invigorating our new economic centers  around the Nation.   My colleague Senator Wicker and I worked on a very important aspect  of the bill, which is driving more innovation dollars into research  institutions in States that haven't traditionally had large research  footprints. This will be an issue of contention, I am sure, with some  of our colleagues, but my point is, innovation can happen anywhere, and  innovation infrastructure should be everywhere. So if we want that to  happen in Reno, NV, we need to make an investment in Reno, NV. I  believe in that because I am pretty sure the Sierra company is a very  big leader in the aerospace sector, and I think they are headquartered  in Reno, if I am not mistaken. This is what I am talking about. You can  build.   Guess what. Not everything has to happen in Seattle or San Francisco  or Boston or out here on the corridor here in Virginia. That is because  the innovation age means that innovation can happen at a very flat  level. It can happen anywhere.   So why would we constrict it? We don't want to constrict it. We want  to empower it. American leadership can't wait. What we need is to be  collaborative here in the U.S. Senate because that collaboration  between government, academia, and industry is what drives the next  level of innovation.   Just think about what happened with ARPA, DARPA as we made the  innovations with the internet. As the Acting President pro tempore  knows, because she is a programmer, that innovation allowed us to then  build out a commercial aspect of the internet that would not have  happened, at least at that moment in time. In 1993, it wouldn't have  happened. Look at where we are today with an internet economy, all  because we had U.S. innovation.   So technology after technology has been invented, and our U.S.  companies have continued to innovate, develop a workforce, and skill  people for the opportunities of tomorrow. But that leadership is not  guaranteed, and time and time again, history has shown us that while we  innovate here, other people are going to follow.   In aviation, the Wright brothers were the first to demonstrate this  with the Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, but the United States soon fell  behind in aviation as European governments invested and built out this  new industry. By 1913, the U.S. military had 6 planes and 14 trained  pilots. France had 216 airplanes and 171 trained pilots.   So leadership can't wait. You can't wait. I think people get this. We  do a lot of the innovation, and other people take that innovation and  implement it. That is why a major section of the bill is about  translational science. It is about taking that innovation in the United  States and translating it into faster adoption applications for  industries.   Congress finally decided to invest in American leadership in 1915 by  creating the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which worked  with academia and industry to regain America's dominance and find how  we build planes that even last today. That is what we are talking  about. That is why we feel that NASA is part of this bill. NASA is our  R&D Agency for aviation. That is what NASA is. Yes, it deserves a place  in this legislation.   A new aviation industry and new aviation supply chains sprung up  [[Page S624]]  across the country in places like Wichita, KS, and Seattle, WA. The  story would repeat itself after the Soviet Union challenged U.S.  leadership in the 1950s. Almost immediately, Congress recognized that  leadership could not wait, and that is when we did NASA. Bringing  together government, academia, and industry to create new generations  of American expertise and technical advancements is what eventually put  a man on the Moon and what will put someone--a woman this time--on the  Moon, but America had to choose to lead.   That is what we are going to be asked about with USICA in getting it  done. We have to choose to lead, to invest in technology. That  technology brought us places like Huntsville, AL, and Houston, TX. In  2020, the aerospace industry supported 2 million good-paying jobs, with  an average salary of over $100,000 per year, and generated $900 billion  in revenue. That is what the innovation economy did for us.   That is why we want to now upgrade the innovation, particularly as it  relates to semiconductors. The availability of these tiny chips is one  of the most pressing issues facing our country now. People can't get  access to them. It is so bad that, of the people who now have electric  cars or hybrids, if you have a used car, you know that your price goes  down; that it just continues to go down. Now used car prices are  actually going up. So few cars are available that the consumers want in  this area that, actually, used cars are getting more money. Prices are  going up and not down.   This shortage cost the transportation sector $210 billion last year  alone. We can't wait. We can't wait on these issues. We can't wait. The  essence of acting now--getting together, communicating with our  colleagues, working together in a collaborative spirit--is what is  going to get this legislation over the goal line and help us.    The first transistor, as part of this chip industry, was invented in  1947 in New Jersey, representing a collaboration from scientists across  physics, electrical engineering, and chemistry, but in the 1980s, the  U.S. semiconductor industry faced a serious challenge from an ally of  ours--Japan. Leadership did not wait. We did not wait. The government  set up a government-industry partnership, Semitech, with specific goals  of creating new collaborations and investing in American manufacturing.  The United States maintained that leadership role, and in the 1990s, we  produced 37 percent of the global chip supply. The semiconductor  industry now supports more than a million jobs because people didn't  stand around and wait.   But today we see overseas competitors who are investing heavily in  the technologies of the future--everything from AI, to composites, to  clean energy solutions--and they are trying to do everything from  driving their own energy independence to combating climate change. They  are investing in the resilience of their supply chains by promoting  domestic production. They are training their workforce.   So the aspects of the legislation that we passed that help to skill  and keep Americans working and trained for the workforce are very  important policies. In fact, the administration just released yesterday  another round of investment as part of what was the aerospace and  manufacturing jobs program that helped keep the aviation worker in  place or actually try to recapture some of them who were laid off  during the pandemic.   It is a very important piece of legislation that we have worked on  that my colleagues over here, for the most part, didn't support in the  final package. Some of them supported it as a concept and as an idea  but did not support the final package.   Right now, it is 30 to 50 percent cheaper to build a semiconductor  foundry in Asia than in the United States, mostly because of foreign  government investment. Moreover, as I said, we are being hard hit by a  semiconductor supply chain crisis. Car manufacturers, including Tesla,  GM, and others, are removing some of their most advanced and desirable  features from their cars just to reduce the number of chips that are  needed. Literally, we are cutting our innovation skill set just because  we don't have the chips. Ford announced last week that it will either  halt or cut production at eight plants.   Are we really going to sit around and wait to get this legislation  done? Are we really going to sit around and wait?   We have eight plants that are going to shut down because they don't  have chips, and we are going to sit around and wait for another 3 or 4  weeks before we go to conference to resolve these issues. It has been  projected that this chip shortage cost the global auto industry, in  2021, $210 billion in revenue and a loss of production of 7.7 million  cars. So leadership can't wait. It can't wait.   Fortunately, the United States is showing that we can respond, and we  in the Senate did pass legislation. Now we have an opportunity to go to  conference and work with our colleagues, but some people want to wait  another 3 weeks or 4 weeks to do that. I don't want to wait. I don't  want to wait another second. The competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers  that are competing on an international basis and that receive the  investments that we make in technology just can't wait.   Recent investments from the commercial sector from Intel show that  over 10,000 new jobs will bring a domestic semiconductor industry to  the Midwest, specifically to Ohio, and our experience has shown us  that, if we make the investments that we are talking about in USICA, in  the competitiveness act, that we will grow an even larger U.S.  semiconductor manufacturing business.   Yet foreign competitors are not sitting still. When it comes to  technology leadership, they are, obviously, going to try to do their  part. So our solution is simple. All we have to do is work together.  All we have to do is be collaborative. As someone once said,  collaboration is the next phase of innovation. You can have all the  science; you can have all the creativity, but if you can't get it  implemented because people don't sit around the table and talk and  innovate and work together, then you can't get it implemented.    That is where we are. We know we need to do this investment in R&D.  We know that we need to invest in chips, and we are not doing it  because some people don't want to move ahead and get this done.   The Senate Commerce Committee passed the legislation, and we,  obviously, got and understood the urgency of it. We got and understood  the urgency of it. Trust me. There are many other things we thought we  were going to put on our agenda. The Acting President pro tempore  knows--because she sat through the hundreds of amendments that were  marked up--the process that we went through, the regular order, the  regular order that we went through here on the Senate floor, and the  regular order we are willing to go through. So no one is asking for  anything else but for regular order.   Of the people who want to hold up and don't want to move forward, I  would ask them to think about our competition that is working very hard  at beating us on semiconductors and the issues that it represents as it  relates to the investments we should be making.   I want us to make the investments in semiconductors. I want us to  make the investments in manufacturing extension programs, in STEM  education, in tech hubs, and in making sure that the United States of  America maintains its leadership role.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask that the scheduled vote occur  immediately.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
