 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4564, the Post-Caliphate Threat Assessment  Act of 2017. The Post-Caliphate Threat Assessment Act requires the DHS  to conduct an intelligence threat assessment of foreign fighter  activities.   With the military defeat of ISIL's caliphate, we are concerned about  the threat of foreign terrorists returning to the West. While the vast  majority of foreign fighters originated from Russia, Central Asia, and  the Middle East, about 20,000 foreign fighters traveled to Iraq and  Syria from at least 110 countries. We must address foreign fighters who  are ready to return home. We must stay abreast of their movements and  stop them from coming to the United States.   Requiring DHS to conduct a threat assessment of current foreign  fighter activities will help DHS to continue to focus on travel  screening on the risk-based dangers that we face. Let's focus our  policies on preventing terrorism by keeping dangerous individuals from  coming to this country.   H.R. 4564 requires a detailed report by the Secretary of Homeland  Security, coordinating with the Secretary of State and the Director of  National Intelligence, on foreign fighter movements to help DHS focus  on preventing their activities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this measure. I want to thank Mr.  Higgins for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4569, the Counterterrorism  Information Sharing Improvement Act of 2017. This bill seeks to ensure  that the DHS gets access to biometric and biographic data collected by  the United States Government to carry out its counterterrorism efforts.   Since 9/11, the Democratic members of this committee have been  committed to bolstering terrorism information sharing within our  government. Today, terrorist threats are decentralized, spreading  beyond al-Qaida, al Shabaab, and ISIL to a patchwork of small cells and  lone wolves who stand ready to carry out violence to our country at  their whim. Increasingly, this threat also includes homegrown violent  extremists and domestic terrorists.   Ensuring that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data on  individuals associated with a terrorist organization is critical to  comprehensive assessing of all forms of terrorism and threats to our  government.   This legislation also requires that the DHS report on how the data is  being received and utilized for screening and vetting purposes. This  report will help Congress ensure that screening and vetting of  travelers to the United States is conducted in a risk-based manner.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and I am prepared to close.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this legislation ensures that the DHS have access  to biographic and biometric data collected by our government on  individuals associated with terrorist organizations. It is important  that this information be integrated into the DHS' screening and vetting  programs to protect our country, our citizens, from all forms of  terrorism and extremism.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4581, the Screening and Vetting Passenger  Exchange Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the Screening and Vetting Passenger Act of 2017 requires  the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and share best practices  for using data provided by passengers in screening and vetting  operations with our allies around the world.   Since 2014, more than 75 million international travelers have come to  the United States. In recent years, especially during the Obama  administration, great strides were made to use the information  furnished by these incoming travelers to advance security screening and  vetting processes.   Building upon the Department's 2017 last point of departure security  enhancements that sought to raise the bar in physical screenings at  overseas airports with direct flights to the U.S., this bill will  further reinforce security measures and seek to provide our overseas  partners with the capabilities to advance their own vetting and  screening.   No country is immune from terrorism, and this bill will ensure that  the DHS can be a valued partner to nations that work with us.   By providing best practices on passenger screening, H.R. 4581 seeks  to ensure that terrorists seeking to inflict harm are not allowed to  travel without detection.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to make international travel more secure  and fosters a strong relationship between our country and our allies.  All nations must increase their vigilance with respect to security  screening. There are thousands of ISIL foot soldiers who may seek to  enter the Western world and other nations to carry out their attacks.  This legislation seeks to harness the United States' best practices and  capabilities to advance the safety of the global aviation community as  we face an agile and evolving enemy.  [[Page H50]]    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4433, the Securing Department of Homeland  Security Firearms Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, DHS is a diverse Department that has the distinction of  being the largest law enforcement agency in the Federal Government. To  help support its critical mission, DHS must maintain and safeguard a  variety of sensitive law enforcement equipment, such as firearms,  ammunition, and badges. DHS equipment in the wrong hands could result  in loss of life.   According to an October 2017 report issued by the DHS Office of  Inspector General, the Department does not have adequate requirements  to safeguard its sensitive assets. Approximately 2,100 highly sensitive  assets were lost between 2014 and 2016. In response to the report, my  legislation requires DHS to develop and implement policies to secure  firearms and other sensitive DHS equipment at the Department.   This security measure requires the Under Secretary of Management to  disseminate a departmentwide directive that includes requirements for  securing firearms and sensitive DHS equipment, as well as reporting  these requirements.   This measure outlines the responsibilities to properly safeguard  firearms and sensitive assets in accordance with the directive and  requires personnel to properly report lost firearms and equipment.   This measure was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland  Security last month and will help foster greater accountability and  security within DHS, and I urge passage of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, my legislation is intended to advance the  critical mission of DHS by ensuring that firearms and sensitive assets  are properly safeguarded and maintained.   In my home State of California, in 2015, a 27-year-old, Antonio  Ramos, was shot and killed with an ICE agent's stolen 9-millimeter  weapon.   According to the DHS OIG, failures to safeguard important equipment  and assets are still not being properly addressed. Given DHS' mission,  it is essential that the DHS workforce prioritize and properly protect  the equipment that is critical to their mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
