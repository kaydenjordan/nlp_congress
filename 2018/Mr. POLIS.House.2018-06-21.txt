 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am strongly against this rule and the underlying  legislation. We have a human rights catastrophe on our hands. In less  than 90 days, the Trump administration has ripped 2,500 children out of  their parents' arms.   I am the father of a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old. I can only imagine  what it would mean to have them taken to parts unknown, perhaps even  locked in a cage, not knowing, not being able to find out what is  happening to them.   This was a conscious decision that President Trump and Attorney  General Sessions made to separate children from parents. It was not the  congressional intent of the law. It was not the way that President  Obama implemented the law. It was not the way President Trump  implemented the law until 90 days ago. But then President Trump made  this mean-spirited decision to literally take little children, even  babies, away from their mothers in our country, to place innocent  children in facilities that have mats on the floor or thermal blankets  for warmth, away from the loving embrace of a mom or a dad.   The President called this a zero-tolerance policy. It was simply the  only reason that these families that are fleeing to the U.S., who are  trying to keep their children safe, are being treated like criminals  and having their young children taken away from them.   Children are being moved around this country faster than the Office  of Refugee Resettlement can even track. We already know that the Office  of Refugee Resettlement has a history of literally losing children,  losing track of them while they are in custody, and now they are  responsible for even more young, innocent lives.   Young children are being placed with host families as far away from  the border as Michigan and Washington State. Parents don't even know  where their children are. And young children are simply terrified about  what happened to their loving mom and their loving dad, and how our  country, the United States of America, could be complicit in separating  them from the only parents they know.   This is an embarrassment for our Nation, and it must end.   And it is offensive when these bills before us are talked about as  consensus or compromise, when no Democrats were involved. It may be a  consensus between far-right Republicans and rightwing Republicans, but  it is not a consensus among moderates, independents, or a single  Democrat.   And when it comes to caring about these kids, I know my Republican  colleagues care as well. So show it by supporting a true compromise  bill, like the Dream Act, like other bills that we have had before us,  like comprehensive immigration reform that, of course, will get votes  from both sides of the aisle because they are the right thing to do for  our country.   There are long-term consequences for this shortsighted policy. The  very act of separating a family has traumatic and long-lasting impact  for young girls like this, taken away from their mom and dad, their  culture, their support system. They don't even have the tools at a  young age to process what is going on or the trauma or the reality of  the situation.   One Colorado pediatric emergency doctor treating children removed  from their parents said: ``The children clung so tightly and completely  to their foster mothers, both at the emergency department and at home,  that they were literally unable to put them down. They were terrified  that their world would be broken for a second time.''   The Trump administration is creating a generation of thousands of  kids, many of whom will grow up in our country, whose first and  sometimes most formative memories is of somebody wearing the badge or  the flag of our country tearing them apart from their mother or their  father while they are screaming, while they are crying out in the void  of a fluorescently-lit warehouse funded by your taxpayer dollars.   According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, responsible for the  care of these kids, many children remain in these shelters for 57 days  on average.   It is further disturbing that President Trump would willingly pull  families apart and not have any plan for reuniting them even with his  executive order, no plans to unite the over 2,500 children who have  been torn apart from their parents.   According to the former director of ICE, these family separations may  become permanent, literally leaving hundreds of kids here in the U.S.  left in an already stressed and underfunded child welfare system, where  they literally have a mom or dad fully capable of giving them care and  loving them that has been forcibly separated from their own young  children.    My office has been flooded with calls--I know yours has too, Mr.  Speaker--some callers crying on the other end, demanding that we do  something.   Yet, instead of ensuring that we provide resources families need and  reunite them and heal the trauma, the Republicans are bringing to the  floor partisan bills that would detain families indefinitely and  criminalize even more immigrants. But this is what happens in a broken,  failing, unaccountable immigration system. On that, we agree.   So, please, begin the discussions of compromise, of consensus. And  that doesn't mean yourselves, Republicans. You control this body. You  get to say what we vote on. It means involve caring independent,  unaffiliated, Democrats, moms and dads, the faith community, the law  enforcement community. Don't just have this discussion behind closed  doors and come out with even more draconian measures that tear even  more families apart.   So instead of bringing two bills to the floor that have widespread  opposition, even in your own party--Republicans failed to pass their  own bill--there are bipartisan solutions that would not only pass the  House, but would get a large majority of the House. We could probably  get to two-thirds of this House voting for compassion and love if we  only were willing to try, bills that truly balance and include border  security and safety and the values of our country, so we know that we,  as Americans and as taxpayers, are not complicit in tearing a young  girl's world apart.   Look, in Congress we often argue on policy issues. And I respect Mr.  Newhouse, my friend from Washington. And I would tell him that what a  compromise means, Mr. Newhouse, is not  [[Page H5441]]  you compromising with Stephen Miller; it means you compromising with  Luis Gutierrez or Zoe Lofgren or me or the faith community. It is not a  compromise when reasonable people like Mr. Newhouse and Mr. Curbelo go  into a backroom and have the reason beaten out of them by hateful  fearmongering that is, frankly, un-American.   Look, I urge my Republican colleagues to imagine that these children  were theirs, because they are ours, they are our wards, they are in our  country. This cannot be allowed to continue. We need to reject this  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this heartless, inhumane  bill and begin a true process of compromise and consensus that can  secure our borders, fix our broken immigration system, unite families,  restore the rule of law, and reflect our values as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from Reuters today  titled: ``U.S. Centers Force Migrant Children to Take Drugs.''                       [From Reuters, June 21, 2018]         U.S. Centers Force Migrant Children to Take Drugs: Lawsuit         Immigrant children are being routinely and forcibly given a       range of psychotropic drugs at U.S. government-funded youth       shelters to manage their trauma after being detained and in       some cases separated from parents, according to a lawsuit.        Children held at facilities such as the Shiloh Treatment       Center in Texas are almost certain to be administered the       drugs, irrespective of their condition, and without their       parents' consent, according to the lawsuit filed by the Los       Angeles-based Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law.        The Shiloh center, which specializes in services for       children and youths with behavioral and emotional problems,       did not respond immediately to a request for comment.        The lawsuit was filed on April 16, days after the       introduction of the Trump Administration's ``zero tolerance''       policy to separate children from parents who crossed the       U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Trump abandoned the policy on       Wednesday.        ``If you're in Shiloh then it's almost certain you are on       these medications. So if any child were placed in Shiloh       after being separated from a parent, then they're almost       certainly on psychotropics,'' said Carlos Holguin, a lawyer       representing the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional       Law.        Officials at the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR),       which oversees such centers, were not immediately available       for comment.        Taking multiple psychotropic drugs at the same time can       seriously injure children, according to the filing, which       highlights the need for oversight to prevent medications       being used as ``chemical straight jackets,'' rather than       treat actual mental health needs.        ORR-run centers unilaterally administer the drugs to       children in disregard of laws in Texas and other states that       require either a parent's consent or a court order, the       filing said.        The lawsuit seeks a shift in ORR policies to comply with       state laws and prevent the prolonged detention of children.        Some youths at Shiloh reported being given up to nine       different pills in the morning and six in the evening and       said they were told they would remain detained if they       refused drugs, the lawsuit said.        Some said they had been held down and given injections when       they refused to take medication, the lawsuit said.        One mother said neither she nor any other family member had       been consulted about medication given to her daughter, even       though Shiloh had their contact details. Another mother said       her daughter received such powerful anti-anxiety medications       she collapsed several times, according to the filing.     Mr. Speaker, ``Immigrant children,'' quoting from this  article, ``are being routinely and forcibly given a range of  psychotropic drugs at U.S. government-funded youth shelters.''   Taking multiple psychotropic drugs can seriously injure children. And  many youths in Shiloh detention facility are being given nine different  pills in the morning, six in the evening. You are paying for them all,  Mr. Speaker. Taxpayers are paying for pills and injections and drugs  for 2-years-olds and 4-year-olds that have been stripped from their  parents.   One mother said she nor any other family member had even been  consulted about their daughter being given powerful drugs.   Many kids are being held down, forcibly given injections when they  refuse to take the medication that our tax dollars are paying for.   We need to stop this, Mr. Speaker.   You don't need a bill to stop it. President Trump needs to stop it.  He wasn't doing it till 90 days ago; then he started to do it. It is  not the will of Congress. It is not the letter of the law. It is a  policy that is un-American and far outside the intent of Republicans or  Democrats in this body.                                time  1445    If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Ranking Member Nadler's bill, H.R. 6135, the Keep  Families Together Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. This thoughtful  proposal would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from  separating children from their parents, of course, except in  extraordinary circumstances, and limit the criminal prosecution of  asylum seekers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal) to discuss our proposal.  [[Page H5442]]         I yield the gentlewoman from Washington an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   To my friend Mr. Diaz-Balart and Mr. Newhouse and so many others, we  stand ready to work with you, but instead, you chose to work with   Steve King, Louie Gohmert, Stephen Miller.  [[Page H5443]]    Come talk to us. We are ready. Democrats, to a person, are ready to  support something that we don't fully agree with because we understand  the Republicans control this body.   So come talk to us, and stop talking to  Steve King, Louie Gohmert,  and Stephen Miller.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Capuano).    Mr. Speaker, I also remind my friend from Miami that we  have reached several compromises.   He and I are both members of the Problem Solvers Caucus. I am proud  that the Problem Solvers Caucus--more than 25 Democrats, 25  Republicans--we agreed. We reached a compromise bill--border security,  addresses the needs of the Dreamers. I think it would get 60, 70  percent of the votes on the floor of the House. Let's bring that bill  up.   Unfortunately, Republicans chose to set Mr. Curbelo's work and my  work aside and proceed with a spiteful bill that makes the problem  worse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled  ``Pentagon Asked to Make Room for 20,000 Migrant Children on Military  Bases.''                              [June 21, 2018]    Pentagon Asked To Make Room for 20,000 Migrant Children on Military                                   Bases              (By Dan Lamothe, Seung Min Kim and Nick Miroff)         The Trump administration is considering housing up to       20,000 unaccompanied migrant children on military bases in       coming months, according to lawmakers and a Defense       Department memo obtained by The Washington Post.        The Pentagon's notification to lawmakers said that       officials at Health and Human Services asked the Pentagon to       indicate whether it can provide the beds for children at       military installations ``for occupancy as early as July       through December 31, 2018.''        Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) addressed the issue on the       Senate floor Thursday morning.        ``The Department of Defense has been asked whether it can       house 20,000 unaccompanied children between now and the end       of the year,'' he said. ``How will that work? Is it even       feasible?''        The plan would seemingly have similarities to 2014, when       the Obama administration housed about 7,000 unaccompanied       children on three military bases. The Pentagon, in its       congressional notification to lawmakers, said it must       determine if it ``possesses these capabilities.'' As required       under the Economy Act, the memo said, the Defense Department       would be reimbursed for all costs incurred.        The sites would be run by HHS employees or contractors       working with them, the memo said. They would provide care to       the children, ``including supervision, meals, clothing,       medical services, transportation or other daily needs,'' and       HHS representatives will be present at each location.        The memo was sent to lawmakers Wednesday after President       Trump reversed his administration's unpopular policy to       separate children from their parents as they arrived at the       southern U.S. border.        The president's executive order directed Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis to ``take all legally available measures'' to       provide Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen with       ``any existing facilities available for the housing and care       of alien families,'' and the construction of new facilities       ``if necessary and consistent with law.''        Lt. Col. Jamie Davis acknowledged Thursday that the       Pentagon received the request, and said the department is       reviewing it.        The Trump administration spent months planning, testing and       defending its family separation system at the border, taking       more than 2,500 children from their parents in the six weeks       prior to the president's executive order Wednesday bringing       it to a halt.        The U.S. government has been examining for weeks whether it       can use military bases to house migrant children.       Representatives from HHS visited three bases in Texas--Fort       Bliss, Dyess Air Force Base and Goodfellow Air Force Base--      last week to review their facilities for suitability, and       were scheduled to review Little Rock Air Force Base in       Arkansas on Wednesday, Davis said.        The Obama administration temporarily set up temporary       centers in 2014 at three U.S. military bases: Fort Sill in       Oklahoma, Lackland Air Force Base in Texas and naval Base       Ventura in California.        Asked about the possibility of military bases being       involved again, Mattis said Wednesday that the Defense       Department would ``see what they come up with'' in HHS, and       that the Pentagon will ``respond if requested.''        Mattis dismissed concerns about housing migrants on       military bases now, noting that the Defense Department has       done it on several occasions and for several reasons.        ``We have housed refugees,'' he said. ``We have housed       people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and       hurricanes. We do whatever is in the best interest of the       country.''        The secretary, pressed on the sensitivities of the Trump       administration separating children from their parents, said       reporters would need to ask ``the people responsible for       it.''        ``I'm not going to chime in from the outside,'' he said.       ``There's people responsible for it. Secretary Nielson,       obviously, maintains close collaboration with us. You saw       that when we deployed certain National Guard units there, so       she's in charge.''        Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Rep. Adam Smith (D-Calif.), the       leading members of the armed services committees, wrote a       letter to Mattis on Wednesday requesting assurances that       members of Congress would have access to any migrant facility       established on a military base. The letter, sent before Trump       dropped his family-separation policy at the border, said that       it was essential to have access even in cases where only       short notice is provided.        Mattis has approved temporarily detailing 21 military       attorneys to the Justice Department to help with the glut of       immigration cases that have emerged on the border. The order,       issued earlier this month, calls for 21 attorneys with       criminal-trial experience to assist as special assistant U.S.       attorneys for 179 days, Davis said. They will help in       prosecuting border immigration cases, he added, ``with a       focus on misdemeanor improper entry and felony illegal       reentry cases.''        The possibility was raised in a congressional hearing in       May, and first reported as underway by MSNBC on Wednesday       night. U.S. law permits a judge advocate lawyer to be       assigned or detailed to another agency, including to provide       representation in civil and criminal cases.     Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration is now looking to  house up to 20,000 children taken away from their parents at military  bases. They are looking to take 10 times as many children away from  their parents as they already have.   It is time to stop President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, isn't that amazing? Republicans can't even  find elected Representatives willing to come down here on the floor and  defend taking kids away from their parents.   They are out of speakers because Republicans are embarrassed. They  know that they cannot face the American people, no less their Maker,  knowing that they are complicit in tearing innocent children away from  mom and dad.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Newhouse may be proud, but there are no  other Republicans who have come to the floor to join him.   We have so many Democrats who want to speak about how you can unite  families that I don't even have enough time to give.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague Mr. Newhouse if he will yield me the  balance of his time. Well, I wish he would, because no Republicans are  willing to face the American people, because they know they are not  working to solve this issue. They are working to tear more families  apart. And they are lying about it, Mr. Speaker. They are lying about  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to go to the definition of the word compromise,  because I think that there needs to be education regarding what these  words mean that are being tossed around. A compromise is an agreement  or settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making  concessions.   It doesn't mean looking at yourself in the mirror and conceding to  yourself. It doesn't mean Republicans going into a closed-door meeting  and coming out with a bill that makes things worse. It means  Republicans and Democrats working together, each giving up some things,  each living with what they can accept.   I have worked hard on compromise with many of my Republican  colleagues through the Problem Solvers Caucus to solve and provide a  pathway to citizenship for Dreamers while securing our border.   This bill makes things worse. It guts legal immigration. It  eliminates two family immigration programs: married children of U.S.  citizens, and siblings of U.S. adults. It doesn't even grandfather in  people already in the system waiting to be reunited with their  families, meaning that it will eliminate the current legal way that  families can be reunified.   This bill raises the credible fear standard for asylum seekers to  begin the process by raising the standards to more probably than not.  This bill does nothing to prevent the Trump administration's grotesque  policy of separating parents and children at the border. In fact, it  simply removes protections for those families who are currently not  separated at points of entry.   And now we are hearing that President Trump is preparing military  bases to house up to 20,000 more kids that he plans to snatch from  their moms and their dads.   We can do better. This humanitarian crisis is entirely President  Trump's making. He didn't do it before the last 90 days. He just  started a misinterpretation of the law. His recent executive order is  not a solution. Over 2,300 kids have already been separated from their  parents and there is no plan to reunite them.   This order doesn't even require any families be detained together,  and the order doesn't contain any prohibitions barring family  separation. We know that separating kids is wrong. I hope Americans  agree that this is bad for kids.    But let's also look at science.   The American Academy of Pediatrics said that the incarceration of  families and separation of families has long-term consequences for the  health and wellbeing, mental and physical, for children and parents.  Separation consequences include: post-traumatic stress disorder,  developmental delays, and poor psychological adjustment.   I dare say that these policies of the Trump administration, who on  their own decided to tear 1- and 2- and 3-year-old kids away from their  parents, is going to create even greater needs for these next  generation of kids, many of whom will grow up here legally, those who  successfully pursue their asylum claims.   And while those immigration claims are being adjudicated, some might  have to return to their native country. Some will be able to stay.  Families should be together. No parent should have to see their own  child stripped away.   This bill is hemorrhaging support. I have an article that I include  in the Record from Politico stating that the Koch network won't support  the House immigration bills, entitled: ``Koch network raps Trump, won't  support House immigration bills.''                       [From POLITICO, June 19, 2018]       Koch Network Raps Trump, Won't Support House Immigration Bills                            (By Maggie Severns)         The political network founded by the Koch brothers is       taking a stand against both President Donald Trump's policy       toward separating families at the border and two immigration       bills due for votes in the House this week, dealing a blow to       GOP leaders who are marshaling support for their version.        ``It's encouraging that the House will have a debate this       week on immigration bills that include protections for the       Dreamers,'' said Daniel Garza, president of the Koch       network's LIBRE Initiative, referring to a group of       undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.       ``Unfortunately, in their current form, both [House       leadership's bill and an alternative immigration bill]       expected to receive a vote fall short of the solution we       need.''        Garza also called on Trump to ``take immediate action to       end the separation of families at the border by rescinding       the `zero tolerance' policy.''        The Kochs' push for a more moderate approach toward       immigration legislation complicates the thorny debate in       Washington. Lawmakers have called on Trump to stop his       administration from splitting up immigrant families, which       has drawn public outrage since he implemented a zero       tolerance policy of prosecuting everyone who crosses the       border illegally. Trump has refused to act alone, saying       Congress needs to pass immigration legislation.        The Koch brothers have pushed the Republican Party to       create a path to citizenship for Dreamers, who were extended       protections under the Obama administration that Trump has       tried to withdraw. The Kochs also have urged the GOP not to       make severe cuts to the flow of immigrants into the country,       even launching a seven-figure ad buy supporting their       efforts.        House Republicans were coalescing around an immigration       bill supported by House leadership that would, among other       things, give some protections to Dreamers. Its path forward       was already complicated: Trump blasted the measure last week,       but later Tuesday he was expected to travel to Capitol Hill       to rally Republicans behind it.        The Kochs' opposition to the GOP leadership bill could make       it even more difficult for House Speaker Paul Ryan to unite       his caucus behind it. Conservatives favor a second bill, also       due for a vote this week, from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).        Garza said in a statement that ``it's clear there's strong       support in Congress and among the American people to provide       permanency to the Dreamers,'' but neither bill ``affords the       Dreamers the certainty they need to make a full contribution       to American communities,'' and both ``include arbitrary cuts       to legal immigration.''     I don't agree with the Koch network on much. I do know  that they fund many Republicans, but maybe now that the Republicans are  taking children away from their parents, the Kochs will stop funding  Republicans, because I am glad to hear that they are people of  principle.   The article says they ``push for a more moderate approach toward  immigration legislation,'' and they have ``called on Trump to stop his  administration from splitting up immigrant families,'' which this bill  does not do.   In fact, this bill ends those who are waiting for family  reunification today. So there is a legal way to unite families. This  bill eliminates that and will lead to more families being apart.   This is a false crisis entirely of President Trump's making. I hope  that even he has recognized that the American people will not stand for  3- and 4-year-olds literally being put in cages, strapped down while  they are given drugs and medicated and injected, with Americans  complicit in this atrocity.   It needs to be reiterated one more time that the votes we take on the  rule today are more than procedural. They have a significant impact on  young lives of innocent children.   They will show which Members of Congress care about fixing our  immigration system and are willing to compromise and work in a  bipartisan way, and which Members of Congress vote to make all of the  problems outlined here today worse and more widespread.   We need to reject these bills, reject this rule. We need to keep  families together. We need to begin the sometimes challenging work of  compromise and consensus building between Republicans and Democrats,  between Mr. Newhouse and Mr. Curbelo, and me and Ms. Lofgren and  others--not with Stephen Miller,  Steve King, or Louie Gohmert.   Reject these bills. Keep families together. Let's work together on  border security, on fixing our broken immigration system, on uniting  families, on a permanent solution for Dreamers, to ensure that this  horror and affront to our American values ends and doesn't repeat  itself ever again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5447]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
