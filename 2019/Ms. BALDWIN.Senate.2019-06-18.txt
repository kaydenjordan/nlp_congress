 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to urge my  colleagues to oppose the confirmation of Matthew Kacsmaryk to be U.S.  District Judge for the Northern District of Texas.   I believe that every individual we consider for a lifetime  appointment to serve on the Federal bench should have the demonstrated  legal acumen and experience but also a commitment to ensuring fair  treatment for anyone who might come before their court. With a  troubling record of professional work and personal statements attacking  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, Mr. Kacsmaryk fails  this test,  [[Page S3644]]  and the Senate must reject his nomination.   Mr. Kacsmaryk currently serves as deputy general counsel of First  Liberty Institute, and in that role he has challenged the  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, argued against marriage  equality, supported schools in barring transgender students from using  restrooms consistent with their gender identities, and opposed a State  law requiring that pharmacies stock emergency contraception.   My colleagues may recall another nominee associated with this  organization, Jeff Mateer, who was First Liberty's general counsel  until 2016 and was nominated by President Trump for a judgeship in the  Eastern District of Texas. Mateer's nomination was ultimately withdrawn  in light of his public statements hostile to LGBTQ people, including  that same-sex marriage is ``disgusting'' and transgender children are a  part of ``Satan's plan.''   Mr. Kacsmaryk's statement and writings evince a similar hostility to  LGBTQ people and to equality. He has repeatedly made claims that  dismiss the reality of LGBTQ people's lives and experiences. For  example, he wrote a 2015 piece entitled ``The Inequality Act:  Weaponizing Same-Sex Marriage,'' in which he suggested that the  movements for LGBTQ and reproductive rights are grounded in ``the lie  that the human person is an autonomous blob of Silly Putty  unconstrained by nature or biology, and that marriage, sexuality,  gender identity, and even the unborn child must yield to the erotic  desires of liberated adults.''   In a September 2015 radio interview, he argued that the movement for  LGBTQ equality is part of a sexual revolution that ``has been typified  by lawlessness and just a complete refusal to obey basic rule of law  principles.''   He has also been particularly disparaging of transgender individuals.  For example, in August of 2016, he signed on to a comment to the  proposed rule implementing the Affordable Care Act's nondiscrimination  provisions. Arguing against the proposal's protections for people based  on gender identity, the commenters wrote that transgender people are  suffering from a ``psychological condition in need of care'' and are  ``not a category of persons in need of special legal protections.''  They further cite one psychiatrist's opinion--just one psychiatrist-- that a transgender person's understanding of who they are is  ``appropriately described as a delusion.'' Furthermore, in an interview  discussing that same rulemaking, Mr. Kacsmaryk characterized healthcare  protections for transgender people as being ``on the Obama  Administration's `bucket list' of aggressive sexual revolution items.''   Finally, Mr. Kacsmaryk has criticized efforts to protect LGBTQ people  from discrimination, even those that have been supported by both faith  groups and progressive organizations. In a September 2015 article about  the adoption of Utah's nondiscrimination law, he called that effort ``a  bad idea . . . primarily for the problem of the protected class. Once a  protected class is defined to be equivalent to race, it takes on a much  heavier atomic weight.''   These are not words and actions of an individual whom we can trust to  serve as a neutral arbiter who will recognize the humanity and dignity  of everyone who comes before him. We have heard from hundreds of  diverse organizations that oppose his confirmation to a lifetime  appointment to the Federal bench, but perhaps most importantly we have  heard from dozens of parents of transgender children from all over the  country. They write:         Hundreds of thousands of children and adolescents       throughout this country are transgender, like our kids. So       are well over a million adults. They deserve to be treated       with respect and dignity--and to trust that when they walk       into a courtroom they will be treated fairly. Confirming [Mr.       Kacsmaryk] as [a federal judge] would send a damaging and       dangerous message that the dignity of children like ours does       not count in the courts, or in the U.S. Senate.    I note that this is June. This is the month where we mark LGBTQ  pride, celebrating the contributions of LGBTQ people and recognizing  the work that remains to be done to ensure full and equal treatment for  all people.   This Pride Month, I urge my colleagues to send a message to those  children, their parents, the broader LGBTQ community, and the country  that they do count--that they count, they matter, and we hear their  voices. And please reject this nominee.   Thank you.   I yield back.
