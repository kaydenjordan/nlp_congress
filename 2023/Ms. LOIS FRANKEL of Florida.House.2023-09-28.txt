 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition  to the 2024 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Appropriations Act because it cedes our leadership in the  global community, undermines human rights, and diminishes access to  healthcare, education, food, and economic security for millions around  the world.   Why should we care? It comes down to this: When people lack access to  the basics in life, it means a greater risk for hopelessness and  instability. Gutting climate change activities only escalates the  consequences. For Americans at home, that means fewer trading partners,  more danger from violent extremists, global pandemics, and even war.    We live in a very complicated world, and this bill undermines  diplomacy and commitments to our allies and partners to make the world  a better place in which to live, upending our commitments to the United  Nations, and turning our back on decades of relationship-building,  leaving a vacuum for unfriendly countries to fill.   If that is not enough, it hurts the most vulnerable women and girls  in the world, slashing funding for women's healthcare and family  planning and blocking access to reproductive care.   Mr. Chair, let me make it clear to the politicians in this room:  Women, not the folks in this Chamber, should decide whether and when a  woman should start or continue a family.   Tragically, this bill is going to leave our country and the world  less healthy, less safe, and even more divided.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
