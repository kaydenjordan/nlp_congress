 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 234, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preamble be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I and this body have  just passed by voice vote a resolution recognizing the 100th  anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. It is a significant  resolution not only to be able to recall what happened in that terrible  time in 1921 but to also recognize the 13 Black towns that still remain  in Oklahoma.   It is an interesting history that we have in Oklahoma, and I  encourage folks to be able to find out more about us as a State. From  the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Black individuals and families from  all over the South were fleeing away from where they were being  oppressed, and they were coming to Oklahoma, setting up vibrant  communities. Over 50 all-Black towns rose up in Oklahoma.   In fact, there was some dialogue in the early 1900s about possibly  having Oklahoma be an all-Black State even. These Black communities  were rising up around our State looking for opportunities, freedom, and  a chance for a better life. Thirteen of those fifty towns still remain  today as communities. Many of the individuals in these towns are  friends and people whom I know and Senator Inhofe and I have the honor  of being able to represent in this great body.   I think about Dr. Donnie Nero, Sr. He is the President of the African  American Educators Hall of Fame. He is the one who helped found and  pull this all together. He has an attitude in wonderful Clearview, OK,  and he says: ``One of the greatest motivational concepts accessible to  mankind is `Recognition.''' He says recognition is about remembrance  and acknowledgment.   We are taking a moment as a Senate today to be able to acknowledge  these 13 Black towns that still remain in Oklahoma and to be able to  look at some of the history of what happened during that time period.  So let me walk through this somewhat.   Tullahassee was founded in 1883. It is regarded as one of the oldest  surviving historically Black towns in Indian Territory.   Langston, founded in 1890, and was named after John Mercer Langston,  an African-American educator and U.S. Representative from Virginia.  Seven years later, the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature established the  Colored Agricultural and Normal University, which would later be called  Langston University. This historically Black college and university has  grown from 41 students in 1897 to over 3,000 students today. Prominent  Oklahomans such as Melvin Tolson, Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, Clara Luper,  E. Melvin Porter, Frederick Moon, Marques Haynes, Zelia Breaux, Isaac  W. Young, Inman Page, and Zella Black Patterson all resided in the town  of Langston or called Langston University home.   Tatums was founded in 1895. It was named after brothers Lee B. Tatum  and Eldridge ``Doc'' Tatum. They found prosperity in 1929 when oil  wells were drilled in Tatum. Norman Studios even filmed a silent movie  called ``Black Gold,'' using the brothers in their film   Taft was founded in 1902 on land allotted to Creek Freedman. They  changed their name from Twine, which they were originally, to Taft to  honor the then Secretary of War and later President William Howard  Taft.   Grayson was bustling with five general stores, two blacksmiths, two  drug stores, a cotton gin and a physician shortly after it was founded  in 1902. It was originally known as Wildcat. It was changed in 1909 to  honor the Creek chief, George W. Grayson.   Boley was a town established in 1903 and named after J.B. Boley, a  railroad official of the Fort Smith and Western Railway, and grew to be  the largest African-American town in Oklahoma. Only 5 years after being  founded, Booker T. Washington visited the town and wrote about the  prosperity that he had witnessed. Boasting the first Black-owned bank,  the First National Bank of Boley was owned by D.J. Turner. It received  a national charter and rose to be one of the largest and wealthiest  exclusively Black communities. Today, Boley still hosts the Nation's  oldest annual Black rodeo.   Rentiesville, founded in 1903, was developed on 40 acres owned by  William Rentie and Phoebe McIntosh. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas  Railway developed a flag stop, putting Rentiesville on the map. John  Hope Franklin, a scholar of African-American history who promoted  dialogue that reshaped American views on race relations, was born in  Rentiesville in 1915. The Franklins later moved to Tulsa, where John  Hope Franklin graduated from Booker T. Washington. He survived the 1921  Tulsa Race Massacre, and he went on to become one of the most decorated  historians. He inspired the John Hope Franklin Center for  Reconciliation, Reconciliation Park in Tulsa, and an elementary school  in North Tulsa. Rentiesville continues to host the Dusk Til' Dawn Blues  Festival that attracts blues artists and all the folks who come in.   Clearview, a town I have already mentioned, was founded in 1903 along  the tracks of the Fort Smith and Western Railroad, was widely known for  its baseball team, but it is widely known now for the Hall of Fame for  Black Educators. It is a place that I would encourage people to be able  to stop in and to be able to see. And it is an annual tradition where  individuals from around the State ride in to be able to recognize Black  educators to be recognized that year in the Hall of Fame ceremony led  by Dr. Nero, Sr.   Brooksville, founded in 1903, originally named Sewell, was renamed in  1912 in honor of the first African American in the area, A.R. Brooks.   Red Bird, founded in 1907 along the Missouri, Kansas and Texas  Railroad, was built on the land allotted by the Creek Nation. E.L.  Barber was one of the town's original developers and the first justice  of the peace and an early mayor. Before Red Bird officially became a  town, Barber organized the First Baptist Church in 1889, which grew to  be the largest church in Red Bird.   Summit was founded in 1910 along the Missouri, Kansas and Texas  Railway.   Vernon was founded in 1911 on Tankard Ranch in the Creek Nation and  was home to many trailblazers such as Ella Woods, who was the first  Postmaster, and Louise Wesley, who established the first school and  church.   Lima, founded in 1913 along the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific  Railroad. The Mount Zion Methodist Church was built in 1915 and still  stands to this day.   And, of course, the most famous and prosperous of all of the Black  communities was Greenwood. Greenwood District became a thriving  community where Black business owners, schools, and churches  flourished. By the late 1910s, it was the wealthiest Black community in  all of the United States. The community earned the name ``Black Wall  Street'' from the famed African-American author and educator I already  spoke of, Booker T. Washington.   The history of these historically Black towns is interwoven into the  history of Oklahoma and the history of the United States. The residents  of these towns have achieved great success and faced tremendous  challenges. The stories of these Black towns and communities in  Oklahoma are also inextricably linked to the events of May 30 through  June 1 of 1921, when the Greenwood District in North Tulsa burst into  flames.   An important part of history is learning from the past. It is not  looking at an incident in isolation. It is what came before and after.  This weekend, the Nation will pause and reflect on the 100th  anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the worst race  [[Page S3412]]  massacre in the history of the United States.   But we can't look at Greenwood as if it was a single weekend. It was  a prosperous, thriving Black community. And it still has a history to  be able to share in our future.   Maybe you have heard me share the story on the floor of the Senate  before. In the past several years, I talked about the race massacre,  here in committee meetings and in conversations around this body. There  is a significance of the 100th anniversary, not just for Tulsa and my  State, but for the rest of the Nation as well. So let me recount this  again   On May 30, 1921, a young Black man named Dick Rowland was in downtown  Tulsa. He entered the Drexel Building to use the only bathroom in the  area that was available for Black people to be able to use in downtown  Tulsa.   An incident occurred in the elevator between Dick Rowland and Sarah  Paige, and Sarah Paige screamed. We really don't know what happened  there, but as the doors opened, she screamed. The police did an  investigation and the next day they went to Dick Rowland and they  detained him at the Tulsa Police Department for questioning before  removing him to the Tulsa Courthouse to be able to be confined.   On May 31, 1921, the Tulsa Tribune released a sensationalist story  claiming that a young Black man had attacked a White girl in an  elevator in the Drexel Building. That story and long, simmering  tensions in the city led to a large group of White individuals  surrounding the courthouse to demand that Dick Rowland be released so  he could be lynched.   A group of Black men traveled to the courthouse to help defend Dick  Rowland from the angry mob, many of them veterans from World War I who  had served honorably there.   After a scuffle at the downtown Tulsa courthouse, White rioters  pursued the men back to the Greenwood District and the violence  escalated dramatically. Literally, as the violence increased, the White  rioters that really became a mob were deputized to be able to handle  the issues in Greenwood. They gathered firearms as they ran the few  blocks from central downtown Tulsa into Greenwood just north of Tulsa.   Houses and businesses were burned and looted throughout the Greenwood  District, and the attacks lasted well into the night and well into the  next day before being quelled by the Oklahoma City National Guard. In  less than 24 hours, 35 city blocks were destroyed by fires, 6,000  African American individuals were detained, and up to 300 lives were  lost.   Out of the 23 churches that were located in the Greenwood area prior  to the 1921 massacre, only 13 of the churches survived and only three  churches were able to be rebuilt after being destroyed--Paradise  Baptist Church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, and Vernon AME Church.   It was a horrific day, and 100 years later, the residents and  businesses in the Greenwood District still carry on the legacy of  resilience and determination.   For the past few years, I have been working to tell this story. For  some--even some Oklahomans--it is a story that they had not heard  before. Five years ago, I started telling the story in Washington, DC,  and when I told it, hardly anyone knew about it. Now everyone I speak  to is familiar with the story.   We have pulled this story out of the dark ages of history and lifted  it up for our Nation to be able to see and our Nation is looking at it.  In Oklahoma, many people now know about that terrible 2-day period when  rioters set a community on fire and set our Nation back. But I also  tell people that you can't understand Tulsa and Oklahoma unless you  understand May 31 and June 1 of 1921.   So I worked to develop a curriculum to ensure future generations of  Oklahomans learn the accurate historic events of 1921. Before we  started working on the curriculum, our schools had a mandate to teach  the 1921 massacre. But there were no materials to actually use to teach  that accurate history. There were no visuals. There was no curriculum.  Now there are. We pulled all those together and made that resource free  to every educator in Oklahoma and every educator in America that wants  to be able to teach that history accurately.   During this same time period, 5 or 6 years ago, I started working on  something I called Solution Sundays, because when I started speaking  about 6 years ago now to individuals all around Tulsa and around the  State about the Tulsa Race Massacre, I usually started the conversation  the same way: May 31 and June 1 of 2021, I would say, about 6 years  ago, the entire country is going to pause. I don't know how long. They  may pause for a minute. They may pause for an hour. They may pause for  a day or for a weekend.   But the entire country will pause and will look at Tulsa and look at  Oklahoma and will ask themselves one question: What has changed in  America in race relations in the last 100 years? I said 6 years ago,  that is a fair question for someone to ask; we had better be able to  answer it when May 31 of 2021 comes.   Little did I know 6 years ago, when I started asking that question  and continued to ask that question when it was 5 years, 4 years, 3  years, 2 years, and the next year--little did I know--about the events  dealing with race that would happen in the last 12 months and the  awakening that in the Nation really has happened to what is still left  undone in the issue of race in America.   I started something about 6 years ago. At this same time, I started  asking about what would we say. I started challenging families with  something I called Solution Sundays. It is a simple idea, quite  frankly. I would just ask people that I would encounter, of all races,  of all backgrounds, a simple question: Has your family ever invited a  family of another race to your home for dinner?   I thought it was simple until, when I would ask people, I would get  the same answer back. I would ask people: Has your family ever invited  a family of another race to your home for dinner?   And the most common answer I got back was: I have friends of another  race.   To which I would always smile and say: That is not what I asked. I  asked: Has your family ever invited a family of another race to your  home for dinner?   And what I found in my State was that most individuals of every race  all answered it the same way: That has never happened in my house.   So I would ask them a simple question. A national conversation about  race is not something that happens on TV. A national conversation on  race happens at our dinner tables with our families.   We should not expect that the Nation will speak on race when our  families are not. And the best way for our families and to show our  kids that this is normal conversation is to have a family over of  another race to sit around the table.   What I like to say to people is, we will never get all the issues of  race on the table until we get our feet under the same table and just  talk and just get to know each other as friends. The Nation will not  shift on race relations until each of our families shifts on race  relations.   I continue to be able to challenge this simple concept of Solution  Sundays. By the way, if you want to pick a different day, that is fine  with me. But Sunday seems to be a pretty good day just to invite  someone over for dinner or for lunch.   In just a few days, people from all over the country will fly into  Tulsa, some of them for the first time. They are going to participate  in events to commemorate the hundredth anniversary. It is my hope that  what they see will be a model of reconciliation for the rest of the  country. But after the anniversary passes and the crowds leave and the  national folks will go on to doing something else, we will still be  around. Tulsa and all of Oklahoma will still need to finish the work  that has begun on race.   I will still be around North Tulsa. I have lots of friends there. And  I know there will be an ongoing dialogue, still, about reconciliation  because the big event that the whole world turns the television cameras  on for doesn't solve the issues of race. We solve that as individuals  and as a family.   You see, I believe, like many do, that I have a calling toward  reconciliation. As a follower of Jesus, as I read  [[Page S3413]]  through the New Testament, I bump into passages like Second  Corinthians, chapter 5, where Paul wrote to us and said we have the  ministry and the message of reconciliation.   Now, I understand that Paul first meant that was an ability to be  able to come to God and be reconciled to God. And I do believe firmly  that every individual can be reconciled with God, and I am glad to  share that message of ministry. But I also believe it is a challenge to  each of us to work toward reconciliation. Where relationships are  broken, we are the reconcilers, and we have a ministry and a message of  reconciliation.   My friend Robert Turner is the pastor of Vernon A.M.E. Church, in the  heart of Greenwood. He and I were visiting last week on the phone,  talking through the things coming up in the days ahead. As I was  chitchatting with my friend, he said: I have to tell you about my  sermon that I preached a couple of weeks ago.   So I said: Tell me all about it.   Pastor Turner said: I preached on Matthew, the tax collector, also  called Levi.   And we spent some time talking about that.   And he said: What I told my congregation was that Jesus called  Matthew, the tax collector, to be one of his disciples, but he also  called Simon the Zealot to be one of his disciples.   Now, you may not know, but the tax collectors were loyal to the  Romans. They were Jews who were loyal to the Roman authority, and the  zealots were Jews who were adamantly opposed to the Roman authority.  So, literally, Jesus grabbed two people from opposite political  perspectives--opposite, if I can say it, political parties--and he  grabbed both of them and said: I want you to be my disciple.   And Pastor Turner said: There is a lot that we can learn from Jesus,  beginning with what Jesus said: Everyone is welcome, from every  political perspective, to come and follow Him.   Pastor Turner, you are spot on. My friend, keep preaching it. But  excuse me for noticing, Jesus is the one who set the example, and he  called all of us to be able to follow it.   Now, I have to tell you, Pastor Turner and I don't agree on  everything. We may not even vote alike, though, honestly, I have never  asked him how he votes. But he is my friend, and he is my partner of  reconciliation.   For 6 years, I have asked people across Oklahoma, when May the 31st  comes and the Nation stops and asks, ``What has changed in the last 100  years?'' We should be prepared to answer. That weekend is here, and  each of us should be able to answer that for our lives and for our  families.   Let's finish the work. We are not done on racial reconciliation.  Let's finish the work, starting with our own families, our own  communities, and our own lives.   God help us to carry on the ministry and the message of  reconciliation   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
