 Madam President, I come to the floor today to join my  colleague, Senator Merkley, and so many others in speaking in support  of the critical democracy reforms in the For the People Act-- legislation that I am honored to lead with Senator Merkley and Majority  Leader Schumer, Representative Sarbanes, in the House, which passed  this bill very recently through their entire Chamber.   This bill will, in short, make it easier to vote, not harder to vote,  as, sadly, some of our colleagues have proposed over the years. But it  will make it easier to vote, end the dominance of big money in politics  and ensure that public officials work for the public interest. And it  includes provisions, as Senator Merkley noted, from 15 bills that I  lead to strengthen our democracy.   I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have  contributed to the ideas in this bill. It represents the combined work  of so many people in this Chamber who are dedicated to improving our  democracy.   Nine bipartisan bills are part of the For the People Act--bills like  the Honest Ads Act, which I originally introduced with Senator McCain,  of the great State of Arizona, the Presiding Officer's home State, and  now lead with Senator Graham and Senator Warner.   What does that bill do? Well, it improves disclosure requirements for  online ads, disclosure requirements that aren't in law. It is not  right. And that is why this is just one of the many provisions with  bipartisan support, the election security reforms that so many of us  worked on, including Senator Lankford and Senator Burr. Those are in  this bill.   These are reforms that have broad support among the American people.  According to a Pew Research Center poll, 65 percent of respondents said  the option to vote early, in this bill, or absentee, in this bill,  should be available to any voter. And a poll from the Campaign Legal  Center found that 83 percent of likely voters support public disclosure  of contributions to organizations involved in elections. Of course,  they do. People want to know who is paying for these ads they see on  TV. They want to know where the money is from, and then they can follow  the money.    Many of the provisions in the bill have already been adopted across  the country in red, blue, and purple States. And Republican and  Democratic election officials and Governors have supported them.   As the chair of the Senate Rules Committee, the committee with  jurisdiction over Federal elections and campaign finance law and the  committee to which this bill has been referred, I believe we must get  this done. Tomorrow, as noted by Senator Merkley, we will be holding a  hearing on the bill. I am pleased that every single Democratic Member  of this committee is a cosponsor of the bill. I intend to move quickly  to a markup to send the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.   The For the People Act is critically important. It is important  because it would improve our democracy by protecting voting rights,  getting dark money out of our elections, and putting in place anti- corruption reforms. It is important because every one of the things  that we want to get done, from rebuilding our economy to fixing our  immigration system, to investing in infrastructure, to tackling the  climate crisis, to reforming our criminal justice system, they all  depend on a democracy that works for the people.   Last November, in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic, nearly 160  million Americans voted, more people than ever before in the history of  America. Think about that--in the middle of a pandemic. And we know we  saw the pictures on TV. We saw the people at the very beginning before  we knew what safety protocols should be in place, when things were  getting messed around--those people in Wisconsin in garbage bags, in  garbage bags in the rain, standing in line to vote.   Why did so many people vote in the middle of a pandemic, both sides  of the aisle--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--why did they vote?  Well, they were interested in the election; we know that. But it was  more than that. In part, they voted because they had more access to  voting because of the changes that were made in the States. Vote-by- mail was available and easier for so many more people to do than ever  before.   We think about those people who suddenly had new means to vote in  States where they suddenly didn't have to get a notary public or two  signatures or this or that just to exercise their right to vote. They  voted, and they voted in droves.   Even though the overwhelming majority of Americans have made it clear  they want to see policies that continue to make it easier to vote,  sadly, there are those on the other side of the aisle who have been  doubling down to find ways to make it harder to vote. As Senator  Merkley noted, over 250 bills were introduced in States across the  country, including my home State of Minnesota, that had the highest  voter turnout once again in the country. People are trying to make it  harder to vote, including in Arizona where they had such a record  turnout, including in Georgia. Why? As Senator Warnock said so  beautifully and succinctly in his maiden Senate floor speech just last  week: ``Some people don't want some people to vote.'' Well, that is not  how this country was founded. That is not what our Constitution says.   We cannot just sit back and let our democracy be undermined. As I  said from the inaugural stage on that beautiful blue-sky day at the  very place where you could still see the spray paint at the bottom of  the columns and makeshift windows that we had in place after the  January 6 attack:         This is the day our democracy picks itself up, brushes off       the dust, and does what America always does: goes forward as       a nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for       all.    For decades, there have been those who have been trying to chip away  at the fundamental right to vote. We can't just keep taking it. We have  to ensure that right to vote.   What is this about? One, making it easier to vote. That is exactly  what For the People does. It includes provisions that I have championed  and so many others have, like automatic voting registration, ending  purges of voting rolls, ending redistricting commissions, requiring all  States to allow same-day voting registration, and voting by mail.   These are commonsense policies that were already in place in many  States in the 2020 general election. Forty-five States didn't require  an excuse to vote by mail. This will ensure that in every State, you  don't need to make an excuse. Twenty-one States have same-day  registration, including States like Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. Forty- three States have early voting. Just last month, Kentucky's Republican  secretary of state praised a State bill that would make early in-person  voting permanent.   Certainly, we need to ban purges of voting rolls. As my friend Stacey  Abrams said: If you don't go to a meeting every year, you don't lose  your right to assemble under the Constitution. If you don't go to  church or synagogue or mosque or temple, you don't lose your right to  worship. So if you haven't voted for a few elections and you decide you  want to vote because you care about a candidate or an issue, you should  not lose your right to vote. But in too many places, that is not the  case.   Twenty States already have automatic voter registration laws,  including West Virginia, Alaska, and Georgia. This bill simply says  they all should.   The second major reform we need is to get the big money out of  politics. The For the People Act helps bring transparency to campaign  spending so that voters are informed about who is funding candidates  and who is paying for the ads.   It also tightens regulations on super PACs and restructures the  Federal Election Commission to make it more  [[Page S1694]]  effective and less prone to partisan gridlock.   The third major reform in the For the People Act is restoring trust  in ou government. Democracy isn't just about what happens on election  day; it is also about making sure that our elected officials are  accountable once they take office.    The For the People Act ensures that Members of Congress and other  Federal officials are truly working for the people. It expands conflict  of interest laws, prohibits Members of Congress from serving on the  boards of for-profit entities, and codifies ethics rules for the  executive branch.   Most importantly, why does the highest Court in the land not have any  ethic rules for the Supreme Court when every other Federal court in the  Nation does? This bill answers that question.   Three simple ideas: Making voting easier, getting big money out of  politics, and strengthening ethics rules.   The year 2020 marked the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the  19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, and a century  after that ratification, we elected our first African American, first  Asian American, and first woman Vice President in Vice President Kamala  Harris. As we celebrate these firsts, we are reminded that throughout  our country's history, the right to vote has been hard-fought and hard- won.   As Congressman John Lewis, whom we sadly lost, once said:         Your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most       powerful nonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect       union.    When we reflect on the sacrifices and strides that have been made for  the right to vote, one thing is very clear: The fight isn't over. The  best way we can honor the countless Americans who have risked and, in  some cases, given their lives--given their lives to protect our  freedoms overseas, given their lives to protect our democracy here at  home--the best way is to make sure that democracy continues unfettered  and that everyone has the right to vote because we know, as Senator  Warnock reminded us, that there are some people who are trying to make  it hard for some people to vote. That is not how America works.   The For the People Act is all about making sure America works for  everyone.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I see we are joined by two Senators who are going to be speaking,  Senator Padilla--three Senators--from California, as well as Senator  Whitehouse from Rhode Island and Senator Van Hollen from Maryland.   Thank you.
