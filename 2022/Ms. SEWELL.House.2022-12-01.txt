 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an American native,  an Alabama native, and a civil rights icon, Mrs. Rosa Parks, on the  67th anniversary of her historic arrest.   On this day, December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Mrs. Rosa  Parks refused to give up her seat, taking a bold stand against  Montgomery's segregated bus system. Her dignified courage sparked the  beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the very fabric of  our Nation.   As the Representative of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, I  am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5111, the Rosa Parks Day  Act, which would designate today, December 1, as a Federal holiday in  her honor.   This bill would ensure that her brave sacrifice will live on in  American history forever, and I urge my colleagues to sign on.   As we reflect on her courage, let us never forget the power of  ordinary Americans to achieve extraordinary social change.   In the words of Rosa Parks, I urge you all to ``never be fearful  about what you are doing when it is right.''                            ____________________
