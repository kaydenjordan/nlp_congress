 Mr. Speaker, today we are a simple majority vote away from  the largest expansion of the Federal Government in the history of this  great Nation, ushering a new era of dependence on socialized  government.   We sit at a crossroads between two different directions:   Free will or government control.   Honest, hard work or cradle-to-grave welfare.   Generational debt or deficit reduction.   Tax increases or tax reduction.  [[Page H6591]]    Socialism or economic freedom.   American energy independence or pro-China Green New Deal.   Mass amnesty or secure border.   Keep jobs at home or send them overseas to China.   Economic growth or economic surrender.   The American people or D.C. politicians.   History will remember which road we decide to go down. I strongly  encourage you to choose wisely and vote ``no''--vote ``no''--on the  build back broke bill.
