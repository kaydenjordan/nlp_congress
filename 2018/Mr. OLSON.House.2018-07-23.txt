 Mr. Speaker, the American Dream is alive and well in  Texas-22. It is alive in the south loop Ellington area, and it is alive  and thriving at Tony's Pizza and Grinders.   Tony's is a walking, talking American Dream. In 1996, the Canolli  family left war-torn Kosovo. They started their life here in Michigan.  But shortly, they saw the bright light of the Lone Star State and moved  to Texas. That is where they started Tony's.   The Canollis are special because they care more about others than  about making dollars. Through Hurricane Harvey, they gave free food to  the Southeast Volunteer Fire Department so they could keep saving  lives.   If you want the freshest and the best pizza in America, try the Mrs.  Marie's. That is amore.                            ____________________
