 Well, I should have known when Senator Klobuchar       got involved, at least, there would be a touch of snow up       here this morning. Of all the things we had considered, I       don't think snow was on my agenda until I walked out the door       a moment ago.        But thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and thanks to the other       members of the Joint Congressional Committee on the       Inauguration as we officially begin the 59th inaugural       ceremony. I also want to thank the joint committee staff and       our partners, particularly our security partners, for the way       they have dealt with unprecedented circumstances.        When I chaired the inauguration 4 years ago, I shared       President Reagan's 1981 description of this event as       ``commonplace'' and ``miraculous.'' It is ``commonplace''       because we have done it every 4 years since 1789; it is       miraculous because we have done it every 4 years since 1789.       Americans have celebrated this moment during war, during       depression, and now during pandemic.        Once again, all three branches of our government come       together as the Constitution envisions. Once again, we renew       our commitment to our determined democracy, forging a more       perfect union.        The theme for this inauguration, ``Our Determined       Democracy: Forging a more perfect union,'' was announced by       the joint committee before the election with the belief that       the United States can only fulfill its promise and set an       example for others if we are always working to be better than       we have been.        The Constitution established that determined democracy with       its first three words, declaring the people as the source of       the government. The Articles of Confederation hadn't done       that. The Magna Carta hadn't done that. Only the Constitution       says the government exists because the people are the source       of the reason it exists.        They immediately followed those first three words with the       words ``to form a more perfect union.'' The Founders did not       say to form a perfect union; they did not claim that in our       new country nothing would need to be improved. Fortunately,       they understood that always working to be better would be the       hallmark of a great democracy.        The freedoms we have today and the Nation we have today is       not here just because it happened, and they aren't complete.       A great democracy is working through the successes and       failures of our history, striving to be better than it had       been. We are more than we have been, and we are less than       we hope to be. The assault on our Capitol at this very       place just 2 weeks ago reminds us that a government       designed to balance and check itself is both fragile and       resilient.        During the last year, the pandemic challenged our free and       open society and called for extraordinary determination and       sacrifice and still challenges us today. Meeting that       challenge head on have been and are our healthcare workers,       scientists, first responders, essential frontline workers,       and so many others we depend on in so many ways.        Today, we come to this moment; people all over the world,       as we are here, are watching  [[Page S77]]       and will watch what we do here. Our government comes       together. The Congress and the courts join the transition of       Executive responsibility. One political party is more pleased       today and on every inaugural day than the other. But this is       not a moment of division; it is a moment of unification. A       new administration begins and brings with it a new beginning;       and with that, our great national debate goes forward, and a       determined democracy will continue to be essential in pursuit       of a more perfect union and a better future for all       Americans. What a privilege for me to join you today.        Thank you.        (Applause.)        I am pleased to call to the podium a longtime friend of the       President-elect and his family, Father Leo O'Donovan, to lead       us in an invocation.        Please stand if you are able and remain standing for the       national anthem and the pledge to our flag.        Father O'DONOVAN. Gracious and merciful God, at this sacred       time, we come before you in need, indeed on our knees. But we       come still more with hope and with our eyes raised anew to       the vision of a more perfect union in our land, a union of       all our citizens to promote the general welfare and secure       the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.        We are a people of many races, creeds, and colors, national       backgrounds, cultures, and styles, now far more numerous and       on land much vaster than when Archbishop John Carroll wrote       his prayer for the inauguration of George Washington 232       years ago.        Archbishop Carroll prayed that You, a Creator of all, would       ``assist with your Holy Spirit of counsel and fortitude the       President of these United States, that his administration may       be conducted in righteousness and be eminently useful to Your       people.''        Today, we confess our past failures to live according to       our vision of equality, inclusion, and freedom for all; yet       we resolutely commit still more now to renewing the vision,       to caring for one another in word and deed, especially the       least fortunate among us, and so becoming a light for the       world.        There is a power in each and every one of us that lives by       turning to every other one of us, a trust of the spirit to       cherish and care and stand by others and, above all, those       most in need. It is called love, and its path is to give ever       more of itself. Today, it is called American patriotism,       borne not of power and privilege, but of care for the common       good, with malice toward none and with charity for all.        For our new President, we beg of you the wisdom Solomon       sought when he knelt before you and prayed for an       understanding heart so that ``I can govern your people . .       . and know the difference between right and wrong.''        We trust in the counsel of the letter of James:        In any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives       generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given       to you.        Pope Francis has reminded us how important it is to dream       together. ``By ourselves,'' he wrote, ``we risk seeing       mirages, things that are not there. Dreams, on the other       hand, are built together.''        Be with us, Holy Mystery of Love, as we dream together.       Help us under our new President to reconcile the people of       our land, restore our dream, and invest it with peace and       justice and the joy that is the overflow of love.        To the glory of Your name forever. Amen.        (Performance of the National Anthem by Lady Gaga,       accompanied by the U.S. Marine Band.)        (Fire Captain Andrea M. Hall, of the South Fulton Georgia       Fire and Rescue Department, president of the International       Association of Firefighters Local 3920 recited the Pledge of       Allegiance.)        (Applause.)         It is hard not to be reminded of President Obama       singing that same song at the Mother Emanuel Church, a song       that in our country is as close to both poetry and prayer as       you could possibly come, and we are going to finish with       those two things.        Let me introduce Amanda Gorman, our Nation's first ever       National Youth Poet Laureate.         Thank you, Amanda Gorman.        Now, for our benediction, I am pleased to introduce the       Reverend Dr. Silvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel African       Methodist Episcopal Church in Wilmington, DE, a friend of       President Biden for 30 years.        Reverend BEAMAN. As a nation and people of faith gathered       in this historical moment, let us unite in prayer.        God, we gather under the beauty of Your holiness and the       holiness of Your beauty. We seek Your face, Your smile, Your       warm embrace.        We petition You once more in this celebration. We pray for       divine favor upon our President, Joseph R. Biden, and our       First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, and their family. We further ask       that You would extend the same favor upon our Vice President,       Kamala D. Harris, and our Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, and       their family. More than ever--more than ever--they and our       Nation need You.        We need You, for in You we discover our common humanity. In       our common humanity, we will seek out the wounded and bind       their wounds. We will seek healing for those who are sick and       diseased. We will mourn our dead. We will befriend the       lonely, the least, and the left out. We will share our       abundance with those who are hungry. We will do justly to the       oppressed, acknowledge sin, and seek forgiveness, thus       grasping reconciliation.        In discovering our humanity, we will seek the good in and       for all our neighbors. We will love the unlovable, remove the       stigma of the so-called untouchables. We will care for our       most vulnerable, our children, the elderly, emotionally       challenged, and the poor. We will seek rehabilitation beyond       correction. We will extend opportunity to those locked out of       opportunity. We will make friends of our enemies. We will       make friends of our enemies.        People--Your people--shall no longer raise up weapons       against one another, who will rather use our resources for       the national good, and become a beacon of life and good will       to the world, and neither shall we learn hatred anymore. We       will lie down in peace and not make our neighbors afraid.        In You, oh, God, we discover our humanity, and in our       humanity, we discover our commonness. Beyond the difference       of color, creed, origin, political party, ideology,       geography, and personal preferences, we will become greater       stewards of Your environment, preserving the land, reaping       from it a sustainable harvest, and securing its wonder and       miracle-giving power for generations to come.        This is our benediction, that from these hallowed grounds       where slaves labored to build this shrine and citadel to       liberty and democracy, let us all acknowledge--from the       indigenous Native Americans to those who recently received       their citizenship, from the African American to those whose       foreparents came from Europe and every corner of the globe,       from the wealthy to those struggling to make it, from every       human being, regardless of their choices--that this is our       country.        As such, teach us, oh, God. As such, teach us, oh, God, to       live in it, love in it, be healed in it, and reconcile to one       another in it, less we miss kingdom's goal.        To Your glory, majesty, dominion, and power forever,       hallelujah. Glory hallelujah, in the strong Name of our       collective faith. Amen.
