 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It is  not a racket.   This amendment would add 14 flights per day at the already heavily  congested Ronald Reagan National Airport.   It already has 820 flight operations per day. It is not a racket. The  addition of 14 flights per day would further exacerbate an already  stressed airport operation.   It is not a racket. With limited gates and physical capacity, DCA  doesn't have the space to safely process additional flight operations,  often resulting in planes sitting on the tarmac waiting.   It is not a racket.   Not only does Ronald Reagan National Airport not have the capacity to  support this extension, there are no protections against negative  impacts on other complementary flights or other airports in the region:  Dulles International Airport, Richmond, Roanoke, and Norfolk.   Historically, slot expansions and perimeter exemptions at Ronald  Reagan National Airport have come at the expense of fewer flights from  other Virginia airports. It is not a racket. It is not a racket.   Without protections ensuring the safety and sustainability at Ronald  Reagan National Airport and the stability of other regional airports,  this amendment will only hinder the current system.   It is not a racket.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
