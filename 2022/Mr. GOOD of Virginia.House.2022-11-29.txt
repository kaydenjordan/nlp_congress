 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the  senseless and tragic loss of life at the University of Virginia on  November 13, but I also rise to recognize and honor the bravery  displayed by Mike Hollins during the recent shooting at the University  of Virginia.   After getting off the bus and directing two students to run to  safety, Mike Hollins, a running back on the Cavaliers football team,  turned around and attempted to reboard the bus to help his teammates  and others still trapped with the gunman.   Mike's bravery was met with evil, however, as he was shot while  trying to protect those still in harm's way. Thankfully, Mike has been  released from the hospital. I pray he will continue to have a full and  complete recovery.   My prayers are also with the families of D'Sean Perry, Lavel Davis,  Jr., and Devin Chandler, who are deeply hurting from the loss of their  loved ones, along with the entire University of Virginia community.   We are always saddened in the face of tragedy, but bravery like Mike  Hollins showed gives us hope. May God continue to heal our land.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
