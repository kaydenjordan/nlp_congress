 Mr. President, on the AUMF, negotiations to reach a deal  on AUMF passage continue here in the Senate. We had a number of votes  yesterday evening on Republican amendments, and I expect we are going  to see a few more later today.   Senate passage of the AUMF is now a matter of when, not if, and today  we are going to continue working to make sure it happens as soon as we  can. Americans want to see an end to endless Middle East wars. Passing  this AUMF is a necessary step to putting these bitter conflicts  squarely behind us.   I thank my colleagues for their work. I look forward to this bill's  passage very soon. We are allowing amendments, but we shouldn't just be  dilatory. We should move forward.                                  Extremism    At the start of this Congress, I urged Republicans in both the Senate  and the House to rid themselves of MAGA extremism and work with  Democrats for the good of the country and even for the good of their  own party. We believe MAGA Republicanism hurts their party, because so  many Americans on both sides of the aisle reject it.   Well, over 3 months later, Republicans have failed in so many ways to  abandon MAGA extremism. If anything, they have doubled down and  embraced it even more tightly--again, to the detriment of their country  and to the detriment of their party.   If you just want to know how extreme the GOP has become in the  majority, look no further than what is happening on the House floor  today and tomorrow. As early as this afternoon, House Republicans will  try resurrecting their doomed attempt to protect retirement investors  from considering governance ESG factors when making investment  decisions.   Republicans talk a lot about their love of free markets and letting  the private sector do its work, but their obsession--obsession--with  eliminating ESG would do the opposite. By turning ``ESG'' into a dirty  new little acronym, Republicans are trying to force their own views  down the throats of every company and every investor.   President Biden has already vetoed this nakedly partisan measure, and  it is clear the votes do not exist to override this veto in the House.  It won't even come close.  [[Page S918]]    So it is bad enough that House Republicans are wasting time on show  votes, but it is even more astonishing that this show vote, of all  things, is designed to restrict the private sector on purely  ideological grounds. It is a sad sign of how radicalized and divisive  the GOP has become over the past few years.   But that is not all. Today's potential vote on the ESG override is  the appetizer. Tomorrow's main course is even more horrifying.   As we speak, House Republicans are considering a sweeping piece of  legislation that would nationalize school policy, endanger billions in  nutrition funding, and accelerate the trend of book bans across the  Nation. The House Republicans' school control bill is Orwellian to the  core, and it will not see the light of day here in the Senate. If  passed, schools across the Nation would be forced to adhere to a  panoply of Federal regulations that take power away from parents and  school districts.   Again, let me repeat that. It would take power away from parents and  school districts, away from educators, and put it in the hands of  elected politicians. Again, the GOP that treasured small government and  local control is long since gone, replaced once again by hard-right  MAGA ideologues.   The bill could be devastating to our communities. According to one  report from CBO, schools that fail to comply with these MAGA mandates  would be excluded from Child Nutrition Programs, impacting over 9  million kids who rely on schools for their meals.   That is it. Punish the poor kids. Make sure they don't have a meal if  the school board doesn't comply with these extreme provisions.   The GOP would also expose school districts to even greater risks of  book banning, censorship, and intimidation. Last year alone, there were  over 2,500 book bans across the country on titles that oftentimes  aren't remotely offensive but would still draw the ire of the hard  right.   One school librarian in Pennsylvania--listen to this; it is  crushing--was reportedly forced to remove a poster quoting Holocaust  survivor Elie Wiesel for violating district policy--Elie Wiesel,  violating district policy.   What was the quote in question?         I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human       beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take       sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.       Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.    That was removed.   What is going on here with the extreme right? They are just losing  it. There is something deeply malicious going on within the hard right  when even the quotes of Holocaust survivors are seen as too ``woke'' or  ``offensive.''   Again, rather than abandon the MAGA hard right, the Republican Party  as a whole seems to be doubling down.   Legislation like the GOP's radical school control bill would only  make matters worse, and I will assure the American people and school  children that if this bill is passed, it will meet a dead end when it  comes to the Senate.                                    Budget    Mr. President, finally, on the budget, in the aftermath of major bank  collapses, House Republicans have spent this week not calling for calm  but sowing chaos. Chaos seems to be their calling card.   Earlier this week, House GOP Members, including the chairman of the  House Budget Committee, said now is ``the best time'' to double down on  debt ceiling brinkmanship and hostage-taking.   They suggest, absurdly, that Democrats and Democratic policies are  somehow to blame for what went wrong with Silicon Valley Bank, and they  are trying to link the bank's collapse with the debt ceiling debate.   This is a stupendously bad idea. This is an idea that has no logic.  It has no linear thinking in it at all. It is just throwing things  together, throwing spaghetti on the wall. Threatening the full faith  and credit of the United States is never appropriate, but, at a time  when markets require stability, it is supremely reckless.   Republicans should remember that poor management and deregulation  under President Trump made these bank collapses possible. It wasn't  Democratic policies.   And I would remind my Republican colleagues of this very important  and telling fact: Inflation and interest rates are impacting  institutions everywhere, but the vast majority of banks that have been  properly managed are not in crisis.   So the Republican convoluted argument falls very, very flat. If this  environment is so bad for the banks, why aren't all banks affected? No,  it is the few that are mismanaged. It is the few that were not  regulated properly by the regulators.   So to link the collapses with the debt ceiling--to suggest that these  incidents should justify even more brinkmanship and hostage-taking--is  stunningly reckless.   Instead of trying to promote financial catastrophe, Republican  leaders should stop hiding from the American people, stop coming up  with diversions and subterfuges, and finally show us your plan.   Today is March 23. It has been long enough.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, March 23, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture  is invoked on S. 316 on Monday March 27, it be in order to consider the  following amendments: Sullivan, No. 33; R. Scott, No. 13; Ricketts, No.  30; Cruz, No. 9; Hawley, No. 40; and Johnson, No. 11; that, if offered,  the Senate vote in relation to the amendments at a time to be  determined by the majority leader following consultation with the  Republican leader on Tuesday, March 28, and that 60 affirmative votes  be required for the adoption of these amendments, without intervening  action or debate.    So, Mr. President, before I finish the rest of the  business, I just want to explain to everyone what happened.   A few moments ago, we entered into an agreement that puts the Senate  on a path to repeal the Iraq AUMFs by early next week. By filing  cloture today, we set up a vote for this coming Monday. If cloture is  invoked, we will hold votes on additional amendments before final  passage.   This has been a good process here on the floor. I was asked by  several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to have a  reasonable amendment process and then we could move the bill forward. I  think we did, on a vote that got 70 Republican votes--or 70 total  votes, or close to 70, on cloture last week. We have 11 amendments, and  I think just about every Republican amendment that was asked for as of  today was accommodated.   So this is a good thing, and I hope it can be a model for the future.  We in the majority will allow amendments. Sometimes those votes are  tough to take, but at the same time, the minority will not just be  dilatory and allow us to move forward. That is what happened this week  on AUMF, and I hope it portends good things to come as we work together  to make this country an even better country.   Now back to other business.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
