 Mr. Speaker, in the preamble of the Constitution, our  Founding Fathers explained a more perfect Union required the Federal  Government to do a few things, and to do them well. At the top of the  list is the Federal Government's responsibility to provide for the  common defense and secure our freedom.   There is no freedom without security. These concepts, these pillars  upon which this great Nation was founded, must be proactively protected  every day by men and women across this Nation. A select few of those  men and women wake up every morning to patrol and protect our sovereign  Nation's border in the face of drug smuggling, human trafficking, and  violent criminal activity.                                time  1530    They work to safeguard our Nation, enforce the rule of law, and  promote free trade and commerce through our ports of entry. Yet the  previous administration's policy left our Border Patrol and Customs  operations hamstrung and significantly understaffed.   As someone who represents a border State, I have seen and experienced  those vulnerabilities firsthand.   To say that our Border Patrol and Customs operations are woefully  understaffed is woefully understated. We are almost 3,000 officers and  agents short of the minimum that is mandated by Congress. One reason  for this understaffing is the unreasonable and protracted hiring  processes.   In 2015, it took more than 460 days, on average, and 11 separate  steps to hire a new officer or agent. This is absolutely absurd, even  by government standards, and it must be fixed. That is why today I am  proud to cosponsor H.R. 2213. This legislation provides a more  commonsense and expeditious process for hiring border personnel.   We also need enough Customs officers to foster efficient trade for a  robust economy. A recent study found that every batch of 33 CBP  officers hired could lead to an increase in GDP of $60 million and an  employment gain of over 1,000 jobs. For too long, the Federal  Government has abdicated its chief responsibility of securing our  borders and protecting our citizens. We must put the safety and  security of the American people first and give our Border Patrol and  the CBP the staff they need to do their job.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2213,  and I applaud Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Vela, and Representative  McSally for their leadership on this critical issue.
