 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate is taking the final step  to send much-needed legislation to protect consumers from robocalls to  the President's desk. I think we had hoped that this would be able to  be passed with a couple of other bills coming out of the Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee. I think the chairman of the  committee, Senator Wicker, will address those later: the data mapping  bill and the secure communications bill that deals with ensuring that  we protect our technology from harmful elements--Huawei and those sorts  of things. I would hope that we could get those cleared at some point,  too.   Today, we want to proceed with the robocall bill.   I will just start by saying that illegal robocalls have flooded  Americans' phones to the point where many folks don't want to answer  their phones at all. In fact, a recent report found that only 47  percent of calls Americans receive are actually answered. This means  consumers aren't answering legitimate calls that could be alerting you  of fraud on your credit card, notifying you that your flight has been  canceled, or reminding you of an upcoming medical appointment--all  calls that are important to consumers.   It is clear that no one is immune to these annoying and potentially  dangerous calls. Scammers use these calls to successfully prey on  vulnerable populations, especially elderly Americans, and they target  the kind of personal information that can be used to steal your money  or your identity. When scammers are successful, the consequences for  their victims can be devastating.   While there are laws and fines in place right now to prevent scam  artists for preying on Americans through the telephone, these measures  have been insufficient. When I served as chairman of the Commerce  Committee, I subpoenaed the mass robocaller Adrian Abramovich to  testify about his operation. His testimony made it clear that robocall  scammers simply build the current fines into the cost of doing  business.   On top of this, the Federal Communications Commission's enforcement  efforts are hampered by a tight time window for pursuing violators.  That is why, earlier this year, I introduced the legislation before us  today, the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence  Act, or the TRACED Act, with my fellow Commerce Committee member,  Senator Markey. The TRACED Act provides tools to discourage illegal  robocalls, protect consumers, and crack down on offenders. It expands  the window in which the FCC can pursue intentional scammers and levy  fines from 1 year to 4 years.   The legislation also requires telephone service providers to adopt  call verification technologies that would help prevent illegal  robocalls from reaching consumers in the first place. The TRACED Act  also recognizes the importance of legitimate calls and ensures  important calls like emergency public safety calls are not wrongly  blocked.   Importantly, it convenes a working group with representatives from  the Department of Justice, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the  Department of Commerce, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, State  attorneys general, and others to identify ways to criminally prosecute  the illegal robocalling. TRACED also addresses the issue of so-called  one-ring scams, where international scammers try to get individuals to  return their calls so they can charge them exorbitant fees.   It directs the Federal Communications Commission to convene a working  group to address the problem of illegal robocalls being made to  hospitals.   Mr. President, I am very pleased that the TRACED Act received  bipartisan support in both houses of Congress. I am especially grateful  to Senator Markey for partnering with me on this legislation, and I  appreciate Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell for quickly  advancing this legislation through the Commerce Committee this year.   I also appreciate the work of our House colleagues, Representatives  Pallone, Walden, Doyle, and Latta, for their work on advancing the  TRACED Act through the House. I am also very pleased this bill has  attracted tremendous support from State governments and industry and  consumer groups.   While the TRACED Act won't prevent all illegal robocalling, it is a  big step in the right direction. As The Washington Post editorial board  recently stated, the TRACED ``is what good, old-fashioned legislating  looks like.'' I could not agree more. No process is perfect, but today,  I am excited that the Senate will be sending the TRACED Act to the  President's desk.   Before I close, Mr. President, I would like to quickly thank several  staff members whose efforts helped get us here today. In my office, I  appreciate the work of Alex Sachtjen, Lauren  [[Page S7177]]  Greenwood, Jessica McBride, and Nick Rossi. I would also like to extend  my thanks to Dan Ball, Olivia Trusty, John Keast, and Crystal Tully on  Chairman Wicker's team, who worked tirelessly to help develop and  advance this legislation.   As I mentioned before, I appreciate the great work of Senator Markey,  his partnership on this bill, and I want to thank the work of Daniel  Greene, Joey Wender, and Bennett Butler on his staff. This truly was,  Mr. President, a team effort, so I thank you.   I look forward to the President's signature on the TRACED Act in the  near future, and I hope that, as this bill gets implemented, it will  once again be safe to answer your phone in this country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I appreciate that. I thank the Senator from  Massachusetts. He and his staff were tremendous in working on this. As  I said before, it is nice when we have an opportunity to work in a  bipartisan way on something that is this meaningful in people's lives.  This has a tremendous impact on the daily life of Americans who are  bombarded, in many cases, not just with annoying nuisance calls, but  also with calls that are very predatory and particularly when it comes  to some of our vulnerable populations.   Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XII, I ask unanimous consent that  the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany S. 151.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 151) entitled       ``An Act to deter criminal robocall violations and improve       enforcement of section 227(b) of the Communications Act of       1934, and for other purposes'', do pass with an amendment.                                   Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment,  and I know of no further debate on the motion.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that this be  separate from the discussion that we are now having, but I would ask  unanimous consent that at 12 p.m. today,  [[Page S7178]]  postcloture time on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1865 expire; the other pending motions and  amendments be withdrawn; and Senator Enzi or his designee be recognized  to raise a budget point of order, followed by Senator Shelby or his  designee to make a motion to waive the budget point of order; finally,  if the motion to waive is agreed to, the Senate vote on the motion to  concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1865 with  no intervening action or debate.    I would say my view here is that the gentleman from  Wyoming wants to explain his point of order. There is no objection to  allowing him to do that.    Thank you.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 81, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 82, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the concurrent  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate be in a  period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a longtime member  of my staff, Nicolaas Budde, who is departing my office after 15 years  of service.   Nic has been my systems administrator, responsible for keeping all of  the technology in my personal and leadership Senate offices here in  Washington and in our three State offices in good working order, among  many other things.   Needless to say, a key part of the job description for a systems  administrator is the ability to be extremely patient with those of us  who may not be as up to speed on the technology available to us. And I  would say that there are very few people who are as patient and kind as  Nic.   From fixing a recalcitrant printer to setting up a new, high-tech  studio for the Senate Republican conference, Nic always does what can  often be frustrating and time-consuming work with a cheerful smile and  a reassuring word. He comes to work every single day with a sunny and  enthusiastic attitude, and he doesn't accept anything less than the  best when it comes to serving South Dakotans and our fellow Americans.   Nic grew up in Harrisburg, SD, and worked on both of my Senate  campaigns as systems administrator while he was in college at Dakota  State University in Madison, SD. For those who may not know, Dakota  State University is the ``high-tech'' college in our State, and  students who graduate from DSU often go on to prestigious jobs at  technology companies and the like. Nic could have done any of those  jobs, but instead he chose to dedicate his career to serving here in  the Senate.   Nic is very involved in the Senate community, often vetting new  technologies and participating in pilot projects and working groups  regarding the use of technology in the Senate. Nic manages my official  website, and during his tenure the site has earned several Mouse Awards  from the nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, including a  Gold Mouse Award. Our website is a critical part of our efforts to keep  constituents informed about the work we do on their behalf, and I am  grateful to Nic for all the work he has done to make our site a helpful  resource for South Dakotans.   Before I came to my current leadership position as majority whip, I  was head of the Senate Republican Conference, and Nic was a key part of  the conference team. While we were there, Nic managed a complex and  highly technical project to upgrade the technological infrastructure of  the office, an important but often unsung part of our ability to get  our conference's message out to the nation.   Nic is currently managing a similarly difficult project at the Senate  Republican Conference, setting up a new, high-tech studio that will  greatly expand our technological and communications capabilities in  that office. This is incredibly important work, and Nic has done all of  this while at the same time putting out fires in my whip office and in  the personal office whenever the phones go down or someone's email  isn't working--and always with a smile and a great deal of patience.   I want to thank Nic for his service and also thank his wife Jackie  and his children, Ella and Frederick, for letting us have their husband  and dad for these many years.   Thankfully, Nic won't be going far. He will just be down the hall  continuing his work at the Senate Republican Conference, where all of  my colleagues will get the benefit of his expertise.   Nic, thank you again for your many years of service, your  cheerfulness, your kindness, your hard work, and most importantly, your  patience.   We wish you the very best for the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1906, two brothers named Nikolai and  Matthew Gjelsvik arrived at Ellis Island from Norway. The only English  they knew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee,'' which evidently  they learned on the boat on the way over.   The immigration officials at Ellis Island thought that their name  would be too difficult to spell and pronounce in this country, so they  asked them to change their name. The names, when they got to this  country, were Nikolai Gjelsvik, spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, and his  brother was named Matthew.   So the immigration officials asked them to change their name, and  they picked the name from the farm where they worked near Bergen,  Norway, which was called the Thune farm. So Nikolai Gjelsvik became  Nick Thune, my grandfather.   He and his brother worked on the railroad as they built it west  across South Dakota. They learned English and saved up enough money to  start a small merchandising company and then later a hardware store in  Mitchell, SD. To this day, there is a Thune Hardware in Mitchell,  although the family sold it many years ago.   In 1916, Nick Thune married an Iowa girl who had moved to South  Dakota to teach school, and they had three sons. The middle son,  Harold, will turn 100 in a few days, and that middle son happens to be  my dad.   Like many of my colleagues, I send congratulatory notes to  constituents for big birthdays and anniversaries. I never thought I  would have the occasion to send one to my dad. I figured for this one,  instead of writing a letter, I would come to the floor.    My dad is a World War II veteran. He is a member of that ``greatest  generation,'' and he shares the qualities of so many in that  generation--humility, patriotism, quiet service. Dad was a Navy pilot  who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid, and he was an excellent pilot.  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four enemy  planes in one engagement. As a side note to that, that accommodation  was issued to him by none other than ADM John McCain, Senator John  McCain's grandfather.   But my dad didn't and still doesn't talk about his own exploits. In  fact, had it not been for my mom, I am quite sure I never would have  known about my dad's record in World War II. I did have the opportunity  to interview him for the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project  a few years back, and he shared some wonderful details about his  service. As usual, his focus was never on his own achievements but on  those of his fellow pilots.   I also probably would never have learned what an outstanding athlete  my dad was, had it not been for my mom. My dad grew up in the small  town of Murdo, SD, during the Great Depression. They didn't have a lot,  but there were a lot of basketball hoops around Murdo. They put them on  barns, poles, garages, and my dad learned to play. In fact, he learned  to play so well that he took his high school basketball team to the  State championship game where, although they lost narrowly, he was  named the tournament's most valuable player.   My dad had hoped to attend college in South Dakota, but there was a  doctor in Murdo named Joseph Murphy who thought my dad was good enough  to play at the University of Minnesota and used his contacts to get my  dad up to Hibbing Junior College in hopes that the Minnesota Gophers  would notice him. Well, they did. He went to the Twin Cities on a  scholarship and played three seasons for the Gophers. He was the team's  most valuable player in his junior year. In fact, he was high point man  in Madison Square Garden on his birthday, December 28, 1940.   In another example of how things have changed through the years, my  dad said that when his team came out to play for the second game that  night at the Garden, you couldn't see the upper deck because of all the  cigarette smoke. Some things do change for the better.   While at the University of Minnesota, my dad met a girl who served  sodas at a drugstore just off campus. They were married within a couple  of years while my dad was in flight training for the Navy, and they  spent the next almost 69 years together.   After the war, they came back to South Dakota. My dad had been  thinking about a career in the Navy, but his dad asked him to come back  and run the family hardware store. My dad said that his heart sank, but  he knew that is what he had to do. So he went home and went to work for  his dad. The hardware store did OK for a while, but started to  struggle. My dad sold it and went back to school and got a teaching  degree.   All parents are teachers for their kids, but my parents were teachers  several times over. Kids usually get a break from their parents when  they are at school. My dad was a teacher at my high school. He was also  a coach and the athletic director, and he drove the bus. My mom was the  school librarian. So I think it is safe to say that my brothers and  sister and I were pretty much always under the watchful eye of my  parents. I have to say that I never had my dad for a class in high  school, but my brother Rich did. Rich was the valedictorian of his high  school class, and the only B he got in high school was from my dad.  That was my dad for you. He never showed any preference or gave any of  his kids better treatment than anybody else. In fact, some of us might  argue that he gave us a harder time because we were his kids. But he  believed very firmly that you had to earn your achievements.   As a coach, my dad taught us about being a team player. He made it  clear that being on a team was not about building your personal  statistics but about making the players around you better. It is a  lesson I have carried throughout my life and one that I try to live by  every day.   A few years ago, the Jones County School District in Murdo named the  auditorium in Murdo after my dad in recognition of his service and  achievements at the school. It was particularly special since my dad  was one of the volunteers who originally built the auditorium back in  the 1950s. My dad would tell me the story that he was more scared up on  the scaffolding of that building than he had ever been flying off a  carrier during World War II.   You might think that with my dad as coach and athletic director,  sports were the main focus around our house. They certainly were a big  part of our lives. But my mom was determined that we would grow up to  be well-rounded people, and my dad always supported her in that. They  worked hard to ensure that we grew up with a perspective on life that  went beyond just the latest sporting event. Mom made us take piano  lessons and, during the summers, come in from outside and read for an  hour every day. We complained at the time, but I know all of us today  are grateful to her and my father for their investments in that.   Mom and Dad made a good team. Mom was an optimist, and Dad was a  pessimist--or, as he would put it, a realist--and they balanced each  other out well. We didn't have material riches growing up, but we were  beyond rich in those things that money can't buy but that lend purpose,  joy, and meaning to life. All of us Thune kids are very, very grateful  for that heritage.   I can't close without talking about something that was life-changing  for my parents, and that was their strong faith in Christ. My dad  always had real discernment and wisdom in no small part because of his  daily dependence upon God in his life. God blessed him with it.  [[Page S7223]]    As we celebrate my dad's 100th birthday, I want to say thank you to  you for the example of faith, integrity, character, and humility that  you have given to me and to Bob and to Rich and to Karen and to Tim.  Thank you for faithfully serving God's purpose for your generation and  happy 100th birthday.   I yield the floor.
