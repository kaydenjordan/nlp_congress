 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  question of adopting amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report  115-595 to H.R. 4545 may be subject to postponement as though under  clause 8 of rule XX.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 773, I  call up the bill (H.R. 4545) to amend the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to improve the examination  of depository institutions, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4545, the  Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act.   It is a strongly bipartisan bill, having come out of our committee by  a vote of 50-10. It is authored by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), who serves as the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations and is, indeed, one of the leaders in the  House in bringing regulatory relief to our community financial  institutions. I want to thank him for his leadership on this very, very  important issue.   H.R. 4545 creates transparency and accountability among regulators by  improving the timeliness of examinations, while also creating a new  more independent examination appeals process.                                time  1315    Madam Speaker, this is about, again, transparency. It is about due  process. The Office of Independent Examination Review created under  this bill will ensure accountability and fairness for financial  institutions during their supervisory examinations. It does so by  providing the right for these institutions to obtain an independent  review of a material supervisory determination contained in a final  examination report.   The creation of this independent review process is particularly  important for our Nation's community banks and credit unions that will  now be able to appeal their examination decisions without fear of  reprisal from their regulator.   By reforming the process for examining financial institutions to  ensure it is fair and consistent, Congress will indeed enhance the  safety and soundness of the financial system overall while ensuring  Main Street businesses can access the liquidity and capital resources  they need to grow and create jobs. Again, Madam Speaker, this is why  this is so important. Ultimately, this is about ensuring a free flow of  credit to Main Street businesses and families.   Many of our community financial institutions have felt a very, very  heavy hand of burdensome Federal regulations that were intended--or so  we were told--for the largest and most complex institutions; and  regulators, unfortunately, seem to ignore congressional directive and  apply each one of these standards to our smallest institutions. Thus,  yesterday, Madam Speaker, we voted on the TAILOR Act, also authored by  the gentleman from Colorado, that would also help ensure these  regulations are tailored to the size and complexity of the institution.   Without having due process and fairness in this exam review, the  result has been catastrophic. This regulatory burden, of which this is  a part, has been resulting in the closing or merger of one community  bank or credit union per day, on average. And again, they are not being  lost to natural causes.   Our community financial institutions serve as the backbone of our  American economy, and we simply cannot afford to lose them. As chairman  of the Financial Services Committee, in my sixth year, my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle are all too familiar with this problem. I hear  from credit unions and community banks every day.   I heard from West Community Credit Union in Missouri, who wrote:  ``This one-size-fits-all approach is simpleminded and has real  consequences. We are beginning to make changes that will negatively  impact our ability to continue to serve members in meeting their home  equity lending needs.''   In fact, Madam Speaker, we know that a number of banks and credit  unions have had to leave mortgage lending because of the regulatory  burden.   Then there is County-City Credit Union in Wisconsin, who said:  ``Small credit unions are dropping every day. Unless we get immediate  relief, there won't be any left. That would be tragic for our members  and the very fabric of our country. Please help us, and help us right  now.''   I have good news. Help is on the way if we can get a good, solid vote  this afternoon.   The CEO of Commonwealth National Bank in Tennessee wrote: ``The fact  remains that there are fewer community banks today than there were  several years ago, a trend that will continue until rational  changes''--for example, like the ones we are speaking of today, Madam  Speaker--``are made that will provide some relief to America's hometown  banks.''   Again, we are hearing this plea every single day. So there is good  reason why H.R. 4545 was reported by this committee with a strong  bipartisan vote, 50-10, including a majority support of the Democrats  on the committee.   Again, the bill is strongly bipartisan, it is practical, and it is  necessary. H.R. 4545 will allow financial institutions, again, to have  supervisory determinations reviewed by a newly established independent  examination review board. This will allow for uniformity among  regulatory agencies, again, while making the overall exam process more  fair and more efficient.   The bill does not prevent a regulatory agency from conducting  examinations or imposing restrictions on financial exams, but, again,  it will restore fairness, due process, and accountability for the sake  of our community banks and credit unions; and, more importantly, for  the sake of those who still have the American Dream of either buying  their own home, starting their own business, or sending that first kid  to college, it is imperative that we enact H.R. 4545.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  to my friend from Missouri, as he recounts his parade of horribles,  that this bill was supported by a majority of Democrats on the  committee, including Mr. Crist of Florida, Democrat; Mr. Delaney of  Maryland, Democrat; Mr. Foster of Illinois, Democrat; Mr. Gonzalez of  Texas, Democrat; Mr. Gottheimer of New Jersey, Democrat; Mr. Heck of  Washington, Democrat; and Mr. Himes of Connecticut, Democrat.   I think my 30 seconds is winding down, but perhaps I can share the  rest of the Democratic Members who supported this excellent piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), who is back with us again today. He is the vice chairman of  the Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and  is the author of H.R. 4545.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), who is the vice chairman of the  Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Service  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to say that I  just find some of the comments of the ranking member curious.   I know if she continues this attack on the so-called Wall Street  megabanks, I just continue to be so curious why she supports bailing  them out? She voted against the Financial CHOICE Act that would have  ended bailouts to these megabanks. And so she supports a bailout fund  in Dodd-Frank to continue to bail out these banks.   Second of all, if she continues to attack them, I guess I am curious  also why she supports the Federal Reserve's program to pay interest on  excess reserves. She supports taking taxpayer money to pay the so- called Wall Street megabanks not to loan money to Main Street,  something that I have opposed as have many other Republicans on this  side of the aisle.   And then to make matters worse, Mr. Speaker, on this interest on  excess reserves, these banks are getting almost 10 to 15 times what our  constituents are getting on their savings accounts.   In many cases, it is the difference between 0.07 percent, versus 1.5  percent. And so I understand, again, she attacks them, but then I am  just curious, why does she find so many ways to support them?   So personally, I think in this economy, there is a need for community  banks and credit unions. There is a need for regional banks, and there  is a need for global banks as well. What we want is accountability. We  want less Federal control, and what we want is more private capital. We  want to ensure that there are never more taxpayer bailouts.   And again, as I said earlier, as this so-called parade of horribles  was brought to the attention of the House, why is it that a majority of  Democrats on her committee support this legislation? Sixteen of them  support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1630]]         Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased now to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the  Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee and the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is a very commonsense bill, which is one of  the reasons it is strongly bipartisan. I am sorry that the ranking  member has not chosen to be part of that bipartisanship, but over half  of the committee Democrats on our committee support it. Why? Because  they understand that it is part of our American DNA to have due  process.    When we continue to lose a credit union or a community bank every day  in America, on average, with their loss, we are losing home ownership  opportunities, opportunities to grow businesses.   Because of that regulatory burden, these exams can mean the  difference between a credit union being open and not being open. They  can mean the difference between a community bank being open or not  open. Thus, it means the difference in our constituents getting homes  and small business loans and auto loans.   This is common sense. It simply says you ought to be able to appeal  an exam, have a third party take a look at it.   Everybody deserves due process in America, including our community  banks and credit unions, so that is why it is so important that we  enact H.R. 4545. It came out of our committee with a huge bipartisan  vote. Let's make sure credit continues to flow throughout America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4545, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, again, what we are talking about here is  fundamental due process: due process for every American, due process  for every institution regardless of its size, regardless of its  geography. This is about due process.   As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: ``Whatever disagreement there  may be as to the scope of the phrase `due process of law,' there can be  no doubt that it embraces the fundamental conception of a fair trial,  with opportunity to be heard.'' He is one of the most famous jurists in  all of American history.   We are trying to ensure, again, that a bank examiner or a credit  union examiner is not tantamount to judge, jury, prosecutor, cop on the  beat, and executioner all rolled into one. There is no due process if  your only practical appeal is to the person who rendered the judgment  in the first place.   So, number one, it is important that all Americans, all institutions  receive due process, which is perhaps why even over half of the  Democrats on the Financial Services Committee chose to support H.R.  4545.   The ranking member's amendment would set a threshold here, but her  threshold, as she talks about these so-called megabanks, at $10  billion, that is one-half of 1 percent of the size of J.P. Morgan.   So, Mr. Speaker, I don't believe in too-big-to-fail banks. I know my  friends on the other side of the aisle do. That is why they voted for  the bailout fund to support these too-big-to-fail financial  institutions with taxpayer funds.   I don't believe in too-big-to-fail institutions, but if I did, Mr.  Speaker, if I did, it would be limited to maybe eight or nine banks in  America. It certainly wouldn't be applicable to any community bank,  credit union, or regional bank.   We have to remember, regardless of the size of the bank, it is their  capital that is helping to capitalize our businesses.                                time  1415    I am from Dallas, Texas. One of our major employers is American  Airlines. I wish they could do business with First State Bank of  Athens, but I suspect they do not. And so sometimes, yes, global banks  are necessary to our economy, regional banks are necessary to our  economy, community banks and credit unions are necessary to our  economy. They are suffering under the sheer weight, load, volume,  complexity, and expense of the regulatory burden, which the examination  process is part of it.   Let's give them due process. Let's give them fairness and ensure that  credit can flow to every small business, every household that is worthy  in America. Let's reject the ranking member's amendment, and let's  support the underlying bill, H.R. 4545.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 773, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4263) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 with  respect to small company capital formation, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 4263, the  Regulation A+ Improvement Act.   I want to thank the sponsor of this bipartisan legislation, the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur). He has been a huge leader on  all capital formation issues within our committee and in this Congress.  He is a real asset. His business acumen is well positioned to help  serve us, and his leadership on this bill should be commended.   Mr. Speaker, although small companies are at the forefront of  technological innovation and job creation, they often face significant  obstacles in obtaining funding in our capital markets. These obstacles  generally stem from the disproportionately larger burden that  securities regulations, written principally for large public companies,  instead place on small companies when they seek to go public.   In 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, known as JOBS Act,  sought to modernize and better tailor some of these regulations,  including Reg. A, under our securities law. Reg.  [[Page H1635]]  A is a longstanding exemption from SEC registration that permits public  offerings without formal registration as long as certain conditions are  met.   Prior to the JOBS Act, a small company seeking to use Reg. A was  limited to raising $5 million of securities in a 12-month period. As  you can imagine, over time, Mr. Speaker, Reg. A offerings became  increasingly rare due to the relatively small offering size that was  available and a requirement that Reg. A securities still comply with 50  different State securities law registration and qualification  requirements.   Title IV of the JOBS Act attempted to address the antiquated  Regulation A by directing the SEC to update it, which the SEC did in  2015, under the moniker Reg. A+, by creating two tiers of Regulation A  offerings and allowing certain securities to qualify for preemption  from State securities law.   Under the second tier, the SEC increased the amount companies can  offer from $5 million to $50 million. Mr. MacArthur's legislation only  pertains to the Tier 2 limit.   Since Reg. A+ was implemented in 2015, small businesses have  increasingly been able to use this tool to raise much-needed capital to  expand their businesses and create new jobs in our economy. According  to the SEC Office of Small Business Policy, as of November 2017, 69  completed Reg. A+ offerings had raised a total of $611 million.   Unfortunately, the $50 million cap leaves significant opportunity on  the table for our startups, opportunity that could be better realized  if the limit were increased to $75 million, which the Treasury  Department has recommended as a potentially less costly alternative for  startups to raise capital. Moreover, increasing the Reg. A+ limit will  better position companies that want to use the exemption as an on-ramp  to list publicly to bear the corresponding compliance burdens and still  invest in jobs and growth.   Mr. Speaker, more and more, we have seen IPOs of companies with  products that we use every day--Uber, Facebook, Spotify, Snapchat--come  after the company is already valued over $1 billion. For everyday  investors, this often means missing out on some of the most dynamic  growth stages of the company that would provide the highest rate of  returns for them and their family, all while the wealthy, accredited  investors and venture capital firms can invest early, and they get to  rake in the better rates of return.   With regulations disproportionately stacked against them, it isn't  surprising that small companies so often are choosing to stay private.  Many have no other choice. Again, after all, the SEC has estimated that  the costs of going public, on average, are $2.5 million in regulatory  costs for undergoing an IPO and annual compliance costs averaging $1.5  million thereafter.   Those costs stand in stark contrast to the $111,000 the SEC says is  the average legal and auditing cost for Reg. A+ offerings. In other  words, by utilizing Reg. A+, small businesses can raise significant  capital while saving more than $2 million--$2 million that can be  invested in jobs and research and other growth opportunities. This is  why Reg. A+ is so important: it provides a more cost-effective way to  raise equity capital early on in the growth stages of these companies.   Additionally, Reg. A offerings enjoy preemption from State securities  laws. Mr. Speaker, I hope every Member pays close attention to this.  They may not know it.   In 1980, when a startup computer company, by the way, called Apple  decided to go public, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided the  stock was too risky and barred its sale to individual investors in the  State. Today, Apple's market valuation is almost $1 trillion. It is an  American iconic brand and one of the largest companies in the world.  And it is, again, potentially going to be the first public company with  a trillion-dollar market cap. If you had bought 45 shares of Apple when  it was offered at its IPO, by the end of last year you would have over  $394,000. That is hardly crumbs, Mr. Speaker.   In short, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  It is a very smart but modest improvement in a popular JOBS Act  provision.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), the sponsor of this legislation and a  hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the majority whip of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin), from the land of moose and maple syrup, a  hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H1638]]  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  MacArthur), an entrepreneur, someone who brings years and years of  experience in capital formation of building a business to help grow  jobs and our economy.   H.R. 4263, again, is, in part, an expansion of the JOBS Act,  something that was signed into law by President Barack Obama. I didn't  agree with that particular President on many occasions, but he got this  right, and this has been something good for the American economy.   But what I fear is that, if we don't go forward, we end up going  backwards. And what we hear from our friends on the other side of the  aisle is: Let's keep the status quo.   But, Mr. Speaker, the status quo is what brought us a 1.6 percent  economy. The status quo is what brought paychecks to become stagnant.  The status quo ensured that Americans did not recover their savings  from the great financial crisis.   Now we have the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and now we have 3 percent  economic growth; now we have the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years;  now we have seen the greatest growth in paychecks in almost a decade;  now we are seeing 90 percent--90 percent--of wage earners seeing a  bigger paycheck, better take-home pay, because of the economic policies  of this Republican Congress and of the Trump administration.   So the gentleman from New Jersey has brought us, really, in some  respects, an important but modest proposition: that we ought to  increase the threshold for Reg A+ to $75 million.   Again, we don't know where the next Uber is coming from. We don't  know where the next Spotify is coming from. We don't know where the  next Apple is coming from. But do you know what, Mr. Speaker? We all  know they need capital. And this is a valuable alley, chain, path in  order to bring capital into our startup businesses.   Now, a constant theme we hear from our friends on the other side of  the aisle is consumer protection. Do you know what? Back in the 1980s,  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided to protect their people from  this fly-by-night company called Apple, which now is looking at an  almost $1 trillion market cap valuation, and had you invested at the  IPO, you would have a 45,000 percent rate of return. You could buy a  home; your children could buy a home; your great-grandchildren could  buy a home. You could achieve your American Dream. But a government  decided: No, you are too stupid to make this investment decision on  your own. We must protect you.   Nothing--nothing--in the bill from the gentleman from New Jersey  alters the vast, vast array of consumer protection laws that are  already on the books. Nothing in H.R. 4263 prevents the Department of  Justice from pursuing criminal prosecutions of fraud. Nothing in the  bill impacts the SEC's ability to pursue civil actions for those  [[Page H1640]]  who engage in fraud, negligent misrepresentations, negligent  transactions.   Nothing in this bill prevents the SEC from entering into cease and  desist orders and imposing civil liabilities for those who violate SEC  rules. Investors get to pursue Federal civil actions against those who  defraud them, those who make untrue statements. So there are plenty of  very important laws that are on our books.   What we shouldn't do, though, is protect our hardworking constituents  from the ability to make decisions for themselves and participate in  these early growth companies that now are only restricted to accredited  investors. It is only the wealthiest who get to make these decisions.  Well, in the land of the free, maybe a few more should, and maybe we  ought to have a few more Apples, a few more Ubers, a few more Spotifys.   I want to thank, again, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  MacArthur), who has been a great leader in capital formation and job  creation on our committee and in this Congress, and I want to urge all  Members to adopt H.R. 4263.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, when I have said something incorrect, I  wish to correct myself in front of my colleagues in the public. I  earlier said that my colleagues were trying to give us status quo. I  wish to correct myself. This motion to recommit is worse than status  quo. It would take us back even further.   The gentlewoman from Ohio should admit when she is wrong. She is  wrong when she says this will not kill the bill. This will kill it. It  will gut it. It will bury it 6 feet under. I think she knows that. So  she is entitled to her opinion about what Reg. A+ should be, but she  absolutely eviscerates the bipartisan bill that is before the House.   Because many who are watching this may somehow think, ``Oh, my Lord,  there are no consumer protections for Reg. A+ offerings,'' the basic  requirements that are applicable to both Tier 1 and tier offerings  include company eligibility requirements, bad actor disqualification  requirements, issuer disclosure requirements, ongoing reporting  requirements.   And then for Tier 2 offerings, additional requirements: providing  audited financial statements; requirement to file annual, semiannual,  and current event reports; and limitation on the amount of security  nonaccredited and accredited investors can purchase.  [[Page H1641]]    Then those that are offered on an exchange have to adhere to the  exchange's listing standards, including corporate governance  requirement, background checks on the management and board, shareholder  approval of certain corporate actions, and the list goes on.   Mr. Speaker, I think there is a good case here. Anybody who picked up  a newspaper recently would find out that, yesterday, the SEC charged  Theranos with raising more than $700 million from investors through  exaggerated and false statements about the company's technology.   Guess what. In announcing the enforcement decision, here is what the  SEC noted:         The charges make clear that there is no exemption--no       exemption--from the antifraud provisions of the Federal       securities laws simply because a company is nonpublic,       development-stage, or the subject of exuberant media       attention.    In other words, the SEC was thoroughly able to do their job, and they  were ready and willing to investigate and bring enforcement actions, as  they well should. This is part of their job, investor protection. But  guess what. So is capital formation. Capital formation is part of the  mission of the SEC. That is why it is so important that we not protect  our constituents against great investment opportunities, like Apple,  like Uber, and like Spotify.   So when we have so many Americans who are still living paycheck to  paycheck, when they finally get a little savings together, shouldn't  they be able to invest in great opportunities of early growth  companies? Shouldn't these early growth companies have access to  capital?   I think so.   You can't have capitalism without capital. Let's get more capital  circulating in the system. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has done so much  good, but we need so much more. We need capital circulating the system,  particularly for our startups and our early growth stage companies.   We need to reject the MTR, and we need to vote in support of H.R.  4263.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
