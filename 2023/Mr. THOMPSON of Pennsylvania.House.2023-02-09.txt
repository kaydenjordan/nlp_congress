 Mr. Speaker, I bring to the floor today  my most recent copy of the ``Boy Scout Handbook.'' I would say this:  After the Bible, it is one of the most influential books in my life.   I rise today to recognize the 113th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of  America, the Nation's foremost youth program of character development  and values-based leadership training.   On February 8, 1910, Chicago businessman William Boyce, who grew up  in western Pennsylvania, incorporated the Boy Scouts of America.   Since that time, millions of young men and women have joined the  Scouts and learned the values of patriotism, courage, and self- reliance. There are more than 1 million youth currently enrolled in  Scouting who contributed more than 17.7 million community service hours  in 2022, helping to advance important projects, from conserving local  waterways to constructing accessible parks, in nearly every  congressional district across the country.   I spent more than 50 years in Scouting, including serving as a  Scoutmaster and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout in 1977. It was these  experiences that first sparked my interest in public service. The Boy  Scouts oath, in part, urges us to perform our duty to our country.   As co-chair of Congressional Scouting Caucus, I am proud to introduce  a resolution alongside my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Bishop)  designating today as Boy Scouts of America Day to honor the tireless  service of Scout volunteers and participants in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scouts of America has played a pivotal role in  shaping the leaders of tomorrow, and I look forward to seeing their  continued contributions to our country.                            ____________________
