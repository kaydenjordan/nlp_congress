 Mr. President, no one wins in a shutdown--not  Republicans, not Democrats, and certainly not the people of Hawaii or  Americans across the country. I have been here for three previous  shutdowns, in the majority and in the minority, and I have seen the  same thing over and over again. Shutdowns don't work. The government  eventually reopens, and neither side has accomplished a single thing.   No one wins, but Americans have a lot to lose. Millions of Federal  workers, including military personnel, will be forced to work without  pay. Children most in need will lose access to food and early education  programs. Tens of millions of people can't get care at community health  centers. The food that we eat will go uninspected. Relief for disaster- stricken communities will grind to a halt. Loans for small businesses  will not get processed. Seniors will have to wait to get new Medicare  cards. Travelers will face the risks of more delays.   We have the ability and the responsibility to prevent all of this  unnecessary pain and disruption, which is why, Tuesday and today, the  Senate has a solution. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to advance a  bipartisan bill that will keep the government open.   Look, this is not the Civil Rights Act. This is not that big of a  legislative accomplishment. It is a 47-day stopgap measure to prevent a  really ridiculous, terrible thing from happening. But we do need to  pass it.   Anyone that is serious about governing knows that the only way to  prevent a shutdown is through bipartisanship. And let me just repeat  that: The only way to prevent a shutdown is through bipartisanship.   This bill is a compromise. No one will get what they really wanted,  but it is the only viable path to keeping the government open as we  work on passing appropriations bills in the regular order for the full  year. It is really that simple.   I just want to point out one thing about shutdowns. We don't have to  do this to ourselves. Shutdowns are a uniquely American tactic. We are  not more prone to polarization or partisanship than other governments  across the world. But you look around the planet, and you won't find  other legislatures pulling the plug on the government itself and the  critical services that people need because they couldn't resolve a  policy dispute. It just doesn't happen because it is that ridiculous,  it is that insane, it is that counterproductive. Only we do this to  ourselves. But here, some House Republicans are openly inviting a  shutdown that we know will exact pain on millions of American families.   Representative Norman has said:         We are going to have a shutdown. It's just a matter of how       long.    Representative Rosendale agreed, saying:         I will not vote for a CR. It doesn't matter what you attach       to it.    What a weird thing to say:   It doesn't matter what you attach to it.   ``It doesn't matter what you attach to it''--I am for a shutdown.   And this from Representative  Bob Good, who sums up their warped  view:         We shouldn't fear a government shutdown.    Well, maybe a Member of Congress is not afraid of a government  shutdown, but all of the people who work for the Federal Government and  all of the people who rely on Federal services do fear a government  shutdown.   One of their Republican colleagues agrees with me:         This is not conservative Republicanism. This is stupidity.       . . . These people can't define a win.    That is the problem. The only thing these people know is that they  want to shut the government down. They haven't even articulated their  policy demands, and we are 48 hours out.   So we need to act like grownups and do our job. And I just want to be  clear:  [[Page S4735]]  We are acting like grownups and doing our job. This is not a criticism  of the U.S. Senate--so far, so good.   And listen, even though it is 48 hours, we have a long way to go. We  have a lot of negotiating to do, and we have a lot of bumps in the  road. As I like to say, it will get worse before it gets better. So I  am not suggesting that we are done here, but I am suggesting that we  are behaving like grownups.   For the people of Maui and those in so many other communities across  the country that have had the misfortune of being struck by disasters,  this bill provides funding that will allow recovery work to continue  uninterrupted. The ongoing recovery effort on Maui alone will require  enormous Federal resources, in addition to what is needed in dozens of  other States that have been slammed by hurricanes, floods, and other  extreme weather. And while this funding by itself won't ever be enough  to cover everything in each one of these communities, it is an  important downpayment.   Whatever our disagreements or our personal politics, we can all  agree: No one wins in a shutdown. We have lived through this before and  know how this ends.   There is an alternative. We can continue what we started earlier this  week and just did right now on the floor--pass this bill with  bipartisan support and keep the government open.   Let's get it done.   I yield the floor.
