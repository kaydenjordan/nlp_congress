 Madam President, the State of Vermont is  remarkably proud of Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who won a silver medal at the  Winter Olympics in Beijing in the men's super-G. This achievement is  specially impressive considering it occurred just 13 months after Ryan  underwent surgery to repair a broken neck. His comeback is truly  remarkable.   It is not merely his success that Vermont honors, but the history of  his family. Family is important in our State, which values community  and continuity--both of which are embodied in family. Families--people  who are linked by a shared home life, by a closeness to one another, by  a mutual supportiveness--are at the heart of what our small State is  about.   Ryan's mother, Barbara Ann, won the gold medal in Slalom at the  Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, in 1972, nearly 50 years to the day before  her son's medal. Barbara Ann was Ryan's first ski teacher, and he  learned where she did: at the small, family operated, nonprofit  Cochran's Ski Area in Richmond, VT,   Cochran's was founded by Barbara Ann's parents, Mickey and Ginny  Cochran, who were a remarkable pair of people. Mickey, who would become  the alpine director of the U.S. National Ski Team, was not himself a  champion skier, but an engineer and former University of Vermont  football player, who valued family--and eventually skiing--above all  else. Likewise, Ginny was dedicated to family and skiing. When they  first established Cochran's Ski Area, it was a small, backyard  operation. Today, it has grown into a center where generations of  Vermont school children could learn to ski, still located on the small  family hill.   Ginny and Mickey had four children, Barbara Ann, Marilyn, Bob, and  Lindy. All were champion skiers and made the U.S. Olympic Team   Among their many other sking accomplishments, Marilyn Cochran Brown  was a national champion three times, Bob Cochran was the first American  man to win a World Cup in giant slalom, and Lindy Cochran Kelley won  national slalom titles and was All American at University of Vermont-- and, of course, Barbara Ann, Olympic slalom gold medalist and two-time  national champion.   That tradition of family skiing excellence continued into the next  generation, Mickey and Ginny's grandchildren. Lindy's children, Jessica  Kelley, Tim Kelley, and Robby Kelley, all raced on the U.S. National  Ski Team and all competed in World Cup races. Robby was the U.S.  National Giant Slalom champion.   Two of Bob's children were skiers: Jimmy Cochran, who won the U.S.  Slalom competition three times and competed in the Olympic games; and  Amy Cochran, a successful collegiate racer. Marilyn's son Roger Brown  was on the U.S. Ski Team, winning the 2002 Slalom championship and her  son Doug Brown was on the varsity ski team at St. Lawrence University.  Together with two of their cousins, Doug and Roger have gone on to  found another Cochran family business, Slopeside Syrup and Untapped.  And of course, Barbara Ann's son, two-time Olympian and one-time silver  medalist Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who has also also competed in the World  Cup.   Clearly, the impact of the Cochran family is not only their world- class skiing. Cochran's Ski Area is a bright spot in making skiing  accessable and fun for all Vermonters. As a nonprofit, they welcome  children from across the region to learn in a safe, judgement-free  environment where the love of the sport is what matters, not the brand  of your gear. The ``Skiing Cochrans'' are truly a Vermont legacy.   ``Bravo!''                            ____________________
