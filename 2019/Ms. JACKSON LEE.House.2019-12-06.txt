 Mr. Speaker, who on this floor would stand with me  for peace, and who on this floor would stand against our position and  against peace?   It is well known that the United States, all of my life, has been a  strong supporter of Israel, rooted in shared national security  interests, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   I have sent to Israel young people, through the Mickey Leland  Kibbutzim program, from my district for 25 years--almost 25 years--to  develop the understanding and friendship that we continue to promote  for the values of what Israel stands for.   The United States has worked for decades to strengthen our  assistance. We are intertwined through national security. And, in  essence, this two-state solution is a solution toward peace.   I have been to Palestine and met the Palestinians and their leaders  over the years that I have served in the United States Congress.  Presidents Bush, Clinton, and Obama stood with Israel, as we all stand  today. But we stand with peace and the understanding of the two-state  solution. Let us stand united.  [[Page H9304]]     I invite my Republican friends to join on the  resolution, H. Res. 326. Do not read into it anything more than a  pathway to peace, discussion, and dialogue, recognizing the dignity of  all people.   I join my friends, my Jewish friends, my friends from Palestine, and  I join Americans in wanting a two-state solution.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, having participated in the restoration and reinvigoration of  the Voting Rights Act in the 2000-2008 period that was bipartisan  because there was an understanding by President Bush that the denial of  one's right to vote is a denial of human rights, I stand here today as  a Member who has joined a number of the congressional hearings. I thank  Congresswomen Sewell and Fudge and Congressmen Cohen and Nadler for the  work that has been done, and I encourage my good friend, Mr. Collins,  to be reminded of the voter suppression in his gubernatorial race that  resulted in the loss of Stacey Abrams.   And so I rise today as one who has seen the impact of voting rights,  particularly in the State of Texas, and argue vigorously for the  restoration through H.R. 4. It is a fair bill: 25-year period on a  rolling basis with current conditions, and a 10-year legitimacy for  those that pass the test.   President Johnson, during the signing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act,  said the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men and women because they are different from other men and  women.   I am a victim of voting rights suppression. I am a redistrict  district that comes from the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Barbara Jordan  would not have come to this House had it not been for the right to vote  for someone that you choose.   In 1940, only 3 percent of African Americans living in the South were  registered. Only after Barbara Jordan submitted an amendment did we  include Hispanics.    Only in the period of the horrible Shelby vote did  we have voter suppression with the voter ID law that impacted Hispanics  in Texas severely, purging language that I helped put in this present  bill and, of course, moving polling places.   If we believe in this document called the Constitution, then we  believe in H.R. 4. We want it restored because it is the right of the  people to vote.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an  original cosponsor, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4, the  Voting Rights Advancement Act, which corrects the damage done in recent  years to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and commits the national  government to protecting the right of all Americans to vote free from  discrimination and without injustices that previously prevented them  from exercising this most fundamental right of citizenship.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Terri Sewell of Alabama for  introducing this legislation, to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and  the Democratic leadership for shepherding this bill to the floor, and  to many colleagues and countless number of ordinary Americans who never  stopped agitating and working to protect the precious right to vote.   Mr. Speaker, in response to the Supreme Court's invitation in Shelby  County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), H.R. 4 provides a new coverage  formula based on ``current conditions'' and creates a new coverage  formula that hinges on a finding of repeated voting rights violations  in the preceding 25 years.   It is significant that this 25-year period is measured on a rolling  basis to keep up with ``current conditions,'' so only states and  political subdivisions that have a recent record of racial  discrimination in voting are covered.   States and political subdivisions that qualify for preclearance will  be covered for a period of 10 years, but if they have a clean record  during that time period, they can be extracted from coverage.   H.R. 4 also establishes ``practice-based preclearance,'' which would  focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect practices  that are most likely to be tainted by discriminatory intent or to have  discriminatory effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical record.   Under the bill, this process of reviewing changes in voting is  limited to a set of specific practices, including such things as:   1. Changes to the methods of elections (to or from at-large  elections) in areas that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically  diverse.   2. Redistricting in areas that are racially, ethnically, or  linguistically diverse.   3. Reducing, consolidating, or relocating polling in areas that are  racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse; and   4. Changes in documentation or requirements to vote or to register.   It is useful, Mr. Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this day.   Mr. Speaker, fifty-four years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of  heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to  vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting  rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final,  completed march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  ``demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman John  Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and local police at  the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to Montgomery in  support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever  I forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and  experience.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence  of such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev.  Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy  Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James  Foreman of the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non- Violent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert  Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson addressed the nation  before signing the Voting Rights Act:   ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.''   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African  Americans living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were  approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just  three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 there were more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   Mr. Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for  many of the approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have  been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the  state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered  harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited  greatly.   The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which  requires that states and localities with a chronic record of  discrimination in voting practices secure federal approval before  making any changes to voting processes.   Section 5 protects minority voting rights where voter discrimination  has historically been the worst.  [[Page H9320]]    Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped more than 1,000  discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107  discriminatory changes right here in Texas.   Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary leadership of President Lyndon  Johnson, the greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dramatic change in many states across  the South.   But in 1972, change was not coming fast enough or in many places in  Texas.   In fact, Texas, which had never elected a woman to Congress or an  African American to the Texas State Senate, was not covered by Section  5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the language minorities living in  South Texas were not protected at all.   But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the tireless voter  registration work performed in 1972 by Hillary Clinton in Texas, along  with hundreds of others, including her future husband Bill, Barbara  Jordan was elected to Congress, giving meaning to the promise of the  Voting Rights Act that all citizens would at long last have the right  to cast a vote for person of their community, from their community, for  their community.   Mr. Speaker, it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in Houston  that in pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to all  Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also represented  this historic 18th Congressional District of Texas, introduced, and the  Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the  Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of Section 4(a) and  Section 5 to language minorities.   During the floor debate on the 1975 reauthorization of the Voting  Rights Act, Congresswoman Jordan explained why this reform was needed:   ``There are Mexican-American people in the State of Texas who have  been denied the right to vote; who have been impeded in their efforts  to register and vote; who have not had encouragement from those  election officials because they are brown people.   ``So, the state of Texas, if we approve this measure, would be  brought within the coverage of this Act for the first time.''   When it comes to extending and protecting the precious right vote,  the Lone Star State--the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Barbara  Jordan--can be the leading state in the Union, one that sets the  example for the Nation.   But to realize that future, we must turn from and not return to the  dark days of the past.   We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge  or dilute the precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that need to  passthis legislation is urgent because the right to vote--that  ``powerful--instrument that can break down the walls of injustice''-- faces grave threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.   And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed and that is why  we must pass H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by  Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not  eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in  stymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale  disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did  eliminate them entirely.   The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another  epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still  needed to prevent another polio epidemic.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   However, officials in some states, notably Texas and North Carolina,  seemed to regard the Shelby decision as a green light and rushed to  implement election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass  muster under the Section 5 preclearance regime.   My constituents remember very well the Voter ID law passed in Texas  in 2011, which required every registered voter to present a valid  government-issued photo ID on the day of polling in order to vote.   The Justice Department blocked the law in March of 2012, and it was  Section 5 that prohibited it from going into effect.   At least it did until the Shelby decision, because on the very same  day that Shelby was decided officials in Texas announced they would  immediately implement the Photo ID law, and other election laws,  policies, and practices that could never pass muster under the Section  5 preclearance regime.   The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in federal court and the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the decision of U.S.  District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos that Texas' strict voter  identification law discriminated against blacks and Hispanics and  violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   Mr. Speaker, protecting voting rights and combating voter suppression  schemes are two of the critical challenges facing our great democracy.   Without safeguards to ensure that all citizens have equal access to  the polls, more injustices are likely to occur and the voices of  millions silenced.   I believe that Texas, the Lone Star State, can be the leading state  in the Union.   But to realize that future, we cannot return to the dark days of its  past and must remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge  or dilute the precious right to vote.   That means standing up to and calling out groups and organizations  like ``True the Vote'' and its local Houston-based affiliate, the  ``King Street Patriots,'' which in recent years have under the guise of  poll watchers, improperly interacted with persons at polling stations  in Hispanic and African American communities in an attempt to  intimidate them from voting.   The behavior of this group was so outrageous in 2010 that I reported  its conduct to the Attorney General and requested the Department of  Justice to investigate. (See Attachment, Letter from Congresswoman  Jackson Lee to U.S. Attorney General Holder (October 28, 2010)).   Mr. Speaker, in many ways Texas is ground-zero for testing and  perfecting schemes to deprive communities of color and language  minorities of the right to vote and to have their votes counted.   Consider what has transpired in Texas in recent past.   Only 68 percent of eligible voters are registered in Texas and state  restrictions on third party registration, such as the Volunteer Deputy  Registrar program, exacerbate the systemic disenfranchisement of  minority communities.   These types of programs are often aimed at minority and underserved  communities that, for many, many other reasons (like demonization by  the president, for example) or mistrust of law enforcement are afraid  to live as openly as they should.   In Harris County, we had a system where voters were getting purged  from the rolls, effectively requiring people to keep active their  registrations and hundreds of polling locations closed in Texas,  significantly more in number and percentage than any other state.   In addition, the Texas Election Code only requires a 72-hour notice  of polling location changes.   Next, take what happened here in Texas earlier this year when the  Texas Secretary of State claimed that his office had identified 95,000  possible noncitizens on the voter rolls and gave the list to the Texas  State Attorney General for possible prosecution--leading to a claim  from President Trump about widespread voter fraud and outrage from  Democrats and activist groups.   The only problem was that list was not accurate.   At least 20,000 names turned out to be there by mistake, leading to  chaos, confusion, and concern that people's eligibility vote was being  questioned based on flawed data.   The list was made through state records going back to 1996 that show  which Texas residents were not citizens when they got a driver's  license or other state ID.   But many of the person who may have had green cards or work visas at  the time they got a Texas ID are on the secretary of state's office's  list, and many have become citizens since then since nearly 50,000  people become naturalized U.S. citizens in Texas annually.   Latinos made up a big portion of the 95,000-person list.   Texas Republicans adopted racial and partisan gerrymandered  congressional, State legislative redistricting plans that federal  courts have ruled violate the Voting Rights Act and were drawn with  discriminatory intent.   Even after changes were demanded by the courts, much of the damage  done was already done.   Reversing the position by the Obama administration, the U.S.  Department of Justice has told a federal court that it no longer  believes past discrimination by Texas officials should require the  state to get outside approval for redistricting maps that will be drawn  in 2021.   In addition to affirmative ways to making it harder to vote, we also  know face other odious impediments in Texas.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll  [[Page H9321]]  taxes and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability  of seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast  their votes.   This is the harm that can be done without preclearance, so on a  federal level, there is an impetus to act.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll taxes  and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability of  seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast their  votes.   Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID:   1. African Americans: 25 percent.   2. Asian Americans: 20 percent.   3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent.   4. Young people, aged 18-24: 18 percent.   5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 percent.   And there are other ways abridging or suppressing the right to vote,  including:   1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting   2. Ending same-day registration   3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on  Election Day will not count.   4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration   5. Shortening poll hours.   6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges thus allowing  self-proclaimed ``ballot security vigilantes'' like the King Street  Patriots to cause trouble at the polls.   The malevolent practice of voter purging is not limited to Texas; we  saw it just last year in Georgia, where then Secretary of State and now  Governor Brian Kemp purged more than 53,000 persons from the voter,  nearly the exact margin of his narrow win over his opponent, Stacy  Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial election.   Voter purging is a sinister and malevolent practice visited on  voters, who are disproportionately members of communities of color, by  state and local election officials.   This practice, which would have not passed muster under section 5 of  the Voting Rights Act, has proliferated in the years since the Supreme  Court neutralized the preclearance provision, or as Justice Ginsburg  observed in Shelby County v. Holder, ``threw out the umbrella'' of  protection.   Mr. Speaker, citizens in my congressional district and elsewhere know  and have experienced the pain and heartbreak of receiving a letter from  state or local election officials that they have been removed from the  election rolls, or worse, learn this fact on Election Day.   That is why I worked so hard to secure language in the Manager's  Amendment to H.R. 4 that strengthens the bill's ``practice-based  preclearance'' provisions by adding specifically to the preclearance  provision, voting practices that add a new basis or process for  removing a name from the list of active registered voters and the  practice of reducing the days or hours of in-person voting on Sundays  during an early voting period.   Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility and sacred duty of all members  of Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect, and expand the  precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R. 4, the Voting  Rights Advancement Act.   Before concluding there is one other point I would like to stress.   In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of  1965, President Johnson said:   ``Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the doors to  the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which  await the wise use of the ballot.   ``But only the individual Negro, and all others who have been denied  the right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use  that right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice  and fulfillment.''   In other words, political power--and the justice, opportunity,  inclusion, and fulfillment it provides--comes not from the right to  vote but in the exercise of that right.   And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to both  register and vote in every election, state and local as well as  federal.   Because if we can register and vote, but fail to do so, we are guilty  of voluntary voter suppression, the most effective method of  disenfranchisement ever devised.   And in recent years, Americans have not been doing a very good job of  exercising our civic responsibility to register, vote, and make their  voices heard.   Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans, the right to vote protected  by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the  sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the  world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things.   So today, let us rededicate ourselves to honoring those who won for  us this precious right by remaining vigilant and fighting against both  the efforts of others to abridge or suppress the right to vote and our  own apathy in exercising this sacred right.    Madam Speaker, I rise to again indicate the enormity  of what we accomplished today in voting for H.R. 4.   It seems like H.R. 4 has been the center point of giving opportunity  to so many across the Nation. That is a bill to give every American one  vote, one person.   It was derailed in the Shelby case from Alabama, misguided by a 5-4  decision by the Supreme Court, ignoring the sacrifice of our colleague,  the Honorable   John Lewis, who almost died on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, brutally attacked by State and local police. That is the same  as local laws and State laws continuing into the decade to oppress  voters.   I indicated in that case, that 5-4 decision, that wrongheaded  decision, that H.R. 4 corrects, that it was as if we were getting the  best of polio and we said we no longer need the vaccine.   I have lived through the question of purging, along with my friends  from MALDEF and the NAACP legal defense fund, and I worked hard to get  language into H.R. 4 that would stop people being purged illegally off  the polls, off the rolls.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from MALDEF and a  letter from The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.                                                          MALDEF,                                  Los Angeles, CA, December 4, 2019.      Re MALDEF Urges Support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act           of 2019, H.R. 4.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: There is no right more fundamental to       our democracy than the right to vote, and for Latino voters       and other voters of color, that right is in danger. Following       the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which effectively       ended preclearance review under Section 5 of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), states and localities moved to       implement discriminatory voting practices that would       previously have been blocked by the VRA. What we have seen       post-Shelby County confirms what we have long-known--that       voter discrimination lives on. Congress must act to restore       the preclearance coverage formula in the VRA, legislation       that has long-enjoyed bipartisan support. MALDEF (Mexican       American Legal Defense and Educational Fund), the nation's       leading Latino legal civil rights organization, urges you to       support the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) of 2019,       H.R. 4, to reenact safeguards to protect minority voters from       discriminatory voting laws.        The VRA is regarded as one of the most important and       effective pieces of civil rights legislation due to its       ability to protect voters of color from discriminatory voting       practices before they take place. Since its founding, MALDEF       has focused on securing equal voting rights for Latinos, and       promoting increased civic engagement and participation within       the Latino community, as among its top priorities. MALDEF       played a significant role in securing the full protection of       the VRA for the Latino community through the 1975       congressional reauthorization of the VRA. Over its now 51-      year history, MALDEF has litigated numerous cases under       section 2, section 5, and section 203 of the VRA, challenging       at-large systems, discriminatory redistricting, ballot access       barriers, undue voter registration restrictions, and failure       to provide bilingual materials. As the growth of the Latino       population expands, our work in voting rights increases as       well.        Section 5 of the VRA required states with a history of       discrimination in voting to seek pre-approval of voting-      related changes from the U.S. Department of Justice or a       three-judge panel in Washington, DC. A voting-related change       that would have left minority voters worse off than before       the change would be blocked. The states and political       subdivisions that were required to submit voting-related       changes for preclearance were determined by a coverage       formula in section 4 of the VRA. The preclearance scheme--an       efficient and effective form of alternative dispute       resolution--prevented the implementation of voting-related       changes that would have denied voters of color a voice in our       elections, and it deterred many more restrictions from ever       being conceived. The Supreme Court in Shelby County struck       down section 4 and called on Congress to enact a new formula       better tailored to current history. As a result, currently,       states or political subdivisions are no longer required to       seek preclearance unless ordered by a federal court.        However, Chief Justice Roberts recognized in the majority       opinion in Shelby County that, ``voting discrimination still       exists; no one doubts that.'' Across the U.S., racial,       ethnic, and language-minority communities are rapidly       growing--the country's total population is projected to       become majority-minority by 2044. Many officials in states       and local jurisdictions fear losing political power, and the       rapid growth of communities of color is often seen as a       threat to existing political establishments. Fear provokes       those in positions of power to implement changes to dilute       the voting power of the perceived threatening minority       community. Unfortunately, now that states and local       jurisdictions are not required to submit voting-related       changes for review, there is no longer a well-kept track       record on newly-implemented discriminatory practices.       Nonetheless, we know, based on our litigation and analysis of       voting changes, that states and local jurisdictions are still       using discriminatory voting tactics to suppress the political       power of minority communities.        Last month, MALDEF, NALEO, and Asian Americans Advancing       Justice--AAJC released a new report, Practice-Based       Preclearance: Protecting Against Tactics Persistently Used to       Silence Minority Communities' Votes, detailing the need for       forward-looking voting rights legislation that provides       protections for emerging minority populations. During the       VRA's more than 50-year history, all racial and ethnic       populations grew, but the growth of communities of color       significantly outpaced nonHispanic whites. While there are       states and localities where communities of color have       traditionally resided in larger numbers, growing communities       of historically underrepresented voters are now emerging in       new parts of the U.S. Between 2007 and 2014, five of the ten       U.S. counties that experienced the most rapid rates of Latino       population growth were in North Dakota or South Dakota, two       states whose overall Latino populations still account for       less than ten percent of their residents and are dwarfed by       Latino communities in states like New Mexico, Texas, and       California. It is precisely this rapid growth of different       racial or ethnic populations that results in the perception       that emerging communities of color are a threat to those in       political power.        H.R. 4 includes important protections for these emerging       populations in the form of practice-based preclearance, or       ``known-practices'' coverage. Known-practices coverage would       focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect       practices that are most likely to be tainted by       discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory effects, as       demonstrated by a broad historical record. This coverage       would extend to any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is home to       a racially, ethnically, and/or linguistically diverse       population and that seeks to adopt a covered practice,       despite that practice's known likelihood of being       discriminatory when used in a diverse population. The known       practices that would be required to be pre-approved before       adopted in a diverse state or political subdivision include:       1) changes in method of election to add or replace a single-      member district with an at-large seat to a governing body, 2)       certain redistricting plans where there is significant       minority population growth in the previous decade, 3)       annexations or deannexations that would significantly alter       the composition of the jurisdiction's electorate, 4) certain       identification and proof of citizenship requirements, 5)       certain polling place closures and realignments, and 6) the       withdrawal of multilingual materials and assistance when not       matched by the reduction of those services in English. The       Practice-Based Preclearance report looked at these different       types of changes and found, based on two separate analyses of       voting discrimination, that these known practices occur with       great frequency in the modem era.        Congress must protect access to the polls and pass the       VRAA, with known-practice coverage provisions. The VRAA is a       critical piece of legislation that will restore voter       protections that were lost due to the Shelby County decision.       We cannot allow another federal election cycle to take place       without ensuring that every voter can register and cast a       meaningful ballot.

Sincerely,                                                    Andrea Senteno,      Regional Counsel.                                   ____              The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,                                                   December 4, 2019.              support h.r. 4, voting rights and advancement act         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200       national organizations committed to promoting and protecting       the civil and human rights of all persons in the United       States, and the 68 undersigned organizations, we write in       strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.       We oppose any Motion to Recommit.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) is one of the most       successful civil rights laws ever enacted. Congress passed       the VRA in direct response to evidence of significant and       pervasive discrimination across the country, including the       use of literacy tests, poll taxes, intimidation, threats, and       violence. By outlawing the tests and devices that prevented  [[Page H9339]]       people of color from voting, the VRA and its prophylactic       preclearance formula put teeth into the 15th Amendment's       guarantee that no citizen can be denied the right to vote       because of the color of their skin.        H.R. 4 has received vocal and vigorous support from the       civil rights community because it responds to the urgent need       to stop the abuses by state and local governments in the       aftermath of the Supreme Court's infamous 2013 decision in       Shelby County v. Holder, when five justices of the Supreme       Court invalidated the VRA's preclearance provision. In its       decision, the Court stated: ``Our country has changed, and       while any racial discrimination in voting is too much,       Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy       that problem speaks to current conditions.''        Since Shelby County, discriminatory policies have       proliferated nationwide and continued in areas formerly       covered by the preclearance requirement. In states, counties,       and cities across the country, public officials have pushed       through laws and policies designed to make it harder for many       communities to vote. While we have celebrated successful       legal challenges to discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and       North Carolina, such victories occurred only after elections       in those states were tainted by discrimination. Lost votes       cannot be reclaimed and discriminatory elections cannot be       undone.        But voter suppression is not merely the province of those       states with a long history of discrimination. Pernicious       practices such as voter purging and restrictive       identification requirements--which disproportionately affect       voters of color--occur in states throughout the nation.       Although progress has been made, some elected leaders in this       country are still working to silence people who were       historically denied access to the ballot box.        During the 116th Congress, the U.S. House Committee on the       Judiciary held extensive hearings and found significant       evidence that barriers to voter participation remain for       people of color and language-minority voters in African-      American, Asian American, Latinx, and Native American       communities. The hearings examined the History and       Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (March 12,       2019), Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in the State of       Texas (May 3, 2019), Continuing Challenges to the Voting       Rights Act Since Shelby County v. Holder (June 25, 2019),       Discriminatory Barriers to Voting (September 5, 2019),       Evidence of Current and Ongoing Voting Discrimination       (September 10, 2019), Congressional Authority to Protect       Voting Rights After Shelby County v. Holder (September 24,       2019), and Legislative Proposals to Strengthen the Voting       Rights Act (October 17, 2019). The Committee on House       Administration also conducted numerous hearings and amassed       significant evidence of voter suppression during the 116th       Congress.        H.R. 4 restores and modernizes the Voting Rights Act by:        Creating a new coverage formula that hinges on a finding of       repeated voting rights violations in the preceding 25 years.        Significantly, the 25-year period is measured on a rolling       basis to keep up with ``current conditions,'' so only states       and political subdivisions that have a recent record of       racial discrimination in voting are covered.        States and political subdivisions that qualify for       preclearance will be covered for a period of 10 years, but if       they establish a clean record during that time period, they       can be extracted from coverage.        Establishing ``practice-based preclearance,'' a targeted       process for reviewing voting changes in jurisdictions       nationwide focused on measures that have historically been       used to discriminate against voters of color. The process for       reviewing changes in voting is limited to a set of practices,       including:        Changes to the methods of elections (to or from at-large       elections) in areas that are racially, ethnically, or       linguistically diverse;        Reductions in language assistance;        Annexations changing jurisdictional boundaries in areas       that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse;        Redistricting in areas that are racially, ethnically, or       linguistically diverse;        Reducing, consolidating, or relocating polling locations in       areas that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically       diverse; and        Changes in documentation or requirements to vote or       register.        H.R. 4 also:        Allows a federal court to order states or jurisdictions to       be covered for results-based violations, where the effect of       a particular voting measure is racial discrimination in       voting and denying citizens their right to vote;        Increases transparency by requiring reasonable public       notice for voting changes;        Allows the attorney general authority to request the       presence of federal observers anywhere in the country where       there is a serious threat of racial discrimination in voting;       and        Revises and tailors the preliminary injunction standard for       voting rights actions to recognize that there will be cases       where there is a need for immediate preliminary relief.        For over half a century, protecting citizens from racial       discrimination in voting has been bipartisan work. The VRA       was passed with leadership from both the Republican and       Democratic parties, and the reauthorizations of the       enforcement provisions were signed into law each time by       Republican presidents: President Nixon in 1970, President       Ford in 1975, President Reagan in 1982, and President Bush       in 2006.        Voting must transcend partisanship. No matter what policy       issues we care most about, we get closer to these goals       through the ballot box. The integrity of our democracy       depends on ensuring that every eligible voter can participate       in the electoral process. Passing H.R. 4 would be a giant       step toward restoring the right to vote and undoing the       damage done by the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision.       During the civil rights movement, brave Americans gave their       lives for the right to vote, and we cannot allow their legacy       and the protections they fought for to unravel. We urge       Congress to pass this historic legislation.
