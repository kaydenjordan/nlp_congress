 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1496, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 3585 South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles,  California, as the Marvin Gaye Post Office.   As Members know, Marvin Gaye is a national treasure. I join my  colleagues in supporting this designation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4301, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 201 Tom Hall Street in Fort Mill, South Carolina, as  the J. Elliott Williams Post Office Building.   James Williams led a life of service dedicated to our country. He  served 20 years in the U.S. Navy and in both the Korean and Vietnam  wars.   In addition to receiving every sea service award for heroism, James  was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon Johnson in 1968.   After retiring from the military, James served as a U.S. marshal for  20 years.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor James Williams'  lifelong service to his country. I urge the passage of H.R. 4301, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my legislation would designate the U.S. Postal Service  facility at 108 West Schick Road in Bloomingdale, Illinois, as the  Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office Building in recognition of  all the men and women who have served our Nation with distinction and  honor.   I would like to thank Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings for  their help in moving this bill through the committee, as well as  Majority Leader McCarthy for helping to secure floor time for  consideration.   This is merely a step, one step, to help citizens in Bloomingdale and  every part of my district recognize the sacrifices and celebrate the  contributions of our friends, families, and neighbors who chose a life  of service to the people of the United States.   Veterans in every community deserve our thanks and gratitude. The  Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office will serve as a living  reminder of the service of every soldier, sailor, coastguardsman,  airman, and marine, whose sacrifices helped keep Americans safe. It is  my hope that this small daily reminder will help us all to remember  that we can and must do more to support our veterans, from those just  returning home to those who fought long ago and still bear the scars of  their service.   Mr. Speaker, we all agree that our Nation's veterans continue to face  serious challenges. Today, an estimated 39,471 veterans are homeless,  and the number of young veterans struggling with homelessness is  increasing. In my home State of Illinois alone, 193 veterans took their  own life in 1 year, a rate more than twice as high as the nonveteran  population of Illinois.   Veterans are more likely to struggle with PTSD as well as substance  abuse disorders than nonveterans. It is clear that we are failing those  who never failed us. We have a solemn obligation to eliminate veteran  homelessness, to improve access to essential health services, and  ensure veterans are able to transition to the civilian workforce and  secure family-sustaining jobs.   We need to prioritize mental health support and substance use  prevention, and we need to exercise strong oversight over the VA to  ensure that no veteran is ever denied medical care or support services.   For the men and women who have protected my own American Dream, I  hope to make theirs easier to achieve. We must all do more to recognize  those willing to give what Lincoln called ``the last full measure of  devotion'' to their country.   It is my hope that the new Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office  Building will foster both gratitude and understanding in our community,  and I urge every Member to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman  Russell for those eloquent words and thank him for his service to our  country as a veteran, as well, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R.  4574, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4722, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 111 Market Street as Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office  Building.   For two decades, Maurice Hinchey served in this Chamber representing  New York's 22nd Congressional District after beginning his political  career 4 years earlier as a State assemblyman. Representative Hinchey  was a strong advocate for the environment, conducting an investigation  into the Love Canal toxic waste site in New York and leading the charge  that passed the Nation's first regulations related to acid rain.   Throughout his career, he fought for the preservation of the Hudson  River, and worked to better the lives of his constituents through his  focus on agriculture, economic development, and veterans' issues.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the contributions  Maurice Hinchey made to this House and to the lives of those he  represented here. I urge the passage of H.R. 4722, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge  the passage of H.R. 4722, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4840, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 567 East Franklin Street in Oviedo, Florida, as the  ``Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe Post Office Building''.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Murphy) so that she may tell us more about Sergeant  First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I  strongly urge the passage of H.R. 4840, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
