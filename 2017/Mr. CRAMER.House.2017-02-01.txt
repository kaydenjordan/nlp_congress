 Madam Speaker, North Dakota does not need the stream  protection rule and neither does the Nation. By passing this resolution  today disapproving the Office of Surface Mining edict, we are  responding to the cries of the American people who are tired of  nationwide job-killing regulations from Washington.   Madam Speaker, the Obama administration took nearly an entire term  and over 10 million taxpayer dollars developing this job killer  designed to prevent billions of dollars of coal reserves from ever  being developed with absolutely no environmental benefit.   Today's action prevents further destruction of jobs and low-cost  energy for the American people.   I urge the Senate to swiftly send this resolution to the President's  desk.                            ____________________
