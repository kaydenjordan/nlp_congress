 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in support of our  unions, including the 150,000 United Auto Workers nationwide and our  Local 2250 in Missouri's First District.   Autoworkers have built a quarter of a trillion dollars in profits for  the Big Three--for Ford, for GM, for Stellantis--in the past decade,  including $21 billion in the first 6 months of 2023. Yet, workers are  currently making 10 percent less in wages, real wages, than they made  last year.   Our workers deserve fair wages. Our workers deserve better benefits  and safe working conditions. They deserve to be rewarded for the  sacrifices that they made and the profits that they have built.   To UAW Local 2250, know that I have your back. I am proud to have  delivered $1.5 million in community project funding for the creation of  a premier automotive repair training center in St. Louis, and I am  proud to keep up the fight right here in Congress to pass and to  finally enact the PRO Act. Our work continues.                            ____________________
