 Madam President, I rise today to commend Julius ``Julie''  P. Knapp for his service to our Nation during the past 45 years. Mr.  Knapp retires this month from his position as the FCC's Chief of the  Office of Engineering and Technology, OET, where he helped usher in the  modern age of communications and was instrumental in making spectrum  available to fuel our Nation's economic growth in this area. If you are  accessing a mobile device right now, using Wi-Fi, or buying the latest  wireless gadget, you are likely benefiting from Julie Knapp's work.   Mr. Knapp is well known and respected here in Congress for his  technically precise and straightforward testimony at countless  hearings. Mr. Knapp is a world-recognized expert in communications and  is widely viewed as a leader on technical policy issues because of his  expertise, his pragmatic and fair approach, and his ability to  ``translate'' complex engineering issues to policymakers on all sides  of an issue. He has briefed generations of congressional staffers on  the intricacies of spectrum management and provided significant and  substantial input on spectrum legislation. Many Members of this body  have discussed communications industry developments with Julie,  including low power FM, wireless and satellite issues, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi,  and 5G, among others.   When the public looks at Julie Knapp's career, we can see a parallel  to the timeline of America's communications industry's growth. He  graduated from high school in New Hyde, NY, in 1969, and he received  his engineering degree from the City College of New York in 1974. Less  than a month later, he went right to work for the American people. He  rose through the ranks at the FCC, beginning as a 22-year-old  certifying radio frequency devices and growing into a seasoned  professional in the increasingly important equipment authorization  branch. He became Chief of the FCC laboratory, Chief of the Policy and  Rules Division for OET, and finally Chief of OET, where he has served  with extraordinary distinction since 2006.   Mr. Knapp's outstanding work has brought him numerous awards and  accolades within the government and in the engineering community. In  2012, he received one of the highest honors for a civil servant, the  Presidential Distinguished Rank Award. He also has received the FCC's  Gold and Silver Awards and the Eugene C. Bowler Award for exceptional  professionalism and dedication to public service.   Mr. Knapp has served the United States through multiple  administrations, never asking for more than the opportunity to make a  difference--and along the way, making a lasting, positive impact. He  epitomizes the concept of civil service. We all owe Julie Knapp a debt  of gratitude and our sincerest thanks for dedicating his life to  building America's communications systems and making these services  universally available to all of us and for doing so with grace and  humility.                            ____________________
