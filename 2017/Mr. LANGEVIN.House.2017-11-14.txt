 Mr. Speaker, I would first like to begin by thanking  Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith and Chairwoman Stefanik  for their tireless work on this bill. It is a good work product, and I  am very proud to be associated with it and be supporting it.   I would also like to thank the Armed Services Committee staff for  their contributions for another successful and bipartisan NDAA, in  particular, Lindsay, Pete, Kevin, and Neve. I want to recognize Kathryn  Mitchell, my MLA on my staff, along with my two fellows, Sean and John,  for their contributions and support during the time we put together  this mark.   I am extremely pleased with the Emerging Threats and Capabilities  portion of the NDAA. I want to congratulate Chairwoman Stefanik. This  is her first NDAA as chairwoman, and it was a pleasure working with her  in a strong bipartisan way.   The conference agreement preserves important steps forward when it  comes to cyber, information operations, and advanced technologies, and  it provides support to our special operators and their families.   When it comes to cyber, the bill requires the Department of Defense  to conduct a cyber posture review to ensure we have appropriate  authorities and policies in place to allow our forces to operate  successfully in cyberspace.                                time  1415    It also reinvigorates the DOD's cyber scholarship program, which  provides scholarships and grant opportunities at colleges and  universities to boost the Nation's cyber forces and to bring their  expertise into the Department after they graduate.   Additionally, the finalized language includes a provision that I  wrote in conjunction with Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith,  and Chairwoman Stefanik to require timely notifications for sensitive  cyber military operations outside areas of active hostilities, ensuring  Congress is able to conduct appropriate oversight in this new domain.  [[Page H9203]]    The bill makes important investments in advanced technologies that  will be game changers for our warfighters, such as the electromagnetic  railgun. We never want to send our servicemembers into a fair fight,  and transitioning critical technologies like these will ensure that we  avoid the valley of death and provide them with the very best tools  that are available.   Finally, I am very pleased with the final conference report  preserving my amendment expressing the sense of Congress that climate  change is a national security challenge and requiring the department to  report its effects.   This important bipartisan provision represents one of the most  significant legislative actions Congress has taken on this issue, and  this shift in policy will better prepare our Armed Forces, ensure  mission resiliency, and improve our readiness to face the changing  climate.   Again, I want to thank the Armed Services Committee for their  excellent work on this critical bill, particularly Chairman Thornberry,  Ranking Member Smith, Chairwoman Stefanik, and, again, all the members  of both the committee staff and my staff as well. It was a pleasure  working on this very bipartisan bill in support of all of our  warfighters, who we want to make sure that we provide the very best  tools that they need to do their job safely and effectively. I thank  them for all that they do for our Nation.
