 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2062, the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.   Every worker--every worker--including older Americans should have the  law on their side to protect them from workplace discrimination. The  good news is that existing Federal statutes already prohibit workplace  discrimination.   Despite what Democrats might have you believe, Mr. Speaker, there are  a number of laws protecting Americans of all ages against  discrimination in the workplace. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRA; the  Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, ADEA; the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, Rehab Act; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of  1990, ADA, make employment discrimination based on an individual's  race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability  unlawful.   My Republican colleagues and I appreciate the stated purpose behind  H.R. 2062. Age discrimination is wrong, but the bill before us today is  fundamentally flawed and a classic example of a solution in search of a  problem.   Age discrimination in the workplace is already illegal. Mr. Speaker,  I am going to say that over and over and over today. Age discrimination  in the workplace is already illegal.   There is no evidence indicating this bill is necessary. The  committee's cursory examination of the bill earlier this year failed to  uncover any suggestion that workers have been discouraged from filing  discrimination or retaliation charges with the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, EEOC, the primary agency that enforces Federal  laws that make it illegal to discriminate.   Over the last couple of decades, rates of age discrimination charges,  a signed statement asserting employment discrimination, filed with the  EEOC have remained steady. Additionally, the available data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics show unemployment trends for older workers  are heading in a positive direction.   In 2018, older Americans earned 7 percent more than the median for  all workers, a large increase from 20 years ago. For workers age 65 and  older, employment tripled from 1988 to 2018, while employment among  younger workers grew by about one-third. Likewise, over the past 20  years, the number of older workers on full-time work schedules grew  2\1/2\ times faster than the number working part-time.   The legislation we are debating today is another sweeping one-size- fits-all scheme. This ill-advised bill rewards Democrats' favored  political friends, disregards real-world workplace experience, and  rejects decades of Supreme Court precedent.   Our Nation's uncertain economic times demand pro-growth and pro- worker policies, but House Democrats would rather consider misguided  proposals such as H.R. 2062. The Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act stifles job creation and harms small businesses and  aging workers at a time when our languishing post-pandemic economy most  needs their contributions.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation enriches trial lawyers, not plaintiffs.  H.R. 2062 overturns Supreme Court precedent by allowing the plaintiffs  to argue that age was only a motivating, not decisive, factor that led  to an employer's unfavorable employment action. It allows these kinds  of mixed-motive claims across four completely different  nondiscrimination laws.   H.R. 2062 also allows mixed-motive claims where the plaintiff alleges  the employer has taken action against a plaintiff because of a prior  complaint of discrimination. Allowing mixed-motive claims in cases  alleging retaliation puts employers in the impossible position of  trying to prove that a legitimate employment decision was not in  response to a prior complaint.   The only party that will be paid in nearly all mixed-motive cases is  the plaintiff's attorneys. We know this will happen because, under the  legislation, employers will be able to demonstrate that they would have  taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating  factors.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, older Americans, the very people this  legislation is purported to help, will in the vast majority of cases  receive no monetary damages or other redress under H.R. 2062.   H.R. 2062 also increases frivolous legal claims against business  owners. Job creators will spend valuable time and resources battling  these undeserving claims, as the Supreme Court pointed out in the 2013  Nassar case. These same resources could be better used to prevent  workplace harassment and discrimination.   When H.R. 2062 was considered by the Education and Labor Committee,  Republicans offered amendments to address fundamental flaws in H.R.  2062.   We offered an amendment to strike the ill-advised and unworkable  provisions allowing for mixed-motive retaliation claims.   We proposed collecting data and evidence to understand how age  discrimination and retaliation charges and lawsuits have changed  because of Supreme Court rulings.   We attempted to make sure the public understands that even successful  plaintiffs under the bill will likely not receive any monetary damages  while their lawyers will be paid.   We proposed a noncontroversial clarification to maintain protections  for workers with disabilities.   And we tried to clarify the evidentiary standard for proving a claim  under the bill.                                time  1500    Unfortunately, our commonsense amendments were defeated by Democrats  along party lines.   Mr. Speaker, all workers should be protected from workplace  discrimination, and they already are under current law.   H.R. 2062 is a distraction from the real problems plaguing our  Nation, like the crisis at the border, over 9 million jobs begging for  qualified workers, unaffordable college costs, and runaway economic  inflation.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2062, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our colleagues on the other side say that workers feel  they have been discriminated against. Well, we all have feelings and  perceptions that are not accurate. I think my colleague from Illinois  pointed out that the data simply does not support the feelings of many  people, and I think we understand that in day-to-day life.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle also contend that the  2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services has  weakened age discrimination protections. They also contend this  decision has deterred workers from seeking relief from age bias. But  let's look at the data; let's not go on feelings.   In the 11 years preceding the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross,  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, the primary agency  that enforces Federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate,  received an average of 18,548 charges of discrimination per year  related to age discrimination. An EEOC charge is a signed statement  asserting employment discrimination. Now, in the 11 years following  Gross, the EEOC received an average of 19,783 charges per year relating  to age discrimination, a slight increase from the previous 11 years.   So, it is obvious from EEOC data that there is clearly no evidence  workers have been discouraged from filing age discrimination charges  with the agency since the 2009 Supreme Court decision. And we had a  Democrat administration during that time and 1 year of a Republican  administration.   We also find that age discrimination charges as a percentage of all  charges  [[Page H3056]]  filed with EEOC are approximately the same for the 11 years before and  after the Gross decision, 22.4 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively.  Again, this does not indicate workers are somehow discouraged from  filing age discrimination charges.   Congress should make fact-based decisions, Mr. Speaker, and in this  case, the facts do not support feelings or the assertions made by the  proponents of H.R. 2062.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats claim H.R. 2062 merely conforms age  discrimination and retaliation claims with current law regarding mixed- motive discrimination claims under title VII of the Civil Rights Act.   However, Congress specifically drafted the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act, ADEA, to be different from title VII, because age is  uniquely different from the characteristics on which title VII  prohibits discrimination, namely, race, color, religion, sex, or  national origin.   The ADEA states that it is lawful for an employer to take an  employment action otherwise prohibited by the statute if the  differential treatment is ``based on reasonable factors other than  age.''   Notably, this provision is not found in title VII.   The Supreme Court has also explained in several cases why age  discrimination differs from other forms of discrimination.   For example, the Supreme Court, in Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power  Laboratory, in 2008, wrote that, ``Congress took account of the  distinctive nature of age discrimination and the need to preserve a  fair degree of leeway for employment decisions with effects that  correlate with age.''   In addition, the Supreme Court, in the 2013 Nassar case, explained  why a mixed-motive standard is ill-suited for retaliation claims.   The Supreme Court observed that with regard to mixed-motive standards  in retaliation cases, ``lessening the causation standard could  contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, which would siphon  resources from efforts by employers, administrative agencies, and  courts to combat workplace harassment.''   Allowing mixed-motive claims in age and retaliation cases, which H.R.  2062 does, will lead to more frivolous legislation.   We should heed congressional and Supreme Court precedents and vote  down H.R. 2062.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to repeat: Republicans hate discrimination in  any form. We particularly do not want any kind of discrimination in the  workplace, and we do not want discrimination against older workers.   We know that older workers were excelling in the pre-pandemic  economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, employment  for workers age 65 and older tripled from 1988 to 2018, while  employment for younger workers grew by only a third.   The number of employed people age 75 and older nearly quadrupled from  461,000 in 1988 to 1.8 million in 2018.   As the country continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, BLS  recently reported that job openings reached a record high of 9.3  million in April 2021, while hiring lags far behind.  [[Page H3058]]    Employers are desperate to fill good-paying jobs, but qualified  workers are hard to find because of Democrat-enacted policies.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to paint a  bleak picture of job opportunities for older Americans, when, in fact,  employment trends for older workers have been positive in recent  decades and will continue to improve as the country fully reopens  following the pandemic.   According to BLS, in 1998, the median weekly earnings of older, full- time employees was 77 percent of the median for workers 16 and up. In  2018, older workers earned 7 percent more than the median for all  workers.   The labor force participation rate for older Americans has been  rising steadily since the late 1990s. Participation rates for younger  age groups either declined or flattened over this period.   Over the past 20 years, the number of older workers on full-time work  schedules grew 2\1/2\ times faster than the number working part time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, older Americans make vital contributions in the  workplace. Committee Republicans are committed to eliminating  discrimination in the workplace, rebuilding our sluggish economy, and  producing a competitive workforce.   Unfortunately, H.R. 2062 is a destructive and misleading bill that  does not protect older workers, and it rewards trial lawyers at the  expense of sound public policy. It is Democrats promising deliverance,  but delivering disappointment.   This sweeping one-size-fits-all ruse is not the answer, unless  Congress decides it wants to benefit trial lawyers at the expense of  older American workers.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  H.R. 2062, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Democrat amendments.   As I understand it, Representative Brown's amendment requires the  EEOC chair to submit five annual reports to Congress on the number of  age discrimination claims brought to the EEOC under this act. If H.R.  2062 somehow gets signed into law, these reports will be a day late and  many dollars short because the law will have already harmfully reduced  the burden of proof in these cases and nullified decades of Supreme  Court precedent.   Before discussing my concerns with this amendment, I admit I am  puzzled that it requires a study on how this legislation will affect  future age discrimination claims when evidence is sorely lacking that  there is a need for H.R. 2062 in the first place.   A witness who testified on H.R. 2062 before the Committee on  Education and Labor acknowledged that EEOC data has not shown workers  are discouraged from filing age discrimination charges with the EEOC  following the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Gross v. FBL Financial  Services.   With respect to this amendment, I have concerns about the feasibility  and viability of the mandated reports. The amendment requires the EEOC  to report each year for 5 years on charges filed with the agency under  H.R. 2062.   H.R. 2062 drastically expands liability by allowing mixed motive  claims in cases involving the Age Discrimination in Employment Act-- ADEA--and three other statutes. However, when workers file charges with  the EEOC, the worker will likely not indicate whether the charge  involves mixed motives, nor is EEOC likely to be able to classify  charges as being mixed motive or not. EEOC will therefore be unable to  determine whether charges have been filed pursuant to H.R. 2062.   I am very doubtful EEOC would be able to comply with this amendment's  requirements, and Congress should not include an unworkable mandate on  an agency. Congress has enacted significant laws prohibiting employment  discrimination, including the ADEA, the Americans with Disabilities  Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil Rights Act, CRA.   Congress purposefully enacted separate nondiscrimination statutes,  including the ADEA, because age discrimination involves unique and  complex factors, as do the other forms of discrimination addressed in  these statutes.   H.R. 2062 overturns Supreme Court precedent, allows a plaintiff to  argue that age was only a motivating but not decisive factor that led  to an employer's unfavorable employment action. Allowing such mixed  motive claims will eliminate the carefully balanced standard Congress  adopted when it passed the ADEA, resulting in more frivolous lawsuits.   Here's why: Under H.R. 2062, a plaintiff is very unlikely to receive  any  [[Page H3061]]  monetary award from the defendant because most employers will be able  to demonstrate they would have taken the same employment action  regardless of the worker's age or other impermissible reasons.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, Representative Williams' amendment  requires EEOC to submit a contrived and convoluted report to Congress  analyzing disparities that individuals face in pursuing relief under  the mixed-motive evidentiary standard. The report must examine age  discrimination combined with discrimination based on race, color,  religion, sex, national origin, or disability.   This amendment does nothing to address the fatal flaws in the bill  that would allow mixed-motive claims in age retaliation and disability  cases, which will increase frivolous litigation while not providing any  monetary damages for nearly all plaintiffs.   As a practical matter, I question whether EEOC will be able to  complete the tortuous analysis proposed in the amendment.   As I noted previously, workers filing discrimination or retaliation  charges with EEOC do not indicate whether they involve a mixed-motive  claim, and EEOC does not collect this data. A mixed-motive claim is  something a plaintiff's attorney adds to a lawsuit.   As such, I am skeptical whether EEOC will be able to find any data  relating to mixed-motive claims.   More importantly, the amendment, which was submitted and then amended  after the Rules Committee's stated deadline, will not fix the bill's  many shortcomings, such as allowing mixed-motive claims in age  discrimination and retaliation cases, even though congressional and  Supreme Court precedents strongly advise against these changes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendments en bloc, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the only parties who will win in nearly all  cases under H.R. 2062 with these amendments, if they are passed, are  trial lawyers. Unfortunately, Democrats have chosen to further their  pro-trial lawyer agenda by putting forward H.R. 2062, legislation that  masquerades as protection for workers.   H.R. 2062 is yet another one-size-fits-all approach that fails to  address the purported problem, neglects real-world experiences, and  disregards decades of Supreme Court precedent.   These poorly drafted fig leaf amendments in the en bloc do nothing to  address the fundamental flaws in H.R. 2062 and place an unworkable  mandate on EEOC. I urge my colleagues to oppose them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle that there was a higher percentage of Republicans who  voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act than Democrats, a higher percentage  of Republicans voted for the ADEA, the Age Discrimination in Employment  Act, and under  [[Page H3064]]  the ADA. It was President Bush who signed that bill.   So Republicans have a pretty good record on promoting and protecting  the civil rights of Americans in this country, all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, for an employer to retaliate against an employee because  that employee has previously made a discrimination complaint is wrong  and it is already illegal.   H.R. 2062 reduces the standard of proof in retaliation cases by  allowing mixed-motive claims, overturning the Supreme Court's 2013  decision in the Nassar case.   Allowing mixed-motive claims in retaliation cases is unworkable and  contrary to the text, structure, and history of title VII, the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act and the Americans with Disabilities  Act.   Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion in Nassar that  in retaliation cases, ``lessening the causation standard could  contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, which would siphon  resources from efforts by employers, administrative agencies, and  courts to combat workplace harassment.''   Justice Kennedy also wrote in his opinion that the concern about  diverting resources was especially true because retaliation charges  filed with the EEOC had nearly doubled in the past 15 years and had  become the second most frequently filed category of complaint.   This concern is even more relevant today because retaliation is now  the most frequently filed EEOC charge. All retaliation claims are  inherently about differing explanations.   In these situations, the plaintiff has already made a discrimination  complaint, and under the mixed-motive standard required under H.R.  2062, it will be a mere formality to plead that any subsequent negative  action by the employer related to the employee was retaliatory.   Under H.R. 2062, a plaintiff claiming retaliation will always survive  the summary judgment stage of the litigation and the case will either  settle or go to trial. This will increase the number of frivolous  claims against unsuspecting business owners and impose related  financial costs noted in the Supreme Court decision, thus limiting  important resources that could otherwise be used to combat  discrimination.   Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the claim that employees  have been harmed by the Nassar decision.   And, by the way, when employees win lawsuits claiming retaliation  under the current standard, they can receive monetary damages, back  pay, and reinstatement, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. Under  H.R. 2062, this won't happen in nearly all of the cases. Only the trial  lawyers will be paid.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment strikes the harmful, overly broad, and  unworkable provision in H.R. 2062, which allows mixed-motive claims in  retaliation cases.   The amendment protects the current standard of proof as described in  the Nassar case, and I urge Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  amendments en bloc containing Representatives Allen's and Foxx's  amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
