 Madam Speaker, the coronavirus is not a  hoax. There are over 90,000 cases worldwide and over 3,000 deaths.   In the U.S., based on various reporting, we think there are over 100  cases, with at least nine deaths.   Criticism of the Trump administration's botched response to this  outbreak is not a hoax. They had faulty initial tests. They then  compounded that problem by having overly restrictive test criteria that  artificially deflated the number of actual coronavirus cases. And we  don't have enough test kits, as of today.   In L.A. County, where I am from, they recently declared a state of  emergency. L.A. County has a total of one coronavirus test kit.   I am pleased that this week the House of Representatives will pass a  supplemental funding package to make sure we have enough test kits for  all the jurisdictions that need it.   We need this administration to stop misleading the American people  and start leading. Lives are at stake.                            ____________________
