 Mr. Speaker, as the House recesses, I want to call  Members' attention to something I hope they will consider over the  recess, this year's record attacks in the form of riders or  undemocratic additions to the D.C. appropriation and how that makes the  best case for statehood for the District of Columbia.   I need to report to the House the remarkable progress we are making  on D.C. statehood.   We are closing in on 100 percent of Democratic House Members as  cosponsors of the D.C. statehood bill. In the Senate, where the  District has no representation, we have more than half of the  Democratic Senators. Before this session is over, we are striving for  100 percent, certainly, of Democrats in the House and even in the  Senate as we go over to the Senate to also make the case without having  any representation there. That is why I am so grateful to the Senators  who have understood the importance of equality for the 700,000-- equality of citizenship, I should say--for the 700,000 American  citizens who live in the Nation's Capital.   In the face of that good news on statehood, you would think that  there would be applause from the Congress, who sits in the home  district of the District of Columbia. But recently, there have been a  spate of undemocratic riders, that is, attempts to amend the District's  appropriation.   What is the District's appropriation doing here?   That is the nub of the problem. It shouldn't be here.   When I first came to Congress, there were actually hearings held on  the D.C. appropriation, but I have been able to make sure that that  doesn't happen. Indeed, Congress has no interest in the D.C.  appropriation because it is a local budget with funds from only local  residents. Not a penny of it is raised in this Congress.   To be sure, we are entitled to some funds from the Congress, just  like the States. But we are not talking about those funds. We are  talking about the local D.C. budget passing through the House and the  Senate for no other purpose except to see if somebody in either of  those two bodies wants to insert undemocratic amendments, using the DC  budget as the vehicle to do it. There are a number of ways to keep that  from happening short of statehood, but statehood would be the end of  it.   I can't decide anything about New York's budget because it is New  York's budget and it doesn't have to come here. In the same way, the  local budget for the District of Columbia has no business here.   It must be that Members who attempt these additions to our  appropriation don't have enough to show to their own constituents for  what they have accomplished during this Congress, so they look around  for something to say, ``I passed this.''   Well, let me be clear. I have been able to keep most of these riders  from passing, so I don't know why they keep trying. But as long as they  keep trying, they have got someone standing in the doorway of the House  to keep these antidemocratic amendments not approved by the residents  of the District of Columbia but having everything to do with the  District of Columbia from, indeed, passing.   And remember, this Member has a vote in committee, which may be the  most important vote any Member can have. That is how I have gotten  things accomplished for the District of Columbia. As it turns out, by  the time a matter comes to the floor, the deal is done.   But I draw your attention to the fact that I do not have the final  vote on the House floor, and yet the D.C. budget is voted on the House  floor.   I do not have a vote on the House floor, although the people I  represent are number one, per capita, in Federal taxes paid to support  the United States of America. If anybody deserves a vote on this House  floor, it is the residents of the District of Columbia who deserve that  vote.   Here is another reason why the residents of the District of Columbia  deserve statehood or, at the very least, a vote in the House of  Representatives, the people's House: The budget of the District of  Columbia is larger than the budget of 12 States; the District of  Columbia has more residents than two States.   Here is the District of Columbia, here is Vermont, and here is  Wyoming. Each has two Senators, but not the District of Columbia. Yet  the District of Columbia has more residents than Vermont and more  residents than Wyoming. You begin to see how the inequality comes up  just in population.   The District has a budget surplus. It is almost $2 billion. That is  the envy of most States, that kind of large surplus, because a surplus  means that you are not spending all your money. You are putting money  aside, which is what, of course, is encouraged for all the States, but  very few States have this kind of surplus.   We are not talking about a big poor city. The per capita personal  income of the District of Columbia is higher than the per capita income  of the residents of any State. Its total personal income is higher than  that of seven States. Its per capita personal consumption expenditures  are higher than those of any State.   Yet, each year, I have to fight abuses of home rule, as we call it,  or self-government for the District of Columbia, using the fact that  this budget has to pass through here in order for the District of  Columbia to use its own budget.   Members rush to press what we call riders--I have indicated  amendments--to our local budget. There have been about four attempts to  repeal the Local Budget Autonomy Act. The District passed a Budget  Autonomy Act. The House repealed it; the Senate did not.   The only quarrel we have with that is, although we have a Budget  Autonomy Act, the House and the Senate continue to appropriate the  District's budget after it has already been appropriated by the  District of Columbia government. Nothing has ever been so redundant as  the congressional appropriation, or shall we call it reappropriation,  of the District's local budget.    There is the annual repeal--and I say ``annual repeal'' because I  have been able to keep it from being repealed altogether--of the so- called Death with Dignity Act. This is a controversial piece of  legislation, but eight States have this same legislation which allows a  doctor to give a pharmaceutical to somebody who asks for it, has 6  months to live and is in great pain.  [[Page H7714]]    It is interesting to note that in the District of Columbia and in the  States that have the so-called Death with Dignity Act, most people who  have this pharmaceutical that allows them to end their own lives do not  use it. Obviously, they are only looking for a peaceful way to die, and  most of them decide to die without taking their own lives.   If such a law exists in eight States, there is no reason why it  shouldn't also exist in the District of Columbia. I have been able to  keep that law from being repealed, and I will do it again.   There is a third bill that, again, is annually repealed. It is called  the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act.    Why would anybody want to repeal an act that simply says to an  employer that you cannot penalize an employee for the form of birth  control that an employee uses? In the first place, most employers  shouldn't even know that private information.   The District passed such a law, the House repeals it, and I am able  to keep it from being repealed in the final bill every single time. But  it gives some sense of how Members scramble for bills they don't want  in their districts, but since it was passed in mine and since they can  abuse their own congressional power, they simply decide to do so.   They have not been able to repeal it, but I believe, if the polls are  correct, the Democrats will recapture the House, and then I believe I  will be able to dispose of these issues as well. Again, these are  controversial, but other States have these same laws.   There is a perennial amendment to keep the District from spending its  own local funds on abortions for poor women. Seventeen States do that,  no Federal funds. What other States are doing, the District should be  able to do for our American citizens.   Another, of course, is recreational marijuana. This is another matter  that has been passed by almost 9 States and DC. Essentially, these  States legalized small amounts of marijuana. In the District, it is 2  ounces.                                time  1300    The House stumbled to try to repeal the District's marijuana law. It  was unsuccessful, so the District still has legal marijuana up to 2  ounces.   However, it can't regulate marijuana, and it can't monetize it. If  you go to the States that have legal marijuana, they sell it, they tax  it. There is no reason why the District of Columbia shouldn't be able  to do the same thing.   This year, there are some additional riders. Representative Gary  Palmer, a Republican from Alabama, needs to mind his own business.  Instead, he has filed amendments to keep the District from using its  local funds to pass something that you would think would not even come  to his attention. It is an initiative that would raise the minimum wage  so that everybody in the District of Columbia earns the same minimum  wage and so that so-called tipped workers do not live on tips alone but  on a basic wage in addition to whatever tips they get.   The industry doesn't like this, but if you are a tipped worker, you  may well like it. Actually, it didn't pass overwhelmingly, but it  passed in the District. The District Council does have the right to  overturn a referendum or an initiative. It may overturn this on its  own, but here comes Congress rushing in to overturn the Tip Minimum  Wage Act.   I had to chuckle at another amendment that was filed, I think also by  Mr. Palmer, who definitely needs more work to do because he keeps  meddling in our business. This rider goes after the District's bill  that mandates health insurance.   What this is about is Republican Members smarting at the notion that  they have not been able to overturn the Affordable Care Act. They have  not been able to do that here either. It turns out that the Affordable  Care Act is, I believe, the most popular piece of recent legislation on  the books today. It has gotten more and more popular the more the House  and the Senate have tried to cripple it.   Local jurisdictions have their own version, and the District says,  yes, you must have health insurance.   Why do they say people must have health insurance? Why did the  Affordable Care Act say that? It is the basic law of insurance. If you  spread the risk and spread the cost, then, of course, everybody's  insurance costs less. So it is the ABCs of insurance. That is why you  have jurisdictions continuing to mandate what the Affordable Care Act  did.   It is interesting to note that the Senate is not going home for the  August recess, and the reason it is not going home is it is trying to  get through a new addition to the Supreme Court.   By the way, that proposed member is Brett Kavanaugh, who happens to  sit on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. As it turns  out, the Democrats in the Senate have one-upped this decision to stay  for the August recess because the Democrats are using that time to  speak and to press the Affordable Care Act, which is so popular and  will help them, I am sure, in the November elections.   Madam Speaker, may I ask what my remaining time is.    Madam Speaker, it doesn't stop in the House. It goes over  to the Senate.   But one of the reasons I have been able to get these antidemocratic  riders off is that the Senate has helped me even though the Senate is  controlled by Republicans, not Democrats. And the reason I think the  Senate has been more open is that, unlike the polarized House--and,  sure, the Senate is polarized as well--the Senate, by its very nature,  represents a broader cross-section of the American people and, thus,  represent Republicans and Democrats and has to think about how far it  wants to go with making itself a target by trying to overturn somebody  else's legislation. So we are able to get most of these antidemocratic  riders off there.   I note that Senator Ted Cruz also needs to devote more attention to  his own constituents from Texas because, in the Senate, he is trying to  do what Representative Palmer is doing: to get rid of the District's  healthcare mandate.   Again, Senator Cruz represents a large State. He is not doing his  best for them as long as he is meddling in the business of another  city, another jurisdiction, the District of Columbia.   It is the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to spend so much time  trying to overturn the laws of the District of Columbia because local  control is a core belief of Republicans in the House and the Senate. We  are going to hold them to that core belief when it comes to matters  affecting the District of Columbia.   Meddling in the business of the District of Columbia can and has cost  the District of Columbia actual dollars. The District of Columbia just  had another bond market report and an upgrade of its rating by one of  them to AAA. Yet one of the bond markets, Standard & Poor's, said:  ``[W]e continue to have concerns about the role of the federal  government in future District budgets. We view this as an ongoing . . .  factor that has a negative effect on the District's finances and as a  slight offset to the District's otherwise very strong management  practices . . .''   What S&P is saying is, essentially, there is an unknown here. There  is an actor. It is the Congress of the United States meddling in the  business of the District of Columbia. So it is hard to judge the  District of Columbia as long as somebody can come from left or right  field and try to change parts of its business.   Essentially, what you have is S&P and other bond markets calling for  Congress to let the District be the District so it can be judged by  what the District alone does. Look at what they say when the bond  markets look at what the District alone does. Look at what the bond  markets say.   Let's look at Moody's, who has just given the District a AAA rating,  given its bonds a AAA rating: ``The dynamism of the District's economy  has led to the largest population in 40 years and strong growth in the  tax base. Financial governance is exemplary. Reserves are robust . .  .''   I want to ask Members of this body how many of you have had reports  like that on your own jurisdiction.   Moody's goes on to say: ``The District of Columbia, the nation's  capital, is  [[Page H7715]]  small but wealthy. Its population would rank 48th among States . . .''  That is what you see with this graph. [B]ut its per capita income is  higher. I repeat, the District's ``per capita income is higher than all  50 States, and its GDP is greater than 17 States.''   What more do you want from the District of Columbia when you get that  kind of objective report on its finances?   The fact is that only eight big cities--the District of Columbia and  seven others--have AAA bond ratings. Only 22 of the States have AAA  bond ratings.   Again, I repeat, what more do you want from us when we have excelled,  outdone the great cities of the United States, outdone most of the  States in our fiscal prudence? Such an outsized performance, if  anything, should encourage the Congress to, at the very least,  recognize the District's budget autonomy law.   Here I am not talking about statehood. I am talking about the  District's budget, having it stay in the District, go into effect  immediately and not come as a pass-through to this body, because, by  coming here, it gets harmed. It adds costs to the budget because of the  uncertainty of having another actor, the federal government, who could  do anything to your local budget.   The bond markets have made the best case for recognizing the  District's budget autonomy law, instead of another passage of the  appropriation after the District has already passed it and getting our  budget here only to see if Members can attach undemocratic amendments,  and get them passed that way.   The fact is, if there were budget autonomy--here, I am not talking  about statehood, but only the budget of the District, like the budget  of every other city and State--and the budget didn't come to the  Congress--if the District had that, it would lower our taxes even more,  and the District would need even less in Federal funds.   I have already gotten the rating agencies to credit a provision I got  in the budget keeping the District from being shut down if the Federal  Government shuts down. That is what I said: shut down.   The Congress often acts like a child. Sometimes they disagree with  the President; sometimes they disagree among themselves; and the whole  darn thing just closes down, leaving everybody out there on his own  with no budget; and then the House and the Senate go at one another  until they finally get something done.   I have annually gotten into the D.C. appropriation a provision  exempting the District from the threat of the shutdown.   So here is the irony: If the Federal Government shuts down or if  doesn't pass a budget on time, the District's budget goes into effect;  and it goes into effect at next year's budget levels, while with the  Federal Government, the most that will happen is that it will stay open  on the prior year's budget.   We are grateful that the bond markets have recognized the District as  one of the most fiscally responsible jurisdictions in the United  States. We are grateful that they have pointed out who the culprit is  if we want to get an even higher rating than we share with seven States  who have AAA ratings.   Remember, Madam Speaker, nobody in this body is interested in the  D.C. budget. That is how I have been able to make sure that nothing  happens on the District budget. And since there is no interest in it,  it simply shouldn't be here.   The District budget is just like a number of other items here from  the District that I have been able to keep from being overturned.                                time  1315    An example is the District's gun laws. It may be the best example.  Every year, I keep the Congress from passing bills to overturn the  District's gun laws. They are very extreme. I do it in the House, and I  do it in the Senate, even though I am not in the Senate, and there is  nobody from the District of Columbia in the Senate.   Senator Marco Rubio from the State of Florida has been the chief  culprit of late. Members vary as to who tries to wipe out all the  District's gun laws. You would think that Senator Marco Rubio would be  the last to do that, because Parkland, Florida youngsters have become  the leading advocates for gun safety control in the United States and  are making some considerable headway.   But, actually, Senator Rubio started his effort to wipe out the  District's gun laws before the Parkland tragedy. And why did he do it?  What does he care about the District? He doesn't care about the  District. He cares about his NRA rating.   Apparently, he had a B-plus NRA rating, National Rifle Association  rating. Within minutes of putting in a bill to eliminate all the gun  safety laws of the District of Columbia, the NRA raised his rating from  a B-plus to an A.   Do you want to know why I am mad? Why I come to this House floor to  say get off our backs and treat us like every other jurisdiction? That  is a perfect example: using the District of Columbia to get an  increased NRA rating.   Over here, it is the Representative from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) who  partners with Senator Rubio. Neither of them has been successful. Why  should I have to fight these two Members at all about an entirely local  matter?   Mr. Speaker, I have not asked only for statehood. I understand the  House and the Senate are essentially incremental bodies. So I have  bills that would simply give the District many of the elements of  statehood.   An example would be a local prosecutor. What is the United States  Attorney for the District of Columbia doing prosecuting local crimes?  That is what he does. In fact, more than 90 percent of the business of  this U.S. attorney doesn't have anything to do with Federal matters.   Again, this is a holdover from before the District had what we call  home rule, and it was 45 years ago that the District was given the  right to govern itself.   But that, the Congress could give the District, and then the District  would choose its own local DA.   There are other examples. the President offers clemency, and that  means it never happens for people in prison in the District. That is a  State function. The District knows more about its own local residents  who are incarcerated than any president. That is the kind of matter  that should go to the District of Columbia.   I cite these examples because they are not statehood. They are just  ordinary home rule jurisdiction, ordinary democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close with the most poignant examples of  denial of democracy to District of Columbia's residents. Mr. Speaker,  the most poignant of the reasons residents resent the denial of equal  treatment to their own jurisdiction has to do with the sacrifices that  District of Columbia residents have made in every war since the  creation of the republic.   The District is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was  created by the Founders. District residents fought in the war that  created the United States of America. Thus, the city stands as a living  contradiction to what the Framers fought for: ``No taxation without  representation.''   Residents of the District are not only taxed without representation  in the House and the Senate, they are taxed at a higher rate than other  Americans--they are number one per capita in Federal taxes paid to  support the Government of the United States.   When you consider the sacrifices that our residents have made, one  would wonder how they could possibly be denied equal treatment in their  own country. One way to understand the sacrifices the District has made  is to look at those sacrifices in times of war: World War I, more  District casualties than three States; World War II, more District  casualties than four States--understand that we are talking about a  city, and these are more casualties than in the States; Korean war,  more casualties than in eight States of the United States--this city,  more casualties than in eight States; finally, the very worst of the  casualties, the Vietnam war, more casualties than in 10 States.   There is not an American who wouldn't say that, with those sacrifices  and with federal taxes paid at a higher rate than any others are taxed,  surely the 700,000 residents who live in our Nation's Capital have more  than paid their dues.  [[Page H7716]]    So I have come to make that case. It is not a difficult case to make.  At the heart of the case are the sacrifices in lives for their country.  Not only did they not have the vote, but, to date, as I speak, those  who are serving their country in Afghanistan and around the world are  doing so without equality with other Americans, with the votes in the  House and the Senate.   If you were to ask the American people, I have no doubt where they  would be on the issues I have spoken about this afternoon. The  Democrats are doing very well in the House and the Senate. I will ask  for a vote for the District in this House, if in fact Democrats take  control of the House of Representatives, as it seems they will.   This is a matter that should be bipartisan, but my party does not  control the House. There is no chance of getting the kind of equality  that our country stands for unless my party gets control of the House.  Therefore, I hope all will understand that is why I am working hard to  see a change in who controls the House of Representatives and the  Senate of the United States.   The District residents, those who died, those who live here today,  have more than earned their right to be treated as equal American  citizens.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
