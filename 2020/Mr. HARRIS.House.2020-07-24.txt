 Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform you that I am unable to  vote today due to my attendance of my mother's funeral. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 162, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 163, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 165, and ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 166.                             Personal Explanation
