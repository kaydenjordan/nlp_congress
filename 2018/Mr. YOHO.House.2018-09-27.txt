 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to recognize the  crewmembers of the USS Cony, a Navy Fletcher Class destroyer that was  commissioned from 1942 to 1969. I would like to welcome the esteemed  shipmates and their families to Washington, D.C., as they celebrate  their 36th annual reunion.   During World War II and the Korean war, the USS Cony protected and  transported goods throughout Asia and the Pacific. The USS Cony  received 13 battle stars for its service and outstanding achievement  that deserves recognition today.   The Cony and its crewmembers also played a crucial role in defending  the U.S. during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I commend the valiant  efforts of the men and women who served this country while aboard the  USS Cony.   Although the Cony was decommissioned long ago, her legacy lives on  today. Thank you to all the members, past and present, of the United  States military for your service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
