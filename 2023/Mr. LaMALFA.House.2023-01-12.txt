 Madam Speaker, on Monday, classified documents were  discovered at President Biden's think tank in Washington, D.C. These  documents were at least 6 years old, meaning the President had them and  took them while he was Vice President, and lacked the authority at the  time to declassify them.   Yesterday, a second batch of documents has been found. The timing of  these discoveries right after the November midterm elections is, I am  sure, coincidental.   Knowing the history of the Biden family's shady dealings with China  and others, this raises serious national security concerns.   Mishandling classified information is a serious offense, yet the  Democrats, from Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden, seem to get a pass.   When Republicans are accused of doing far less, we get special  prosecutions and political witch hunts for a long time.   This breach of national security should be immediately investigated  by Congress and the DOJ to determine the magnitude of this offense. If  the DOJ wants to claim to be non-partisan, it must start enforcing with  equity across party lines.   Who has seen these documents?   Who has had access to them with the sloppy storage that we saw in  Pennsylvania or wherever else they are?   This is a very dangerous precedent, and the Vice President or the  President need to be held accountable.
