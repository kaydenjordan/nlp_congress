 Mr. President, like a lot of other Americans, I didn't  sleep much last night, didn't sleep much at all. I couldn't shake the  overwhelming feeling of sorrow that I felt for the community of Uvalde,  TX. Nineteen innocent children, fourth graders, were gunned down in  their classroom 3 days before summer break--3 days. Two teachers were  murdered as well. Countless children witnessed their classmates and  teachers shot and killed as they climbed through windows to try to  escape the massacre. Twenty-one families are living every parents'  worst nightmare--the loss of a child. Instead  [[Page S2683]]  of planning their summer vacations, those families are now planning  their children's funerals. Their nightmare is our national nightmare.   Though my own boys are now grown adults, I can't help but think when  my wife and I used to help them with their homework and tuck them into  bed at night. I can't help but think of when they were the same age of  the 19 elementary children gunned down at their school yesterday. Like  millions of American parents across our country, my wife and I are  brokenhearted today.   Millions of Americans dropped their children off at school this  morning, and my guess is they probably hugged them extra tightly. They  said goodbye and watched those kids walk into school. And they left to  hope and pray today that their children will be there, alive, at pickup  at the end of the day or that they will be on the bus ride coming home  at night. They are left to hope and pray that they never get the  shattering call that those families in Uvalde received yesterday.   We are the only country in the world where parents have to hope and  pray that their children will not be murdered at school by a gunman. We  are the only country in the world where a fourth grade classroom can be  turned into a battlefield by a madman with an assault weapon.   This has to stop. We can't go on this way. We are mourning this  tragedy, and I refuse to accept inaction. I refuse to accept that the  mass slaughter of children in their fourth grade classroom is somehow  normal. This has to stop. We can't go on this way.   For as long as I have been in this Chamber--that is some 21 years--we  have been failing to address the epidemic of gun violence in this  country. This has to stop. We can't go on this way. I refuse to believe  that Congress can't reform our gun laws in a way that the American  public broadly support. I refuse to believe that changing our laws  won't reduce gun violence and make these tragedies less likely from  recurring in the future.   We are long overdue to make commonsense reforms to our Nation's gun  laws. To put it bluntly, this is not going to be easy. I know it. I  think we all realize that.   Many of our friends in this Chamber revere the Second Amendment and  respect the tradition of lawful gun ownership in this country. I myself  am a gun owner and have been one since I was 12 years old when I bought  my first BB gun. However, the Second Amendment does not give us the  right to murder children at school or gun down worshippers at church or  kill African Americans at a grocery store.   In our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote these  words that we all remember. He wrote:         All men [and women] are created equal, that they are       endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,       that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of       Happiness.    These 19 children were denied the right to life, to liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   So in Uvalde, there is no little league game this weekend. There is  no fifth grade next year. They will never get to be teenagers, go to  the prom, graduate, go on to college, have a career, or have children  of their own, and, if lucky, maybe grandchildren someday. Their lives  were stolen from them by a gunman; and, tragically, we can never bring  them back.   What we can do though--what we can do though--is to try hard, really  hard to prevent this from ever happening again.   We need to be able to say to the American people: We have had enough.  This has to stop. We can't go on this way. We won't go on this way.   Today, we are a nation in mourning. We also need to be a nation  working together to address this epidemic, working to reform our gun  laws, and doing whatever it takes to prevent another massacre in an  American school, in a place of worship, or in a grocery store.   May God bless the community of Uvalde. May the Lord be with those 21  families during this time of unfathomable heartache and anguish.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, as we heard from previous speakers, we  will shortly vote to invoke cloture on the nomination of Dr.  Christopher Frey to be Assistant Administrator for EPA's Office of  Research and Development. I rise today in strong support of his  nomination.   Chris Frey, as he is known to his friends and colleagues, is an  outstanding public servant, a deeply respected scientist, and an  excellent choice to fill this leadership role at EPA.   The Office of Research and Development provides the bedrock of  scientific analysis upon which we establish our Nation's critical  environmental protection regulations. The EPA is able to fulfill its  responsibilities to protect our air that we breathe, to protect the  water that we drink, and the land we build our communities upon because  of the robust scientific research provided by what is called O-R-D, the  Office of Research and Development.   Dr. Frey's nomination received a bipartisan vote in the Committee on  Environment and Public Works. He has the experience, intellect, and  integrity to lead this indispensable office. I am eager to see him  confirmed.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture on his  nomination. This is about restoring science as the guiding force in  EPA's work.   I yield the floor.                         Vote on Thompson Nomination     Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  nomination.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
