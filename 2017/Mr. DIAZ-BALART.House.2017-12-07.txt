 Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairman for,  again, bringing the 12 bills, once again, through the process. This is  just a short-term continuing resolution. It is a clean date extension,  and this CR will give an opportunity to continue to move forward  quickly, by the way, towards finalizing appropriations bills.   It is important to note that, for example, in the Transportation and  HUD bill, we considered 22 amendments in committee, 39 amendments here  on the floor. You see, this has been an open and fair process the  entire way. Now we must--we must--move quickly to finish the job and  conference all 12 of these bills.   In the meantime, however, we must keep the government open and  funded. This is especially, by the way, important now that our  communities are pulling together to recover from three devastating  hurricanes, as well as the thousands of families threatened by raging  wildfires in California.   Look, we can't take the risk of shortchanging our first responders,  our military, given the natural disasters at home and the threats from  our adversaries abroad. A vote against this CR would do just that.   Again, just for the Transportation and Housing segment, this CR will  support ongoing transportation and safety missions, air traffic  control, housing for vulnerable citizens, including our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR. We cannot let  those folks down. We cannot shut the Federal Government down, and it  allows us to finish the job, and I thank the chairman for his steadfast  leadership.
