 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 403, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 275) condemning the  horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021, and  reaffirming the House of Representative's commitment to combating hate,  bigotry, and violence against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander  community, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on H. Res. 275.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  [[Page H2521]]    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 275, condemning the  horrific shootings that led to the tragic loss of eight American lives  in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16. The people of the United States mourn  the eight innocent lives lost, six of whom were women of Asian descent,  and several of whom were immigrants.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Judy Chu for her  leadership on this issue and for introducing this important  legislation.   Over the past year, Asian-Americans have been attacked and harassed  because of misinformation and xenophobia that wrongly blamed them for  the coronavirus pandemic. And, sadly, incidents of violence against  Asian-Americans are on the rise across our country.   The heinous shootings in Georgia was a wake-up call for the public to  the reality the Asian-American community is facing each and every day.  Acts of violence like these demonstrate why we must always call out  bigotry and hate whenever or wherever we see it. We must all speak out  against it.   In New York City, the number of anti-Asian hate crimes reported to  the police increased by 833 percent last year, the most out of any  major city in America. This is simply unacceptable. By voting to pass  this resolution, the House of Representatives will clearly state our  condemnation of the heinous and inexcusable acts of gun violence that  led to the tragic loss of eight lives in Georgia on March 16.   The resolution also condemns any racism and sexism that contributed  to the shooter's targeting of the Asian-owned businesses and murder of  seven women, six of whom were of Asian descent.   This resolution honors the memory of the victims and the loved ones  they leave behind. The healing process will be long and difficult for  the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, and all communities  impacted by this tragedy.                                time  1830    Importantly, the resolution affirms the commitment of the Federal  Government to combat hate, bigotry, and violence against Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to prevent tragedies like this in  the future, a commitment I hope all of my colleagues can agree on.   I am proud to stand in solidarity with the Asian-American and  Pacific-Islander community in calling for an end to the targeted  attacks like the one we saw in Atlanta.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu), who is the chairwoman of  the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and sponsor of this  important resolution.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleagues, Representative  Chu, Representative McBath, and Representative Bourdeaux, for their  thoughtful and important resolution.   The House of Representatives must take a stand against anti-Asian  bigotry and hate, and condemn the terrible shootings in Atlanta.   H. Res. 275 does just that. I urge every Member on both sides of the  aisle to support this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
