 Mr. President, I am here to express my strong opposition  to President Trump's nomination of Gina Haspel to be the next Director  of the Central Intelligence Agency. There are two reasons I oppose this  nomination: Ms. Haspel's support for torture and her willingness to  destroy evidence of the CIA's use of torture.   For years, apologists for the CIA's program have tried to redescribe  this inhumane practice to make it seem less appalling to the American  people. They have even renamed it. Torture has been rebranded as  ``enhanced interrogation.''   There is no way to hide the basic facts. The techniques used by the  CIA were torture: waterboarding so the person had the repeated  sensation of drowning, confining people to small boxes for hours on  end, depriving people of sleep for days, forcing people to hold painful  stress positions.   The CIA did not invent these tactics. Listen to an American war hero  describe what he endured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.         I was being forced to stand up continuously--sometimes       they'd make you stand up or sit on a stool for a long period       of time. I'd stood up for a couple of days, with a respite       only because one of the guards--the only real human being       that I ever met over there--let me lie down for a couple of       hours while he was on watch in the middle of one night.    Speaking about his captors, this former American POW said:         They bounced me from pillar to post, kicking and laughing       and scratching. After a few hours of that, ropes were put on       me and I sat that night bound with ropes.        They beat me around a little bit. I was in such bad shape       that when they hit me it would knock me unconscious. They       kept saying, ``You will not receive any medical treatment       until you talk.''        I was getting about three or four spoonfuls of food twice a       day. Sometimes I'd go for a day or so without eating.        I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has       his breaking point. I had reached mine. . . . I had been       reduced to an animal during this period of beating and       torture.    These are the words of Senator John McCain--our distinguished  colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, a decorated Naval aviator  who was beaten, broken, and tortured for 2 years after being captured  in North Vietnam.   No matter how you dress it up, torture is torture, and it is wrong.  It is inhumane, it is infective, and it is un-American.   That was the conclusion of the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee  report on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program during the Bush  administration. The committee drew a definitive conclusion: Torture did  not work. In fact, not only does torture not work, it makes it more  difficult for other agencies in our government to protect our national  security.   Surely a person who is seeking to be the Director of the CIA in 2018  should agree with this assessment or be able to give a really good  explanation of why not. Someone seeking to be the Director of the CIA  should be able to state clearly that torture is wrong, but when  repeatedly asked a yes-or-no question by my colleague Senator Kamala  Harris: Were the CIA's actions immoral, Ms. Haspel danced around the  answer. These are not the answers of a person who can be trusted to  administer the powerful CIA.   That question of trust goes to my second objection: The Director of  the CIA will make many decisions that will be held in secret and never  reviewed by the American people. It is critical we trust her judgment  and that we have complete confidence in her honesty and willingness to  submit to congressional oversight. I do not have that confidence in Ms.  Haspel, and here is why. As we now know from the public reports,  between October and December of 2002, Ms. Haspel oversaw a CIA prison  in Thailand. Under her leadership, at least one detainee was  waterboarded and subjected to other torture methods. As far as we know,  Ms. Haspel raised no objections.   According to news reports, in 2005, Ms. Haspel recommended that the  CIA destroy 92 videotapes of interrogations of detainees. CIA officials  remember, at the time, Ms. Haspel was one of ``the staunchest advocates  inside the building for destroying the tapes''--``the staunchest  advocates inside the building for destroying the tapes.'' She went so  far as to draft the order for her boss, the Director of the National  Clandestine Service, to sign, urging them to use ``an industrial  strength shredder,'' just to make sure they were completely destroyed.   Ms. Haspel destroyed these tapes despite Federal court orders  requiring the preservation of the CIA's records, despite the objections  of Members of Congress, and against the order of the Director of  National Intelligence, the CIA Director, two White House Counsels, and  senior Department of Justice officials. In a convenient coincidence for  Ms. Haspel, the tapes she ordered destroyed reportedly documented the  interrogation of detainees at the very same CIA prison in Thailand that  Ms. Haspel previously supervised. Even more conveniently, some of the  tapes reportedly documented the interrogation of the very detainee who  was waterboarded under Ms. Haspel's leadership.   When Senator Angus King asked about her destruction of the tapes, Ms.  Haspel could come up with no credible explanation. How can we trust her  to be fully forthright with Congress in the future if she cannot  acknowledge missteps of the past?   Ms. Haspel had numerous opportunities to question the directives she  was given during this era. According to the  [[Page S2745]]  Senate Intelligence Committee report, other CIA officers regularly  called into question the effectiveness and safety of the techniques  being used but not Gina Haspel. It was happening right before her eyes,  and she did nothing to stop it. While her colleagues questioned the  legitimacy of the CIA's program, according to public reports, Ms.  Haspel vigorously defended it. According to those same reports, the  Trump White House reviewed CIA message logs that ``made it clear just  how accepting she had been of since disavowed interrogation  techniques.''   The fact is, so far as the record indicates, the only action Ms.  Haspel has taken with regard to U.S. torture practices has been to do  her best to cover it up.   Why relitigate the choices that were made during those dark days  after 9/11? Because this matters, especially with a President like  Donald Trump. As a candidate, Donald Trump said he would ``bring back a  hell of a lot worse than waterboarding'' because even ``if it doesn't  work, they deserve it anyway.'' As President, Donald Trump pulled back  from his plan to reinstate the use of secret CIA prisons overseas only  after overwhelming bipartisan outrage.   The stakes are high. The use of torture is one of the darkest  chapters in our Nation's modern history. We cannot give this President  any reason to drag this country back. We cannot allow any room for that  mistake to occur again.   Gina Haspel has spent 33 years at the CIA. She has a decorated career  and has sacrificed for this country in many ways Americans will never  know. I have no doubt her current and former colleagues who praise her  as a patriot are sincere, but patriotism and judgment are not the same  thing. Someone who puts protecting the Agency above following the law  cannot be trusted.   When announcing his opposition to Gina Haspel's nomination, Senator  McCain recently said that ``the methods we employ to keep our nation  safe must be as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to  and promote in the world.'' I agree with Senator McCain, and I urge my  colleagues to reject her nomination.                             National Police Week    Mr. President, I rise to honor the lives of six Massachusetts police  officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. On April 12, our  Commonwealth suffered a terrible loss when Sergeant Sean Gannon of the  Yarmouth Police Department was killed while serving an arrest warrant.  He was only 32 years old.   A native of New Bedford, MA, Sergeant Gannon graduated from Bishop  Stang High School in North Dartmouth and then earned a bachelor's  degree in criminal justice from Westfield State University and a  master's in emergency management from the Massachusetts Maritime  Academy.   After college, Sergeant Gannon jumped headfirst into public service,  first serving as a public safety officer and later becoming a police  officer with the Yarmouth Police Department, where he served for 8  years. Sergeant Gannon loved working with police dogs, and he was the  first full-time  K-9 narcotics officer at the Yarmouth PD. His loyal patrol dog, Near- Oh, was seriously injured in the incident that claimed Sergeant  Gannon's life, but he is expected to recover and return to the Gannon  family.   Sergeant Gannon had a huge heart and spent his free time volunteering  with Big Brothers, Big Sisters, traveling, enjoying the outdoors, and  working with his hands.   Thousands of mourners, including law enforcement officials from  across the country, gathered to pay their respects at Sergeant Gannon's  wake--a testament to the high esteem with which his community held him  and to the power of his sacrifice.   Yarmouth police chief Frank Frederickson calls Sergeant Gannon the  ``Tom Brady of our department'' and posthumously promoted him to the  rank of sergeant.   Last month, I spoke with Sergeant Gannon's wife, Dara, and his  parents, Patrick and Denise, to offer my condolences, my thoughts, and  my prayers, and I continue to hold them in my heart.   Next year, Sergeant Gannon's name will be added to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial, recognizing law enforcement officers who  have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities. We  owe Sergeant Gannon and all of them a deep debt of gratitude. They died  as heroes.   I would also like to recognize the five Massachusetts officers whose  names were added to the memorial this year. Patrolman Seth A. Noyes, of  the Boston Police Department, died on October 18, 1870, from injuries  sustained in the line of duty. He was 41 years old. Sergeant John J.  Shanahan, of the Revere Police Department, died on November 19, 1928,  when he was hit by a truck while directing traffic around the scene of  a car accident. He was 54 years old. Patrolman Jeremiah J. O'Connor, of  the Lawrence Police Department, died on November 14, 1950, when he had  a heart attack after pursuing a subject. He was 61 years old. Patrolman  Frederick A. Bell, of the Newton Police Department, died on September  5, 1954, 4 months after he suffered severe injuries in a car crash. He  was 39 years old. Sergeant Raymond P. Cimino, of the Chelsea Police  Department, died on February 28, 1985, after suffering a heart attack.  He was 44 years old.   We honor their service, we honor their sacrifice, and most  importantly, we honor the lives they led and the legacies they leave  behind.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to  honor the life and memory of Sergeant Sean Gannon of the Yarmouth  Police Department, who was killed in the line of duty on April 12,  2018.   This week is National Police Week, a time to honor the brave law  enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. Last  month, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts suffered a terrible loss when  Sergeant Sean Gannon was killed while serving an arrest warrant in  Barnstable. He was only 32 years old.   A native of New Bedford, MA, Sergeant Gannon graduated from Bishop  Stang High School in North Dartmouth and then earned a bachelor's  degree in criminal justice from Westfield State University and a  master's in emergency management from the Massachusetts Maritime  Academy.   After college, Sergeant Gannon jumped head first into public service,  first serving as a public safety officer and later becoming a police  officer with the Yarmouth Police Department, where he served for 8  years. Sergeant Gannon loved working with police dogs and was the first  full-time K-9 narcotics officer at Yarmouth PD. His loyal patrol dog,  Nero, was seriously injured in the incident that claimed Sergeant  Gannon's life, but is expected to recover and return to the Gannon  family.   Sergeant Gannon had a huge heart and spent his free time volunteering  with Big Brothers, Big Sisters, traveling, enjoying the outdoors, and  working with his hands.   Thousands of mourners, including law enforcement officers from across  the country, gathered to pay their respects at Sergeant Gannon's wake,  a testament to the high esteem with which his community held him and to  the power of his sacrifice. Yarmouth Police Chief Frank Frederickson  called Sergeant Gannon the ``Tom Brady of our department'' and  posthumously promoted him to the rank of sergeant.   Our hearts are broken by the loss of Sergeant Gannon.   Today, we honor Sergeant Gannon's service, we honor his sacrifice,  and most importantly, we honor the life he led and the legacy he leaves  behind.
