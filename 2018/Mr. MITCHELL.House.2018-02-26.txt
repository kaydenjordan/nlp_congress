 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material germane to the topic of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am here with Mrs. Walters from  California, who is the co-chair of the Tax Truth Squad. This has been  an exciting first 14 months for me serving Michigan's 10th  Congressional District. I had the privilege of representing the  freshman class in House leadership.   Tax cuts and tax reform are important to me, as I grew up the oldest  of seven kids in a family in which dad built trucks in a line and my  mom worked full time more often than not to support our family. I saw  firsthand the difficulties experienced to make ends meet and support  that family. That is why I am committed to ensuring policies that  create jobs, economic growth, and wages in the pockets of people who go  to work every day and get a paycheck.   Until last December, it seemed to be only a dream that we could  achieve meaningful tax cuts and reform. It had been more than 30 years  since that had been updated. Since that time, layers of rules and new  additions to the Tax Code had grown that into a beast of 74,000 pages.  You would have to be a wizard to know what was in it.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act addressed these problems and put more money  in the pockets of hardworking Americans so they can make decisions  about how to use their own money.   Up until now we have talked about the possibilities and the dream of  tax cuts and reform. Now we can talk about the realities of what tax  reform is bringing to America.   Representative Walters and I have organized a series of floor  speeches that begin tonight a little later than originally planned.  Each legislative week we have designated one or more States'  delegations that will join us and talk about tax reform, tax cuts, and  the impact it is having on their constituents and their districts.   Texas is kicking off that initiative tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi  Walters), who is the co-chair of the Tax Truth Squad.    Mr. Speaker, as we go through the evening, I will try  to highlight some important components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I think one of the most important components is the larger standard  deduction. We have doubled the standard deduction from $12,000 to  $24,000 for married couples. We created a simpler filing process. What  we created was, in essence, a filing process where 90 percent of  Americans can file their taxes on a form about this size, significantly  better than the current Tax Code.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), who is  a good friend, a colleague, and the gentleman who led us through the  whole battle to achieve this epic change. Congressman Kevin Brady is  the author of the legislation and a true champion for American  taxpayers. He is the Representative of the Eighth District of Texas and  the chairperson of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady for his leadership on  this issue. He talked a little bit of the impact it has had on his  district in Texas. Here, we have a sign. Since the tax reform bill  passed, more than 400 companies have given a pay raise, a bonus,  increased 401(k) contributions, or, in the case of utilities, lowered  their rates.   At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax reform  bonuses. The direct bonus announcements already, to date, exceed $3  billion. There are companies like JetBlue, KeyBank, and DTE Energy in  my district back home, Alaska Airlines. We could go through the list.  Four hundred companies have already announced major changes and major  investments. These have a major impact throughout the country and on  our constituents.   Next, we are going to hear from another colleague and a good friend.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Representative from the 25th District of  Texas (Mr. Williams), who has consistently been a voice of  businessowners throughout his district and America through his work on  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, some of our colleagues on the floor, as we  worked toward passing this epic reform, talked about the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act as being Armageddon, as being the end of the world. Let's talk  a little about that.   On CNBC on February 20, they had a survey: Q1 Small Business  Confidence Index saw an increase of 5 points. Forty-six percent of  those surveyed say tax policy changes will have a positive effect on  their business, up from 38 percent in the fourth quarter. The number of  those same tax policy changes that have a negative impact fell sharply  to 23 percent. Only one in three respondents expect to receive a tax  cut. The independent Tax Policy Center estimates that four out of five  Americans will actually see a tax cut at the end of the year.   Not quite the Armageddon some of our colleagues predicted.   We are now going to hear from another colleague. Representing Texas'  22nd District and a vocal advocate for a simpler and fairer Tax Code,  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining us.   We were talking about some of the improvements in people's lives that  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has created. Over the weekend, I received a  message from one of my constituents, Mark. I know him. He and his wife  work hard. They don't make a lot of money.  [[Page H1259]]    But I got a nice note saying: Thank you so much. They met with their  accountant about this year's taxes and projected next year. He said  they will have another $2,700 a year in their pocket that they will  have to make decisions about fixing their house or maybe taking a  little vacation up north.   These are the things the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), a  good friend of mine who has been an instrumental Member in bringing the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to the House floor. His work on behalf of the  32nd District of Texas and all Americans has certainly been recognized.  He is also chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Sessions joining me  tonight. As I said, along the way, we are going to highlight some  aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Real quickly, I want to outline that up to $24,000 of a married  couple's income is taxed zero. There is no tax on that. We continue to  allow families to write off State and local taxes, up to $10,000. We  help families with children in taking care of their loved ones by  doubling the child tax credit and preserving the child and dependent  tax credit, while also preserving the adoption tax credit, all critical  things to families and helping support families through the Tax Code.    Mr. Speaker, I next yield to the Congressman from Texas (Mr. Flores),  a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee with decades of  experience in job creation and providing opportunity for economic  growth.    Mr. Speaker, I continue with the discussion of the  impact to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by introducing a colleague on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the defender of a  strong rural economy, representing the 36th District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman Brian Babin.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Babin for joining us this  evening.   Congressman Babin talked about the impact on small businesses. Many  businesses in his district are what are called pass-throughs--they are  family businesses. For the first time ever, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  provides the ability for small businesses to deduct 20 percent of their  income and tax it at a much lower rate--at 25 percent--to allow those  businesses to grow.   It also allows those businesses to immediately write off the full  cost of new equipment, rather than expense it or amortize it over 7  years, because money out of their pocket now means it is real money out  that they can't wait for 7 years to get back to the Tax Code-- significant differences allowing businesses in my district and  throughout the country to invest in growth.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber), my colleague representing the 14th District of Texas, with  extensive real-world experience in the private sector through his own  small business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), from the 19th District of Texas, who is a member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Arrington referenced some of the  changes in Texas in some of the important improvements in the business  climate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Southwest Airlines and American Airlines both chose to give bonuses  to their employees of $1,000 each shortly after passage of this bill  and signed by President Trump.   A surprise we hadn't anticipated was lowering electricity bills. Both  in north Texas and in my district back in Michigan, there were massive  cuts in utility rates as a result of lowering taxes--not something that  we thought about or bargained for at the time.  [[Page H1262]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and  thank him for bringing his medical expertise to the tax reform  discussion with his service on the Energy and Commerce Committee, from  the 26th District of Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining me this  evening.   Mr. Speaker, I did want to, at this point, wrap up this evening's  version of the Tax Truth Squad.   Since the tax reform bill was passed and signed into law, let me  state again that more than 400 companies have given a pay raise;  bonuses; increased 401(k) contributions; or, in the case of utilities,  lowered rates--lowered rates dramatically.   At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax reform  bonuses. Direct bonus announcements have already topped $3 billion; $3  billion into our economy, into people's pockets, decisions they can  make about what they want to do with the money rather than turning it  over to the government, rather than turning it over to the IRS, rather  than having it spent on bureaucracy.   In my home district, we will talk about that more next week, but I  want to reference that Fiat Chrysler is moving jobs here from Mexico,  moving to Macomb County, investing $1 billion--yes, you heard that  right, investing $1 billion--in expanding a plant and creating 2,500  new jobs in Michigan just in that one plant.   By the way, they also announced a bonus--a tax bonus separate from  their bonus in their contract, which some people said: Oh, it was in  their contract.   No, it wasn't. It was a bonus of $2,000 per employee as a result of  the tax bill.   These are major cuts that people overlook. Look at these companies,  look at the list of them, and it grows every day.   Let me suggest real quickly: I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but  I know my district and I know my constituents, and $1,000 is not  crumbs.   I referenced earlier the note I got over the weekend from Mark in my  district who says his projected taxes next year save him $2,700 in his  pocket.   Now, I know where you live, I know where I live, that is real money.  Maybe for some of my colleagues, it doesn't matter as much, but that is  why we passed this bill. That is why we worked so hard on this bill.  That is why we support it. And that is the truth about taxes.   That is what we want the American people to understand: we are  putting money back in their pockets, money back in the economy, rather  than taking money and putting it in government and hoping they do  something productive with it.   I thank the Chair for the opportunity this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
