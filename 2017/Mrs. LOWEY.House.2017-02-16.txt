 Madam Speaker, I hope the women of America are watching.  Let there be no doubt about the actions of congressional Republicans  and the Trump administration. They will oppose your right to make your  own health decision and limit access to your reproductive health care  at every available juncture.   Rather than work to create jobs, House Republicans are helping State  officials block women from getting contraception and other reproductive  health services.   Today's bill would particularly harm the neediest Americans, as it  could deny them the opportunity to visit the health provider of their  choice, which in many instances may be the only provider available  within hours of their home.   Sadly, this will be just one of the many assaults on women's rights  in the 115th Congress.
