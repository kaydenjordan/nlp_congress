 Mr. Speaker, since day one of this Congress, Democrats  have committed themselves to a For the People Agenda. Today is no  different.   The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting people across the world, our  country, and my district. It is for the people that we stand here today  to assist families, uplift workers whose basic livelihoods have been  threatened, strengthen our community hospitals, and support our  frontline healthcare workers.   We are here to deliver relief to people, like the owner of a  community bookstore in Andover, Massachusetts, whose business has been  crushed; to keep our end of the bargain for the hospital workers at  places like Lawrence General, Lowell Community Health Center, and so  many others who are putting their lives on the line each day.   We are here for the families who are worried about their basic health  and safety. This bill delivers for them.   This is a time for bold action, and much more needs to come.   For families struggling with the harsh realities of this situation,  know that we will keep protecting you. We will take our lessons and  courage from our frontline workers, from the families banding together  to care for their loved ones, from the acts of kindness we are seeing  all over our country as we stand united as Americans. I support this  bill.
