 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5446, and I thank Mr. Ferguson  for working with our office to bring this bill to committee and here to  the floor as well. And I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms.  Jenkins) for managing the time on this bill. This may be one of the  last things she gets to do here on the House floor, and I just want to  thank her for her friendship throughout the years, as well, and working  in a bipartisan way with us on occasion.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleague mentioned, this is a targeted bill to  address the overzealous enforcement of existing law. These changes are  needed because, as Mr. Ferguson will point out as well, we have found  ourselves in an environment where small-business owners have seen their  property and products taken and sold within 24 hours.   Take, for example, as was mentioned by Ms. Jenkins, the 2015 IRS raid  of Mii's Bridal and Tuxedo shop in Garland, Texas. Claiming the owners  owed back taxes, the IRS agents seized $17,000 in cash and $650,000 in  wedding dresses and equipment, like sewing machines. The agents then  immediately auctioned off those items, even though their tax dispute  was not settled and has not been contested.   The agency argued the expedited procedures were needed because they  said the dresses, as was mentioned, were perishable goods. These were  not oranges or grapefruits, they were not apples or eggs, they were  dresses.   By invoking the word ``perishable,'' the IRS didn't have to post  advance public notice of the auction or wait at least 10 days for  sunlight to come in before selling the goods, as is normally required.   To say this is wrong is an understatement. Clothing, as we all know,  is not really perishable. It will decay over time and when it is worn,  but left to its own, it doesn't decay. It is not perishable.   And destroying an immigrant-owned business--an immigrant-owned  business--within hours, that took decades to build, should never have  happened in the first place.   How the IRS used civil asset forfeiture in this case goes against a  bedrock principle of our country, of the  [[Page H3367]]  United States--the principle of due process.   In this case, the IRS acted without proper notice and outside the  intent of the law. They seized property and sold it without knowing its  true cost or its value.   Civil asset forfeiture is a tool that the IRS and other law  enforcement agencies use to go after ill-gotten funds from human  traffickers, terrorists, and other serious criminal activity.   Sometimes it is a necessary mechanism. I think we all recognize that.  But only when used correctly and fairly.   Seizing the goods of a small immigrant-owned business and selling  them immediately at auction under the false premise that they were  perishable goods is a clear example of how the law should not be used.   Passage of this measure will ensure that abuses like this never  happen again. I urge swift passage of this bill to help us take at  least some steps to address the abusive flaws in the civil asset  forfeiture procedure and give at least this one company some modicum of  justice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, let me thank Mr. Ferguson, as well as Ms.  Jenkins, for bringing this bill to the floor.   I don't want anyone who may be watching this on C-SPAN and may be  just waking up, turning on the television, and looking at the  incredible bipartisanship that is happening here today to think they  died and have gone to bipartisan heaven.   Although much of the work that we are doing today is bipartisan in  nature, it really is drastically different than the way in which the  Committee on Ways and Means has conducted business in the most recent  past in connection with the passage of the Republican tax bill.  Democrats have called that a tax scam bill.   It had absolutely no input from the Democratic side of the aisle,  certainly here in the House of Representatives, in the committee, or  here on the floor. Not reflective of any of the Democratic principles  or values in that bill and its passage.   And as much as we are working in a very bipartisan way, this is not a  reflection of my good friend Ms. Jenkins, but more a reflection, I  think, of the leadership of the Republican Conference in ramming a bill  through the committee without proper hearings. Not having a single  Democratic amendment in that process spoke very ill of the process  itself.   Nobody cares about how sausage gets made. We know that. Nobody cares  how legislation gets made. Nobod cares about how sausage gets made  until they taste it and it doesn't taste good. And I think that is what  is happening right now with the American people.    This tax bill is falling flat on its face. This tax scam bill is  falling flat on its face because it is not helping the people it was  purported to be helping in the first place. The greatest bait-and- switch probably in the history of our country went on in terms of what  the President talked about, the people he was going to help, the middle  class and hardworking people, and instead it all basically went to the  wealthiest 1 percent and the wealthiest multinational corporations in  the history of mankind.   They got permanent tax relief, and the middle class and working men  and women in this country got bupkis. All right? And the reality is  they know what happened here. They know that 83 percent of that bill  went to the wealthiest 1 percent and 17 percent to working men and  women and working poor people.   That is just obscene. That is not reflective of who we are as a  nation or as a country or as a people, yet that is what happened, and  in no small part because it was done in such a partisan way. The bill  had not a single hearing within the committee and was brought to the  floor all to meet a deadline of passing it before the Christmas and  Hanukkah break. That was the only goal, so that my Republican  colleagues could say they had achieved something, even if it was ill  conceived and passed with rushed judgment.   And now we know about all the problems with the bill and all the  fixes that have to take place; things that maybe could have been worked  out had there been a more open process and more deliberative process  and the inclusion of Democrats in that process. Just maybe.   So I don't want anyone, again, to be watching C-SPAN or maybe turning  on the news tonight and learning about all the bipartisanship that is  happening here on the House floor--and it is good; these are good bills  that we are working on together--and say: Did I die and something  happened? Has the world been righted? Am I missing something?   I want them to know: No. You are not missing anything.                                time  1400    That tax scam bill did pass, and it did go toward helping the  wealthiest 1 percent and the richest multinational corporations in the  history of the world, and the little guy is not getting very much at  all. That is still the case. That hasn't changed. And it is sad, but it  is true.   I, once again, want to thank the gentlewoman for her efforts in  bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor. But let it be known that  this is more of an aberration and not the norm in terms of how the  committee has been conducting business, nor has the House of  Representatives been conducting business in the most recent past.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 833         Resolved, That the following named Members be and are       hereby elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        (1) Committee on natural resources.--Ms. Velazquez.        (2) Committee on science, space, and technology.--Mr. Lamb       (to rank immediately after Ms. Rosen).        (3) Committee on veterans' affairs.--Mr. Lamb (to rank       immediately after Mr. Correa).    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to  remember my colleague from New York, the former dean of our delegation  and the first woman to chair the House Rules Committee, Louise McIntosh  Slaughter. Louise was a wonderful soul whose love of public service,  the institution of Congress, and her home of western New York each and  every day.   Louise grew up in a coal mining community in Kentucky as one of 5  children. Inspired by the loss of her sister to pneumonia as a child,  Louise chose to study microbiology and pursue a master's degree in  public health. Her passion for health care inspired her work throughout  her career as she championed numerous bills and efforts to help the  American people gain real access to care.   After obtaining her degrees, Louise met her husband, Robert, and the  couple moved to New York. While living near Rochester, Louise became  involved in local community groups and eventually sought to get  involved in electoral politics. Her long career in public service took  Louise from the county legislature to Gov. Mario Cuomo's staff, the New  York State Assembly, and eventually the Congress.   I had the honor of serving alongside Louise in the Assembly before  eventually joining her in Congress. She had a perfect blend of southern  charm and New York hustle, and was a steadfast champion for the people  of western New York and Americans across the country. I will miss her  relentless passion, her wit, and above all, her friendship. I know  Monroe County and the city of Rochester will miss their longtime  champion.
