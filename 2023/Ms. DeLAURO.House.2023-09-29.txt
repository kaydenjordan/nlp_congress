 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this continuing resolution. If you  cannot agree to the funding levels for 2024 in order to keep government  open, you must pass a continuing resolution. A 30 percent slashing of  the Federal Government only continues the majority's inability and  unwillingness to govern responsibly.   I would argue that you cannot call it a conservative resolution,  either. There is nothing conservative about the indiscriminate  destruction of public investments in America's families.   Regardless of what it is called, this bill inflicts serious  consequences on the American people, whether it is signed into law,  which it never will be, or because of the costly shutdown it triggers.   We are less than 48 hours from a government shutdown, and what do we  have to show for it?   The American people are tired of the doublespeak coming from the  majority. There are House Republicans who have repeatedly assured the  public that nobody wants a shutdown, and there are others who tell us  they think a shutdown would be a good thing for the country. Maybe they  are not worried about a shutdown because they know that Members of  Congress will not miss a paycheck.   I can speak for every Democrat in the Congress when I say we oppose  this Republican shutdown, a shutdown that will be devastating for our  country.   What have the Republicans offered as their effort to avoid a  government shutdown? What would this bill do? This bill would slash  investments in cancer research, leave communities recovering from  natural disasters out to dry, and undercut allies with a $1 billion cut  to Israel and further cuts to our support of Ukraine. It defunds law  enforcement by 30 percent and makes our communities less safe. It takes  food out of the mouths of millions.   This bill raises costs for American families at a time when the cost  of living is already too high.   It cuts title I education funding, the bedrock of American public  education, to the effect of 150,000 teachers being pulled out of  classrooms. Mr. Speaker, 275,000 children would lose access to Head  Start, undermining early education and making it harder for parents to  work.   In an unprecedented move, the House Republican bill cuts the Low- Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, funding by roughly 74  percent. More than 5 million households will lose their home heating or  cooling benefits or have their benefits cut by hundreds of dollars,  threatening their ability to heat their homes in winter or cool their  homes in summer.   House Republicans are threatening public health by cutting the Food  Safety and Inspection Service by 30 percent. Without adequate  inspection staff in our meat and poultry plants, these plants will be  required to close or reduce their hours. It hurts workers' paychecks,  reduces the meat and poultry supply, raises the cost of food for  American families, and risks the consumption of contaminated food.   With the cuts in this bill, 400,000 fewer small businesses would be  assisted by the Small Business Administration's entrepreneurial  development programs. This would have a significant impact on small  business owners, especially among veterans, women, and Native American  entrepreneurs.   This bill has no future. At best, it is dead on arrival in the Senate  and would never be signed by the President of the United States.   Everyone in this room knows that keeping the government operating and  passing bills to fully fund the next fiscal year will require  bipartisan cooperation. You need the House and the Senate, Democrats  and Republicans, to pass appropriations bills. Yet, House Republicans  are refusing to work with and negotiate with Democrats.   This is a pointless charade with grave consequences for the American  people. House Democrats are ready to work. We were ready in the spring.  We were ready last week. We are ready this weekend. We are ready today,  tomorrow, and every day to work in good faith with our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to meet the needs of the American people.   Let's get to work, serious work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will just take a second to tell the  gentleman from Arkansas that, with this bill, you will cut 1,460  teachers from your district and almost 46,000 households will have  their low-income energy assistance benefits terminated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), the distinguished ranking member of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few seconds here to let  the gentleman from Texas know that the State of Texas will lose almost  14,000 teachers. That is going to be really tough to explain that to  families when their children do not have a teacher in the classroom.   In addition to that, almost 77,000 Texans will lose their low-income  energy assistance benefits or have those benefits cut. It is going to  be a tough time for folks, come the cooler months or the warmer months,  to take advantage of this.   I think people need to be mindful of the consequences of a 30 percent  cut, or in the case of LIHEAP, a 74 percent cut, that they are  proposing today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Ramirez).    Mr. Speaker, I would take a second to tell the gentleman  from Ohio that 232,000 people in Ohio will be without low-income energy  assistance benefits.   Further, there will be 5,500 teachers who will be pulled out of  classrooms, and the families in both instances will suffer while the  gentleman talks about issues that are not truly affecting what is  happening in the everyday lives of the people that he represents.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I find it hard to believe that the  gentleman from Texas believes that wasteful spending is on teachers who  really teach our youngsters, and 14,000 of them will be gone in the  State of Texas.   I find it hard to believe that it is wasteful spending to deal with  77,000 people who will lose their LIHEAP benefits. Is that wasteful  spending, for people to have heat or be cooled or kids being taught in  school?   Let's talk about wasteful spending and the tax cuts my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are willing to give the richest one-tenth  of 1 percent of the people in this country and the richest  corporations, and tax cheats, I might add, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat), the distinguished ranking member of the Legislative Branch  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, to both of the gentlemen from Florida,  8,500 teachers, gone. Think about the kids who are going to school and  there is no teacher for them. Think about folks who need to heat or  cool their homes. We are looking at 36,000 households that will be  without those benefits.   Do they really care about those folks? Probably not.   As a Democrat, I took the lead on the infant formula crisis--I don't  know where my colleague was during that crisis--and called to attention  a company that knowingly sold tainted product and wound up killing  three or four people. I don't know where he was during that. I know  where I was, and I know where the administration was.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the distinguished ranking member of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman from Arizona that  there will be 63,000 households in Arizona that will be without the  low-income energy assistance benefits. These are not just numbers.  These are people, and we are making their lives more difficult at a  time when there is serious inflation and when there is, in fact, a high  cost of living.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are only adding and  increasing to that high cost of living.   I might also remind the gentleman from Arizona that we are looking at  about 2,800 teachers.   Now, again, these are not just numbers. Children go to school. If  there is no teacher to teach them, what is the result? What happens to  parents when they find out that their child's teacher is gone? If there  was a teaching shortage before, this will make it even worse. That is  the result of the cuts that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle want to make. It is there. It is in black and white. You can't  make up the numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman from Texas that the  eyes of the people of Texas are upon you when you are thinking about  really 77,000 seniors and kids without any benefits from the low-income  energy assistance program and also 14,000 teachers will be gone from  Texas schools.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Clarke).                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Clarke).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is almost laughable to think about chaos. I think the majority has  demonstrated overwhelmingly in the last several days, the last several  months, an unwillingness to govern, an inability to govern, and chaos,  general chaos, here.   It is interesting. The gentleman is from South Dakota, where, last I  understood, a little bit like the Northeast, in New England, it gets  cold. It gets cold in the wintertime in South Dakota. The gentleman is  happy to see 24,000 individuals not get energy assistance, low-income  heating assistance. We may be taking up a collection of hats and coats  and gloves, et cetera, because they are not going to get their LIHEAP  benefits in a cold climate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to let the gentleman from Wisconsin  know that 195,000 households are beneficiaries of the LIHEAP program.  They will be jettisoned from that program. If you think it is cold in  this Chamber, head to Wisconsin and you will know how cold it is in the  wintertime. Think twice about whether or not you will vote to cut  195,000 people's benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I find it unbelievable that the gentlewoman  from New York would support a bill that cuts $1 billion from our ally  in the Middle East--that is, from Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   What we are looking at here is a piece of legislation that makes a 30  percent cut in programs that have a serious effect on the lives of the  people in this country.   Let me just lay out some of them because these have not been talked  about so far.   The National Institutes of Health will be cut. There would be a  reduction of 7,000 research grants.                                time  1315    I think we have people in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle who  have had a loved one with a cancer diagnosis or Alzheimer's or heart  disease, but there is a willingness to cut the National Institutes of  Health and thereby cut 7,000 research grants.   Let's take a look at our allies. We speak about Israel and Ukraine.  Israel will receive a $1 billion cut in the funds that the U.S.  provides. We talk about Israel as being our closest ally in the Middle  East.   People should understand what is in this bill. We defund--not we--my  Republican colleagues defund law enforcement, reduce drug enforcement  administration agents, Federal law enforcement officers, eliminate  hundreds of State and local law enforcement.   They talk about crime, and they talk about law and order, but there  is a willingness to cut the funds in order for us to make our  communities safe.   Social Security offices, the field offices, would be forced to close  down, reducing access to in-person services.   People applying for disability benefits will wait additional months  for the processing of claims. That is what is in store with this bill  if you support it.   Wildfire suppression efforts will be hindered, 57 percent cuts, and  we know what devastation wildfires have had all over our country. Look  at what happened in Maui.   Unbelievable that they would talk about a bill, extol a bill that has  such devastating repercussions on the people of this country.   They slashed the resources for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.  Opioid use disorder. They are worried and talk about an opioid crisis,  but let's cut off the avenue where people can get treatment and help  and potentially save their lives.   Education. It is an abomination, what they will do to education  because they are on a march to eliminate public education in the United  States of America; that opportunity that all of our families have said:  Go to school, get an education so that you can succeed.   Rural America? Let's care about rural America, not cutting the loans  and grants for farmers and rural communities.   They will make it harder for farmers to access loans and grants,  making home farm ownership more difficult. They cut rural housing,  rural utility,  [[Page H4897]]  broadband to keep people in touch, and they eliminate health services  for rural and underserved families.   Mr. Speaker, 2 million vulnerable individuals and families will lose  access to healthcare services. They take food out of the mouths of  children, families, and seniors.   Mr. Speaker, there needs to be a ``no'' vote on this irresponsible  continuing resolution. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
