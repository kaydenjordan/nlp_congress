 Madam President, well, as we all know, last night, the  Senate voted by a substantial margin to move forward with a debate on a  bipartisan infrastructure bill. I want to commend the group of Senators  who worked with President Biden to reach a deal. The agreement will  ultimately dedicate over a trillion dollars to strengthening virtually  every major category of our country's fiscal infrastructure.   The vote last night also means that the Senate is on track to reach  the two-track goal I laid out for this Chamber at the beginning of the  month. The first track is the bipartisan bill focused on traditional,  brick-and-mortar infrastructure projects. The second track is a budget  reconciliation bill where Democrats will make historic investments in  American jobs, American families, and efforts to fight climate change.   In order to start work on a reconciliation bill, the Senate must pass  a budget resolution first, and we are on track for that as well.   It has been my goal to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill  and a budget resolution during this work period. Some pundits have  called that a tall order. I understand that. But because of the vote  last night, the Senate is now moving forward with the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, and we are on track to pass both elements of the  two-track strategy before we adjourn for the August recess. It took  some prodding and a few deadlines, but it all has worked out for the  better.   I want to take a step back and explain why these two bills are so  important at this moment. For the past 2 years at the end of the Trump  Presidency, the country was angry, divided, plagued by COVID, and our  economy was stuck in the muck. The COVID washed over our country like a  plague and was met by staggering incompetence from the Trump  administration. America was sick, dying, and our economy was in  shambles.   The discovery of the vaccine played no small part in our country's  recovery. We Democrats pushed early on, last February and March--not  this past one but a year ago--to increase funding for BARDA. Even then,  the Trump administration was sort of being stingy about that money, but  we got the money done. And the vaccine, as I said, played no small part  in our country's recovery.   But elections have consequences. I say that to the American people.  Elections have consequences. When we ran as Senate Democrats, when  President Biden ran, we promised we would get the vaccines out; we  would get the country's economy moving again; we would give hope to the  middle class and those struggling to get to the middle class, where  hope had been a distant and hazy frame on their horizon previously.   The Biden administration came in. We came in as a Senate majority. We  immediately set to work beating the pandemic, with a relentless focus  on getting the country vaccinated and getting our country back to  normal.   Congressional Democrats swiftly passed the bold, strong American  Rescue Plan, one of the largest Federal packages in American history,  to keep  [[Page S5148]]  families, businesses, and workers afloat until the country could  reopen. And we have done that. Six months into the Biden administration  and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, the country has  stabilized.   This morning--this morning--it was reported that in the second  quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 6.5 percent, erasing all of  the losses from the COVID pandemic. It happened a lot quicker and a lot  sooner than many anticipated.   Let me repeat that because it is great news. Under President Biden  and Democratic House and Senate majorities, the economy recovered so  fast this year that we have already erased the losses in growth that we  experienced as a result of the COVID pandemic. That is very good news.   It certainly doesn't mean every family is back on their feet yet. It  certainly doesn't mean our work is complete. But the American economy  is back. It is thriving and set for even brighter days ahead.   Again, elections have consequences. There is such a difference  between the bumbling, nasty, divisive last 2 years of the Trump  administration and a new Democratic majority in the House and the  Senate and a Democratic President.   Vaccines are out there, as we promised to get them. There are still  some people resisting taking a vaccine. They should. We have had some  resistance even from ideological rightwingers, which is just awful.  Vaccines are out there.   Money has been pumped into the economy through the ARP, and things  are moving forward, but now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Now  is the time to press forward to cement these gains and build on them.  We must continue encouraging vaccinations. We must keep a very close  eye on the Delta variant and take necessary precautions. But we also  must address the underlying structural economic conditions that held  back the middle class and those trying to get there even before the  pandemic.    The American dream--that if you work hard, you will be doing better  10 years from now than you are doing today and your kids will be doing  still better than you--was fading for the last 20 years. If you look at  the economic statistics, they show that that dimmer view the American  people had was accurate in terms of economic circumstances.   But now we need to get bright and sunny again. We need to return to  the bright, sunny American optimism that has been so much a part of our  character for more than two centuries. And how do we do it? We don't  just sit on our hands. We don't just say: Let businesses take care of  it. They won't. They have a different mission.   A massive investment in public infrastructure will create tens of  thousands of good-paying jobs. That is just what the doctor ordered.  And we need to go beyond that to restore that bright, sunny optimism.  We need to help American families keep up with the exorbitant costs of  childcare, healthcare, housing, college, and more. We need to press on  and fight to reverse climate change because, as bad as COVID was, if we  do nothing about climate change, a few years from now, each year will  be worse than COVID, and each year after that will get worse and worse  and worse. If we do nothing, people several years from now--even people  now will say: Why didn't we do more? We Democrats want to do more on  climate. We must.   The numbers show that the American economy has gotten back to where  it was prior to COVID. Now is the time to go further and build back  even better than before. We Democrats, when we can in a bipartisan way  but on our own when our Republican colleagues are adamantly against us,  we will move forward on both tracks--both tracks.   I am proud of my Democratic caucus, every one of them voting  yesterday for this bill and all pledging to go forward on the second  track as well.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, even during normal  times, protecting the U.S. Capitol is a difficult job. Millions of  people visit the U.S. Capitol every single year. Five hundred and  thirty-five elected officials and their staffs work here every single  day. To keep the Capitol Complex safe, to keep it secure, we are lucky  to have the best of the best.   Our Capitol Police, who stared down a violent mob on January 6, have  been nothing short of heroic--heroic. When the smoke cleared after the  attack of January 6, they came back to the Capitol and helped piece  together what the rioters had torn apart. In the aftermath of that dark  day, the National Guard helped keep watch day and night, 24-7.   I walked the halls of this building early in the morning and saw our  National Guard men and women, from New York and so many other States,  camped out, helping us, wanting to make sure the Capitol was secure. We  owe the Capitol Police and we owe the National Guard our deepest  gratitude, but we owe them more than just that. We owe them the  resources they need to do a very difficult job and to do it well.   Unfortunately, Congress is on the precipice of failing. Due to  unforeseen expenses during the pandemic and the toll incurred by the  attack on January 6, funding for our Capitol Police, security at the  Capitol Complex, even our National Guard, has come close to running  very dry.   Already, the Capitol Police has had to delay vital trainings and the  purchase of new safety equipment. Soon, salaries, bonuses, and new  hiring will be on the chopping block. According to MG Tom Carden, who  sent 1,200 members of the Georgia National Guard to the Capitol after  January 6, his unit is facing ``draconian'' cuts if Congress doesn't  replenish funding before this weekend. We must not--we must not--let  that happen under our watch.   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy, has been  working diligently to come up with a bipartisan agreement. Now, Senator  Shelby has joined with him, and they have crafted a $2.1 billion  supplemental appropriations bill to fill the shortfalls of our Capitol  Police, our National Guard, and a number of other vital defense  operations. It is not everything that we wanted. The House's bill is  bigger and broader. But it does fill the need, and we need to fill it  quickly.   I want to thank Senator Leahy particularly for his relentlessness in  pursuing this.   I want to thank Senator Shelby for realizing how important this was  in prodding Members on his side of the aisle to move forward.   I also want to thank Senators Klobuchar and Blunt, chairmen of the  authorization committee, the Rules Committee, that deals with these  issues. Senator Klobuchar in particular, whose hearings and continued  focus on Capitol security helped pave the way for the agreement,  deserves our kudos.   Now is the time for the Senate to take up and pass this bill on  behalf of the brave police officers and servicemembers who defended  this very citadel of democracy.   All 50 Senate Democrats fully support this crucial police and  security funding. All 50 Democrats are ready to go. We are eager,  insistent we meet our deadline.   Again, Democrats are prepared to vote on this bill as soon as  possible. With the cooperation of our Republican colleagues, which we  hope we will get--our needs are dire--we could pass this bill today.   The last 6 months have pushed those who protect the U.S. Capitol to  the limits. In the face of unprecedented adversity, they responded  heroically. We must support them now as they so courageously supported  us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask that I be allowed to speak for a few minutes, do  my unanimous consent, and then go right to Senator Shelby.    Mr. President, first, I want to just give my great  thanks to Senator Leahy and Senator Shelby for bringing this vote here  right now. The bottom line is very simple: This wasn't easy to get  done. A UC on these kinds of issues should be easy, but it is not.  Senator Leahy persisted and persisted and persisted, and I want to  thank him as well.   Senator Shelby persuaded the Members on his side that we had to move,  and they have come up with a good compromise. It is not everything our  side wanted, but it is very good.   I also want to thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Blunt. Their work  on the authorizing committee, the Rules Committee, helped pave the way  for this, with all the information they brought out, and they deserve a  lot of credit.   Now, look, to keep the Capitol Complex safe and secure, we are lucky  to have the best of the best. As I said earlier today, our Capitol  Police risk their lives for us. They go all out for us. They are  really, really important. The National Guard went all out for us, too,  on that fateful day and then for months afterwards. I remember walking  through the halls early in the morning, thanking them as they were  bivouacked out through the Capitol Visitor Center and everything else.   Now we are about to run out of money. Already, the Capitol Police  have forgone some of the things that they usually do in terms of  training, in terms of other types of activities, and soon, salaries,  bonuses, and new hiring will be on the chopping block. Similarly, many  of our National Guard units from around the country that sent troops  here, soldiers here, men and women here, are running out of money.   We can't let that happen. So passing this amendment is living up to  our responsibility to keep this grand Capitol safe, this temple of  democracy, this citadel of democracy safe, and to make sure that the  people who risk their lives for us and protect us get the help they  need.   It shouldn't have taken this long, but here we are, and I am glad we  are on the floor.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 3237    Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at  a time to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation  with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 63, H.R. 3237; that the only amendments in order be the  following: the Leahy-Shelby substitute, No. 2123, and the Cotton  amendment to the Leahy substitute, No. 2124; that there be 6 minutes  for debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees;  that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation  to the Cotton and Leahy amendments; that if a budget point of order is  raised and a motion to waive is made, the Senate vote on the motion to  waive; and that if waived, the bill, as amended, if amended, be  considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended, if amended, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all without intervening action  or debate, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage of the bill.    One more point. I hope this will be unanimous. It is  hard for me to believe that any Member would not want to support our  Capitol Police. For Members to take umbrage at the Capitol Police when  they did their job and protected us for some kind of crazy ideological  reason would be disgraceful. I hope there will be a unanimous vote for  this.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement now be  executed.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Thank you, Senator Leahy.   Thank you, Senator Shelby.                            ____________________
