[[Page S6723]]                                 Transmittal No. 18-38    Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                  36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) Airborne Early Warning       and Control (AEW&C) provides detection and surveillance of       regional surface and aircraft platforms through the use of       the APY-9 radar, APX-122A Identification Friend or Foe (IFF),       and ALQ-217 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems. The E-      2D AHE provides area surveillance and detection, air       intercept control, air traffic control, search and rescue       assistance, communication relay and automatic tactical data       exchange. The E-2D AHE is classified SECRET.        2. The APY-9 radar is a mechanically rotated,       electronically scanned array, which utilizes Space Time       Adaptive Processing technology to provide 360-degree       detection and surveillance in high clutter environments. It       is able to provide simultaneous detection and surveillance of       surface and air units. The APY-9 radar is classified SECRET.        3. The MIDS JTRS (5) terminal provides enhanced Link 16       functionality, namely Concurrent Multi-netting with four       channels (CMN-4) and Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR).       CMN-4 is a Link 16 enhancement that increases the terminal       capability from receiving only one Tactical Digital       Information Link-J (TADIL-J) message packing structure per       time slot to receive as many as four simultaneous message       packing structures per time slot, each transmitted on a       unique Link 16 net. The capability for current Link 16       terminals to receive only one TADIL-J message packing       structure per time slot imposes complex network design       constraints and prohibits network designers from making full       use of the Link 16 spectrum capacity. CMN-4 relaxes these       restrictions allowing for greater network planning       flexibility and achieves a fourfold increase in receive       message throughput for Link 16 terminals with this       capability. CMN-4 is backwards compatible with JTIDS and       MIDS-LVT, although legacy terminals would not be able to       experience the increased throughput. CCR described the Link       16 terminal's ability to receive multiple messages in the       same net within the same time slot. The MIDS-JTRS device       itself is CCI and is not classified. The COMSEC keying       material which is loaded into the device for IFF Mode 4/5       operations is classified SECRET.        4. The APX-122A IFF Interrogator and APX-123A IFF       Transponder are identification systems designed for command       and control. They provide the ability to distinguish friendly       aircraft, vehicles, or forces, and to determine their bearing       and range from the Interrogator. These devices have embedded       COMSEC which contains SENSITIVE encryption algorithms and       keying material. The APX-122A IFF Interrogator and APX-123A       IFF Transponder devices themselves are CCI and are not       classified. The COMSEC keying material which is loaded into       the devices for IFF Mode 4/5 operations is classified SECRET.        5. The ALQ-217 Electronic Support Measure (ESM) system is       used to detect, intercept, identify, locate, record, and/or       analyze sources of radiated electromagnetic energy to support       classification of unknown surface and airborne units. The       ALQ-217 is classified SECRET.        6. The AN/AYK-27 Integrated Navigation Control and Display       System serves as the network manager and the human machine       interface for the E-2D navigation system. The AN/AYK-27 is an       UNCLASSIFIED system.        7. The LN-251 Embedded Global Positioning Systems/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGIs) with embedded airborne Selective       Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Receiver (ASR)       system provides position, navigation and timing information       to the E-2D via the Global Positioning Satellite system and       an inertial measuring unit. The LN-251 is UNCLASSIFIED.        8. If a technologically advanced adversary obtained       knowledge of the specific hardware or software in the       proposed sale, the information could be used to develop       counter-measures which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        9. A Special Security Agreement (SSA) will be in place in       order to provide additional security requirements for       implementation by the Government of Japan to protect the       advanced capabilities this aircraft provides. This sale is       necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        10. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Japan.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

Transmittal No. 18-22       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The GMLRS M31 Unitary is the Army's primary munition for       units fielding the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems       (HIMARS) and Multiple Launcher Rocket Systems (MLRS) M270A1       Rocket and Missile Launcher platforms. The M31 Unitary is a       solid propellant artillery rocket that uses Global       Positioning System (GPS)-aided inertial guidance to       accurately and quickly deliver a single high-explosive blast       fragmentation warhead onto point targets at ranges from 15-70       kilometers. The rockets are fired from a launch pod container       that also serves as the storage and transportation container       for the rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets.        2. The GMLRS Unitary employs a multi-mode fuze consisting       of an Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) and a Frequency-      Modulating Continuous Wave--Directional Doppler Ranging       (FMCW-DDR) height of burst sensor. The weapon has three       fuzing modes point detonating, post-impact time delay, and       proximity height of burst--which are all accomplished       automatically via a launcher/fire control system electrical       interface prior to launch. The height of burst sensor is not       integrated with the fuze, but provides fire pulse input and       interfaces with a mechanical fuze.        3. GMLRS hardware and operational software are       UNCLASSIFIED. System performance characteristics are       classified CONFIDENTIAL. Components of the GMLRS system are       considered highly resistant to reverse engineering and the       impact of loss or diversion of the end item hardware would       have minimum adverse impact.        4. The M57 ATACMS Unitary is a conventional, semi-ballistic       missile which utilizes a 500-lb high explosive unitary       warhead.
