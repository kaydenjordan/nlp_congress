 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New  York for his leadership and for yielding to me. I also want to thank my  colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for all of his commitment, not  only on issues of human rights regarding Russia, but human rights in  general.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1145, condemning the  poisoning of Russian anti-corruption and opposition leader Alexei  Navalny.   Since Vladimir Putin took power in 1999, human rights defenders,  journalists, and opposition politicians have suffered relentless  persecution. Some have been killed, like Anna Politkovskaya, in 2006,  and Boris Nemtsov in 2015. Others, like Alexei Navalny, have been  targeted but survived. Navalny was attacked twice with a chemical  substance in 2017, likely poisoned in 2019 while in prison, and  seriously poisoned in August 2020.   I am thankful that Navalny is recovering from the latest attack, but  I regret that the Trump administration's response has been so feeble.  Secretary Pompeo issued one statement, days late, and after German  experts confirmed the poisoning, in which he merely called for an  investigation.   Today, with this resolution, Congress is stepping forward to make  clear that the United States is appalled by the attack on Alexei  Navalny and supports a robust response.   This resolution:   Condemns the poisoning;   Thanks Germany for facilitating Navalny's transfer to ensure high  quality medical care;   Welcomes his recovery;   Calls on the OSCE and human rights bodies to treat his case as a  human rights violation;   Calls on the U.S. Government to raise Navalny's poisoning with  Russian authorities and to support independent, impartial, and thorough  investigations by competent authorities;  [[Page H5907]]    Calls for the imposition of Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible  for the attack;   And supports a review of whether the poisoning constitutes use of a  chemical weapon, with sanctions to follow as appropriate.   This resolution does not punish Germany by calling for the suspension  of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany is an ally. It is the Russian  Government that is at fault here.   So I want to thank all the cosponsors in the Foreign Affairs  Committee for supporting this initiative.   I hope and I pray that the incoming Biden administration will make  human rights the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy going forward.  Brave individuals like Alexei Navalny deserve far more than a passing  reference from our government's leaders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.                                time  1430
