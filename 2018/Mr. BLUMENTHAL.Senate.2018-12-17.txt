 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this  letter from 44 former U.S. Senators be printed in the Congressional  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  December 10, 2018.        Dear Senate Colleagues: As former members of the U.S.       Senate, Democrats and Republicans, it is our shared view that       we are entering a dangerous period, and we feel an obligation       to speak up about serious challenges to the rule of law, the       Constitution, our governing institutions and our national       security.        We are on the eve of the conclusion of special counsel       Robert S. Mueller III's investigation and the House's       commencement of investigations of the president and his       administration. The likely convergence of these two events       will occur at a time when simmering regional conflicts and       global power confrontations continue to threaten our       security, economy and geopolitical stability.        It is a time, like other critical junctures in our history,       when our nation must engage at every level with strategic       precision and the hand of both the president and the Senate.        We are at an inflection point in which the foundational       principles of our democracy and our national security       interests are at stake, and the rule of law and the ability       of our institutions to function freely and independently must       be upheld.        During our service in the Senate, at times we were allies       and at other times opponents, but never enemies. We all took       an oath swearing allegiance to the Constitution. Whatever       united or divided us, we did not veer from our unwavering and       shared commitment to placing our country, democracy and       national interest above all else.        At other critical moments in our history, when       constitutional crises have threatened our foundations, it has       been the Senate that has stood in defense of our democracy.       Today is once again such a time.        Regardless of party affiliation, ideological leanings or       geography, as former members of this great body, we urge       current and future Senators to be steadfast and zealous       guardians of our democracy by ensuring that partisanship or       self-interest not replace national interest.
