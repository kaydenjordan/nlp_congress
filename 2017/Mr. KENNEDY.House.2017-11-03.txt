 Mr. Speaker, this moment is a bit hard to stomach. It is  hard to stomach yet another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care  Act, in the words of our colleagues, while extolling the virtues of  public health programs by cutting grace periods down to 30 days that  will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing access to their  insurance.   It is hard to stomach a $1 trillion tax cut being proposed for  wealthy adults at the same time that our Republican colleagues are  telling us that we can't afford to care for sick kids. It is hard to  stomach the indifference shown in this Chamber over the course of the  past month as CHIP lapses and panic sets in amongst families whose  lives depend on this program.   It is hard to stomach an idea that the only way to give them care is  to somehow take it away from somebody else, by gutting the Public  Health Fund in the midst of an opioid epidemic or scapegoating patients  who struggle to afford the monthly premiums and sometimes fall behind.   Why is it always those patients who are asked to sacrifice?   It is always those communities that are asked to do more with less.   Why do we somehow create a false choice on this floor today that  leads 9 million families to an impossible choice tomorrow?   For those families, CHIP is not a privilege or a line item in the  budget, it is a lifeline. They deserve the same decency and the same  urgency that our Republican colleagues showed the wealthy in their tax  plan yesterday.
