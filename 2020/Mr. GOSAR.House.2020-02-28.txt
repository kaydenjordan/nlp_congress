 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National  Children's Dental Health Month.   Each February, the American Dental Association unifies members of our  healthcare community to recognize the importance of good oral health  for our children and many others.   As a former dentist, I know that quality dental healthcare impacts  your overall well-being. Proper oral health starts with the very first  tooth, as baby teeth are the building blocks to a healthy smile.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20  percent of children ages 5 to 11 suffer from tooth decay. When a child  suffers from dental pain, the impact is far-reaching and can affect  critical developmental stages, including speaking, eating, and  learning.   Although tooth decay is widespread, it is preventable. Tooth decay is  the number one chronic infectious disease among children in the U.S.,  and programs like Give Kids a Smile Day enable thousands of dentist  volunteers to give their time and efforts to make a difference in the  health of children.   Since this program has started, volunteers have treated over 6  million children across the country, in all 50 States and the District  of Columbia. They have truly made a huge impact in their communities  and improved the oral health of so many children.                            ____________________
