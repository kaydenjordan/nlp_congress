 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize La Asociacion  de Cronistas de Arte, or AcroArte, and congratulate them on their 25th  silver anniversary.   AcroArte was founded in 1993 by Dominican journalists who specialize  in arts and entertainment and has celebrated the best and brightest in  music, theater, film, and more.   Together, they established the Soberano Prize, which was first called  the Casandra, which showcases and rewards the best of arts and culture  in the Dominican Republic.   This prestigious recognition has helped artists gain a foothold among  the Dominican diaspora, sharing the Dominican identity, culture, and  values around the world.   As more generations of Dominican Americans share their talents with  this world, I look forward to AcroArte lifting them up.   It is a privilege to welcome AcroArte here to the U.S. Capitol, and I  congratulate them on their 25 years of success.  [[Page H3493]]                                ____________________
