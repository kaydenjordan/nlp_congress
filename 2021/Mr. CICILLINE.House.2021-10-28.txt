 Mr. Speaker, as the United States reasserts itself on  the world's stage, it is time for robust engagement. We must reengage  with our allies and regain our footing as a global leader. But we are  standing in our own way.   Mr. Speaker, 100 ambassadorial positions are currently unfilled, with  60 awaiting Senate action. Where is the Senate?   Mr. Speaker, more than 300 national security professionals asked this  same question this morning in a letter to Senate leadership.   We do not have representatives to NATO, the European Union, ASEAN, or  the Organization of American States. Despite our significant interests  in the Middle East, we lack an Assistant Secretary of State for Near  East Affairs and an ambassador to Israel.   Mr. Speaker, we are sending a dangerous message of neglect and  indifference to our allies and adversaries. The Senate must act.   I join the hundreds of esteemed former ambassadors and Pentagon  officials in urging the Senate to begin hearings and to schedule votes  for all pending State Department and USAID nominees.   I include in the Record a letter from Foreign Policy for America.                                     Foreign Policy for America,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2021.       Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Senator Bob Menendez,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Senator James E. Risch,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,           Washington, DC.         We write as senior national security professionals to       express our alarm over the dangerously slow pace of Senate       confirmations of State Department and USAID officials over       the past ten months. The resulting vacancies have damaged       U.S. national security and our ability to address       international threats. We ask for your urgent attention to       resolving this situation.        The United States cannot afford to be absent at this time       of strategic competition with China. Yet, at this moment, 100       Ambassadorial positions are unfilled with 60 awaiting Senate       action. As President Biden prepares to meet with world       leaders at the G20 summit, the Senate has confirmed just two       of the president's Ambassadorial nominations to G20 member       states. As the world works to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,       the United States lacks both an Assistant Secretary for       International Organization Affairs and a USAID Assistant       Administrator for Global Health. Of the 17 world leaders       known to be attending the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in       November, only one has had the opportunity to coordinate in       advance with a confirmed U.S. Ambassador. Nearly half of       Ambassadorial posts on the African continent have nominees       stalled in the Senate. The sum total of missed opportunities       is staggering.        In addition to placing the United States at a strategic       disadvantage, Washington has sent an unfortunate message of       neglect and indifference. We currently lack Representatives       to both NATO and the European Union, to ASEAN, and to the       Organization of American States. In Canada, France, Germany,       and the United Kingdom, the lack of confirmed U.S.       Ambassadors neglects historic allies. Despite our significant       interests in the Middle East and the threats posed by Iran,       the United States currently has neither an Assistant       Secretary of State for Near East Affairs nor an Ambassador to       Israel. As we call for a free and open Indo-Pacific, the       United States lacks an Ambassador not only to China, but to       Australia, Bangladesh, India, Japan, New Zealand, the       Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and       Vietnam.        In Washington, widespread leadership vacancies and stopgap       appointments have resulted in an overstretched workforce and       unacceptable risks. As conflicts and natural disasters spur       population displacement unseen since World War II, the United       States has neither an Assistant Secretary of State for       Population, Refugees, and Migration nor an Assistant       Secretary of State for Conflict and Stability Operations.       President Biden's nominee for Assistant Secretary of State       for South and Central Asian Affairs, whose nomination was       announced on April 23rd, was not confirmed until September       13th, well after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The       State Department is planning to host a global Summit for       Democracy in December, but does so without an Assistant       Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Countless       other vacancies have resulted in unsustainable workloads,       undermining morale and retention.        As you are aware, the Senate has thus far confirmed only       two of President Biden's ambassadorial nominees, and just       eleven Assistant Secretaries of State. At USAID, only two       appointees requiring Senate confirmation have been approved.       Of the 235 Senate-confirmed State Department positions, only       24 have confirmed occupants, while 83 are at the Senate       awaiting confirmation. This is well below the number of       nominees confirmed at similar points in the first terms of       Presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush.        We note with particular regret that individual Senators       have blocked the confirmations of exceptionally qualified       nominees for reasons completely unrelated to their       credentials. There is no question that this practice, which       has been employed by members of both parties, has eroded       America's global leadership and contributed to a perception       among our friends as well as our adversaries that the United       States is in decline.        The steady atrophying of our diplomatic capacity poses an       unacceptable risk to U.S. national security. We urge you to       exercise decisive leadership to swiftly facilitate committee       hearings and votes for all pending State Department and USAID       nominees. If unanimous consent agreements cannot be obtained       to expedite votes, we ask that you once again dedicate the       floor time necessary to approve these nominations by regular       order.        Sincerely,        Ambassador (Ret.) Bernadette M. Allen,        Ambassador (Ret.) Frank Almaguer),        Major General (Ret.) Joseph T. Anderson,        Brigadier General (Ret.) Steven M.
