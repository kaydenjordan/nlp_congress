 Mr. Speaker, I am prayerful today, and finally today, that  I can come on the floor of the House and say to the victims of gun  violence and say to those who lost their lives, and to their families,  that I can be on the floor of the House today, not just saying, I give  you my thoughts and my prayers; not just saying, I want to send to you  my sympathies.   I can't tell you how tired I have been coming to the floor, feeling  hurt in my heart, and all I could say is thoughts and prayers.   Today I can vote on something that is going to make a meaningful  difference to each and every one of them.
