 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Yes, I object.    Who has control of the floor?    Who has the floor?    Mr. President, I would like to suggest to my friends on  both sides of the aisle that we first assume the appropriate distance  and then, secondly, that we take a deep breath. The emotions we have  seen on the floor on both sides of the aisle are reflected in homes  across America, where families are very emotional at this moment as we  face this public health crisis. It is no surprise that it is reflected  on the floor of the Senate. We are going to solve this problem, and we  are going to do it in a timely way, which the American people expect of  us.   We have had two measures now that have come before us--one for $8  billion and another for $100 billion--that were addressed on a  bipartisan basis with an agreement. This will be as well.   Now, as for this argument that we can't spare 1 minute, that we can't  spare 1 day, I understand the sense of urgency.   The House of Representatives passed the second bill, the $100 billion  bill, in the early morning hours of Saturday. When did the Senate pass  the bill? It passed it on Wednesday--more than 4 days later.   With regard to this $100 billion bill, which included medical leave,  accelerated access to unemployment compensation, food, new Medicaid  payments to States, a guarantee that you would never have to pay for a  test, the Republican leader waited 4 days to call that bill. His  argument was, Wait a minute; the paperwork is not here. Well, I checked  on that because the Senator from Idaho raised it on the floor, and it  turns out that, as we have many, many times--and we were prepared  here--by consent, you can move on a measure before the paper actually  comes across from the other body.    I will yield.    Mr. President, I might say to my friend from Idaho that  it is not unusual for us to move on a measure before the bill, the  paper, has come across the rotunda. We do it by consent. Yes, it  happens here, and we were prepared to do it again.    Mr. President, if time remains on the Republicans' side,  they can use it as they wish.    Mr. President, I will not yield at this moment. I want to  finish my comment as I allowed the Senator from South Dakota to finish  his. I hope the Senator from Arkansas will show me that respect. Thank  you.   Measures that have been raised this morning are important measures,  and for the most part, my colleagues are pushing an open door.   The Rubio-Cardin plan is one that I support. It is supported on a  bipartisan basis. I think it is an excellent idea for dealing with the  challenges of restaurants and small businesses. I support it. There is  no issue in terms of whether that will be included in the final  package. I believe it will, and I certainly hope it will.   As for the notion of cash payments that was brought to us by the  White House, I don't hear any objection whatsoever on the Democratic  side of the aisle to it.   With regard to the notion of extending unemployment insurance and  providing additional benefits within unemployment insurance, I guess we  are going to argue as to who came up with the idea first, but both  sides agree on that basic idea.   So these proposals that have been brought before us are not in  controversy, as I understand it, in the negotiations that are underway.  The thing that I was concerned about and that Senator Schumer  addressed--and Senator Manchin raised the same issue--was really  focusing on the threshold issue of the capacity of our healthcare  system to deal with this public health crisis.   When we heard the Governor of New York this morning suggest that the  hospitals of that State will have to increase their capacity by 50  percent and that it will still not be enough, it is a suggestion to all  of us that we need to start with healthcare and hospitals. It was our  feeling that the bill Senator McConnell tried to move yesterday was not  adequate. It didn't provide the necessary resources for that. When we  return to this measure--it has been said by Senator Schumer and others  that it could be today, and I pray that it will be--I think you will  find additional resources for hospitals and healthcare. In my State,  that is a critical element.   Let me also talk about the fact that we are dealing with a bill of  great importance and great magnitude. Reflect  [[Page S1925]]  for a moment that the amount of money we are talking about in this bill  is roughly equivalent to the entire Federal Government's domestic  discretionary budget in 1 year. We are dealing with this bill, as we  should, on an urgent basis. We should take care to make sure we do the  best we can but to not wait for the perfect. Let's make sure we have  something that is good and responsive to the needs we have   I also think that the measure yesterday that was pushed by Senator  McConnell did not provide adequate resources to State and local  governments. When I talk to my Governor in Illinois, Governor Pritzker,  they are spending money in ways they never dreamed of in order to deal  with this public health crisis. They are also seeing more unemployment  insurance benefits being claimed than we ever have in our history. We  need to help the State and local governments, and that was one of the  objections we had to the bill yesterday. We didn't feel that it was  adequate.   When it comes to corporations and providing help to businesses, large  and small, count me in. I am one of those Democrats who stood for the  stimulus package that President Obama brought before us because I  thought it was necessary. I still believe we did the right thing in  passing that stimulus package when many on the other side of the aisle  did not. Part of that package helped larger corporations, and so be it,  for I thought that was necessary. Yet we learned a bitter lesson. Many  times, the benefits being given to those corporations and the tax  breaks being given to them translated into stock buybacks, whereby they  took the money and ran. We don't want that to happen again.   Arguing for transparency and accountability on the money that goes to  any business, large or small, is not unreasonable, and it used to be  bipartisan. We are arguing over that, debating over that, and  negotiating over that at this minute.   Let me also say that I continue to be amazed at the references to the  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. She really unnerves a lot of people  on that side of the aisle. She is the Speaker of the House, you know,  and the measure--whatever we do here--will be headed over there for  consideration. The fact that she would want to be party to that  negotiation is not an outrageous idea. It happens to be consistent with  the bicameral system of government that we have.   The Senator from Kentucky got up and talked about how she came into  the meeting and ruined the whole meeting by asserting herself as the  Speaker of the House. It is reasonable for her to do that. In fact, the  suggestion by Senator Schumer at the outset was that we have the four  corners--the four leaders, the Democrats and Republicans--and a  representative of the White House for this negotiation. That approach  was rejected by the Senator from Kentucky. We will do our own, he says.  We will get back to you when we have a Republican plan. It was not  bipartisan from the start, and it should be all the way. It is the only  way it will work.   Let me say for a moment that if and when we have reached an  agreement--and I pray that it will be done under the circumstances--and  if and when we vote for cloture on the motion to proceed, at that  point, the Senator from Kentucky can offer any amendment he wishes. At  that point, I hope that we will have an agreement and that we will all  agree to do it in a quick fashion. Yet this idea that it is going to be  instantaneous as soon as we vote for the motion on cloture on the  motion to proceed is not a fact, and it hasn't been for a long time.   Let me just conclude by making an observation on something related to  our meeting here today and what is going on in the United States of  America. Five of our Members did not vote yesterday on the Republican  side of the aisle. One has been diagnosed as having COVID-19, and the  other four are self-quarantining because of the concern about their own  health, which is natural. It is naive for us to believe this will be  the end of this challenge to our membership.   I implore Senators to consider the bipartisan measure that Senator  Portman and I have offered for remote voting. We should not be  physically present on this floor at this moment. We know better, and  our staff is subjected to whatever we bring on the floor in terms of  viral load. Let's think about this in human terms. Too many of our  colleagues and their families are falling prey to this disease. We  should change the rules of the Senate to reflect humanity and reality.  It is the 21st century. Voting in a remote fashion, as I have suggested  with Senator Portman, is the best way, I think, to protect us and our  families from further problems from a health viewpoint.   Let me close by saying a final word on this. Senator Schumer came to  the floor and didn't say, with arms crossed, we are stonewalling. He  said he had to leave the floor to go back and negotiate. With whom? He  left the floor to negotiate with the Republican leaders from the White  House and, perhaps, from other places. That is the way it should be.   We are going to get this done today. Take a deep breath. Everybody is  emotional at this moment on both sides of the aisle, but we have a job  to do, and we are going to get it done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?    I yield to the Senator from Montana.    Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?    Mr. President, let me just say, strike a responsible  distance and take a deep breath. We are going to pass this bill--not  the one that Senator McConnell brought before us yesterday but a  version of that, which I think is a dramatic improvement.   My prayer is that bill is going to include even more money than the  McConnell bill when it comes to dealing with the healthcare crisis we  face and the challenge we face--more money for hospitals, more money  for providers, and more money for equipment, and we are going to have  to come back again, I am sorry to say, if this continues, to make sure  we put even greater investment in the men and women who will save our  lives across this country.   Secondly, we want to make certain that this McConnell bill is  improved when it comes to accountability for the taxpayer dollars given  to the largest corporations in America. Some of us feel burned by what  has happened with some of those corporations in the past when we  trusted their leadership to build their companies and help their  employees, but, instead, they built up their own bank accounts at the  expense of their employees. We don't want to return to those days. I am  sure the Republicans don't either. We want language in this bill that  moves this in the direction of accountability and transparency when it  comes to spending taxpayers' dollars by major corporations.   Third, never overlook the need of State and local governments. They  have been waiting, begging, and pleading with the administration in the  White House to give national leadership. Absent that, they have taken  on the responsibility themselves. They are asking us to stand behind  them as they make these difficult decisions, State by State by State,  because the White House refuses to make these same decisions. We need  to provide the resources to do that. State and local governments need  that help, and I believe the McConnell bill could be improved by  providing more resources in that regard.   There are so many bipartisan things that we do agree upon in this  bill. Let's get these things right. As Senator Murphy of Connecticut  said, if we don't get it right in terms of dealing with the  coronavirus, we can't put enough money on the table for economic  recovery. Let's do it.   I am sorry we are going to this roll call. It is not an indication of  the progress that I believe has been made since yesterday in  negotiating a bipartisan approach to improving the McConnell bill.    I think it is time to recognize that.   Thank you.                                Cloture Motion
