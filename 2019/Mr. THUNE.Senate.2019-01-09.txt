 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I think it is important that we remind  ourselves about what it takes to make a law here in Washington, DC. It  obviously takes passage of a bill by the House of Representatives,  passage by the Senate, and a Presidential signature. Obviously, we are  in the middle of sort of a, I guess you could say, fight right now  between the executive branch--the President--and Democrats in the House  and the Senate, which normally would be resolved by the two sides  sitting down and negotiating and coming to some sort of an agreement or  compromise. That, frankly, is what is going to be necessary to resolve  the current crisis we are in.   The Democrats in the Congress have the majority in the House. It  takes 60 votes, as we know, to do anything in the Senate, which means  it will take somewhere around the order of 10 Senate Democrats in order  to put a piece of legislation on the President's desk.   There has to be a negotiation. There have to be two sides at the  table. The Democrats have made it very clear in the Senate and in the  House that they have no interest in negotiating with the President.   Furthermore, they have determined that they are going to shut down  all the rest of the business that is being done in the Senate simply  because they do not want to provide funding for the border wall that  has been requested by the President. That is the standoff we are  currently in the middle of.   I will remind our colleagues that as recently as last month, my  friend the Democratic leader said that in order for us to proceed and  vote on anything in either Chamber, we need to have a piece of  legislation that the President has said he would agree to sign, which,  again, suggests the way out of this is for the Democrats to come to the  table and enter into a negotiation with the President about how to fund  the border wall, how to deal with the issue of border security, and  then to open up the government. That is the way this ultimately gets  resolved.  [[Page S80]]    It seems to me, at least from my observation so far, that there has  been no movement, zero movement--zero movement--on the part of the  Democrats when it comes to trying to resolve the current situation.   I will simply say that I agree with what the Democratic leader said  as recently as December; that is, in order for either Chamber--the  House or the Senate--to vote on a compromise piece of legislation, it  needs to be a piece of legislation that the President of the United  States has said he will sign.   Each of these elements has to come together, and, obviously, each is  very relevant in this conversation. You cannot have a law without a  Presidential signature. There are 535 Members of Congress. There is  only one President of the United States, only one person who can sign a  bill into law. Obviously, the President is a critical player in this  conversation.   Of course, the Democrats, as I said, have the majority in the House  of Representatives. It takes 60 votes to do anything in the Senate. I  think we have a majority of Senators who would vote today to provide  the funding that is necessary to secure our borders, the funding that  the President has requested, but it is going to take a number of  Democrats, perhaps as many as 7 to 10 Democrats, in order for us to  pass a bill in the Senate.   The Democrats are very relevant in this conversation. They are not  irrelevant. They have to be at the table. Normally a negotiation starts  with the two sides saying ``This is where I am, and this is where I  am'' and figuring out how to reach that common ground, how to reach  that middle and structure an agreement that could pass both the House  and the Senate and receive a Presidential signature.   That is not what is happening right now. I think we all know that. I  think it is very clear that the Democrats are very dug in; they have  not moved a single inch off of their position from the time that this  whole shutdown started. I think there is a path forward. I am hopeful  that negotiations, discussions that will continue later today at the  White House, will lead us to a conclusion, to an outcome, and to a  result that gets Federal employees back to work, making sure the  government continues to function and run but also addressing a critical  and important priority for all of us as policymakers; that is, ensuring  that we secure our border in a way to protect the American people.   I think it should go without saying that border security is a basic  national security requirement. Countries have to secure their borders.  They need to know who is coming into their country, and they need to be  able to keep people who shouldn't be entering the country, such as  criminals and drug traffickers, out. Making sure that our borders are  secure is one of our most essential responsibilities of Members of  Congress. It is a basic obligation, like making sure our military is  capable of defending our country. While border security is always a  national security imperative, it is particularly important right now  because we have not only a security but a humanitarian crisis at our  border.   Over the past year, illegal border crossing apprehensions have shot  up by more than 30 percent. An average of 60,000 individuals try to  cross our southern border illegally each month. This represents a  serious security concern. Among those trying to cross our southern  border are drug dealers, gang members, human traffickers, and other  criminals.   This flood of attempted border crossings also represents a serious  humanitarian concern. Individuals attempting the journey to come here  illegally are vulnerable to exploitation, illness, and abuse. One out  of every three women attempting the journey to the United States is  sexually assaulted. A staggering 70 percent of individuals become  victims of violence along the way. Illness and other medical issues are  serious problems. Fifty migrants a day are referred for medical care,  and Customs and Border Protection rescues 4,300 people in distress  every single year.   There is a direct way to stem this crisis, and that is to promote  legal immigration and discourage people from coming here illegally. How  do we discourage people from attempting to come here illegally? Well, I  would argue we enforce our immigration laws and prevent individuals  from illegally crossing our borders.   I have mentioned the dangerous individuals who can sneak across our  porous borders and the humanitarian crisis we face, but of course there  are even more dangers posed by the weaknesses in our border, both  around barriers and through our ports of entry, such as the illegal  drugs that are pouring into the country.   Every week in this country, 300 Americans die from heroin. Ninety  percent of the heroin supply--90 percent--flows across our southern  border. In 2017, opioids were involved in the deaths of almost 50,000  Americans. Roughly half or more of those deaths involved fentanyl, and  a lot of that fentanyl is coming across our borders illegally. Federal  agents have seen a 115-percent increase in the amount of fentanyl  seized between ports of entry. One key part of addressing the opioid  epidemic in our country is shutting down the flow of illegal drugs  across our porous borders.   Democrats used to understand the need for border security. In 2009,  the Democratic leader here in the Senate said:         Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the       American people are convinced that we will stop future flows       of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing       with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now and       on rationalizing our system of legal immigration. That's       plain and simple and unavoidable.    That is from the Democratic leader here in the Senate in 2009.   In 2006, the Democratic leader and the ranking member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee voted for legislation to authorize a border fence.  They were joined in their vote by then-Senator Biden, then-Senator  Clinton, and then-Senator Obama.   In 2013, every Senate Democrat supported legislation requiring the  completion of a 700-mile fence along our southern border. This  legislation would have provided $46 billion for border security and $8  billion specifically for a physical barrier.   Nearly every Senate Democrat supported $25 billion in border security  funding just last February, and I suspect that more than one Democrat  still understands that we desperately need to improve security at our  borders. But the Democratic leadership refuses to play ball. More than  2 weeks into this shutdown, they are still not willing to negotiate a  solution that would secure our borders and reopen the government.  Democratic leaders are willing to ignore the security and humanitarian  crisis at the southern border simply because they don't like this  President and because they are afraid to oppose the far-left wing of  their party.   We need to end this partial shutdown, and we need to reopen the  government, but the only way for that to happen is for Democrats to  work with Republicans and the President to provide adequate funding for  border security. Once they negotiate in good faith toward a serious  agreement that the President will sign, the Senate will immediately  take it up so that we can end this shutdown and take needed steps to  bolster security at our borders.   Border security is not some issue Republicans have somehow dreamed  up. Securing our borders is a national security imperative, and both  parties have a responsibility to make sure our Nation's borders are  protected. I hope Democrats here in the Senate will remember their  obligation to our Nation's citizens and work with the President to  secure our borders and reopen our government. I would end where I  started, and that is to say that in order for that to happen, there has  to be an agreement. Both sides have to come to the table. The  President, the House, and the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, are  all relevant in this conversation because it takes all to accomplish a  legislative result that will reopen our government, get Federal  employees back to work, and at the same time take the important steps  that are necessary to secure our border.   I yield the floor.
