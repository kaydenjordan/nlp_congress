 Madam Speaker, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a  time to call attention to this deadly disease, to recognize the  advancement our Nation has made in the battle against breast cancer,  and to spread information about the fight to save the lives of those  impacted.   It is estimated that more than 275,000 new cases of breast cancer  will be diagnosed this year. For this reason, it is vital that those at  risk take proper steps to reduce their risk for this disease.   Our medical personnel have made great progress in our fight to cure  breast cancer, but we must continue to do more.   Madam Speaker, I hope everybody will join me this month in spreading  awareness about breast cancer, comforting those who have been impacted  or are fighting cancer right now, and thanking our medical personnel  for their dedication to treat and cure this deadly disease.                            ____________________
