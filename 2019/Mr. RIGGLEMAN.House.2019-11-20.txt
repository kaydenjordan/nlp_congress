 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of the  American Dream; in favor of the bedrock of what has made America:  capitalism.   Yesterday, while every cable news channel was transfixed by the  Intelligence Committee, the Financial Services Committee was discussing  a bill that strikes at the heart of American capitalism.   H.R. 3848, the companion legislation to Senator Elizabeth Warren's  Stop Wall Street Looting Act, would add regulatory costs and harm job  creators. It has a pithy title that is, unfortunately, misleading in  purpose. I prefer to call it the stop entrepreneurship act.   This bill would curb private investments in Main Street companies,  which would kill jobs, stifle innovation, harm consumers, and strike a  major blow to the hallmark of capitalism.  [[Page H9068]]    According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, even a modest scenario  would result in the loss of 6.2 million to 24.3 million jobs across the  country. As a small business owner who benefited from private equity  when growing my business, I know the value of these types of  organizations that provide support and really give a way forward for  companies trying to grow.                            ____________________
