 What is a high crime? How about if an important       person hurts somebody of low means? It is not very scholarly,       but I think it's the truth. I think that's what they meant by       high crimes. It doesn't have to be a crime. It is just--when       you start using your office and you're acting in a way that       hurts people, you have committed a high crime.    Mr. Manager NADLER. There are many reasons why high crimes and  misdemeanors are not and cannot be limited to violations of the  Criminal Code. We address them at length in the briefs we have filed  and in the report of the House Judiciary Committee respecting these  Articles of Impeachment, but I would like to highlight a few especially  important considerations. I will tick through them quickly.   First, there is the matter of the historical record. The Framers  could not have meant to limit impeachment to statutory crimes.  Presidents are to be impeached and removed from office for ``treason,  bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' but bribery was not  made a statutory crime until 1837.   Second, the President's position is contradicted by the  Constitution's text. The Framers repeatedly referred to ``crimes,''  ``offenses,'' and ``punishment'' elsewhere in the Constitution, but  here they refer to ``high Crimes.'' That matters. It matters because  the phrase ``high Crimes'' refers to offenses against the State rather  than to workaday crimes, and it matters because the phrase ``high  crimes and misdemeanors'' had a rich history in England, where it had  been applied in many, many cases that did not involve crimes under  British law. When the Framers added ``high Crimes'' here but  nowhere else in the Constitution, they made a deliberate choice. Any  doubt in that score is dispelled by the Framers' own statements.    In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachable  offenses are defined fundamentally by ``the abuse or violation of some  public trust.''   A few years later, James Wilson, a Constitutional Convention  delegate, agreed with Hamilton.   Wilson stated:         Impeachments, and offences and offenders impeachable, come       not . . . within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence. They       are founded on different principles, governed by different       maxims, and are directed to different objects.    George Mason expressed concern that the President might abuse the  pardon power to ``screen from punishment those whom he had secretly  instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his  own guilt.'' Sound familiar?   James Madison responded directly to Mason's concern because Mason's  concern was that the pardon power might be too broad and the President  might misuse his broad pardon power to pardon his own coconspirators  and prevent a discovery of his own guilt.   Madison responded:         If the President be connected, in any suspicious manner,       with any person, and there be grounds to believe he will       shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him;       they can remove him if found guilty.    At the North Carolina ratifying convention, James Iredell, who would  go on to serve on the Supreme Court, responded to the same concern. He  assured delegates that if the President abused his power with ``some  corrupt motive or other,'' he would be ``liable for impeachment.''   In the early 1800s, this understanding was echoed by Supreme Court  Justice Story, who wrote a famous treatise on the Constitution. There,  he rejected the equation of crimes and impeachable offenses, which, he  stated, ``must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles  of public policy and duty.''   Later in American history, Chief Justice and former President William  Howard Taft, as well as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, publicly  stated that impeachable offenses are not limited to crimes but,  instead, capture a broader range of misconduct. Indeed, under Chief  Justice Taft, the Supreme Court unanimously observed that abuse of the  President's pardon power to frustrate the enforcement of court orders  ``would suggest resort to impeachment.'' Now, notice, pardon power is  unlimited. What they are saying here is the abuse of the pardon power.  Abuse of the pardon power for a corrupt motive is impeachable.   If all of that authority is not enough to convince you, there is  more.   Historians have shown that American colonists before the Revolution  and American States after the Revolution but before 1787 all impeached  officials for noncriminal conduct. Over the past two centuries,  moreover, a strong majority of the impeachments voted by the House have  included one or more allegations that did not charge a violation of  criminal law. Indeed, the Senate has convicted and removed multiple  judges on noncriminal grounds.   Judge Archbald was removed in 1912 for noncriminal speculation in  coal properties.   Judge Ritter was removed in 1936 for the noncriminal offense of  bringing his court ``into scandal and disrepute.'' During Judge  Ritter's case, one of my predecessors as chairman of the House  Judiciary Committee stated expressly: ``We do not assume the  responsibility  [[Page S493]]  . . . of proving that the respondent is guilty of a crime as that term  is known in criminal jurisprudence.'' What is true for judges is also  true for Presidents, at least on this point.   The House Judiciary Committee approved three Articles of Impeachment  against President Nixon. Each of them encompassed many acts that did  not violate Federal law. One of the articles--obstruction of Congress-- involved no allegations of any legal violation.   It is worth reflecting on why President Nixon was forced to resign.  Most Americans are familiar with the story. The House Judiciary  Committee approved Articles of Impeachment in July 1974. Those articles  passed with bipartisan support, although most Republicans stood by  President Nixon.   Then the smoking gun tape came out. Within a week, almost everyone  who supported the President the week before changed his position, and  the President was forced to resign because of what was revealed on the  smoking gun tape. Within a week, Senator Goldwater and others from the  Senate went to the President and said: You won't have a single vote in  the Senate. You must resign, or you will be removed from office because  of the evidence on the smoking gun tape.   But what was on the smoking gun tape? The smoking gun tape had  recordings of President Nixon's instructing White House officials to  pressure the CIA and the FBI to end the Watergate investigation. No law  explicitly prohibited that conversation--it was not, in that sense, a  crime--but President Nixon had abused his power. He had tried to use  two government agencies--the FBI and the CIA--for his personal benefit.  His impeachment and removal were certain, and he announced his  resignation within days.   Decades later, in President Clinton's case, the Judiciary Committee's  report on the Articles of Impeachment stated: ``The actions of  President Clinton do not have to rise to the level of violating the  federal statute regarding obstruction of justice in order to justify  impeachment.''   There is, thus, overwhelming authority against restricting  impeachments to violations of established or statutory law. Every  relevant principle of constitutional law compels that result. So does  common sense.   Impeachment is not a punishment for crimes. Impeachment exists to  address threats to the political system, applies only to political  officials, and responds not by imprisonment or fines but only by  stripping political power.   It would make no sense to say that a President who engages in  horrific abuses must be allowed to remain in office unless Congress had  anticipated his or her specific conduct in advance and written a  statute expressly outlawing it. For one thing, that would be  practically impossible. As Justice Story observed, the threats posed by  Presidential abuse ``are of so various and complex a character'' that  it would be ``almost absurd'' to attempt a comprehensive list.   The Constitution is not a suicide pact. It does not leave us stuck  with Presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten  our security and democracy.   Until recently it did not occur to me that our President would call a  foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his  political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid  that the President was already required by law to provide.   No one anticipated that a President would stoop to this misconduct,  and Congress has passed no specific law to make this behavior a crime.   Yet this is precisely the kind of abuse that the Framers had in mind  when they wrote the impeachment clause and when they charged Congress  with determining when the President's conduct was so clearly wrong, so  definitely beyond the pale, so threatening to the constitutional order  as to require his removal, and that is why we are here today.   You must judge for yourselves whether justice will be had for  President Trump's crimes against our freedom and the Constitution.   I will conclude by highlighting a few points that merit special  emphasis, as you apply the law of impeachment to President Trump's  misconduct.   First, impeachment is not for petty offenses. The President's conduct  must constitute, as Mason put it, a great and dangerous offense against  the Nation--offenses that threaten the Constitution.   Second, impeachable offenses involve wrongdoing that reveal the  President as a continuing threat if he is allowed to remain in office.  In other words, we fully recognize that impeachment does not exist for  a mistake. It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or  unpopular. Impeachment is reserved for deliberate decisions by the  President to embark on a course of conduct that betrays his oath of  office and does violence to the Constitution.   When the President has engaged in such conduct, and when there is  strong evidence that he will do so again--when he has told us he will  do so again, when he has told us that it is OK to invite interference  from a foreign power into our next election--the case for removal is at  its peak.   This is certainly the case when he invites, indeed, attempts to  compel a foreign government to help him subvert the integrity of our  next election. There can be no greater threat to the Republic.   Finally, high crimes and misdemeanors involve conduct that is  recognizably wrong to a reasonable, honorable citizen. The Framers  adopted a standard for impeachment that could stand the test of time.  At the same time, the structure of the Constitution implies that  impeachable offenses should not come as a surprise. Impeachment is  aimed at Presidents who act as if they are above the law, at Presidents  who believe their own interests are more important than those of the  Nation, and, thus, at Presidents who ignore right and wrong in pursuit  of their own gain.   Abuse, betrayal, corruption. Here are each of core offenses that the  Framers feared most: The President's abuse of power, his betrayal of  the national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly  qualify as great and dangerous offenses.   President Trump has made clear in word and deed that he will persist  in such conduct if he is not removed from power. He poses a continuing  threat to our Nation, to the integrity of our elections, and to our  Democratic order. He must not remain in power one moment longer.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel, we will now walk through the President's abuse of power, the  corrupt object of his scheme, his three official acts carrying out his  scheme, his attempted coverup and exposure, and the harm to our Nation  and continuing threat caused by his misconduct.   Let's start first with the object of the President's scheme.   Senators, we have today provided handouts that you can follow along  in our slides.   So as this first slide indicates, in this portion of our  presentation, we will discuss the evidence that shows overwhelmingly  that President Trump directed this scheme with corrupt intent, with one  corrupt objective: to obtain foreign assistance in his reelection bid  in the 2020 United States Presidential election.   We will walk through first how the President wanted Ukraine to help  in his reelection campaign. He wanted Ukraine to publicly announce two  investigations: one into his political rival Joe Biden and the second  into the debunked conspiracy theory relating to Ukraine interference in  the 2016 election. President Trump himself later confirmed this intent  in public statements.   We will then explain how we know these investigations were solely for  President Trump's personal, political gain.   First, President Trump made clear he cared only about the  announcement--the announcement of the investigations, not the actual  investigations.   Second, President Trump similarly made clear he cared only about the  ``big stuff.'' The ``big stuff'' meaning his political investigations.    Third, he used his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, who repeatedly  told us he was pursuing the investigations in his capacity as the  President's personal lawyer and that this wasn't about foreign policy.   Fourth and fifth, there is no real dispute that these investigations  were never part of an official U.S. policy, and they in fact went  outside official channels. The Department of Justice  [[Page S494]]  even publicly confirmed that they were never asked to talk to Ukraine  about these investigations--never.   Six, multiple officials who knew what was going on repeatedly  reported these concerns to supervisors and even the NSC legal advisors.   Seven, Ukraine expressed concerns multiple times that these were  political investigations and Ukraine didn't want to get involved in  domestic U.S. politics.   Eight, the White House tried to bury the call.   Nine, President Trump himself told us what he really wanted and cared  about in his own words, in many public statements.   And finally, despite the President's counsel's attempts to justify  his actions, the evidence makes clear that President Trump did not care  about anticorruption efforts in Ukraine. This was only about one thing:  his political investigations.   If you are following along on the slide, now, as I mentioned, the  object of the President's scheme is clear: two investigations to help  his political reelection.   The Constitution grants the President broad authority to conduct U.S.  foreign policy. He is our Commander in Chief and chief diplomat. When  the President of the United States calls a foreign leader, a  President's first and only objective should be to get foreign leaders  to do what is best for the U.S. national interest, consistent with the  faithful execution of his oath of office and consistent with official  U.S. policy.   But on July 25, when President Trump called the President of Ukraine,  President Trump did the opposite. Instead of following official U.S.  talking points, instead of listening to his staff on what was important  to our national interests, President Trump asked Ukraine for something  that benefited only himself: his political investigations. And not only  did these investigations diverge from U.S. national interests, as you  will hear, President Trump's actions harmed our national security. In  putting himself above our country, he put our country at risk, and that  is why his actions are so dangerous.   Now let's take a moment and look carefully at the two investigations  that President Trump sought from Ukraine, which are at the heart of the  President's scheme, and how he stood to benefit politically from  Ukraine's announcement of each.   As you can see on the slide, the first investigation was, of course,  of former Vice President Biden. Let's go straight to that July 25  telephone call again where President Trump stated clearly each of these  investigations he wanted.   So let's start with Vice President Joe Biden and the removal of a  corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine.   The first investigation related to former Vice President Joe Biden  and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, on whose board his son  Hunter Biden used to sit.   President Trump himself summarized the theory behind his request in  broad strokes in his July 25 call with President Zelensky. Here is what  he said:         The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,       that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want       to find out about that so that whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look it . . .       It sounds horrible to me.    Now let's look carefully at the investigation President Trump was  asking for and what it was based on. In short, President Trump asked  for the investigation into Biden based on a made-up theory that no one  agreed with--no one. We will go into this in more detail, but at a high  level, the allegation is that late in 2015, Biden pressured Ukraine to  remove the then-prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, by threatening to  withhold approximately $1 billion in loan guarantees if he was not  removed.   According to this theory, Vice President Biden did this in order to  help his son in a company called Burisma. Vice President Biden's son  sat on the board of Burisma.   As the theory goes, Vice President Biden tried to remove Ukraine's  prosecutor, all to make sure the prosecutor wouldn't investigate that  specific company Burisma because, again, his son was on the board.   Then, Senators, if that doesn't sound farfetched and complicated to  you, it should. So let's take this step-by-step and start from the  beginning.   In 2014, Vice President Biden's son Hunter joined the board of the  Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. At the time, Burisma's  owner, a Ukrainian oligarch and former government minister, was under  investigation.   In 2015, Viktor Shokin became Ukraine's prosecutor general, a job  similar to Attorney General in the United States.   Although Shokin vowed to keep investigating Burisma amid an  international push to root out corruption in Ukraine, he allowed the  Burisma investigation to go dormant--allowed it to go dormant. That is  when he was removed. He was not actively investigating Burisma. He had  let it go dormant. Moreover, Shokin was widely perceived as ineffective  and corrupt.   George Kent, the second most senior official at the U.S. Embassy in  Kyiv at the time described Shokin as ``a typical Ukraine prosecutor who  lived a lifestyle far in excess of his government salary, who never  prosecuted anybody known for having committed a crime and covered up  crimes that were known to have been committed.''   In late 2015, Vice President Biden, who had assumed a significant  role in U.S. policy toward Ukraine, publicly called for the removal of  Mr. Shokin because of his failure--his failure--to adequately combat  corruption. But Vice President Biden wasn't alone. The European Union,  our European allies, the International Monetary Fund, and three  reformers inside Ukraine also wanted Mr. Shokin removed to reform the  Ukrainian prosecutor general's office--to reform it.   Reforming the prosecutor general's office was also supported on a  bipartisan basis by the Ukrainian Caucus here in the Senate. On  February 12, 2016, after Vice President Biden had urged removal of Mr.  Shokin but before the Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove him, a  bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators Portman, Durbin,  Shaheen, Ron Johnson, Murphy, Kirk, Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown sent  a letter to President Poroshenko that urged him to make urgent reforms  to the prosecutor general's office. The month after the Senators sent  that letter, Mr. Shokin was fired. He was fired.   So let's be very clear. Vice President Biden called for the removal  of this prosecutor at the official direction of U.S. policy, because  the prosecutor was widely perceived as corrupt, and with the support of  all of our international allies. His actions were therefore supported  by the executive branch, Congress, and the international community.   Common sense would tell us that this allegation against Joe Biden is  false and that there was no legitimate basis for any investigation. But  there are several other reasons you know that the only reason President  Trump wanted Ukraine to announce the investigation into Biden was  solely for his very own personal benefit.   If you look at the slide, we will summarize some points.   First, none of the 17 witnesses in the House's inquiry said there was  any factual basis for this allegation--not 1 of the 17. To the  contrary, they testified it was false.   Second, as I mentioned, the former prosecutor general Vice President  Biden tried to remove was widely considered to be corrupt and failed to  investigate corruption in Ukraine. Thus, removing him from office would  only increase the chances that Burisma would be investigated for  possible corruption.   Third, because the prosecutor was so corrupt, Vice President Biden  calling for his removal was also at the direction of official U.S.  policy and undertaken with the unanimous support of our allies.   Fourth, the successor to the fired Ukrainian prosecutor general  admitted that Vice President Biden's son didn't do anything wrong in  connection with Burisma. So the entire premise of the investigation  that the President wanted Ukraine to pursue was simply false.   Finally, President Trump didn't care about any of this until 2019,  when Vice President Biden became the frontrunner for the Democratic  Presidential nomination and polls showed that he had the largest head- to-head lead against President Trump. That became a problem.  [[Page S495]]    Let's start with the first and second points. Vice President Biden's  conduct was uniformly validated by the witnesses in the House  investigation, who confirmed his conduct was consistent with U.S.  policy. Every single witness who was asked about the allegations  against Biden said it was false. They testified that he acted properly.  Every witness with knowledge of this issue testified that Vice  President Biden was carrying out official U.S. policy in calling for  Shokin's removal because Shokin was corrupt. These witnesses explained,  too, that the United States was not alone in this view. All of our  European allies also supported this action. There is simply no  evidence--nothing, nada--in the record to support this baseless  allegation.   I would like to go through some of that testimony now.   First, here are Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes: Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
