 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into my remarks, there is  just some floor business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are four measures at  the desk that are due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the measures on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to their further proceeding en  bloc.    Mr. President, first, I believe this is the first time  our new Senator from Vermont is sitting in the Chair.   Congratulations. There will be many more opportunities just like  this.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as the debate over raising the debt  ceiling continues, Leader McConnell said something yesterday that, I  think, is right on the mark. He said that when it comes to moving a  debt ceiling proposal through Congress, the House should go first. He  is correct. Not only should the House go first, but they must quickly  show the American people what their plan actually is for avoiding a  first-ever default on the national debt. So far, we haven't heard  anything beyond vague and troubling talking points about the need to  cut Federal spending. That is not going to fly when you are in the  majority, as Speaker McCarthy, of course, is. The substance and details  make all the difference. The debt ceiling is not some political game,  and Speaker McCarthy has an obligation to level with the American  people on what precisely the new House plans to do in order to avoid a  default.   President Biden and the Speaker have reportedly agreed to sit down in  the near future on this topic, and the Speaker is apparently heralding  this development as some sort of big win or concession. But look,  Speaker McCarthy sitting down without a clear plan is no win. Sitting  down to talk about the debt ceiling without a plan is like coming to  the table with no cards. President Biden, meanwhile, has a plan. He has  cards. He has been clear that there must be no brinksmanship and no  default on the debt ceiling.   Speaker McCarthy, what about you? The House GOP is threatening  spending cuts. Well, what are they? why the evasion? Why is your  conference hiding from the American people?   House Republicans, where are your cards?   Again, I want to be clear that the debt ceiling is a subject of the  highest consequence, and using it as a bargaining chip--using it as  brinksmanship, as hostage-taking--as Republicans are trying to do, is  exceedingly dangerous because if the House of Representatives continues  on their current course and allows the United States to default on its  debt obligations, every single American is going to pay a terrible and  expensive price.   The consequences of default are not some theoretical abstraction. If  default happens, Americans will see the consequences in their daily  lives. Interest rates will go soaring on everything from credit cards  and student loans to cars, mortgages, and more. That is thousands of  dollars for each American going right out the door. That will happen  and through no fault of their own.   Retirement plans, like 401(k)s, would lose their value, robbing  people of their hard-earned livelihoods. For millions  [[Page S81]]  of Americans who one day dream of owning a home--their own piece of the  rock--a default would add $130,000 to the lifetime cost of a new home.  Imagine spending years putting a little bit of your paycheck aside  every month in order to buy a house, only to find out that suddenly  that dream is entirely out of reach because radical politicians in  Washington bumbled their way into a financial catastrophe. That is  precisely the danger we approach, thanks to the House GOP's reckless  approach to the debt ceiling.   None of this need be inevitable or even likely if only House  Republicans would quit their radical posturing and work with Democrats  in a serious way to raise the debt ceiling together, and we should do  it soon, not months from now when America finds itself staring straight  into the abyss of a financial catastrophe.   I would remind my Republican colleagues they did it before, when  Trump was President, three times, with no Democratic obstruction or  hostage-taking, and we did it once together when Biden was President.  Much of this debt comes from spending when Trump was President, voted  on by a Republican House and a Republican Senate. So it is a bit of  hypocrisy now to say that they can't do it again and are holding it  hostage and are playing a dangerous form of brinksmanship. It shouldn't  matter who is President. These are still bills we already incurred that  must be paid for the good of all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the Republican national sales tax, the  House Republicans keep churning this stuff out. It is unbelievable. In  the 118th Congress, it is already a tale of two parties: Democrats  united on one side, Republicans in chaos on the other.   While Democrats are laser-focused on making life better for everyday  families, Republicans are making it clear they want to help the very,  very wealthy--the ultrarich. While Democrats want to embrace  collaboration and bipartisanship wherever possible, Republicans seem to  be trapped by MAGA extremism. That is the contrast in a nutshell:  Democratic unity versus Republican chaos, Democratic unity versus  Republican chaos.    Yesterday, I joined with President Biden, the Vice President, Leader  Jeffries, and Democratic colleagues from both Chambers to talk about  how we Democrats can maintain our unity and turn it into action in  order to help the American people.   Later today, I will join with Leader Jeffries to further highlight  the contrast between Democrats' ``people first'' agenda and  Republicans' radical plans--radical plans--for a national sales tax.   Multiple extreme-right Republicans say that Speaker McCarthy has  promised them a vote on their national sales tax bill, which they  guilefully refer to as the ``FairTax Act.'' Nothing could be less fair  to the American people. In a universe of bad ideas, a Republican  national sales tax reigns supreme. This proposal, pushed by the MAGA  fringe, who now controls the House Republican conference, would impose  a 30-percent tax on every single purchase Americans make just as  inflation is beginning to drop. This so-called FairTax is truly foul  legislation for American families.   For young families who want to buy a home, well, the Republican tax  plan would add nearly $125,000 extra on top of the price you pay for  your house--an impossible sum for many young people struggling to get  their start in life.   And what about Americans out there thinking of buying a car? Under  the Republican tax plan, the average American would pay $10,000 more on  that single purchase alone.   What about seniors getting ready for retirement? A Republican  national sales tax means people's life savings would suddenly lose 30  percent of their value. Imagine working your entire life, playing by  the rules, paying your taxes, saving a little of each paycheck only to  have Republicans swoop in and erase nearly a third--a third--of what  you have saved up.   And it doesn't end there.   Under the Republican tax plan, a mere trip to the grocery store would  be torture. Eggs are high enough right now at $4.25 a dozen. They would  be $5.50 under the Republican plan. Milk, right now, is $4.40. It would  cost $5.70 under the Republican plan. The same holds true for  everything else: bread, produce, canned goods, cleaning supplies, soap,  shampoo, toothpaste, diapers--you name it. All of it would go up by a  third for millions of families--millions, tens of millions, probably  hundreds of millions. It would be a devastating blow.   But do you know who wouldn't mind a Republican national sales tax?  The ultrarich, the ultrawealthy. The top 1 percent of our earners  wouldn't notice much change in expenses. That is who would win under  the Republicans' proposal--the very, very rich--because their taxes  would be greatly reduced even further, even worse than under the Trump  tax cuts. No wonder, then, that even Grover Norquist--no friend of the  Democrats--calls this bill a ``terrible idea'' and an ``assault on your  retirement savings.''   Look, if Republicans want to start their majority with a debate on  their national sales tax bill, Democrats would welcome it. Let the  American people see which party is fighting for everyday folks and  which party is trying to rig the game in favor of the ultrarich. It is  a debate the American people need to see.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
