 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the selfless men  and women who serve at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. These brave  individuals risk their lives every day to protect our Nation and  enforce our laws. They deserve our admiration and support, not a  ``present'' vote.   It is disgusting and unconscionable that Members of the political  left, Members in this very Chamber, continue to denigrate these  patriots. One prominent gubernatorial candidate declared ICE a  terrorist organization. A House Member called ICE fascist. Another  Member of this body said that ICE agents, who were just doing their  job, were cowardly.   I wish that I was making this up. Talk about shameful statements,  talk about inflammatory statements to a law enforcement agency that is  responsible for the internal enforcement of both our immigration and  customs laws.   Mr. Speaker, these attacks are utterly despicable. While #AbolishICE  might make for a catchy bumper sticker for radical leftists, it is  harmful to our law enforcement.   Today, I join with my colleagues in supporting this resolution and  commending ICE agents for their hard work.
