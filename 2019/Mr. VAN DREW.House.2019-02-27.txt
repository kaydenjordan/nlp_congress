 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment clarifies that the exceptions for gifts and  loans of firearms between parents and their children applies to  stepparents and stepchildren.   The reason I offer this amendment is to recognize that the  relationship between stepparents and stepchildren is sometimes stronger  than or as strong as that of the biological parent-child relationship.   The parents of one of my closest friends are technically stepparents,  but you would never know it, because they are all so close and love  each other so much.   The amendment also clarifies that gifts and loans of firearms among  family members are still subject to the existing legal standard for all  transfers.   Existing law states that no person may deliver a firearm to someone  if he or she has a reason to believe that the person is prohibited from  possessing a firearm.   Consequently, even gifts and loans among family members are not  permissible if the transferor has a reason to believe that the  transferee may use the firearm in a crime or is prohibited from  possessing firearms.   Again, the amendment clarifies that while a background check is not  required for these transfers, the existing legal standard continues to  apply.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the body for its support of my amendment,  and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Van Drew amendment.   This is a good amendment, and I believe it will be helpful, and I  believe it creates an atmosphere which is a fair atmosphere for  everyone to increase safety and yet at the same time to understand the  relationships that do exist in stepfamilies.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
