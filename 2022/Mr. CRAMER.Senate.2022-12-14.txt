 Mr. President, I want to honor the 30 years of  distinguished service of a remarkable North Dakota public servant who  is retiring from office at the end of December.   Alvin Jaeger took office as North Dakota's 14th secretary of state in  January 1993, when I was the executive director of the North Dakota  Republican Party. That year, he and newly elected Governor Ed Schafer  became the second and third Republicans to be voted in to a State  office after several years of Democrats occupying them. Today, all  State office holders are Republicans, the significance of which is not  lost on neither Al nor me.   A Beulah, ND, native, Al came to the Secretary of State's office  having previously served in the North Dakota National Army Guard and  having been a business analyst for the Mobil Oil Corporation, a Fargo  real estate broker, and a high school teacher in western North Dakota.   In his 30 years in office, Al has brought wisdom, intelligence, and  dedication to everything he has undertaken. He has served on the State  Board of University and School Lands, the North Dakota Emergency  Commission, and the State Historical Society of North Dakota, making  his participation in the work of these boards a top priority. Al has  also been active in the National Association of Secretaries of State  and most recently was a member of its executive committee.   When first elected, Al oversaw the development of the office's first  website and subsequently supervised the ever evolving modernization and  digitization of services and information that we now expect to be found  online. He led in updating North Dakota's election code and developing  more sophisticated tracking of election results. He has become the  ``go-to'' authority on issues related to election security and uniform  voter identification. And he and his staff have set a high standard for  election integrity in North Dakota not enjoyed by many other States.   One of the projects Al championed and which will be among the  greatest legacies of his years in office is the North Dakota Blue Book.  This publication traces back to the Territorial Legislature in 1887, 2  years before North Dakota became a State, with early titles more  commonly referred to as ``legislative manuals or handbooks.'' They were  put out sporadically until Al came to office in 1993, when he committed  to resuming a biannual publication of the book. Over these past 30  years, each book has provided a comprehensive chronology of all current  and State office holders, a summary of significant laws passed during  that biennium's legislative session, as well as historical features and  data about the State. With each edition providing information about  North Dakota not readily available elsewhere, the value of the  commitment by the Secretary of State's office to regularly publish  these books cannot be overstated.   When Al Jaeger retires on December 31, he will become the second  longest serving secretary of state in North Dakota, overseeing and  codifying the laws of 15 legislative sessions. It is going to take a  long time for the impact of his years of service to be adequately  measured. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I thank him for his years of  service as secretary of state. I congratulate him on his well-earned  retirement and wish him many years of health and happiness in the  future.                            ____________________
