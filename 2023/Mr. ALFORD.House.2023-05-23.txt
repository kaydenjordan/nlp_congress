 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce our first big win  in Congress. One week ago today, I stood right here to take a stand for  AM radio in America and call on all car manufacturers to reconsider  their decision to do away with it.   Well, I have some great news to report today, Mr. Speaker. Ford has  decided to keep AM radio in their 2024 models, including the F-150 made  just outside of Kansas City. It is a start, but we are not done. I am  now calling on all the other auto manufacturers to follow Ford's lead  and preserve AM radio.   This is not just about radios, Mr. Speaker. It is about standing up  for the farmers and ranchers who tune into AM radio as they till the  soil from dusk to dawn. It is about commuters who rely on AM radio  during their morning and evening commutes. It is about accessibility,  about making sure that every American, no matter where they live, has  access to vital news, weather, and community updates.   Today, we push forward advocating for AM radio, advocating for our  constituents, and today we show other car manufacturers what public  pressure looks like and tell them like I said last week, I want my AM  radio.                            ____________________
