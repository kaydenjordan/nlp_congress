 Mr. President, I want to applaud the Republican leader,  the Senator from Kentucky, for saying what needed to be said. If there  is a unique role for the U.S. Senate in our system of government, it is  to be the place where debate and deliberation, common sense and  compromise, prevail over demagoguery.   And, unfortunately, what we heard from President Biden yesterday was  sheer demagoguery. And I agree that it was not only unbecoming of the  President of the United States; it was, frankly, embarrassing. Many of  us were embarrassed for him that he would resort to that sort of  rhetoric, particularly when Members of his own political party are not  on board asking him to do what he wants to do, which is to break the  rules of the U.S. Senate.   So until this debate began, many Americans probably didn't think  twice about something called the filibuster. And as we have all tried  to explain why it is important and what role the filibuster plays in  our system of government, I think it is perhaps best described as a  mechanism to force us to  [[Page S167]]  do what doesn't come naturally, and that is to build consensus, to work  together in the best interest of the country, and to pass laws that  will endure, not those that will be reversed with the new majority,  with the next election.   When you think about a country like ours, with 330 million people, as  diverse as it is, it just makes sense for us to have fulsome debate and  deliberation, because the risk of making mistakes, of unintended  consequences, is great, and there is no body in America that can fix  mistakes made by the U.S. Congress.   So deliberation is an important function, and that is why forcing us  to do what doesn't come naturally, which means to work together and  build consensus to get 60 votes to cut off debate, is such a critical  role.   Well, unfortunately, our colleagues have--according to the Democratic  leader and the majority leader--our colleagues have chosen to leave  bipartisanship and tradition at the door in order to grow their own  political power.   Make no mistake, they face an uphill battle. Two of our Democratic  colleagues have stated their outright opposition, and I imagine others  who hold the same view who have not wanted to catch the slings and  arrows that have made their way toward the Senator from Arizona and the  Senator from West Virginia.   There are many other Democratic Senators who hold the same concerns  in private. Still, the majority leader is determined to light the  Senate rule book on fire.   As this Chamber considers such an extreme move, I want to share some  wise words from one of our former colleagues. That would be former  Senator Joe Biden. The current President served in the Senate for three  and a half decades and held a deep reverence for the rules and the  traditions and the norms that govern this body--at least, he did. Back  in 2005, the Senate was weighing whether or not to eliminate the 60- vote requirement for certain judicial nominees. At that time we had a  Republican majority and a Democratic minority. The shoe was on the  other foot. But Senator Biden--or then-Senator Biden--was absolutely  clear about his feelings on the matter. He said: Eliminating the  filibuster--the so-called nuclear option--is ``an example of the  arrogance of power''--``the arrogance of power.''    Now, that is not an ambiguous statement. That is not a qualified  statement. That is not a contingent statement. That is a declarative  statement about what eliminating the filibuster is--an arrogance of  power.   Back in 2005, then-Senator Biden believed that changing the rules to  benefit yourself or your political party is an example of that  arrogance of power. And he called it ``a fundamental power grab by the  majority party.'' But now President Biden obviously holds the exact  opposite view. In other words, he has done a spectacular flip-flop.   Now that his party is the one in power, he is not only OK with the  idea of this arrogance of power, this power grab, he endorses it. He  advocates for it.   He is willing to use some of the strongest rhetoric I have ever heard  come from a President of the United States to condemn it, to condemn  the filibuster and endorse its destruction. In Georgia, yesterday,  President Biden made his new position on the filibuster crystal clear.  He said: ``Let the majority prevail.''   The move he once called ``a fundamental power grab'' is now his new  legislative strategy. And President Biden isn't the only one to have  done a complete flip-flop when it comes to the filibuster, when it is  opportunistic, when it is convenient, when it is expedient.   Senator Durbin, the Democratic majority whip, also used to have a  deep respect for the traditions of the Senate. He said that, if the  filibuster were eliminated, ``that would be the end of the Senate as it  was originally devised and created going back to our Founding  Fathers.'' But his respect for these traditions, these norms, these  rules dissipated when it became a political inconvenience.   Last year, Senator Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, said the  filibuster ``has become the death grip of democracy.''   I am not sure if he is proud of it now, but Senator Schumer was also  an advocate for the filibuster in the not-so-distant past. Just a few  years ago--again, when the shoe was on the other foot and Democrats  were a minority, and Republicans were a majority--he said we should  ``build a fire wall around the legislative filibuster'' to protect the  Senate from ``the winds of short-term electoral change.''   Well, today, for sure, the winds have shifted. The Senator who once  supported the filibuster now finds himself as the majority leader,  trying to appease the most radical elements in his political base.   Where does he stand on the filibuster today? Well, he is whipping  votes to eliminate it. Democrats who once hailed the filibuster as a  vital stabilizing force in our government now call it a weapon of mass  destruction, a mockery of American democracy, and even a Jim Crow  relic.   Let's not forget that, just about a year and a half ago, Democrats  used this Jim Crow relic to block an anti-lynching bill. That is right.  I was here on the Senate floor when the now-Vice President of the  United States, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker from New Jersey, our  colleague from New Jersey, participated in a filibuster to block a  motion to proceed to a police reform bill that contained their own  anti-lynching bill in it. Shocking to me. They didn't even want to  begin discussion of the bill--their own anti-lynching bill.   Well, now that Democrats control all levers of government, they have  tossed their previous convictions in the trash. Their agenda, securing  a result that will result in a permanent partisan advantage, that is  their sole focus. Our colleagues seem to have been blinded by the  possibility of short-term victories, and they are ignoring the longer  term repercussions, because, in the Senate, what goes around comes  around.   Let's say that Democrats muster enough support to take a wrecking  ball to the Senate rules. They blow up the rules and pass this so- called election bill with only 50 votes plus the tie-breaking vote of  the Vice President. They would likely spend the rest of the year  checking other items off of their radical wish list. This idea about a  carve-out for one kind of bill is just malarkey, to use the President's  term.   They would clearly use this to craft new laws to curb Second  Amendment rights, expand access to abortion, and decimate important  industries in the United States like the oil and gas industry. At the  same time, the President is asking for Vladimir Putin and OPEC to pump  more oil because the price of gasoline has gone through the roof.   Well, our colleagues like the sound of that--eliminating the  filibuster--but they aren't prepared for what inevitably would come  next.   The great genius of our system and of our country is that power is  not absolute, and, ultimately, all power lies in the hands of we the  people, and we are all directly accountable to the people we represent.   If voters reject Democrats' power grab and hand Republicans the  Senate majority, Democrats would, if they were successful today or  tomorrow, have zero impact on the legislative process. You could just  ignore Democrats and plow your way to a certain result. They would have  no way of stopping legislation they absolutely abhor from becoming law,  and the States they represent, represented by Democratic Senators,  those Senators would be irrelevant. Think about that.   All of us worked hard to get here. All of us are proud of the fact  that our voters elected us to represent them in this most august body  known on the planet, but if you happen to be in the minority, under the  current position taken by the President and the majority leader and our  Senate Democratic friends--almost all of them--those Senators elected  in blue States would have zero impact. They might as well not even show  up.   If voters reject the Democrats' power grab and hand Republicans the  majority, they would have no say in the legislative process, if they  are successful.   A Republican-controlled Senate could pass new laws to protect the  right to life, secure the border, expand and enhance Second Amendment  rights under the Constitution, and much, much more.   If that were to happen, would Democrats stand by the rules change  that they are debating and advocating for  [[Page S168]]  today? Would they stand by their decision to silence the minority party  and minority Senators? Would they agree with President Biden's  statement, ``Let the majority prevail''?   Well, we don't have to wonder because we have seen this movie before.  Our colleagues have already expressed regrets over the previous  filibuster carve-out.   Contrary to the strong statement Democrats made in 2005 advocating  for the filibuster to be maintained, they started chipping away at it  just 8 years later.   In 2013, Democrats eliminated the 60-vote threshold for judicial  nominees, and the move has haunted them for nearly a decade and  resulted in the confirmation of three Supreme Court Justices during  President Trump's term of office.   Back then, when they invoked the nuclear option, Leader McConnell  said:         You will regret this, and you may regret this a lot sooner       than you think.    Reflecting on that moment a few years ago, Senator Bennet, one of our  Colorado colleagues, was clear. He said Senator McConnell was right.   Under the previous administration, the Republican-led Senate  confirmed more than 230 conservative judges, all thanks to the  Democrats' elimination of the filibuster when it comes to nominations.   The senior Senator from Colorado isn't the only one who has shown  remorse after ending up on the losing side of that rules change.  Senator Tester, our colleague from Montana, said voting on that rule  change was ``probably the biggest mistake [he] ever made.''   Senator Shaheen, our colleague from New Hampshire, concluded that  ``it has not served us well.''   Even Senator Schumer, the majority leader, has said that ``I wish it  hadn't happened.''   And as a reminder, this is only in reference to Federal judges. These  individuals hold tremendous power, no mistake about it.   But now we are talking about rule changes that stipulate how laws are  made, not how nominations are considered. This is the so-called  legislative calendar, and what happens in the wake of this change would  impact every single family across the country.   When Republicans, inevitably, at some point, take the majority again,  it would be a simple thing, with 51 votes, to dismantle all of the laws  that our Democratic colleagues have passed if they were to eliminate  the filibuster. Then, of course, when Democrats take control again, the  reverse would happen.    You know, I think that the 60-vote requirement is forcing us to do  something that doesn't come natural, and that is to force us to work  together to build consensus. I think that is what the American people  want us to do, to work together. And the filibuster, that 60-vote  requirement to close off debate, forces us to do just that. It  eliminates the possibility that we can, with a mere majority of 51  votes, have our way, only to see it reversed after the next election.  That is not good for the country. That is not good for our  constituents. That doesn't create the sort of predictable, enduring  laws that the American people should be able to rely on.   Well, when it comes to eliminating the filibuster, Senator Biden's  line about ``the arrogance of power'' is exactly that. At some point,  the shoe will be on the other foot--it always happens--which is why no  party, neither party, has been so shortsighted, until now, to try to  eliminate the legislative filibuster. No party has ever been so power  hungry and so shortsighted as to shatter the norms and traditions of  this institution.   I would like to close with one more quote from then-Senator Biden  back in 2005. He said:         What shortsightedness, and what a price history will exact       on those who support this radical move.    I yield the floor.
