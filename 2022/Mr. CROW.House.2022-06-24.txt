 Mr. Speaker, today I rise as a father, a combat veteran, a  gun owner, and the Representative of a community devastated by gun  violence.   My constituents are family and friends of those who were killed at  Columbine, at the Aurora Theater, at STEM School Highlands Ranch, and  at the Boulder King Soopers. As a community, we consoled each other  after each one of these terrible shootings, and we demanded commonsense  reform, but for too long our Nation's leaders refused to act.   When I came to Congress I promised my constituents that I would fight  to protect our community from gun violence.   Today, I am proud to vote for the first comprehensive gun violence  package in 30 years. This bill is a first step. It doesn't have  everything we would hope for, but it is a step in the right direction.   Today's success belongs to every Coloradan who turned their hurt into  action. This long overdue progress is theirs.   Mr. Speaker, I plead with my colleagues for a ``yes'' vote.
