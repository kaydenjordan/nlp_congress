 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman and  good doctor from Pennsylvania for this initiative tonight, this Special  Order.   Madam Speaker, amidst Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and  historically high gas prices here at home, I have got a radical idea  for President Joe Biden; how about you ask American workers to produce  American energy sourced right here in America?   I know that is a radical idea for you, but this would increase  American jobs, strengthen America's economy, and lower grocery and gas  prices for all Americans. Not to mention, we would be producing some of  the cleanest oil and gas in the world today.   So how do I tell my constituents the truth? The truth is this: The  Biden administration would rather invest in foreign energy and make us  more reliant on hostile nations and war criminals than to bring  domestic production here in America back up to par.   Let me repeat that. Instead of supporting American ingenuity and  affordable energy, the left wants your tax dollars to line the pockets  of tyrants in Communist countries like Iran and Venezuela, who hate  America and everything that we stand for. This kind of stupidity is  hard to comprehend.   Tonight, I am calling on President Joe Biden to put what is best for  America first for once, and immediately unleash American energy.
