I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs.  Shaheen) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr.  Manchin) and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I was fortunate early in my political life  to meet several people who became my heroes and mentors and led me to  take up public service as my life's calling.   The first was a Senator from Illinois named Paul Douglas, and I met  him when I was a college intern in his office. And he introduced me to  a man named Paul Simon; Simon, who was a Lieutenant Governor in our  State, State legislator, Congressman, and, ultimately, the Senator who  preceded me in this Senate seat.   After Paul Simon passed away, I approached his family and talked  about a tribute to him, and they basically said: Well, you remember  Paul. He would have been the last person in the world who ever wanted a  statue and really didn't care much about having anything with his name  on it. That just wasn't his approach to politics.   But I thought to myself there were some things that he valued that  maybe I can try to help in my own way in his memory. And one of them  was in 2014, when I introduced a bill called the Paul Simon Water for  the World Act.   Simon had written a book that didn't make the New York Times best  seller list. It was entitled ``Tapped Out.'' He had a theory many years  ago that the issue with the 21st century was going to be water. And he  made a pretty convincing case, and, frankly, the events and evidence  since then have backed him up.   So this bill, the Paul Simon Water for the World Act, was designed to  build on the success of an earlier effort called Paul Simon's Water for  the Poor, which had passed 10 years before and sought to bring clean  water and sanitation programs to the world's poorest communities.   Today, as we mark World Water Day, I want to recognize what we have  accomplished with these two pieces of legislation. They have helped  provide, for the first time, access to clean drinking water and  sanitation for more than 60 million additional people around the globe.   Those successes have also improved global health, economic  development, and educational attainment. And they have proven how far  just a little Federal funding invested in the right area can go.   Both of those laws were passed on a bipartisan basis, and in  recognizing the compounding benefits of clean water and sanitation,  Congress has sustained the programs.   My staff has traveled to countries like Kenya, Ghana, Senegal to see  these programs in action. They have shared stories and photos with me  about schools and villages that, for the very first time, have access  to clean, drinkable water.   In Ghana, for example, these laws have helped fund something called  the Digni-Loo Program. It has provided rural villages with clean,  sustainable toilets and helped eliminate waterborne diseases in entire  districts of the country.   This World Water Day, I hope we can reaffirm our commitment in this  Senate to supporting legislation in the name of my friend and mentor,  the Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act, that will help bring  global health for years to come.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Mr. President, in just a few days, America's eyes will turn to the  Senate Judiciary Committee as we begin the process of considering Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson for her nomination to the Supreme Court.   It is going to be a historic moment on Monday as Judge Jackson  appears before the Committee, and gaveling the hearing to order as  chair of the committee will rank as one of the highest honors of my  career in Congress.   Next week, the American people will have a chance to meet Judge  Jackson, learn about her, her professional record, and her life  experience. But, for now, let me briefly share a few things that have  impressed me the most.   By now, I am sure, many have heard about her experience. Judge  Jackson has clerked at every level of the Federal judiciary. Most  lawyers would consider a clerkship in any court as an achievement that  they could brag about for years. She served as a clerk at every level  of the Federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court.   She served in many roles in the courtroom as a public defender, a  lawyer in private practice, and a district and circuit court judge at  the Federal level.   She was confirmed by the Senate unanimously to serve on the U.S.  Sentencing Commission, and she would be the first Justice since  Thurgood Marshall with considerable defense experience.   Her qualifications are exceptional. In every role she has held, she  has earned a reputation for thoughtfulness, evenhandedness, and  collegiality.   Just as impressive as Judge Jackson's record is her character and  temperament--humble, personable. She has dedicated herself to making  our legal system more understandable and more accessible for everyone  who came into her courtroom.   Finally, of course, there is the perspective that Judge Jackson will  bring to the High Court. Over the course of its history, 115 Justices  have served on the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed, Judge Jackson  will be the 116th, but she would be the first Supreme Court Justice who  is the daughter of parents who felt the crushing oppression of  segregation and the first Justice who has  [[Page S1240]]  represented an indigent as a public defender.   Judge Jackson comes from a law enforcement family and has a deep  appreciation for the risk of police officers, like her brother and  uncles. And I believe one served in the Baltimore Police Department.   Indeed, with Judge Jackson's confirmation, the Supreme Court would  come closer to fully reflecting the diversity of America.   When Justice Breyer announced his retirement, I promised that the  process for confirming his successor would be fair and timely. Well, it  has been. For instance, the committee sent a bipartisan committee  questionnaire to Judge Jackson. In response she provided materials  which shed considerable light on her record, her accomplishments, her  writings, and her legal reasoning. Notably, this included more than  12,000 pages of public records from Judge Jackson's time on the  Sentencing Commission.   The committee also sent a bipartisan document request to the Obama  Presidential Library. That request sought documents relating to Judge  Jackson's nomination to both the Sentencing Commission and the U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia. In response to that  request, the Obama Library produced more than 70,000 pages of material.   Additionally, Judge Jackson has written hundreds of opinions--almost  600 now--which provide extensive insight into her legal philosophy.   In short, the committee has all the information it needs to evaluate  Judge Jackson's qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court.   We have sent a lot of followup requests for information, too, and she  has always responded in a timely way.   So we are going to proceed with her hearing come Monday. This process  will provide committee members an opportunity to question Judge Jackson  to learn more about her approach to judicial decision making, her views  on precedent, and her record on and off the bench.   Here is how the hearing is going to work. Each member of the  committee will be allocated 10 minutes to make opening statements. Each  member will have a total of 50 minutes to question Judge Jackson. There  are 22 members on the committee. If you do the math, there is plenty of  opportunity for questions to be asked and answered. I expect it to be a  substantive hearing. I expect members on both sides of the aisle to ask  tough but fair questions and to give her an appropriate time to  respond, and I expect that the committee will diligently perform our  role in the Senate's advice and consent function.   When the hearing is complete, I believe the American public will be  keenly aware of just what an outstanding nominee Judge Jackson is. I  will also get to see what I have seen in meeting with her personally.  She is thoughtful, brilliant, kind, and has a good sense of humor.   She has already inspired young people across the country--young  people who are just beginning to discover their passion for law. You  see, she graduated from Miami's Palmetto Senior High School, a public  high school in Pinecrest, FL. Right now, the halls of Palmetto High are  buzzing with pride in anticipation for next week's hearing.   One school administrator told my office that, even though students  will be out on spring break next week during beach season in Florida,  many will be coming together for a virtual watch party as Judge Jackson  appears before our committee. The administrator said that many of these  students see themselves in Judge Jackson, particularly the members of  the speech and debate team, which Judge Jackson was once a member of  herself. In fact, Judge Jackson has cited her time on the speech and  debate team as one of the most formative experiences of her life. She  described it as ``the one activity that best prepared me for future  success.''   Well, today, Judge Jackson is more prepared than perhaps anyone to  serve on the Supreme Court. So to all the students at Palmetto High who  are following in her footsteps, working long hours to hone their  rhetorical skills, you are on the right track. While Judge Jackson may  be the first Palmetto Panther to serve on the Supreme Court, there is  no reason she should be the last. Years from now, who knows, maybe one  of you will be preparing for your hearing before the Senate committee.  Until then, you should all be so proud of Judge Jackson.   I would like to add another element to this--a personal element. When  I spoke to Judge Jackson about her family, she was naturally proud of  her husband, who is a surgeon, but she talked about her two daughters  and showed me pictures of them. They are teenagers and obviously good  kids. She is so proud of them. She told the story that when there was a  vacancy announced on the Supreme Court several years ago, one of her  daughters picked up a pen and wrote a personal letter to President  Obama and said: Why don't you pick my mom?   It is that kind of support every parent lives for, and I am sure it  means a lot to her. She is a good person, a good mother, a good parent,  and she will be a great member of the Supreme Court.   I also want to say that there are elements that obviously the public  has paid attention to. This being the fourth time before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, many people in America know Judge Jackson or they  have heard about her or they have read about her. They believe in a  positive way that she will bring diversity to the Court; that she has  the experience that is necessary to serve effectively; that she will  uphold our constitutional values of liberty, equality, and justice; and  that she will protect the constitutional rights of everybody, not just  the wealthy and powerful. She has ethics and integrity, and she will  place justice before politics.   I am looking forward to this hearing. I am happy that the Republicans  have said publicly that they want to make it a respectful hearing, and  I certainly hope they live up to it. I will do everything I can to  convince the Democratic side to aspire to the same goal. This can be a  historic moment for America in the selection of this Justice. I hope  the Senate Judiciary Committee rises to the occasion, and I have  confidence that it will.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will consider 12  outstanding judicial nominees. These nominees represent the continued  efforts of President Biden and Senate Democrats to bring much-needed  professional and demographic diversity to the Federal bench.   This latest lineup of nominees include legal academics, public  defenders, civil rights lawyers, sitting State and Federal judges,  prosecutors, and private practitioners. Each of these nominees has the  character, temperament, and qualifications to serve with distinction.   The first nominee is Judge Jacqueline Corley, nominated to the U.S.  District Court for the Northern District of California.   For more than a decade, Judge Corley has served as a Federal  magistrate judge in the Northern District of California. She has  handled cases implicating a variety of complex statutory and  constitutional questions, from immigration to employment to national  security matters. And in her time on the bench, she has amassed a  record that reflects her evenhanded, impartial approach to the law.  Earlier in her career, Judge Corley spent nearly two decades working in  private legal practice and as a career law clerk to Judge Charles  Breyer, who also serves on the Northern District of California.   Judge Corley received a unanimous rating of ``Well Qualified'' from  the American Bar Association, has the strong support of Senators  Feinstein and Padilla, and received overwhelming bipartisan support in  the Judiciary Committee.   Next, we have Fred Slaughter, who has been nominated to serve on the  U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.   Judge Slaughter currently serves as a judge on the California  Superior Court for Orange County. In 2014, Governor Jerry Brown  appointed him to this position, and since then, Judge Slaughter has  presided over a wide variety of cases, including civil cases, felony  criminal cases, and juvenile justice proceedings. After graduating from  the UCLA School of Law, he started his career as a deputy city attorney  with the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, before moving to the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Central District of California as an  Assistant U.S. Attorney. He prosecuted a wide range of cases and  developed a deep understanding of the district to which he has been  nominated.   Judge Slaughter has the strong support of both his home-State  Senators, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Padilla, and he was rated unanimously  ``Well Qualified'' by the American Bar Association. His deep commitment  to public service, coupled with his broad experience, makes him an  excellent nominee to the Federal bench.   The Senate will also consider the nomination of Ruth Montenegro to  the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.   Since 2018, Judge Montenegro has served as a U.S. magistrate judge in  the Southern District of California. Prior to that, she served as a  State court judge. With her combined experience on federal and State  courts, Judge Montenegro has been on the bench for nearly 8 years. She  has presided over thousands of cases, including more than 30 jury  trials and over 100 bench trials.   Judge Montenegro was unanimously rated ``Qualified'' by the American  Bar  [[Page S1249]]  Association, and both Senators Feinstein and Padilla strongly support  her nomination. A graduate of UCLA School of Law, Judge Montenegro  worked as an attorney for more than 19 years before assuming the bench.   Judge Montenegro is also the child of immigrants and a first- generation college graduate. Throughout her career, she has made it a  priority to give back to the community. In 2018, she served as chair of  the California Bar Foundation's scholarship committee, and, for many  years, she served as president and chair of the scholarships committee  for the El Centro Education Foundation.   Judge Montenegro was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with  bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   Next is Victoria Calvert, nominated to be a judge on the U.S.  District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Ms. Calvert is a  highly experienced litigator with a proven commitment to ensuring equal  justice for all.   Ms. Calvert attended Duke University and received her law degree from  the New York University School of Law. She then spent 6 years working  in private practice before dedicating her career to public service.  Currently, she serves as a staff attorney with the Federal defender  program in the Northern District of Georgia, a position she has held  since 2012. In this role, she has represented hundreds of indigent  clients. Ms. Calvert has the strong support of her home-State Senators,  Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Warnock. And she received a unanimous ``Well  Qualified'' rating from the ABA.   I have said many times that public defenders are vastly  underrepresented on our Nation's courts, and I believe that Ms. Calvert  will bring a valuable perspective to the bench, including an  appreciation for the real world impact of judicial decisionmaking.   We also will be considering the nomination of Julie Rubin, who has  been selected to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of  Maryland.   For the past 8 years, she has served as an associate judge on the  Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In this role, Judge Rubin has  presided over nearly 950 civil and criminal cases that have gone to  verdict or judgment, including 122 jury trials.   Prior to assuming the bench, Judge Rubin spent 15 years litigating in  private practice and tried 17 cases to verdict or judgment. She also  rose to become the vice president of her firm. Judge Rubin received her  undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College and her law degree from  the University of Maryland School of Law. And she received a unanimous  ``Well Qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association.   Judge Rubin has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr.  Cardin and Mr. Van Hollen. She also received bipartisan support in the  Judiciary Committee. As a native Marylander with a wealth of trial  experience on and off the bench, Judge Rubin will make an excellent  addition to the District Court.   Next we have Hector Gonzalez, nominated to serve on the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of New York.   Mr. Gonzalez is an accomplished litigator. Over the course of his  career, he has tried more than 20 civil and criminal cases, the  majority of them as chief counsel. Mr. Gonzalez served as a prosecutor  for almost 10 years, serving in both the Manhattan District Attorney's  Office as well as the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District  of New York. In addition to the criminal law expertise he developed as  a prosecutor, Mr. Gonzalez has also gained considerable civil  litigation experience, managing complex litigation matters involving  bankruptcy, antitrust, and professional liability.   In recognition of his long career as an accomplished litigator, Mr.  Gonzalez was inducted as a fellow into the American College of Trial  Lawyers. The ABA found him unanimously ``Well Qualified.'' In addition,  he has the strong support of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand.   Next we have John Chun, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Western District of Washington.   Judge Chun has served on Washington State courts for the past 7  years, first as a judge on the King County Superior Court and currently  as a judge on the Washington Court of Appeals. Throughout his time on  the bench, he has presided over 90 civil and criminal cases that have  gone to verdict or judgment. These cases have been almost evenly split  between jury and bench trials.   Prior to his judicial appointment, Judge Chun spent 10 years as a  commercial and employment litigation attorney. Practicing in both  Federal and State court, he tried five cases to verdict or judgment and  became partner at his firm in just 6 years. Judge Chun received his  undergraduate degree from Columbia University and his law degree from  Cornell Law School. He then began his legal career by clerking for the  Honorable Eugene A. Wright on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit.   Judge Chun has the strong support of Senators Murray and Cantwell. He  received a bipartisan vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also  received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating from the American Bar  Association. Judge Chun's demonstrable commitment to justice and the  rule of law will serve him well as a district court judge.   Next is Sarah Geraghty, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the  Northern District of Georgia.   Since 2003, Ms. Geraghty has been an attorney at the Southern Center  for Human Rights, where she has advocated for the fair and equal  treatment of people in the criminal legal system, regardless of their  ability to afford counsel. Ms. Geraghty has approximately 20 years of  litigation experience, during which time she has handled every stage of  the legal process, from pretrial investigations to briefing and arguing  appeals.   Ms. Geraghty has been widely recognized for her work. In 2020, she  was named Attorney of the Year by Georgia's primary legal publication,  the Fulton County ``Daily Report''. In 2017, Emory University School of  Law's public interest committee gave Ms. Geraghty its Unsung Devotion  to Those Most in Need Award. Ms. Geraghty was rated ``Qualified'' by  the American Bar Association, and both Senator Ossoff and Senator  Warnock strongly support her nomination.   In addition to her legal practice, Ms. Geraghty is a lecturer at  Emory Law School and a part-time instructor at Georgia State University  College of Law. Ms. Geraghty has received numerous letters of support,  including from law enforcement officials and attorneys who have opposed  her in litigation. These letters demonstrate that Ms. Geraghty's  approach to resolving legal disputes has always been, as one letter put  it,``collaborative rather than confrontational.'' Another letter stated  that she has always ``approached conflicts between the parties with  flexibility and an open mind.'' These qualities will serve her well on  the bench. Ms. Geraghty received bipartisan support in the Judiciary  Committee. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her nomination.   We will also consider Georgette Castner, who has been nominated to  serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.   She is an experienced litigator with a deep knowledge of the District  of New Jersey. A graduate of the College of New Jersey and Rutgers Law  School, Ms. Castner has spent almost 15 years in private practice,  representing a range of individual and corporate clients. Over the  course of her career, she has litigated matters spanning various areas  of civil and criminal law.   Ms. Castner received a ``Qualified'' rating from the ABA and has the  strong support of her home-State Senators, Mr. Booker and Mr. Menendez.   Next is Judge Cristina Silva, nominated to the U.S. District Court  for the District of Nevada.   Judge Silva currently serves on Nevada's Eighth Judicial District  Court, where she handles a mix of civil and criminal proceedings. In  her time on the bench, Judge Silva has presided over 15 trials, the  vast majority of which were jury trials. She has also remained active  in the local legal community, including through service on the board of  directors of the Nevada Latino Bar Association.   Before her appointment to the bench, Judge Silva served as both a  local and Federal prosecutor. She helped lead the domestic violence  unit of the Miami-  [[Page S1250]]  Dade State's Attorney's Office and then served for nearly a decade as  an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Nevada, ultimately  becoming the chief of that office's criminal division. Judge Silva  received a unanimous rating of ``Well Qualified'' from the ABA and has  the strong support of Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen.   We also will be considering the nomination of Anne Traum, who has  likewise been chosen to serve on the U.S. District Court for the  District of Nevada.   Professor Traum is currently a professor of Law at the University of  Nevada, Las Vegas, William S. Boyd School of Law, a position she has  held since 2014, and associate dean for experiential legal education.  Her commitment to the university is admirable: She founded, and now  leads, the appellate clinic, which allows students to brief and argue  cases before the Ninth Circuit or the Nevada Supreme Court.   Additionally, she took 1-year leave of absence from the university  from 2015 to 2016 to serve as special counsel with the U.S. Department  of Justice's Office for Access to Justice. The breadth of her career  does not stop there, though. She was an assistant federal public  defender in the Federal public defender's office in Las Vegas from 2002  to 2008 and, prior to that, served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the  Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nevada  from 2000 to 2002.   Professor Traum has the strong support of her home-State Senators,  Ms. Cortez Masto and Ms. Rosen, and was rated ``Well Qualified'' by the  American Bar Association.   Finally, we will be considering Judge Alison Nathan, who has been  nominated to serve on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.   Judge Nathan is an experienced litigator and an accomplished jurist.  She has served on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  New York since 2012. While on the bench, she has authored over 1,500  opinions and has presided over 45 trials that have gone to verdict or  judgment. With that long record, her reversal rate is an impressive 1  percent. I have no doubt that she will be a valuable addition to the  Second Circuit. After attending Cornell University and Cornell Law  School, Judge Nathan clerked for Judge Betty B. Fletcher on the Ninth  Circuit and for Justice John Paul Stevens of the U.S. Supreme Court.  From there, she began her legal practice, where she specialized in  civil litigation and developed a large pro bono practice focused on  LGBTQ rights and appeals for inmates on death row. She also held  positions in government and academia.   Judge Nathan has the strong support of Senator Schumer and Senator  Gillibrand, and she was unanimously rated ``Well Qualified'' by the  American Bar Association. Her record on the bench is deeply impressive.  She has proven, without a doubt, that she understands the difference  between a policy advocate and a judge, and I am certain that she will  continue to administer justice in a thoughtful, evenhanded manner.   I support all of these outstanding nominees and encourage my  colleagues to join me in voting for their confirmation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to thank Raymond ``Ray'' Drake for  his extraordinary service to the United Parcel Service, UPS. Earlier  this year, Ray announced that after 46 years at the UPS, including 11  years as vice president of UPS State Public Affairs, he will be  retiring this April.   Ray has a profound record of service to UPS, rising through the ranks  and serving with a deep sense of loyalty and respect. In 1976, Ray was  first hired at UPS as a package handler while attending the College of  New Jersey. While balancing his studies, Ray was promoted to part-time  hub supervisor. Upon graduating with a degree in political science, he  moved to the metro New York district to become a package car driver.   Just 2 years after his graduation from college, Ray was promoted to a  full-time management position, joining engineering and operations,  where he spent 35 years of his career. Working in engineering and  operations, Ray took on a number of assignments, holding positions in  three UPS districts and numerous package and air divisions. In these  roles, Ray utilized his strong leadership, technical, and analytical  skills to develop and deploy operational practices throughout UPS. For  the last 11 years, Ray brought his talents in leadership and advocacy  to the UPS's State public affairs team, where he worked tirelessly with  key policymakers in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.   In Illinois, Ray has served far beyond his responsibilities with the  UPS. Ray was deeply involved with the State chambers of commerce and is  the former commerce chairman, the only UPS manager to chair a State  chamber. Ray currently serves on several boards and committees,  including the Illinois Chamber Foundation Board, the Chicagoland  Chamber Board of Directors, the Chicagoland Chamber's Public Policy  Committee, and the Board of Directors of Illinois' Civic Federation. In  support of UPS's international initiatives, Ray serves on the Illinois  advisory council for the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition and the  advisory council for North Rhein Westphalia-Invest, and previously  served as vice chairman of the Illinois International Business Council,  an organization he helped found. In this role, Ray has used his decades  of experience in transportation and operational leadership to educate  and engage community leaders on investments in development and  diplomacy and has used these relationships to help strengthen Illinois'  economy.   In the true spirit of his own legacy at UPS, Ray was a leader in  developing the wildly successful Chicagoland Regional Education  Programs, which has allowed thousands of young Illinois residents the  opportunity to go to college while working at UPS.   I want to close by congratulating Ray Drake on his distinguished  career with the UPS and thank him for all he has done and all he will  continue to do to serve communities in Illinois and across the world.  Chicago is grateful for all of his service and sacrifice. Now, as he  enters the next chapter in his life, I want to wish Ray and his family  the very best in a long and happy retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3869         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
