 Madam Speaker, well, here are the numbers: gross  domestic product is down another 0.9 percent on this quarter on top of  last quarter's 1.6 percent drop in GDP for the second straight quarter.   Why?   There are several factors: the high cost of energy and energy being  shut down in this country--energy affects everything--inflation, and  profligate spending by government have driven us into a situation where  we have--yes, we will say the word--a recession.   Now, there are 38 different edits to the terminology of recession.  However, the definition of recession on the Wikipedia page is not going  to change the fact that the policies of overspending, choking  regulations, and bad energy policy have made it impossible for people  to afford anything anymore. Indeed, it has been a tax upon people's  income. Approximately one full month's paycheck is lost to Americans  because of these high costs.   So instead of playing around on Wikipedia redefining what recession  is, let's get back to work and put things together on our energy  policies, supply chain, and, indeed, stop the profligate spending of  build back broke.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas, the  ranking member on the Committee on Natural Resources.   Indeed, I have enjoyed time spent on both of the committees we are  talking  [[Page H7392]]  about here, Agriculture and Natural Resources. But what we are talking  about here today is something already covered by current law.   It already prohibits the import, export, transport, sale, receipt,  acquisition, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce of big cats.  It allows exceptions for entities that are federally licensed by USDA,  under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, such as  small family-run zoos.   The trade of big cats, and all federally licensed zoological  facilities, are regulated under the Animal Welfare Act, as mentioned,  which placed USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, known  as APHIS, in charge of hiring inspectors and law enforcement officers  who are experts at animal welfare issues.   This bill ignores existing regulatory framework and creates an  additional regulatory system by adding the Department of the Interior's  Fish and Wildlife Service into the mix.   So, it creates a duplicative regulatory structure and supersedes  State law as well. It would mandate all persons or entities that  currently possess big cats to register each animal with the Fish and  Wildlife Service within 180 days of enactment of this in order to keep  their animals.   Some supporters of this bill have admitted it would indeed create a  duplicative Federal process at the Fish and Wildlife Service because  proponents would rather, as mentioned, work through the Committee on  Natural Resources than through the Committee on Agriculture, which is  its current jurisdiction.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking at the calendar. There are somewhere around  40 legislative days left of this session. Getting both committees to  have to do this work--obviously, they pushed it through already--but  let's take that to an agency level. Now, whether APHIS can do the job,  do we want to add Fish and Wildlife to that?   I have issues in my own district in California, where Fish and  Wildlife needs to do more work on analyzing what the effects of their  mandates are on water in my State and my neighboring State. They are  entering into even more responsibility that is unneeded.   My colleague's amendment would have perfectly dovetailed into what we  are talking about here and kept it in the jurisdiction where it needs  to be instead of creating more bureaucracy and more effort by already  overstretched government agencies that don't have the personnel to  cover some of the responsibilities they already have.   Let's look at what we are looking at priority-wise.   Yes, we are supposed to be able to walk and chew gum and do other  things around here, but why are we creating double effort from already  stretched agencies still sometimes sitting in COVID caves, not getting  the job done? Adding more, that is unnecessary.   It would have been very simple to have a clean bill here and, I  think, some bipartisan effort, but it has all blown up on us here with  having to have a duplicative effort.   I think, unfortunately, what good could have come from H.R. 263 is  lost in a set of priorities that are just trying to make it easier to  increase the bureaucracy. That is pretty sad because we want to see a  good outcome here for these animals and for the people who enjoy them  and would like to continue to enjoy them.
