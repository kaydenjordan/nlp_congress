 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Richard  Michel of Marksville, Louisiana, on his retirement after 60 years of  service to his community.   Dr. Michel spent much of his career serving as both a doctor and as  mayor, which earned him the title of Doctor Mayor. He was valedictorian  of his high school class and attended LSU Medical School before joining  the Air Force in 1957.   A cattle rancher in his spare time, Dr. Michel found himself in a  hospital bed after breaking two vertebrae in his back in 1976. This was  when he decided to run for public office. He was elected mayor of  Marksville in 1978 and served four terms before leaving office. In  1998, he ran again to serve another three terms, for a total of 28  years as mayor of Marksville.  [[Page H2430]]    Please join me in congratulating Dr. Richard Michel on his lifelong  career as a doctor, mayor, cattle rancher, and airman.                            ____________________
