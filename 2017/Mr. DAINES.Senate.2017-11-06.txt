 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today the U.S. House of Representatives  begins marking up H.R. 1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and as the U.S.  Senate continues to debate tax cuts, I am reminded of a speech that  former Democratic President John F. Kennedy delivered in New York City  in 1962. In fact, it was in December of 1962, when he said:         In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too       high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way       to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates       now. The experience of a number of European countries and       Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with       tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is       that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax       reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of       cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to       achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can       bring a budget surplus.    President Kennedy went on to say:         I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut       deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of       deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted       result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy; or a       temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut       designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and       achieve--and I believe this can be done--a budget surplus.       The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness;       the second reflects an investment in the future.    If someone had just tuned in, they might think I was quoting,  perhaps, President Reagan or perhaps some other Republican leader. This  was President John F. Kennedy in 1962.   We need to cut taxes once again and put money back into the pockets  of the American people. I can state that Montanans need more jobs, but,  importantly, we need better paying jobs. Most importantly, they need  bigger paychecks. The best way to give Montanans a pay raise--how about  cutting their taxes? We need tax cuts.
