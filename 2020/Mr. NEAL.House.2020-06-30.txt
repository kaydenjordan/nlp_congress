 Mr. Speaker, America's infrastructure is in woeful  disrepair. Our roads and bridges are crumbling; many areas still lack  reliable internet service; and there are even places in the United  States where the tap water is unsafe to drink.   We need these major investments. With more than 40 million Americans  out of work, the pandemic crisis has had a devastating impact, and the  consequences for our Nation are apparent.   The Democrats' Moving Forward Act will create jobs, reinvigorate our  economy, and also modernize our infrastructure. All corners of the  Nation will benefit from this package, including my home State in  western and central Massachusetts.   Bold investments in broadband and the rail system are particularly  good news for our region's economy, workers, and students. Rail, $19  billion--perhaps we will see our long-held vision of rail  transportation from Boston to Worcester to Springfield on to Pittsfield  occur as well.   This is smart and responsible. The Ways and Means Committee  contributed the largest tax investment in combating climate change that  Congress has ever made, and it is in legislative form and in  legislative language.   This legislation promotes investments in clean energy technologies,  incentivizes the greening of the fleet, rewards renewable energy  projects, and engages in responsible labor practices with priorities on  workers' rights and well-being. We are going to keep working to make  sure that we can have more green jobs that are good jobs, not only in  the space of renewable energy production but in the production of zero  emission vehicles as well. Prioritizing green jobs will also mean  prioritizing manufacturers whose raw materials will power the green  economy.    This is a unique opportunity for all of us, for our investments in  our communities, our businesses, and in our workers to come out on the  other side of this crisis stronger than ever.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
