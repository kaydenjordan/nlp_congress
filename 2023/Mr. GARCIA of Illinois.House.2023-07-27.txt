 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the  centennial anniversary of the village North Riverside, Illinois.   This area now known as North Riverside sits on Potawatomi land that  was purchased by a real estate and fur trading company in 1835.   By 1900, onion farmers had begun to move to the area, and the village  grew from there.   The bright neon lights and blaring brass sounds of the legendary  Melody Mill ballroom that were a mainstay of the big band era attracted  people from all over who were looking for a lindy-hopping night of jazz  and swing music.   North Riverside continues to be a thriving place with a vibrant  theater scene, sports, scouting, and even a quilting club. Every street  has a block captain who helps neighbors and seniors with errands and  much more.   Here is to the next 100 years, North Riverside.                            ____________________
