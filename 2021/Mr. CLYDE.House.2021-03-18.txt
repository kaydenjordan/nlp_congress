 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to shine a light on the  current crisis that is plaguing our southwest border. Customs and  Border Protection agents has stated that they are encountering more  than 3,000 illegal immigrants per day. It has also been reported that  Customs and Border Patrol encountered the highest number of illegal  aliens recorded in the month of February in over 7 years, at 100,441  encounters.    The Biden executive order terminating the construction of the wall  caused this crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it worse. The  Biden border crisis stands to threaten not only U.S. communities along  the southern border, but also Americans throughout the interior. And as  a result of the Federal Government's inaction, local border communities  are stepping up to fill the void.   But, unfortunately, these localities do not have the authority to  retain these illegals who plan to travel to dozens of cities throughout  the country. We must do everything in our power to protect Americans  from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus.   It seriously troubles me that the Secretary of Homeland Security  acknowledged just yesterday in a committee hearing that the Department  not only does not know how many illegal immigrants have been released,  but they are also not testing all of them for COVID-  [[Page H1576]]  19 before releasing them. Let that sink in.   The Department charged with protecting the homeland lacks an  executable strategy to ensure that all illegal immigrants are properly  screened and tested before they are released into the interior.   In order to right this wrong and stand up for the safety of all  Americans, I will be introducing the COVID-19 Border Protection Act, a  bill that repurposes COVID relief funds, funds from Democrats' nearly  $2 trillion package slated to be sent overseas, to test immigrants who  are encountered by Federal officials at the border and quarantine those  who test positive. I took an oath to protect all Americans, and this  bill does just that.   The crisis at the border is unacceptable and it exemplifies the  threat posed by the rollback of Trump-era policies that were tough on  illegal immigration.                                time  2115    Illegal immigrants should not be allowed to enter our country to  begin with, and a wall would help do just that. But they should  certainly not be allowed to enter and spread the COVID-19 virus. All  Americans should be appalled with the crisis at the border.   I call on my colleagues to join me in rejecting the administration's  America second policies and get tough on illegal immigration.
