 Mr. Speaker, we cannot rely on words alone to repel  Russian aggression in Ukraine nor to extinguish terrorism in the Middle  East. Rather, we must also provide material support to our democratic  partners, as well. We must not cleave Israel and Israeli funding and  Ukraine and Ukrainian funding into two separate spending votes because  their fight for freedom is actually one and the same.   The stories of Ukraine and Israel are inherently intertwined, and I  am the daughter of their woven histories and struggles. With forged  papers, my Jewish father evaded the Nazi threat in Lviv. The vast  majority of his family was murdered in the Holocaust, but the few who  survived emigrated to the United States, Australia, and Israel.   It is an absolute dereliction of our duty to democracy to condition  and politicize our support for Israel or Ukraine. To do so would signal  to our adversaries abroad that we don't have the willpower, that we  don't have the courage, to stand up to authoritarianism or extremism  wherever it rears its ugly head.   We cannot send that message. We cannot appease evil. We cannot afford  to backslide in defense of democracy.                            ____________________
