 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Galena Park Independent School District's very own North Shore High  School football team for their fifth time in a row going to the Texas  State Championship.   Located in my district, North Shore Senior High School is home to a  group of outstanding athletes and students both academically and  athletically. Through their hard work and perseverance, our local stars  will now play against Duncanville High School.   I am truly proud of all their accomplishments both on and off the  field. They embody the Texas spirit of excellence and courage.   I urge the Mustangs to stay focused and stay strong, because all of  Texas 29 is rooting for them this Saturday.   Go Mustangs.                            ____________________
