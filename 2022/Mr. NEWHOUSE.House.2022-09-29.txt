 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a member of my team  for his hard work and dedication over the last 8 years.   Sean O'Brien started working for Washington's Fourth Congressional  District at just about the same time that I did. He even stepped up to  run my first reelection campaign. Luckily for both of us, he was  successful, and he served as my legislative assistant, my legislative  director, and eventually my deputy chief of staff.   I was proud to step into the role of Congressional Western Caucus  chairman with Sean at the helm. With his vision, knowledge, and  steadfast support as the executive director, we worked together to  build an organization that I am proud to lead.   Sean, as you join the new House alumni association, never forget what  you learned in the people's House. The long hours and late nights are  worth it. Our work is important, but the real work happens outside the  swamp. And never underestimate a supportive team because you will  always be an invaluable member of mine.                            ____________________
