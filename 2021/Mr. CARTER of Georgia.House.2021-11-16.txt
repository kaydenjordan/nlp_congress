 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor the life of former Georgia Secretary of State and  United States Senator Max Cleland. Max was a  [[Page H6273]]  political giant in Georgia, dedicating his life to the service of  others.   A disabled war veteran of the Vietnam era, Max worked tirelessly to  improve the Veterans Administration to help his fellow soldiers.  Committed to helping others, Max made it his mission to help our  veterans most in need and suffering from mental and physical disorders.  As a pharmacist, I am able to personally appreciate his work to make  lifesaving medicines more easily available.   His dedication and service to his community and country will not go  unnoticed. I am thankful for Max's lifetime of dedicated service, and I  know his legacy will live on forever.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                       Oglethorpe Speedway Park Closing     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect upon the  closing of the great Oglethorpe Speedway Park in Pooler, Georgia.   The Oglethorpe Speedway Park opened in March of 1951 and has hosted  some of the most exciting weekends for race fans ever since. Sadly,  Oglethorpe Speedway Park will be closing its operations for good.   This speedway has become a home for its employees and fans alike such  as Darlene Nerich, who has worked each season and every weekend since  April 1, 2000. Darlene's daughter took her senior prom pictures and had  her wedding at the track so that her mother could continue her streak.  Geraldine Jenkins has been attending races since 1951 when she was 14  and has hardly missed a race.   Georgians are collectively mourning the loss of this beloved landmark  and the memories it holds. We are sad to see it go, but we are excited  for what may come next.                 Remembering Monsignor William Oliver O'Neill     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor the life of the Reverend Monsignor William Oliver  O'Neill of St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Savannah.   Reverend O'Neill served the people of Savannah for 46 years until his  retirement in 2013. He served six churches in his time in Savannah and  spent much of his time preserving the history of the church in the  city.   Reverend O'Neill oversaw and managed the $11 million restoration of  the Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist in Savannah that was  completed in 2000. In 2003, Reverend O'Neill successfully stopped an  armed arsonist from damaging the church by telling him: Don't point  that gun at me. I will knock your head off.   He removed smoldering cushions from the bishop's chair and a burning  Bible from the pulpit as the arsonist looked on. Reverend O'Neill  returned, intent on fighting the fire with a fire extinguisher before  police stopped him and firefighters arrived.   He was the image of service to others and love for God. My thoughts  and prayers are with his friends and family through this difficult  time.            Celebrating Willie Mae Hubbard-Wright's 103rd Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  103rd birthday of Willie Mae Hubbard-Wright of Liberty County.   Born on November 4, 1918, 7 days before the unofficial end of World  War I, Willie Mae has been a staple in her community for many years.    During her childhood, she was a proud member of Ebenezer Presbyterian  Church in Freedmen's Grove.   She attended grammar school at Dorchester Academy and graduated in  1936. After grammar school, Willie Mae became a boarder in Dorchester,  where she learned to sew, a talent that would stay with her many years  after her time as a boarder.   The living embodiment of motherly love, Willie Mae sewed clothes for  her family and friends, making full use of the talent God had given  her. We treasure Willie Mae and are happy to celebrate this momentous  occasion.   Happy birthday, Willie Mae, 103 years young.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Ross Tolleson of Perry, Georgia.   Ross was a beloved and honored member of the Georgia State Senate,  where he served from 2001-2015. Senator Tolleson represented the 20th  Senatorial District, and he did so with a servant's heart, always  working to better those that he represented. He served on the Committee  on Natural Resources and Environment, chairing the Natural Resources  Subcommittee for Appropriations.   Outside of the Senate, Ross served his community as a banker, an  insurance salesman, and a tree farmer. He will forever be remembered  for his selfless dedication to improving and assisting our great State.   I am thankful to have served with Ross and will always hold the time  we spent together close to my heart. My thoughts and prayers are with  his family, friends, and all who knew him during this most difficult  time.                            ____________________
