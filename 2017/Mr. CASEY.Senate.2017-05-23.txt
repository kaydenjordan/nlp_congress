 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, today I wish to commend Bonnie Seaman, who  has loyally served the people of Pennsylvania for more than 40 years,  more recently as the director of constituent services for my Senate  office. Bonnie has not only been a trusted member of my staff but a  very close family friend.   Bonnie was born and raised on a turkey farm in Leck Kill, PA. She is  the youngest of four children. She first began her public service  career in county government at what was then known as the  Northumberland County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Department,  where she touched the lives of people in her community.   In pursuit of a college degree, Bonnie attended Indiana University of  Pennsylvania and graduated cum laude with a degree in education. After  graduation, she worked as a special education teacher.   Bonnie's passion for helping others steered her career to the  Pennsylvania State Senate. While working in the Pennsylvania Senate,  she was asked by her supervisor if she was interested in working on my  father's transition team after he was elected Governor of Pennsylvania  in 1986. This transition job offer was supposed to be temporary, but  Bonnie would spend the next 30 years working in State government for  both then-Governor Casey and then me, when I got to State government  years later.   She worked as the Governor's executive assistant for 8 years, and of  course she wore many hats, managing the Governor's staff, scheduling  events, and resolving constituent issues, but her most important role  was providing support to the Governor. Her dedication and loyalty  earned her the respect of her fellow employees in the Governor's office  as well as those she worked with outside of the office.   After working in Governor Casey's administration, Bonnie worked as  well with my father on his autobiography entitled ``Fighting for  Life.'' In his book he pays tribute to her as follows:         I could never have made it through this project without my       executive assistant,  [[Page S3082]]       Bonnie Seaman. It's hard to think of any work I have done       these past ten years without Bonnie. Another theme of this       book is loyalty, and few people have taught me more about the       trait than Bonnie. I am deeply indebted to her for the skill       and good spirit she brings to our work right up to this day.    That was written more than 20 years ago--just about 22 years ago. Of  course, I can say the same thing about Bonnie's work in the U.S.  Senate. In 1996, when I was elected the State's auditor general, Bonnie  was vital to, first, my transition team. Then she served as the  director of the Office of the Auditor General for 8 years, where she  oversaw day-to-day operations of my schedule and the management of  staff. When I was elected State treasurer in 2004, Bonnie began work  with the Treasury Department. Then, finally, when I was elected in 2006  to the Senate, I asked Bonnie to serve as director of constituent  services. I knew that her dedication to public service and compassion  for others would make her an excellent director. She led the office of  constituent services for 10 years with distinction. With her gold  standard professionalism, and unimpeachable ethics, she was a mentor to  her staff and served as a shining example of quality public service.  Through her work, Bonnie has touched the lives of over 60,000  Pennsylvania constituents.   On behalf of my family, as well as thousands of families across our  Commonwealth, I express our gratitude to Bonnie Seaman for more than  three decades of stellar public service. The building we worked in, in  Harrisburg, has this inscription on the front of it, the finance  building: ``All public service is a trust, given in faith and accepted  in honor.'' Bonnie accepted the trust that was placed in her. She kept  faith with taxpayers and brought honor to her work. I wish Bonnie well  in her retirement as she travels with her husband Tom, attends yoga  classes, and enjoys time with her family and friends.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
