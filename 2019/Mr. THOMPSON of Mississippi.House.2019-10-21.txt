 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I am happy to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Elijah  Cummings.   We all have at least one Elijah Cummings story. Some of us have a lot  more. But more importantly, it is how Elijah lived that we have to pay  tribute to.   Elijah demonstrated every day not only that he loved the people of  Baltimore, but he loved this great country. If we can just pattern our  lives after Elijah Cummings' past, we will be fine.   To a great warrior, a great patriot, a great leader who, obviously,  in a lot of our minds, was taken too short, we say God bless you. We  understand that if we had anything to do with it, we would have kept  you here. But it just wasn't in the plan.   So, departing, I say to you, as well as my colleagues: Elijah, we  appreciate you. Your job here in this Congress speaks volumes. God  bless you.
