 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding as well. The VA  currently requires veterans in need of organ transplants to travel to  VA transplant centers to receive their transplant. Waiting times at  these centers average 32 percent longer than those non-VA transplant  centers.   In addition, we have reports that show that the further the veteran  is from a VA transplant center, the less likely the veteran is to  receive the organ transplant. This can ultimately prove fatal. We owe  it to our Nation's  [[Page H8560]]  heroes to provide them the best possible care, regardless of where they  live.   Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation offered by my friend and  colleague from Florida, Dr. Dunn, to solve this problem. I am just  amazed that we have waited this long to realize we had one.   The VICTOR Act allows veterans who live more than 100 miles from one  of the VA's 13 transplant centers to seek care at a federally  certified, non-VA facility. I am proud to cosponsor the VICTOR Act  because our veterans shouldn't be punished just because of where they  live.
