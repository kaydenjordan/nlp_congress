 Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring and thanking an outstanding public servant, Mayor David J.  Berger, who will retire at the end of this month, after dedicating his  life to serving his beloved city of Lima, OH. He leaves this office  with a legacy of service and accomplishments.   Dave has served as the mayor of Lima, OH, for a remarkable 32 years.  He is the proud son of an IBEW union worker and was raised with a keen  sense of service to others and a dedication to his Catholic faith--two  things that would guide him throughout his career. Dave's faith led him  to attend a seminary high school and then St. Meinrad's seminary in  southern Indiana. Upon leaving the seminary, he attended Catholic  University of America in Washington, DC, where he received both his  bachelor's and master's degrees.   Following graduation, his faith and commitment to service brought him  to Lima, OH, where he served as the executive director of Rehab  Project. He worked to bring opportunity for a second chance to Ohioans  in prison, helping provide training to build and renovate homes. This  work led him to run for mayor in 1989 and, after a successful campaign,  serve in that position ever since.   From his work serving as a founding member of the bipartisan Ohio  Mayors Alliance, to serving as cochair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors  Water Council, Dave has worked with mayors and legislators on both  sides of the aisle to always be a persistent advocate for the people of  Lima and the concerns and challenges faced by many cities throughout  the industrial Midwest.   Dave is well known for his work advocating for water infrastructure  and has spent half of his career as mayor leading negotiations with the  U.S. and Ohio EPAs to work to solve a combined and sanitary sewer  overflow problem that has plagued many cities. My staff and I regularly  met with Dave about these issues and acted upon his ideas and  suggestions.   We have also worked together on several community projects. From  helping to launch a My Brother's Keeper chapter in his city to  advocating for public infrastructure investments or ensuring employers  in Lima honor the dignity of work by respecting labor union rights,  David and I have spent years collaborating to help the local community  flourish.   With his commitment to push for research and economic development,  and improving the city's downtown, Dave has lent his time and wisdom to  serving on the board of directors of the  [[Page S8343]]  Ohio Energy Advanced Manufacturing Center; Downtown Lima, Inc.; the  Allen Economic Development Group; and West Ohio Community Action  Partnership. His pursuit of partnerships among these organizations and  many community-driven task forces have helped support the city's  workers and helped retain vital employers in the community, including  the Lima Refinery, the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, JSMC, and  the Ford Engine Plant.   I am grateful that our friendship long predates both of our political  careers--Dave is a fellow native of Mansfield, OH. He is also a fellow  Eagle Scout. One my most prized photos is that of then-Col. John Glenn  posing with me as I am awarded the Eagle Scout badge at the Johnny  Appleseed Council's Eagle Scout ceremony. What that photo does not show  is that Mayor Berger was there as well.   Dave's legacy will live on in the city he loved--the jobs he saved  and secured, the water infrastructure he improved, the businesses he  helped thrive and grow, and, most importantly, the lives he helped  change for the better.   I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing my friend, Mayor David J.  Berger, a long and happy retirement. Dave has done so much good for so  long for the people of Lima, and because of his work, Lima's next  mayor, Sharetta Smith, has a strong foundation to continue addressing  the challenges facing this city in the heart of Allen County.   Dave, thank you for 32 years of dedicated service and for the legacy  you have created. I know it has not always been, easy but all your  efforts are appreciated.                            ____________________
