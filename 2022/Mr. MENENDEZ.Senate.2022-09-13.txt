 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

Policy Justification                    Pakistan--F-16 Case for Sustainment         The Government of Pakistan has requested to consolidate       prior F-16 sustainment and support cases to support the       Pakistan Air Force F-16 fleet by reducing duplicate case       activities and adding additional continued support elements.       Included are U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics services for follow-on support of       Pakistan's F-16 fleet to include participation in F-16       Aircraft Structural Integrity Program, Electronic Combat       International Security Assistance Program, International       Engine Management Program, Engine Component Improvement       Program, and other technical coordination groups; aircraft       and engine hardware and software modifications and support;       aircraft and engine spare repair/return parts, accessories       and support equipment; classified and unclassified software       and software support; publications, manuals, and technical       documentation; precision measurement, calibration, lab       equipment,  [[Page S4567]]       and technical support services; studies and surveys; and       other related elements of aircraft maintenance and program       support. The estimated total cost is $450 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a partner nation that is a force       for political stability in the region by allowing Pakistan to       retain interoperability with U.S. and coalition forces in       ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for       future contingency operations.        The proposed sale will improve Pakistan's capability to       meet current and future threats by continuing the sustainment       of its F-16 fleet, which is the Pakistan Air Force's premier       multi-role jet fighter and greatly improves Pakistan's       ability to project combat power in support of       counterterrorism through its robust air-to-ground capability.       Pakistan will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and       services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Fort Worth, TX. There are no known offsets       proposed in conjunction with this sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Pakistan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
