 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  continued injustices at our southern border.   Recent reports have continued to highlight the conditions at DHS  detention camps are deplorable, inhumane, and abusive to children.  Current and former Border Patrol agents have attested to the horrible  conditions these children are being subjected to.   Now that we have provided emergency funding, we must stop this abuse  by the Trump administration in its tracks. We need far greater  accountability, we need to set required standards for medical care, we  need to strictly limit the time spent in detention facilities, and we  need to institute protocols to ensure compassionate processing of  children and families.   What is going on at our border does not reflect our values. It does  not reflect who we are. And the impact on these children will last a  lifetime.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  work with us to stop this stain on our great Nation's long history of  compassion, refuge, and inclusion.                            ____________________
