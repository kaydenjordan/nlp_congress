 Madam Speaker, this is not a women's issue or a men's  issue. It is an issue for what is right. People have a right to make  health choices. If someone doesn't believe in abortion, then make that  choice for yourself. If someone believes in something else, then they  have the right to make that choice. So eligibility for title X funding  should be based on a provider's ability to provide family planning  services, period. Whether a provider offers safe and legal abortions  with private funds should not be used to prevent women and men from  getting preventive care like cancer screenings or HIV tests. That is  all the rule requires.    It should not be controversial. Yet, here we are.   What effect would this Congressional Review Act have?   Well, Kansas has given us an ominous preview. When Kansas defunded  providers that offered abortion services, the number of Kansans  accessing cancer screenings, STI tests, and other care through the  title X program plummeted by thousands. A vote for this CRA is a vote  to multiply that number.   The Americans who will be affected by this CRA will lose the  opportunity to see the provider of their choice, sometimes the only  viable provider.   Why would we want to put women--why would we want to put anybody in  that category, where they cannot see the only viable provider because  someone else doesn't like what the doctor can do?   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' My Republican friends always  talk about individual freedom and how important it is. This is an  individual freedom of a woman's right to control her own body and to  make personal choices on health care. We should not interfere with  that. We should allow the most and the best health care to be available  to all people. I urge a ``no'' vote.
