 Mr. Speaker, Friday, thousands of Americans participated  in the March for Life in support of the most vulnerable in our society  who have no voice: the preborn.   Today, we continue to recognize the dignity of every individual and  fight for the most fundamental right of all: the right to life. Our  instincts were always right. Science has revealed it is not just a  clump of cells in the womb. At 15 weeks, babies suck their thumbs,  kick, jump, have fully developed hearts, and can feel pain.   What looks like a baby in the womb, revealed to us through ultrasound  technology, is in fact a baby when they are born.   The radical Roe v. Wade decision was based on bad science and bad  jurisprudence, and I am grateful that it was overturned.   Now is the time where we as a Nation must continue to build a culture  that respects life and recognizes the God-given dignity of every  individual and that first unalienable right: the right to life.   Despite the terror tactics we have seen come from pro-abortionists-- burning and vandalizing pregnancy centers  [[Page H270]]  and churches--the pro-life movement has not winced.   Pregnancy centers across the country continue operating, providing  mothers with true healthcare, and they are saving lives.   Mr. Speaker, I join with these and millions across our Nation in  serving as a voice for the voiceless. I, along with my fellow  colleagues here, will continue to work to advance legislation that  protects the preborn and the right to life.
