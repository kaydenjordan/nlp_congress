 Mr. President, reserving the right to object. One hundred  years ago, not many people could have imagined, certainly not predicted  within a degree of accuracy, the kinds of technological advances that  we have seen over the last century that have allowed us all to have  lights in our own homes; to have televisions, cell phones, all manner  of conveniences; and that these things would be widely available to  rich and poor alike, urban and rural alike.   These are conveniences that are now so common that they are easy to  take for granted. But they don't come about automatically. They didn't  just happen. They have been brought to us as a result of labor and  innovation and dedication of individuals who took chances and created  something new.   Today, I stand opposed to the nomination of Shalanda Baker because  she openly opposes the economic system that has brought so much fortune  to our country. Regarding capitalism, free markets, Ms. Baker stated  the following:         As we move into this new future, we must also remember that       a just transformation of our energy system requires a careful       interrogation of the racist, capitalist politics that       currently drive it. We must expose, and then eradicate, these       underpinnings.    Ms. Baker, in addition to having made statements like that one,  advocates for a cap-and-floor model for electric utility pricing, one  in which high-income individuals would pay a minimum--not a maximum,  but a minimum of 6 percent of their entire household income on  electricity; and then other households who are less wealthy--the least  wealthy would pay no more than 3 or 4 percent of household income.   Look, I, too, want to make sure that our poorest citizens and our  poorest communities have access to resources and are able to be lifted  out of poverty, but placing obstacles in the way of competitive markets  and denigrating the very concept of the competitive markets that have  made electricity and so many other developments so available to so many  people, rich and poor alike, would I fear; would I firmly believe;  would I, am certain, end up preventing technological advances that  benefit everyone in our society.   For these reasons, I oppose Ms. Baker's nomination, and I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, article II of  the Constitution gives this body some important responsibilities,  including the responsibility to provide advice and consent on Officers  of the United States. We have to confirm people after they have been  nominated by the President.   As a Member of the Senate, I take this responsibility seriously, and  I do my due diligence once a nominee has been submitted by the  President and consideration by the Senate. I have done that here.   And in the process of that due diligence process with this nominee, I  submitted a number of written questions to Ms. Hedlund in order to  develop a better understanding of how she would respond to certain  issues that are directly relevant to the position for which she is  seeking confirmation from the Surface Transportation Board.   Specifically, I asked her how she would approach: 1, cost-benefit  analysis in proposed regulations; 2, the  [[Page S6933]]  scope of the SBT's rulemaking authority; 3, how she would approach  consideration of rate regulation, rate caps, or price controls; 4, her  definition of the public interest, which is a key term that comes up as  used in STB proceedings; 5, how she would balance Amtrak access to the  freight rail network with reliable freight service; and, 6, how she  would approach the carrying out of the NEPA process, including the  definitions behind the key regulatory terms at issue.   These are all issues that are really relevant to the STB, and these  are the kinds of questions that deal with the kinds of things she would  do if confirmed as a member of the STB.   Needless to say, I was disappointed with my responses. Some of the  answers avoided answering my questions; some answers appeared to be  purposely vague; and some refused even directly to answer the question.   So for these reasons, I voted against Ms. Hedlund's nomination before  the Commerce Committee, and my position has not changed since that vote  took place. I am not comfortable granting my consent today, and I will  not be, until I have the information and more thorough, responsive  answers to my reasonable questions. And so for these reasons, I object.
