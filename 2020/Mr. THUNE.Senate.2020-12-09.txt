 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am hoping that we will be able to pass a  COVID relief bill before Christmas. As the leader has said earlier, we  don't need to resolve all of our differences to pass a bill. We can  pass targeted legislation that focuses on the priorities that we all  agree need to be addressed. As the leader pointed out earlier this  morning on the floor, Republicans here in the Senate have tried  repeatedly, going back to last summer, to move legislation that is  targeted, that is fiscally responsible, and that addresses the key  needs that are being experienced and the challenges that are being felt  by the American people during the pandemic.   In fact, as recently as October, we had a majority of U.S. Senators  here on the floor that attempted to get on a bill--a targeted, fiscally  responsible bill--that addressed the needs that our small businesses  have, with additional funding for the PPP program; that provided an  extension for unemployment insurance for people who were unemployed;  that provided funding for vaccine distribution; that also provided  funding for frontline workers and, I should add, funding for schools  and universities. It was a very targeted, fiscally responsible bill. It  was voted on here in the Senate not only once but twice.   Both in September and October, we brought a bill to the floor and  couldn't even get on it because the Democratic leadership decided to  block that bill. So we didn't even have a debate. Not only could we not  get a vote on something that represented a good-faith effort at  addressing the key needs that are being felt by the American people as  a result of the pandemic, but we couldn't even get on the bill to  debate it.   So we are trying yet one more time, and I hope this time we will meet  with success because I do believe that we need to pass COVID relief  before the end of the year, and I hope Members of the Democratic  leadership will decide that they are willing to move forward to meet  our country's most critical COVID priorities                 Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act of 2020    Mr. President, on the subject of COVID relief, there is another issue  that we should address before the end of the year, and that is tax  relief for remote and mobile workers. The complicated tax situation  facing mobile workers has been an issue for a while now, but it has  been thrown into especially sharp relief by the pandemic.   As everyone knows, medical professionals around the country have  traveled to hard-hit areas this year to help hospitals deal with the  influx of COVID cases. But what many people don't realize is that these  medical professionals, like other mobile workers, are likely to face a  complicated tax situation this year as a result. For the majority of  Americans, State income tax is fairly uncomplicated. Most Americans  work in the same State in which they reside. So there is no question as  to which State will be taxing their income.   For mobile workers, however--like traveling nurses or technicians or  the medical professionals who responded to COVID in hard-hit areas--the  situation is a lot more complicated. Like most Americans, their income  is subject to taxation in the State in which their permanent home is  located, but any income that they earned in a State other than their  State of residence is also subject to taxation in the State in which  they earned it.   Now, individuals can generally receive a tax credit in their home  State for income tax paid to another State, thus avoiding double  taxation of their income. I would add, however, that for States that  don't have an income tax--and there are many of those across the  country, including my home State of South Dakota--there is no tax  credit against income tax paid because there is no income tax paid in  the home State.   But mobile workers' income tax situation is extremely complicated, as  they generally have to file tax returns in multiple States, and it is  made even more complicated by the fact that States have a multitude of  different rules governing just when income earned in their State starts  to be taxed. Some States give up to a 60-day window before income  earned by mobile workers in their State is subject to taxation. Other  States start taxing mobile workers immediately.   Navigating different States' requirements can make for a miserable  tax season for mobile workers, and it can also be a real burden for  their employers. It is particularly challenging for smaller businesses,  which frequently lack the in-house tax staff and tracking capabilities  of larger organizations.   The situation has long cried out for a solution. For the past four  Congresses, I have introduced legislation, the Mobile Workforce State  Income Tax Simplification Act, to create a uniform standard for mobile  workers. It is a bipartisan bill, and under that bill if you spend 30  days or fewer working in a different State, you would be taxed as  normal by your home State. If you spend more than 30 days working in a  different State, you would be subject to that other State's income tax  in addition to income tax from your home State.   In June of this year, I introduced an updated version of my mobile  workforce bill: the Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act. Like my  original mobile workforce bill, the Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act  would create a uniform 30-day standard governing State income tax  liability for mobile workers. But my new bill goes further and  addresses some of the particular challenges faced by mobile and remote  workers as a result of the coronavirus.   The Remote and Mobile Worker Relief Act would establish a special 90- day standard for healthcare workers who travel to another State to help  during the pandemic. This should ensure that these workers don't face  an expected tax bill for the contributions that they make to fighting  the coronavirus.   My new bill also addresses the possible tax complications that could  face remote workers as a result of the pandemic. During the coronavirus  crisis, many workers who usually travel to their offices every day have  ended up working from home. This doesn't present a tax problem for most  employees, but it does present a possible problem for workers who live  in a different State than the one in which they work.   Under current State law, these workers usually pay most or all of  their State income taxes to the State in which they earn this income  rather than their State of residence. However, now that some workers  who usually work in a different State have been working from home,  there is a risk that their State of residence could consider the  resulting income as allocated to and taxable by it as well. That could  mean a higher tax bill for a lot of workers.   My bill would preempt this problem by codifying the prepandemic  status quo. Under my bill, if you planned to work in North Carolina but  had to work from home in South Carolina during the pandemic, your  income would still be taxed as if you were going in to the office in  North Carolina every day, just as it would have been if the pandemic  had never happened.  [[Page S7292]]    Relief for mobile workers is a bipartisan idea. A version of my  original mobile workforce bill has passed the House of Representatives  multiple times, and the only reason it hasn't advanced so far in the  U.S. Senate is because of the opposition of a handful of States, like  New York, that aggressively tax temporary workers.   New York, of course, was the epicenter of the pandemic in the United  States early on, and medical professionals from across the country came  to New York to work and to help out. Now, one would think that their  presence would be an occasion for profound gratitude, but New York  Governor Andrew Cuomo apparently also regards them as an opportunity  for a tax windfall. That is right. Despite the fact that these workers  provided indispensable help to New York in the worst period during the  pandemic, in May Governor Cuomo announced that these workers would  nevertheless be subject to New York's substantial income tax for the  time that they spent working in the State.   It is unconscionable that we would allow healthcare professionals who  risked their lives--risked their own lives--to care for individuals in  coronavirus-stricken States to be punished with unexpected tax bills.  And we need to make sure that Americans who work from home to help slow  the spread of the virus don't face a complicated tax situation or an  unexpectedly high tax bill as a result.   It would be wonderful to see the Democratic leader who, of course,  hails from New York, speak up to endorse remote and mobile worker  relief. He should make it clear whether he agrees with Governor Cuomo's  decision to cash in on COVID relief workers' assistance or whether he  thinks these vital medical professionals should be spared unexpected  tax bills.   I really hope that he is not actively standing in the way of my bill  in order to protect Governor Cuomo's efforts to boost New York's  coffers at healthcare workers' expense. I encourage him to make it  clear where he stands on this issue.   I intend to do everything I can to ensure that my bill receives a  vote in the Senate before Christmas. Passing this legislation would  spare a lot of workers a lot of misery when April comes around.   Americans have been through enough this year. Let's not add  unexpected tax bills to the equation                            ____________________     Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions be discharged from further consideration of S. 3451 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
