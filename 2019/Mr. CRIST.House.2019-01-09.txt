 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, for 19 days, critical financial agencies which serve the  people have been closed. Taxpayer assistance has stopped; the people's  refunds are at risk of serious delay; small business support is  suspended; and consumer protection work has been halted. People are  hurting. It is a self-inflicted wound.   But today, we have the opportunity to reopen these critical agencies  for the people. The solution is simple: vote ``yes'' on this  legislation; put people above politics; and reopen our government  today.
