 Mr. President, there are several important domestic and  international matters before us that require our urgent attention, not  least of which is the need to find a bipartisan path to keep the  Federal Government open and fund it within the next 3 days to prevent a  national economic calamity.   We have a lot of work to do. A lot of priorities vie for our  attention. But today, on World Diabetes Day, I rise to address another  pressing issue that I believe also requires our timely action.   I want to uplift the findings of my new bipartisan white paper,  released today on this World Diabetes Day. It shines a light on the  urgent need for Congress to finally address the high costs of insulin  and pass Federal legislation to cap the costs of insulin for every  American who needs it.   This report is issued jointly today from my office in collaboration  with my partner in this work, my friend the Republican Senator from  Louisiana, John Kennedy. Senator Kennedy and I have been working to  address the high costs of insulin because this is a problem that is  particularly acute in our States.   Over 12 percent of adults in my home State of Georgia--12 percent-- are diabetic, but in Louisiana, that number climbs to over 14 percent,  and many of these are people who cannot afford access to this  lifesaving drug.   This is what we hear from the people in our States, but this new  report, for the first time, takes a comprehensive look to learn more  about who and where these people are. And what we found in our original  analysis is that there are more than 800 counties across the country  where you see the tragic convergence of high rates of diabetics coupled  with high rates of uninsured people--high levels of diabetes, high  levels of uninsured people. And we call these insulin deserts. These  insulin deserts--some 813 counties across our country--are in the top  half of counties across the country for both their percentage of  individuals who are uninsured and who have diabetes--over 800 counties.  And over 100 of these insulin desert counties are in my home State of  Georgia.    Over 75 million nonelderly people live in insulin deserts. That  includes more than 12 million Americans who are uninsured. In fact,  among nonelderly individuals, insulin deserts have nearly double the  percentage of uninsured residents as those who live in nondeserts.   So our analysis shows these insulin deserts are concentrated in the  South and the Southeast. But it also shows that there are insulin  deserts all over the country, concentrated in the South and in the  Southeast, but you see them from Washington State to Texas, to North  Dakota, to Florida, to New Jersey. In other words, this is a national  problem.   And who are the people in these insulin deserts? Well, as compared to  uninsured folks in other parts of the country, uninsured Americans who  live in these places are, one, more likely to fall under the Federal  poverty line than their counterparts. They are less likely to be  college graduates than uninsured Americans in nondeserts. They are more  likely to be people of color than uninsured Americans in nondeserts. In  fact, in 2019, Black Americans were twice as likely as non-Hispanic  White Americans to die from diabetes.   And uninsured Americans in insulin deserts are less likely to have  access to sufficient internet service than uninsured Americans. And why  does this matter? One of the reasons it matters is because it means  that they have less access to patient assistance programs offered  online by insulin manufacturers, and we know the challenges that  uninsured people experience when it comes to accessing healthcare.   This report deals with the uninsured people who are diabetics and the  convergence of those two things.   So what does all of this mean? What this report illustrates is that  even with the steps private industry has taken to lower insulin costs-- steps that are good, that many of us in Congress pressed them to do.  But it is still voluntary, and, by the way, they could be rescinded at  any time.   And even with the steps more than 20 States have taken to institute  State-level insulin copay caps and even with our success in lowering  out-of-pocket insulin costs for Medicaid beneficiaries, there are still  millions of Americans and communities across our country that are being  left behind. They live in these insulin deserts concentrated in the  South and the Southeast, but you see them all over the country. They  are being left behind.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in 2019,  uninsured people with diabetes spent close to $1,000 on insulin alone.  If you are poor and you are uninsured, that number is unaffordable. We  know that number includes the 246,000 insured Americans who use insulin  every year, and we know that number rises to more than 540,000  Americans when we include those who experience a lapse in coverage.   But even when we look past the uninsured, we know that when we  include those Americans with private insurance, the total number of  Americans who are left vulnerable to potential spikes in insulin prices  jumps to some 2.75 million Americans.   Here is the thing: Insulin should not be expensive. It is a 100-year- old drug. When it was invented, the patent was sold for $1. It  certainly shouldn't be unaffordable.   For the first time, this analysis, which my office releases today,  paints a clear picture of who is needlessly suffering and whom we will  leave behind if we do not pass my $35 cap for the insured and the  uninsured.   We already know what happens when people can't afford their insulin.  We know that one in four diabetics--listen--ration their insulin. In  the United States of America, people are rationing insulin, getting  insulin from friends who have relatives who have passed away. I spent  time with a young woman in my State named Lacey, who is a graduate  student, was meeting people on Facebook meetup groups and then meeting  them in dimly lit parking lots at the local Chick-fil-A to get insulin  in the United States of America, a drug, invented 100 years ago, sold  for $1.   That is not right. But not only is it not right, it is not smart. It  is bad fiscal policy. We know that every year Federal and State  government spending on hospitalizations related to complications from  diabetes totals more than $11 billion. That is more money  [[Page S5499]]  than it would cost to cap the cost of insulin for everybody who needs  it.   And, so, yes, I am a pastor; I am going to make the moral argument,  but I am saying to you that it is not right, and it is not smart.   And perhaps that is why there are many of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle who care about this issue and have long been working to  make insulin more affordable for diabetics.   I want to commend my colleagues, Senator Jean Shaheen and Susan  Collins, for their leadership over the years that has helped keep this  issue on Washington's front burner. I look forward to our continued  partnership in the coming months on this issue.   I was proud that last year this Chamber passed a provision from my  legislation, the Affordable Insulin Now Act, that was signed into law  as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Since January 1, that provision  has been saving our seniors money by capping out-of-pocket insulin  costs at no more than $35 a month for Medicare patients. And my  original Affordable Insulin Now Act included a 35-dollar-a-month  insulin copay cap for patients on private insurance as well, and it  almost passed this Chamber.   We got close. Now it is time to get it done. We weren't successful in  getting that provision over the finish line. But I was proud that  earlier this year, I got together with my friend John Kennedy, and we  introduced a new bipartisan version of the Affordable Insulin Now Act  that would finish the work we started by capping insulin costs at $35 a  month for insured Americans and uninsured Americans.   Since then, Senator Kennedy and I have been working to build support  for our legislation, which we have committed will be--listen-- completely paid for. And I am proud that support for our plan has  continued to grow. I am proud our bipartisan bill has the support now  of a broad coalition of Senators from both sides of the aisle, from  Senators Fetterman to Peters, to Hawley, to Vance, to Warren, to Casey,  to Britt, to Tuberville, to Braun, to Rosen--Senators who don't agree  on a whole range of things, but we all know this makes sense.   Our bipartisan plan to lower insulin costs for the insured and  uninsured also has the support of organizations like the American  Diabetes Association, the American College of Physicians, Protect Our  Care, and First Focus Campaign for Children.   So on World Diabetes Day, I encourage all of my colleagues to read  this report, which we released today, because it drives home the work  we should be focused on for the more than 7 million Americans with  diabetes who use insulin, and it reminds us of whom we leave behind  when we fail to act.   Dr. King said: Of all the injustices, inequality in healthcare is the  most shocking and the most inhumane.   Shame on us if we can't get this done.   And so in closing--and nobody believes a Baptist preacher when he  says ``in closing''--I think that this report is summed up by the story  of a woman in the State of Georgia.   She said:         I have suffered with [diabetes] since the age of 11. [The]       type of insulin that costs me hundreds of dollars every month       at the pharmacy was released to market the year before I was       diagnosed. I bought a vial in 1997 without insurance and it       cost me $18.   In 1997.         This insulin has not changed since then--    The drug hasn't changed--       but now costs hundreds of dollars. Something needs to be done       to ensure we who depend on this life sustaining medicine can       continue to afford it. We will literally die in a matter of       days without it. It is not a matter of choice.    I agree with her, something must be done. And so let me just thank  folks in my office, dedicated public servants who have been working on  this issue, especially Gabi Vesey, Annie Wang, and Harper Melnick, for  their work on this report. Thank you. People who need insulin really  need it. It is not a matter of choice, and Congress can make a  difference by passing this bipartisan legislation.   I urge my colleagues, with all that we have to do, to prioritize this  work as we handle the host of other vital issues that require this  body's attention.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I object.    I object.
