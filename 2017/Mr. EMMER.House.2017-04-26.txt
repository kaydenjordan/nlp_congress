 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  Minnesota's very own Dan Coborn.   Dan Coborn, a native son of the St. Cloud community, recently passed,  but his memory will live on.   Dan will be remembered as an executive who helped his family's  business grow and succeed. He will be remembered as a loving husband  and father whose wife and five children meant the world to him.  [[Page H2859]]    Perhaps most importantly, Dan Coborn will be remembered for his  charity and generosity. Over the span of his life, Dan Coborn gave back  to a number of charities that included the St. Cloud Area Family YMCA,  Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Minnesota, and the Boys and Girls  Clubs of Central Minnesota.   In addition to financially giving back to these charities, he also  gave his time by serving as a board member of the St. Cloud Hospital  and the Sauk Rapids-Rice Schools, in addition to serving as a founding  member of the United Way of Central Minnesota.   Dan Coborn was a hero in our community, and his passing is a massive  loss to us all. I wish his family peace during this difficult time, and  I promise his life's work will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
