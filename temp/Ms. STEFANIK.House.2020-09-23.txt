 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary  of the founding of The Chronicle, a weekly newspaper in my district.   The Chronicle was established by Mark Frost in 1980 in Glens Falls,  New York. Through hard work and determination, Mark turned an initial  investment of $1,700 into a successful newspaper and small business. He  remains the publisher and editor today, alongside their team who have  been with The Chronicle for decades.   In that time, The Chronicle has established a loyal base of readers  and advertisers, becoming truly a cornerstone of the community.   The Chronicle has also hosted events to provide a forum for  discussion and to bring Glens Falls residents together, especially  through The Chronicle Book Fair. The fair is an opportunity to  highlight and connect local authors and publishers and discover books  of all genres.   Annual events like this are important to strengthen and grow the  fabric of our communities, and I know many who are looking forward to  safely resuming them as soon as possible.   On behalf of New York's 21st District and the United States Congress,  I would like to thank Mark Frost, his family, and the entire Chronicle  team for their contributions to the community and congratulate them on  reaching this important 40-year milestone.                            ____________________
