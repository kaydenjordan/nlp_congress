 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1365) to make technical corrections to the Guam World  War II Loyalty Recognition Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1365         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Title XVII of division A of Public Law 114-328 is amended--        (1) in section 1703(e)--        (A) by striking ``equal to'' and inserting ``not to       exceed''; and        (B) by striking ``covered into the Treasury as       miscellaneous receipts'' and inserting ``used to reimburse       the applicable appropriations'';        (2) in section 1704(a) by striking ``, subject to the       availability of appropriations,'' and inserting ``from the       Claims Fund''; and        (3) by striking section 1707(a).       SEC. 2. BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.         (a) Determination of Budgetary Effects.--As the budgetary       effects for spending provided by this Act were estimated and       offset as part of the enactment of the Guam World War II       Loyalty Recognition Act (title XVII of division A of Public       Law 114-328), the budgetary effects of this Act shall be       determined as if the amendments made by this Act were       included in the enactment of the Guam World War II Loyalty       Recognition Act (title XVII of division A of Public Law 114-      328), for purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974       and the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record revised CBO materials.

Those customs duties and       income taxes are currently deposited in the Treasury as       miscellaneous receipts.        Using information from the Department of Justice about how       much compensation is due, CBO estimates that enacting H.R.       1365 would increase direct spending by $40 million for       compensation payments as funds become available over the       2020-2023 period.        The costs of the legislation (detailed in Table 1) fall       within budget function 800 (general government).                           TABLE 1--ESTIMATED INCREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING UNDER H.R. 1365                                       [By fiscal year, millions of dollars] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                           2019-                                                     2019     2020     2021     2022     2023     2024     2024 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated Budget Authority......................        0       12       12       12        4        0        40 Estimated Outlays...............................        0       12       12       12        4        0        40 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         This estimate supersedes the CBO estimate for H.R. 1365, a       bill to make technical corrections to the Guam World War II       Loyalty Recognition Act that was transmitted on July 10,       2019. Although the five-year and ten-year totals are correct,       the initial estimate indicated that there would be some costs       in 2019. The legislation has not yet passed either House of       Congress and CBO assumes it would be enacted near the end of       fiscal year 2019. Given that timing, CBO expects spending       would probably commence in fiscal year 2020.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew       Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,       Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.    Mr. Speaker, this marks the first time that I have  taken to this floor to deliver remarks as a Member of Congress. My  constituents can attest to the fact that I have never been one known to  shy away from a microphone. However, the gravitas of H.R. 1365 that I  bring to the floor today is of such consequence that I chose to  withhold the privilege of this floor until this day.   While H.R. 1365 is a bipartisan bill that would simply make technical  corrections to the current Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act,  it is the final component of a 75-year saga rooted in loyalty, faith,  hope, and love in the midst of unimaginable suffering.   The Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act was passed by Congress  and signed into law at the end of 2016, recognizing the sacrifices the  people of Guam endured at the hands of foreign occupiers during World  War II. Nearly 78 years ago, foreign enemies bombed  [[Page H7352]]  Pearl Harbor and then made their way east, taking control of Guam from  United States naval forces, many of which were evacuated prior to the  invasion.   The civilian population of Guam, regarded as Americans by the enemy,  were left undefended, for all intents and purposes. In the 974 days of  enemy occupancy, too many of the people of Guam, who today are American  citizens, were injured, raped, maimed, murdered, and even forced to dig  their own grave sites or those of their family and friends.   These atrocities occurred due to the unwavering patriotism of the  people of Guam.   An 83-year-old survivor clearly remembers her family risking their  lives to hide and care for the only living U.S. Navy soldier left on  the island, who was tasked with sending information to our forces  overseas. She shared her observations of enemy soldiers going village  to village, looking for radioman George Tweed and leaving a trail of  tortured and dead in their path.   Another 83-year-old survivor shared how he witnessed his childhood  friend beaten up every day just for looking American.   One survivor, who was 5 years old at the time, testified to  remembering her mother, pregnant with her sibling, after being severely  beaten, hemorrhage to a slow death while performing forced labor under  the grueling Sun. The baby did not survive either.   Though our people experienced such cruel acts, we remained vigilant  with the hope and faith that the United States would return and  liberate us from enemy forces. Seventy-five years ago this past Sunday,  true to their word, our servicemen took to the shores of Guam, many of  whom gave their lives to reclaim the island, and rescued those left who  survived the brutality.   These stories are the memories of our survivors who continue to carry  the heavy burdens of war post-liberation. These survivors, who were  steadfast in their devotion to this country, the United States of  America, were left out when America forgave its vanquished enemies from  any form of redress to those who suffered under their occupation.   Almost 3 years ago, Congress voted to pass the Guam World War II  Loyalty Recognition Act, providing those remaining survivors with a  Federal claims process to seek adjudicated compensation for wartime  suffering, a Federal process that, today, 75 years later, has one final  hurdle to clear with H.R. 1365 to make those who qualified whole. Of  the over 14,000 who suffered, 3,663 survivors have filed claims, with  many of the nearly 11,000 having passed before this process could even  begin.   Nonetheless, the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, since October  of last year, has certified over 600 claims, and the Commission  continues to adjudicate all claims filed.   Unfortunately, pertinent technical language was left out of the  original bill, preventing the Department of the Treasury from making  payments for claims adjudicated and certified for compensation by the  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. H.R. 1365 makes the necessary  corrections to the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act to see  Congress' intent through, and it was drafted in close consultation with  the Department of the Treasury and the Department of the Interior, to  ensure the language's efficacy.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to note for my colleagues that the  moneys used for payment of these claims does not create a new expense  category for the budget. I repeat, H.R. 1365 does not create a new  expense category for the Federal budget. Instead, the moneys deposited  in the Guam War Claims Fund is funding that originates from Guam's  section 30 Federal income tax transfer payments, essentially moneys  already due to the government of Guam. As such, funding for these  claims do not represent a new expense but a reprogramming of existing  expenses.   It is also important to note that these claimants are not just  constituents of mine. Many claimants live in 46 other States and  territories and are constituents to 265 districts across our Nation. We  have claimants in Alabama; Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California;  Colorado; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Hawaii; Idaho; Illinois;  Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maryland; Massachusetts;  Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Montana; Nebraska; Nevada;  New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; Ohio;  Oklahoma; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South  Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Utah, the great State that my colleague this  evening represents; Virginia; Washington; Washington, D.C.; Wisconsin;  Wyoming; the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and Guam.   Over these past 75 years, our World War II survivors and their  families have made their home throughout this country. Notwithstanding  our current political status, our sons, daughters, mothers, fathers,  brothers, and sisters have died defending the freedom that liberators  brought to our shores 75 years ago.                                time  2115    While we struggle on Guam under inequities and supplemental security  income, Medicaid, and even basic voting rights, we remain the Sparta of  America, with the highest per capita armed services recruitment rates  in the country.   The brutality of the enemy 75 years ago could not break the resolve  of our relationship with the United States of America and the  generations since then and, to this very day, reflect this exemplary  patriotism in our rights of service and those who made the ultimate  sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I humbly ask my colleagues for their support in passing  H.R. 1365 so the Greatest Generation of Guam who instilled in us this  faith in American democracy can finally receive the long-awaited  closure they have been seeking since the end of World War II.   As a gracious victor who assumed the responsibility for postwar  peace, the passage of H.R. 1365 represents an unreconciled act of grace  by the United States of America to a people who suffered for their  loyalty to America. Perhaps most importantly, it represents an  affirmation that, while slow to turn, and sometimes too slow, the  wheels of justice in the land of the free do eventually come full  circle.   A loyal people await the ultimate passage of H.R. 1365. And I am  humbled to not only represent them in this body, but to extend my  thanks on their behalf to the Speaker, majority leader, majority whip,  committee chairs of jurisdiction, my minority leader, and ranking  committee members who have made this moment possible, and to my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who, today, do us the tremendous  honor of seeing this measure through this House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague on the other side of  the aisle for his support.   Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my appreciation to various individuals  and entities for their unyielding support and assistance in pushing  this bill forward.   I thank Ms. Irene Sgambelluri, an 89-year-old war survivor who flew  out  [[Page H7353]]  here on her own to take meetings at the White House and who now has a  White House special assistant on speed dial; Congressman Kilili Sablan  for his assistance in moving this bill through the process; my  predecessors for laying much groundwork over many years that brings us  to this inflection point; my leadership counterparts in Guam; the  speaker of the Legislature of Guam and the Republican Party of Guam,  who recognized and endorsed this very important bipartisan measure.   Lastly, I want to thank the senior citizens of Guam, our war  survivors whose sacrifices, patience, and fortitude have given us the  strength and inspiration to bring this to closure on their behalf.   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 434) to designate the Emancipation National Historic  Trail, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 434         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emancipation National       Historic Trail Study Act''.       SEC. 2. EMANCIPATION NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL STUDY.         Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C.       1244(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(47) Emancipation national historic trail.--The       Emancipation National Historic Trail, extending approximately       51 miles from the Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in       Galveston, Texas, along Texas State Highway 3 and Interstate       Highway 45 North, to Freedmen's Town, then to Independence       Heights and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas, following       the migration route taken by newly freed slaves and other       persons of African descent from the major 19th century       seaport town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of       Freedmen's Town, located in the 4th Ward of Houston,       Texas.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 434, introduced by Representative Jackson Lee of  Texas, celebrates the freedom of the last American slaves by  authorizing the study of an approximately 51-mile route for inclusion  as a national historic trail in the National Trails System. The study  will examine the suitability of designating the Emancipation National  Historic Trail from Galveston to Freedmen's Town in Houston.   Nearly 2\1/2\ years after President Lincoln's Emancipation  Proclamation, United States General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston,  Texas, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.   Upon gaining their freedom, many of the 250,000 newly freed slaves  traversed the route from Galveston to Freedmen's Town in Houston,  spreading the news to neighboring communities. This bill is a fitting  tribute that honors the historic journey and lasting legacy of the last  American slaves.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for  championing this important legislation and for her hard work moving  this bill through the legislative process.   I strongly support passing this bill.   I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his support,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 759) to restore an opportunity for tribal economic  development on terms that are equal and fair, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 759         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and       Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity       Settlement Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT.         The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian       Tribes of Texas Restoration Act (Public Law 100-89; 101 Stat.       666) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 301. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preclude or       limit the applicability of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act       (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).''.   [[Page H7362]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 759, introduced by Representative Babin from Texas,  amends the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Indian Tribes of  Texas Restoration Act of 1987 to clarify that the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act applies to both the Pueblo and the Tribe.   The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas was federally terminated in  1954, followed by the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, also known as the Tigua  Tribe, in 1968. Congress rightfully restored both the Pueblo and the  Tribe in 1987 at one time by enacting the aforementioned Restoration  Act.   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted just 1 year later, in  1988. The framework that it created should have applied to both the  Pueblo and the Tribe, just as it did to every other Tribe. However,  since the Restoration Act was passed at a time when Indian gaming was  just emerging and Federal regulations had not yet been implemented, it  contains a section regarding gaming.   We know from the Congressional Record that the intent of this section  of the Restoration Act was to clarify Indian gaming policy at the time,  not to completely prohibit gaming on these lands in perpetuity, but  that is what is occurring. The language in the Restoration Act has been  used by the State of Texas to completely stymie the Pueblo's and the  Tribe's ability to engage in Class II gaming, much to the detriment of  the economic health and well-being of both the Pueblo and the Tribe.   Additionally, the only other federally recognized Tribe in Texas, the  Kickapoo Traditional Tribe, is allowed to operate a Class II gaming  facility, as they were restored by Congress in 1983 without any type of  gaming restrictions.   H.R. 759 remedies this inequality by clarifying that the Pueblo and  the Tribe, like the Kickapoo, have the same rights and responsibilities  under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act as virtually every other  federally recognized Tribe in the United States. The legislation  confers no new or special rights to the Pueblo or the Tribe, nor does  it in any way limit the existing rights of the State of Texas. This is  simply a matter of parity and fairness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, do not wish for my support of this measure to  indicate or to be misconstrued as support for gaming.   My support of this measure has everything to do with what my  colleague on the other side of the aisle has stated. This is about  parity, and this is about the unique sovereignty that recognized Tribes  have with the Federal Government through our own Constitution.   If we are going to be recognizing this unique sovereignty, we should  do so equally among all the other Tribes. This equality is so necessary  if we are going to maintain the credibility of the process.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for my colleagues and all the work that  they put into this, and I yield back the balance of my time
