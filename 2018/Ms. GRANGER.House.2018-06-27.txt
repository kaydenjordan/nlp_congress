 Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming  (Ms. Cheney) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the  gentlewoman from Wyoming for her support of our missile defense  programs. I agree with her support for these capabilities. I fully  commit to working with her during the conference process to ensure both  the missile defense tracking system and the laser scaling technologies  for boost-phase ICBM missile defense are funded in the conference  report.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I am not opposed  to the amendment.  [[Page H5790]]     Mr. Chairman, while I will not oppose the amendment, I  will urge caution about proposals that limit the department's  flexibility to adapt to changes in its need in the ROTC program.   I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the  gentleman's commitment to this matter. We respect the dedication and  accomplishments of all National Background Investigations Bureau  workers, including the hard work of the staff in Butler County,  Pennsylvania. There is currently a backlog of more than 700,000 pending  security clearance cases.   Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told my subcommittee that the Air  Force has 79,000 people still waiting for security clearances, and that  number has almost doubled in the last 18 months. We want to work with  your office to make sure we address that as much as possible, and I  look forward to your continuing partnership in this matter.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.              Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Frankel of Florida     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition, but I don't oppose the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, women have a larger presence in our  military today than ever before, with more than 200,000 women serving  in Active-Duty military. Women serve as leaders in all jobs and in all  branches of the military. Women have served in every conflict from the  American Revolution to the current war on terror.   From their early days as cooks and nurses to the combat roles they  fulfill today, the roles of women have evolved with the military. So I  am pleased to support this amendment, which will continue to further  the growth of our 21st century women warfighters.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Bishop) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this  critical weapons system, and I want to assure him that the committee  supports the continued production of Tomahawk missiles.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman is correct. The committee  increased funding for Tomahawk production 2 years in a row. Using this  funding for other purposes is contrary to congressional direction, and  this is the second year in a row that the Navy has blatantly  disregarded our instructions. The action by the Navy led the committee  to recommend a rescission of prior year funding for Tomahawks.   Despite this rescission, the committee remains supportive of  additional Tomahawk production and is  [[Page H5792]]  awaiting a revised plan from the Navy on how they will spend the  previously appropriated funding for missile production.   I assure the gentleman from Utah that the committee will revisit this  issue in conference, when the Navy indicates affirmatively they will  use additional funding solely for missile production.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Heck) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for raising the  issue of off-base infrastructure. I know the gentleman has been working  on this issue since his first days in Congress, and I commend his  dedication.   I appreciate that the authorizing committee has given us a tool to  begin to address this problem. Unfortunately, we don't yet know the  full scope of the challenge. Before we can appropriate funds to a  program like the Defense Community Infrastructure Program, we need more  information to define the priorities and ensure that the most urgent  needs are met.    Mr. Chair, yes, I can commit to working on this issue if  the gentleman can give me the details on the scope of what we need to  solve.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                     Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Rosen     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I  don't oppose the amendment.  [[Page H5793]]     Mr. Chair, the Department of Defense is responsible for  defending the homeland and U.S. interests from attack, including  attacks that may occur in cyberspace. This is an important mission and  one that this bill prioritizes by providing $8 billion across the  entire cybersecurity landscape.   Our Nation's cybersecurity posture starts with our cybersecurity  professionals. The gentlewoman's amendment provides an additional $5  million to ensure that we continue to have the most qualified and  highly trained cybersecurity professionals in the world.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to accept the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I don't  oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, as discussed yesterday on the Allen-Raskin  amendment, I support the work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Office.  They perform tireless work to track, locate, and recover our fallen  heroes, and I thank them for their continued efforts.   That is why the base bill already includes $10 million above the  budget request. I supported the Allen-Raskin amendment yesterday, which  provides an additional $10 million above the request. This amendment  provides $10 million, which will support continued efforts to return  our fallen heroes home where they belong.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the military and society at large must do  more to change the stigma of sexual assault so victims are not afraid  of retaliation when coming forward and reporting the crime.   This bill provides $318 million for sexual assault prevention and  response programs at the service level and at the Department of Defense  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. This is $35 million  above the President's request.   I understand this amendment funds a report required by the 2019  House-passed National Defense Authorization Act, to which we do not  object.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to reverse a justified  reduction made by the committee to the request for the AMRAAM missile  program.   Both the Navy and the Air Force, historically, overestimate the cost  of the missile in their budget request. In the last 5 years, this  overestimation has been 12 percent, on average. The fiscal year 2019  request assumes a unit cost that is 16 percent more than the most  recent contract.   For several years in a row, Congress has adjusted the budget request  for this program to account for these overestimates and other facts of  life, such as production delays. In fact, the delivery schedule for  this program has been revised 25 times since 2011, and the production  of new guidance system components is 21 months behind schedule.   The Department, itself, has frequently sought to take savings from  the AMRAAM program for other priorities. For example, the Air Force  has, 5 years straight on, sought approval to reprogram a total of $57  million of this program to other needs. This is in addition to the  reductions that have been taken by Congress. It, therefore, defies the  facts to claim that this program is being underfunded.   Because of the long time it takes the Department of Defense to put  together its budget request, these requests do not always reflect the  most current information. The committee takes commonsense reductions  when they will do no harm to national security.   I must add that this is precisely the sort of commonsense reduction  to the President's budget that enables us to accommodate the priorities  of Members of this body. This year we received approximately 6,600 such  requests.    The committee will continue to engage with the Navy and Air Force on  this program and make adjustments as needed. This amendment, however,  would restrict our ability to ensure that the priorities of this body  are reflected in the final bill.   Mr. Chair, I, therefore, oppose the amendment and urge its rejection,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5795]]         Mr. Chairman, in closing, as I have stated, these sorts  of commonsense adjustments to the President's budget request must be  made to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars and accommodate higher  priorities, including Member priorities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I  don't oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment provides a modest increase  in the training budget for the Special Operations Command. Like my  colleague, I want to make sure that our soldiers are able to deal with  any contingency that may confront them.   Our Special Forces deploy to some of the most austere and unique  environments in the world. We should do all that we can to ensure their  success.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his concern.  This amendment would increase funding in the defense health program  account, aiming to improve coordination between the Department of  Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as both agencies study  the effects of toxic exposure to burn pits.   It is important to both Departments to be aware of what the other has  done  [[Page H5797]]  in this important area of research, therefore, I am prepared to accept  the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his amendment. I  have no objections and am prepared to accept it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concerns. The  Department is currently funding several research projects related to  the potential health effects of open-air burn pits and burn pit  exposure, such as pulmonary fibrosis, lung and respiratory issues, and  metals toxicology.   I believe this research is important. I don't have any objection to  this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concern to  provide adequate funding for the Fisher House Foundation. The Fisher  House Foundation is a nonprofit organization that provides temporary  lodging for military family members when confronted with the illness or  hospitalization of their servicemember.   The bill already includes $5 million for the department to grant to  the Fisher House Foundation and allows each service to transfer up to  $11 million for Fisher House operations.   I am pleased to accept the amendment to provide additional funding  for the Fisher House, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this bill includes $130 million for the  peer-reviewed breast cancer research program. I believe this research  is very worthwhile. I do not have any objection to the gentlewoman's  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am a strong supporter of innovation and  bringing fresh ideas to the department. I support efforts that will  deliver promising new technologies and provide our troops with a  technological edge to prevail. However, I don't support efforts aimed  at building empires under the guise of innovation.    The amendment seeks to reverse a justified reduction made by the  committee to the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, DIUx. For fiscal  year 2019, DIUx proposed to double its budget compared to last year  without sufficient justification. This proposed increase was aimed at  doubling the size of the program office, along with significant  increases for office space and a generous travel budget.   I need to better understand how DIUx will fit into the department's  new research and engineering organization and how it will maximize  innovation for the warfighter before increasing funds for DIUx.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), my  ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I support efforts to bring  innovation and new capabilities to the warfighter. However, the DIUx  unit appears more focused on building its own program office rather  than delivering capability.   I do not believe additional funding for DIUx is justified at this  time. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, improvised explosive devices continue to be  used by terrorists against our forces, which is why the bill includes  $150 million for technologies to combat terrorism, including  investments to counter improvised explosives. The additional funds will  be helpful to develop technologies to help protect our troops.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's dedication to this issue,  and I also thank him for his previous service in the Army as an  explosive ordnance disposal technician.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I agree that cybersecurity is a very  important national security issue. The scholarship program will help in  attracting and retaining a cyber workforce. I appreciate the  gentleman's dedication the issue.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Diaz-Balart) having assumed the chair, Mr. Lewis of Minnesota, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the  fiscal year  [[Page H5803]]  ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, sexual assault remains a serious problem in  the military and one that we must continue to be addressing. The  Department has implemented a number of measures to prevent and reduce  sexual assault incidents, prosecute perpetrators, and better respond to  victims. Despite this, there is still more to be done.   This bill provides $318 million, which is $35 million above the  President's request for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response programs  at the service level and at the Department of Defense Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response program office.   I agree that this is a critical issue that requires attention at the  highest level. All of the military services must continue to address  incidents of sexual assault and make clear that the military has zero  tolerance for such behavior.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to accept the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I don't  oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment reaffirms  existing DOD policy and supports the House NDAA, which also includes  this provision.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I do not oppose  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment increases funding for the  National Guard's Counterdrug Program. We are very supportive of the  counterdrug program. The bill in front of us increases funding at the  same level that passed the House last year.   That being said, I understand this program is very important to many  Members, and I support this amendment to provide a modest increase.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment increases funding for the  Virginia-class submarine program by $1 billion, at the expense of other  critical Navy and Air Force programs.   The Department of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the  Air Force, and the National Coast Guard Association of the United  States all oppose this amendment.   In fact, the Deputy Secretary of Defense sent a letter detailing the  harmful effects this amendment has on multiple critical National  Defense Strategy programs. His quote: ``disrupt multiple critical  National Defense Strategy programs.''   These are must-have programs, like the DDG 51 guided-missile  destroyer, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, the Global Hawk, and the  TAO fleet oiler, just to name a few.   I have also received a letter from the National Guard Association  opposing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the letters I received from the  Deputy Secretary of Defense and the National Guard Association.                                    Deputy Secretary of Defense,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2018.      Hon. Kay Granger,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on           Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington. DC.        Dear Madam Chairwoman: The Department of Defense (DoD)       objects to the proposed amendment by Representatives Courtney       and Wittman that cuts over $1 billion from the Fiscal Year       (FY) 2019 President's Budget. The FY 2019 cuts disrupt       multiple critical National Defense Strategy (NDS) programs,       including the carrier program and Air Force research and       procurement. Combined with the out-year cost of finishing the       incrementally funded submarines. the Department would be       required to cut over $6 billion from multiple programs such       as reducing, the buys of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers,       oilers and fast frigates.        The FY 2019 President's Budget request supports a robust.       balanced shipbuilding program. providing $23.7 billion for       ten combat ships and eight support ships. including, two       Virginia-class submarines. DoD is committed to growing the       size of the Navy, investing over $20 billion per year across       the Future Years Defense Program. Consistent with the NDS.       Dolls request balances ship procurement with readiness and       other systems to be a more lethal joint force and meet future       capabilities.        The Virginia-class submarine provides crucial capabilities       to the joint warfight. The current Navy fleet faces known       shortfalls in attack submarine inventory in future years.       However, in the FY 2019 President's Budget we balanced the       investment in this capability against other critical       capabilities in areas such as space and cyber, and in       emerging areas such as autonomy and artificial intelligence.        The Department appreciates Congressional support for       growing the Navy's fleet and ensuring robust future       capabilities. Working together we will find solutions that       make us stronger and safer.      Patrick M. Shanahan.                                   ____           National Guard Association of the United States, Inc.,                                     Washington, DC, June 27, 2018.      Hon. Kay Granger,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on           Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairwoman: On behalf of the 45,000 members of       the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS),       I write today to express our opposition to the proposed       amendment by Representatives Courtney and Wittman which       provides funding for long lead time materials to construct       additional Virginia-class submarines in FY 2022 and FY 2023.        We share the concerns of the Department of Defense as       outlined in their June 26th letter of objection. Primarily,       our concern centers on the fact that while programmatic       adjustments are identified for the beginning of the program,       this change will create an unfunded liability across the       multi-year procurement cycle. As you know, the National Guard       is often supplemented with Congressional assistance from your       committee and I worry that creating such a large additional       requirement will unduly force cuts in other critical defense       funding over the next several years.        I thank you and your staff for your efforts in writing this       expansive and important piece of national security       legislation. Thank you, as always, for your continued support       of the men and women of the National Guard. My staff and I       stand by to assist in any way, and I look forward to       continuing our great work together.            Sincerely,                                                J. Roy Robinson,                                           Brigadier General (Ret.),                                                  President, NGAUS.     Mr. Chair, not only does this amendment cut $1 billion  from vital programs in FY19; it will leave future Congresses with at  least a $6 billion shortfall. That is not the appropriate way to spend  our taxpayers' dollars.   The Navy is not committed to funding these two additional submarines  in the future. In fact, the Statement of Administrative Policy on the  House-passed NDAA specifically objects to adding two additional  submarines above what is currently in the President's budget.   This amendment takes $346 million that has been set aside for the  reactor core for the last Nimitz-class carrier refueling overhaul.  Delaying this procurement for yet another year hurts  [[Page H5811]]  this program and creates serious production gaps. This will directly  impact the ability of the manufacturer to provide Columbia-class core  reactors in a timely manner, and it introduces risk to the schedule for  the Columbia-class submarine program. That is unacceptable.   The amendment takes $315 million from other shipbuilding programs,  funds that will have to be repaid in future years. It takes more than  $245 million from the DDG 51 guided-missile destroyer program, a  critical missile-defense-capable ship that is deployed throughout the  world.   This amendment is asking Congress to fund $1 billion now but create a  bill for the future, a bill that will not be paid due to the imminent  threat of the return of sequestration.   Some Members have asked if we can just fix this amendment in  conference. Let me be very clear on that point. The answer is no. We  will not be able to fix the damage this amendment causes in conference.  Should this amendment pass, all cuts will be included in the conference  report.   I received a letter today from Representative Courtney and  Representative Wittman asking me to reconsider my position on their  amendment. Their letter says that this amendment doesn't lock the  Congress or Department into any course of action. That is not true.   Who will pay for these subs, and where will they find the money?  Cutting $1 billion out of critically important programs so the Navy can  have options in future negotiations of additional submarines is also  irresponsible, especially when the Navy has neither requested nor  budgeted them.   Since when is it acceptable to give $1 billion to someone so they can  have options?   Their letter also claims they have not heard of any concerns about  the proposed first-year offsets. This is not true. In May of this year,  the Navy warned that any reductions to the DDG 51 destroyer program  will affect the ability of the Navy to achieve any--any--multiyear  procurement savings.   Mr. Chair, I will continue to oppose this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I urge the rejection of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Wittman) having assumed the chair, Mr. Johnson of Louisiana, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
