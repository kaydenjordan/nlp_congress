 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a solution to decongest  America's ports, revive America's supply chain, and get Americans back  to work.   In the past few months, we have learned the hard way that congested  ports create a real interstate commerce and supply chain problem.  Families are waiting 6 months for working refrigerators, farmers are  waiting 2 months or more for a simple part to fix their equipment, and  manufacturing companies are waiting 5 to 6 times longer for electronic  components.   Well, people are tired of watching their paid-for, necessary goods  sit on our ships off our coasts. The Biden administration is not doing  anything about it.   Today, I introduced the Truckers Responding at National Shipping  Ports Overcoming Retail Turmoil Act, requiring the Secretary of  Transportation to establish a grant program for motor carriers and  motor private carriers to relieve congested ports during a national  state of emergency or when ports are congested at 50 percent or more.   My bill would empower the Secretary of Transportation to issue  Federal grants from unused relief dollars to truckers or distributors  to transport goods from a port of entry to a destination point.  [[Page H6078]]    Additionally, my bill would temporarily waive State-operating  standards, should those standards be more stringent than the Federal  standard. For example, my bill would allow Kansas farmers and truckers  to operate their U.S. Department of Transportation compliant trucks in  California, a State that otherwise restricts trucks older than 2011  from entering the State, to help relieve the ports and transport goods  across this country.   Temporarily waiving State requirements is a small price to pay for a  strong supply chain, fully stocked shelves in grocery stores, and  employed transportation workers.   Congested ports have far-reaching implications beyond the States in  which they exist, and it is unconscionable to let the American people  suffer because of the unwillingness to solve a problem that impacts us  all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend the American public  from the worst sort of Federal Government overreach, that which  involves their private bank accounts.   President Biden's proposal to give the IRS unprecedented access to  Americans' bank accounts would pose hefty compliance burdens on  community banks and credit unions, hamper the ability for individuals  to access capital, and entrench the Federal Government even further  into our everyday lives, decaying freedom and eroding personal liberty.   This is wrong for America, and I stand and will continue to stand in  opposition to this indefensible and wasteful proposal to invade the  privacy of nearly every American.                          Recognizing Brycen Gulick     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank Brycen  Gulick for his service to me, my office, and Kansans throughout the Big  First District.   During his time in my office, Brycen has shown himself to be kind,  creative, and joyful. I most admire his loyalty, always yearning to be  a part of our team, and his adaptability and willingness to step  outside of his comfort zone.   God continually puts open and closed doors in front of all of us, and  the wise man asks God to speak and direct his steps as he walks through  life. I am proud to have had Brycen on my team, and I pray that the  Lord would help him blossom in his next adventure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Brycen for his service.                            ____________________
