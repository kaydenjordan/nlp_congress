 Madam President, 5 years ago this Saturday, my  hometown of Las Vegas endured one of the darkest days in its history.  On a beautiful autumn evening, the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was  interrupted when a gunman showered the concert with bullets from a  high-rise hotel room. Those who were at the festival, including my  niece, at first thought the gunshots were fireworks, but they soon  realized that something much more deadly was unfolding.   Fifty-eight people lost their lives that night, and two more have  died in the years since the attack. Over 850 people were wounded, and  tens of thousands who attended the concert or helped respond to the  shooting bear the visible and invisible scars of that night.   It is hard to overstate the scale of the devastation of that night,  and it remains the worst mass shooting in modern American history. As  soon as the gunfire broke out, first responders sprang into action, as  did ordinary citizens, turning concert barriers into stretchers and  trucks and cars into makeshift ambulances. Doctors and nurses rushed to  hospitals, and thousands of people lined up all over the State to  donate blood. Individuals and businesses contributed food, blankets,  airline tickets home, or whatever survivors might need.   At the worst of times, Nevadans came together to support one another,  and they have worked to help each other ever since. Local businesses  have supported the construction of a healing garden. The commission  working on a permanent memorial continues to make progress, and this  summer it invited the public to participate in its planning. And  scholarship funds and activity groups continue their work to support  the children of victims and survivors.   And this weekend in Las Vegas, thanks to the work of the Vegas Strong  Resiliency Center, bereaved families, survivors, first responders, and  community members will light lanterns together to honor the strength,  the light, and resilience of the Las Vegas community.   The fact is, though, that trauma leaves its marks. Many of those  touched by the Route 91 attack say that the shooting created a  permanent before and after for them. It fundamentally changed their  lives. And America has seen far too many of these mass attacks, from  Orlando to San Jose, Parkland to Buffalo. More recently, of course,  this summer saw the horrific shooting in Uvalde, TX, of 19 students and  2 teachers.   In the wake of Uvalde, Route 91 survivors Geena and Marisa Marano  came to see me. They are sisters whose experiences at the festival  inspired them to work for change. They told me that knowing how  difficult it had been for them as survivors of a mass attack, they  could not imagine what children who survived Uvalde were going through,  and so they were in Washington to call, once again, for change. This  time, they succeeded.   Over the summer, Congress passed and the President signed the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which contains a range of commonsense  provisions to reduce gun violence in America. I can't emphasize this  accomplishment enough. People thought that passing bipartisan gun  safety legislation was impossible, but because of the work and the  dedication and advocacy of so many, including Route 91 survivors like  Marisa and Geena, we got it done.   I am especially proud that I was able to help secure enhanced  background checks for those under 21 years of age as well as additional  mental health funding that is needed in our schools. Many survivors  will be the first to say the work isn't finished yet. That was a first  step; we still have more to do. And I agree with them. They are going  to continue to push for commonsense reforms, and I will support them as  I always have. Because these shootings are just devastating for whole  communities, we have to do something. I know for many in Las Vegas and  all over Nevada--this week especially--will bring difficult reminders  of that dark day 5 years ago, but it will also bring a renewed  determination to heal, to memorialize, to honor those who were  affected, and to work toward a safer future.   Madam President, I will continue to stand with my hometown and with  those survivors not only in Nevada but across the country and to do  everything that I can to work for the same goals that they care about.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to clarify a colloquy  between myself and Chairman Wyden placed in the Congressional Record on  August 6, 2022. The statement in the Record references geothermal  energy as applicable to the new ``section 48D'' of the Tax Code added  by section 13702 of the Inflation Reduction Act. The statement should  have referenced that section as ``section 48E.'' As explained in that  colloquy, geothermal will qualify for the production and investment tax  credits included in sections 13701 and 13702 of the Inflation Reduction  Act.                            ____________________
