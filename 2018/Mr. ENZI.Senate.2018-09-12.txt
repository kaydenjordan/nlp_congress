 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider the conference report to H.R. 5895, a  spending measure covering programs within the jurisdiction of the  Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Energy and Water, military  construction and Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. The  military construction portion of this legislation includes funding for  military construction designated as overseas contingency operations  funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. These  provisions provide $921 million in budget authority for fiscal year  2019. The inclusion of the overseas contingency operations designations  with these provisions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment  under the Congressional Budget Act.   On June 18, 2018, I filed an adjustment relating to S. Amdt. 2910 to  H.R. 5895, which contained appropriations for the same three  appropriations subcommittees. The military construction portion of the  amendment contained $921 million in revised security budget authority  designated as overseas contingency operations, and the budgetary  adjustment was made to accommodate this spending.   Since the level of overseas contingency operations spending in the  conference report is consistent with the previously filed levels and  appropriately designated, those funds are now available for use in this  conference report, and no further budgetary adjustment is warranted at  this time.                            ____________________
