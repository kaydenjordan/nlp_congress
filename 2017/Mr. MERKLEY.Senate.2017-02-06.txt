 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, this morning and throughout the night,  the Senate has been considering the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the  next Secretary of Education. My colleagues have come down here to the  floor, and I appreciate my colleague, who just completed his comments,  for his knowledge and his insights on public education and his passion  for a system of education that provides opportunity to every child in  America.   We are down here speaking through the night to raise the issue of why  the nominee for Secretary of Education is so completely inappropriate.  We see the passion that has arisen across America, ordinary citizens  calling us up on the phone, inundating our phones, thousands of phone  calls--I had more phone calls in a single day than I normally get in a  couple of weeks--inundating us with thousands of emails and letters.   Why is there so much public passion about this nomination? The short  answer is that public education is a cherished institution in the  United States of America. Public schools are a vital pathway through  which our children have the opportunity to gain the knowledge that  allows them to thrive in our society. We don't want to see that system  of public education, that gateway for a successful life, destroyed by  Betsy DeVos. That is why the American people are sending us so many  letters and emails and making so many phone calls--because Betsy DeVos  has no education experience, no public school experience.   Our students, teachers, communities, and our Nation deserve  leadership that does have public education experience, someone who does  have a passion for the success of every child, not someone who is  simply dedicated to trying to tear down public schools so she can run  private profit institutions and put money in the bank.   What do we really care about in the United States of America? Do we  care about the education of our children or about an entrepreneur  hijacking the public education system for personal profit? That is why  the citizens of this country are so outraged by this nomination and  outraged that Senators on this floor are planning to vote for her later  today.   I had the chance to go to school starting in first grade down in  Roseburg, OR. Roseburg is a timber town. My mother showed me the path  that was somewhere between a quarter of a mile and half a mile long. I  walked that path over to the first grade school. It had classrooms that  did not have hallways; they opened to the outside. The school ground  was a magical place for me to go in the first grade.   I still remember vividly Mrs. Matthews. Mrs. Matthews was a very  stern public school teacher. She had probably about 20 people in her  classroom, 20 little kids. She was determined that by the end of the  first grade, we would all read at the third grade level. That was her  mission in life. And we would do math at the third grade level. Thus,  every moment in that classroom we were working.   She was a senior teacher. I thought of her as quite old at the time.  I don't know if she was in her fifties or sixties. Suddenly that age  doesn't seem so old to me now. She was very experienced, and she had  her system of working with little kids. She would divide us into groups  of about four to five kids, and we would work in different clusters  around the schoolroom. She would travel from one cluster to another  keeping us on track, making sure we were progressing as we were reading  to each other, as we were doing our math problems. By the end of the  school year, everybody read at the third-grade level. We were afraid of  Mrs. Matthews because she was a very stern teacher, but we all thrived  in that classroom because we had a person dedicated to the success of  children.   One of the things that helped Mrs. Matthews was that there were 20  students in her classroom. When I went to my son's first grade  classroom, there were 34 kids in that classroom. I don't know that Mrs.  Matthews' strategy could have worked with 34 children. I don't know if  she could have taken 34 kids and gotten them to the third grade level  at the end of first grade.   It is unfortunate that we are not providing for our children the same  quality of education that our parents provided for us. Yet we are  living in a knowledge economy world where public education is much more  important today for success than it was a generation ago. So it is more  important, but we are funding it less. Certainly we have growing  national wealth. Why aren't we making the investment in our public  schools?   Along comes Betsy DeVos, who says: Here is an economic opportunity  for me to make even more money and convert these public schools to  private schools, private for-profit schools. That bothers me an  enormous amount because I want to see the resources not go into the  bank accounts of wealthy, ambitious entrepreneurs; I want to see those  resources go into our public classrooms, which, quite frankly, don't  have enough resources as it is.   For first grade, I went up to Portland. My family moved with the  timber economy. The mill shut down outside of Roseburg, OR. We had been  in Roseburg through first grade. By second grade, my father had taken a  job as a mechanic up in Portland. We moved to the public schools of  Portland and the following year bought a  [[Page S787]]  house outside of Portland and moved to the David Douglas High School  system, where I was from third grade through graduation. That grade  school and high school system provided the foundation on which I could  pursue virtually any path I put my mind to.   Isn't that the goal in America, that every child should have the  opportunity to pursue their dreams, not to have that opportunity cut  short by somebody who wants to drain the resources out of our public  education system?   When I was in grade school, my father said to me: Son, if you go  through the doors of that school and you work hard, you can do just  about anything here in America.   I thought that was pretty cool because I lived in a blue-collar  community. I knew there were fabulously more affluent communities in  different parts of Portland, and our community was not one of them. We  were a working-class community. The idea that if I went through those  doors and worked hard, I could pursue just about anything was a really  cool notion. It gave me a lot of pride in the United States of America,  and it gave me a lot of pride in my parents' generation that they were  providing public schools to enable every child to have this opportunity  to thrive.   That is what we want to have--not a system for the elite, not a  system in which the rich get their education over here and they are  therefore destined to seize the best jobs in society and generationally  build wealth upon wealth upon wealth while the rest of our Nation is  left out in the cold--no, a system where every child has the  opportunity to thrive. That is the great foundation for a nation that  says we are going to dedicate our resources so that all families are  lifted up. But that is not the vision of Betsy DeVos. That is why I am  on the floor today at 5 a.m. speaking about my concerns about her  nomination and what it represents for public schools.   We need, plain and simple, an Education Secretary who actually has  experience with public education. Betsy DeVos has none. She did not  attend public school. She did not send her children to a public school.  She did not volunteer in a public school. She did not get a degree and  teach in a public school. I don't know if she has ever set foot in a  public school.   The process--the journey of becoming a teacher--is one that requires  substantial education so you are prepared to convey and to find the  pathway with which children can learn, absorb knowledge, move forward,  and be inspired. But Betsy DeVos likes the idea of schools in which  there is no accountability for the preparation of the teachers.   Why undermine the success of our children for personal profit? For a  moment, think about the type of backgrounds previous Secretaries of  Education have had. They have been prepared to understand our school  systems and issues before, here in America.   John King was our 10th U.S. Secretary of Education from March of 2016  through January of 2017, just recently. He had a J.D. and a Doctor of  Education from Columbia University. He taught in the Massachusetts  school system. He had been Commissioner of Education in the State of  New York from June 2011 until January 2015. He had been the Deputy  Secretary of Education for a little more than a year. He had a lifetime  of study about our public education system, a lifetime of dedication to  that system, a lifetime of experience in that system brought to bear to  make that system work for our children.   How about Arne Duncan, who preceded him? He was the ninth U.S.  Secretary of Education, serving from the time President Obama came into  the office through December 2015. Arne Duncan graduated from college  with a bachelor's degree in sociology. He was deputy chief of staff to  the Chicago superintendent from 1999 through 2001. He was  superintendent of Chicago Public Schools for 8 years--or almost 8  years--from June 2001 to January 2009. He also brought to bear  substantial, extensive experience and an understanding of the issues  and how to address them in America.   Let's go back to a Republican administration and Margaret Spellings,  our eighth U.S. Secretary of Education, serving for 4 years, from  January 2005 through January 2009. She worked on the Education Reform  Commission under Texas Governor William Clements. She was executive  director for the Texas Association of School Boards.   We can keep going back and see the type of experience that has been  brought to bear on this important position. Rod Paige was a son of  public school educators. Rod Paige was our seventh U.S. Secretary of  Education. Rod Paige taught at Texas Southern University. He was Dean  of the College of Education of Texas Southern University. He was a  trustee of the board of education of the Houston Independent School  District. He was a superintendent of the Houston Independent School  District. In other words, as we work backward through his career, he  was involved in education in one role after another.   Betsy DeVos has none of that background. She has a background, and  she certainly has things she knows well and is very good at, but  education--public education--is not one of them. She was chairwoman of  the Windquest Group, a private technology and manufacturing investment  firm. She was a Republican National Committee member for Michigan from  1992 through 1997. She worked at that point to divert children from our  public education system and to divert resources from that system.   Michigan's charter school system, which she has backed, has most of  them run by private for-profit companies--80 percent, the largest  percentage of the country--companies driven by making a buck and  squeezing every dollar out of the system they can rather than squeezing  every ability into our children.   Public education being converted into a private profit company is the  experience that she brings. She likes the idea of those schools having  no accountability because if you have no accountability, you don't have  to spend as much money on the kids, and you make more money for  yourself.   That sort of self-serving, for-profit depletion of our public schools  should not be represented or advocated for by the Secretary of  Education.   She has other experience. That experience has to do with being very  involved in one party of the United States--the Republican Party-- serving as the Michigan Republican Party chairwoman from 1996 through  2000 and 2003 through 2005. Serving as a party chair is different than  gaining experience in public education.   She wanted to further press the case to convert public schools over  to for-profit, a strategy that she was benefiting from so much. She  worked on a 2000 ballot measure, and the people of Michigan rejected  it. She also put a lot of money into a PAC but, again, putting money  into an advocacy group--an advocacy group dedicated to depleting our  public schools--is not a foundation for running public schools. It is a  foundation for not running public schools.   During her confirmation hearing, it became so incredibly evident that  she knows nothing about public schools. It makes sense that she has no  background because she didn't attend public schools. It makes sense  that she didn't learn anything about public schools by teaching; she  didn't teach. Or volunteering in ones--she didn't volunteer. It makes  sense that she didn't learn about public schools from her children  going to public schools because they didn't go to public schools.   You might have thought for all her dedication to converting our  public schools over to for-profit schools, she might have learned  something along the way, but we found out during her confirmation  hearing that she knows literally nothing about public schools.   If she knew she was going to have a confirmation hearing, you would  think she would have prepared for this experience. One of the major  questions that we wrestled with in public schools is how to use  assessment tools and whether they should be used in the context of  measuring students' growth or students' proficiency and how that  reflects on the teacher.   When asked by Senator Franken about her views in this dialogue on  proficiency versus growth as a tool of measurement, Betsy DeVos said: I  think if I am understanding your question correctly about proficiency,  I would also correlate it to competency and mastery so that each  student is  [[Page S788]]  measured according to the advancement they are making in each subject  area.   Franken said: That is growth. That is not proficiency. I am talking  about the debate between proficiency and growth, and what are your  thoughts on that?   She was unable to respond to that question because she was unfamiliar  with the issue. That is a fundamental debate that is going on as we try  to make sure that we have accountability in our public schools. Perhaps  she was not familiar with the issue because she opposes accountability  in her for-profit operations, because the less you spend on a student,  the more you can put in the bank.   That is a very sad point of view--to put profit over people, and  those people are children. Another major issue in our school system is  how to address the education of students with disabilities. We have an  act called IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. She was  asked by Senator Kaine about IDEA and said that is a matter best left  to the States.   Her response worries educators and those with disabled family members  because before IDEA passed in 1975--so it has been with us for 42 years  now--only one in five students with disabilities received a public  education.   I will put it differently. Four out of five or 80 percent of students  with disabilities were left out in the cold. They didn't get the  benefit of a public education. Our goal from 1975 forward as a nation  has been to make sure students with disabilities also receive the best  education that their circumstances enable them to have.   Before 1975, many States had laws on the books that specifically  excluded disabled students. That began to change with a series of court  cases and the eventual passage of IDEA, a vision in which we said:  Let's embrace our students with disabilities and give them a pathway to  the maximum opportunity they might be able to have in life.   IDEA gives such students the right to a free and appropriate public  education. That is the wording of the law--free and public education,  and the right that this education should take place in ``the least  restrictive environment'' possible.   A right to free and appropriate public education and that it should  take place in the least restrictive environment has meant so much to  millions of our students who have some disability in life because we  haven't said to them we are setting you aside. We have said: We are  going to empower you to seize all the opportunities you can possibly  seize by making sure you have an education, an appropriate education in  the least restrictive environment.   When Betsy DeVos responded to the issue about IDEA and said it is a  matter best left to the States, people across the Nation envisioned how  States used to operate, which they basically said: Disabled child,  there is no pathway to a successful life.   That is not the way we should treat our children with disabilities.   To facilitate these rights, each student under IDEA receives an  individualized education program, referred to as an IEP, a legal  document that lays out how public education will be tailored to their  needs. Once a year, the family, the student, the school officials, and  experts gather around a table to update the IEP, the individualized  education program, for that particular student, based on that student's  abilities and disabilities.   The IEP lays out the accommodations the student may get in the  classroom and any related services the school will pay for, such as  occupational therapy or speech pathology and services. IEP can even be  used to pay for certain kinds of private school education in the event  a family requests it and the IEP determines that it is in the best  interests of the child.   Betsy DeVos would throw all this out the window and say: Let's not as  a nation guarantee an opportunity for these children. Let's not require  accountability for our States to provide an education to these  children. Let's not provide a pathway. Let's leave it to a State. Maybe  they will get an opportunity, maybe not, and that is OK with her.   It is not OK with me. It is not OK to the parents of the thousands of  children who wrestle with a disability in my home State of Oregon. It  is not OK to the parents across this Nation that their children be  tossed aside in the vision of Betsy DeVos.   Betsy DeVos had little constructive or helpful things to say on how  she would protect students in our schools and on college campuses if  she became Secretary of Education. Sexual assault on campuses is a very  significant issue. It is estimated that roughly one-fifth of women on  campuses are victimized by sexual assault, and many of them know the  offender; that of every 1,000 women attending a college or university,  there are 35 incidents of rape each academic year. Only a small portion  of those are reported to law enforcement.    So Senator Casey asked her if she will commit to maintaining  President Obama's attempts to curtail sexual assaults, and the answer  didn't leave confidence with the Senator or the committee that she  would be dedicated to that issue or understood that issue.   Senator Murphy asked Betsy DeVos whether guns have a place in and  around our schools, and again she seemed unfamiliar with the national  debate. She said: ``I think that is best left for locales and States to  decide.'' And referring to a school in Wyoming, she said: ``I think  probably there, I imagine you need a gun in school to protect against  grizzlies.''   Senator Murphy asked whether she would support President Trump's  proposal to ban gun-free school zones, and she responded that she  would.   There are many challenges in the details of this debate, but Betsy  DeVos didn't seem prepared to understand and be able to articulate  those issues.   It remains very clear for many of us all that has occurred in America  since 2013. There have been 210 school shootings. There were 64 school  shootings in 2015. In Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT--the Senator  from Connecticut was speaking during the previous hour--there was an  assault that killed 20 first grade children and killed 6 adults. And  this question of how to create a secure environment is one that any  nominee for public education should have a deep understanding of.   Betsy DeVos has a questionable history in terms of her interest and  concern about LGBTQ rights for students, so that is a concern as well.   She does have this history of this war against public schools in  Michigan, and if we had a department for a war against public schools,  maybe she would be the right person to lead it. It would be a mission I  would disagree with because I am here to tell you that this vision of  public schools--every child has the opportunity to thrive is a vision  we have embraced in America and should continue to embrace.   If we believe in the American dream, if we believe in opportunity for  all, then we should not have millionaire Senators voting to confirm a  billionaire Secretary who knows nothing about public education and the  struggle for education among working Americans and Americans with  modest means. That is the concern--Senators living in a bubble  confirming a Secretary who lives in an ultra-rich bubble and knows  nothing about our public schools.   We can take a look at some of the schools that Betsy DeVos has  promoted with her vision of no accountability. Seventy-nine percent of  Michigan charter schools are located in Detroit. Very few perform in  the top tier of schools.   There is a school in Brightmoor, a charter boasting more than a  decade of abysmal test scores--not good test scores, not outstanding  test scores, but terrible test scores.   That school is not alone. Another charter school, Hope Academy-- serving the community around Ground River for 20 years--test scores  have been among the lowest in the State throughout those two decades.  In 2013, the school ranked in the first percentile. That means out of  100 schools, it was the worst. But its charter was renewed under this  vision of no accountability.   How about Woodward Academy? It is a charter that has bumped along at  the bottom of school achievement since 1998, while its operator,  despite running an abysmal school, a terrible school, was allowed to  expand and run other schools.   How about the idea of outstanding schools, not terrible schools? How  about the idea of resources invested in the success of the school, not  an entrepreneurial for-profit strategy designed  [[Page S789]]  to squeeze as much money out of that school as you possibly can at the  expense of our children?   Stephen Henderson, an editor at the Detroit Free Press, summed up the  carnage in Michigan--Betsy DeVos's destructive results in Michigan--as  the following: ``Largely as a result of the DeVos lobbying, Michigan  tolerates more low-performing charter schools than just about any other  State, and it lacks any effective mechanism for shutting down or even  improving failing charters.'' That is a powerful statement, that  DeVos's assault on public schools--converting them to charters with no  mechanism for shutting down poorly run charter schools, no mechanism  for improving failing charter schools--Betsy DeVos's vision of zero  accountability--producing failing schools--is an assault on the  opportunity for the success of our children. And it should not be  entertained, and she should not be within a thousand miles of the  Department of Education.   A columnist, an editor with the Detroit Free Press, went on to  summarize that ``as a result of DeVos's interference and destruction of  the schools in Michigan, we are a laughingstock in national educational  circles, and a pariah among reputable charter school operators, who  have not opened schools in Detroit because of the wild West nature of  the educational landscape here.''   Often what we see with this strategy from the very rich who want to  masquerade as helping our children and challenging communities is what  they really want: They want the government to pay for their elite  education in private schools. Take the money out of the public system  and help the wealthy in America be even wealthier by subsidizing or  paying for their children to go to elite schools.   The strategies that Betsy DeVos implements results in this failing  system in Michigan that has become ``a laughingstock in national  educational circles, with no accountability for improving the schools,  and no accountability for shutting them down.''   If anyone was running a private business with no accountability, that  business would fail. But when it comes to squeezing money out of the  public system, there are opportunists who say: Here is something. Don't  care much about public education, but I sure see an opportunity. I  smell an opportunity for profit right here. I can squeeze that school,  and I can make a lot of money.   That person belongs nowhere near our public education system.   There are other things that concern folks. In 1983, Betsy DeVos's  family funded the creation of the Family Research Council. FRC is known  for its incendiary anti-LGBT agenda. It is known for its promotion of  junk science, claiming a connection between homosexuality and  pedophilia. The FRC thanks on its Web site the DeVos and Prince  families of Michigan for establishing its DC base. And FRC advocates  for conversion or reparative therapy.   Well, in all those ways, it sends a message that as the Secretary of  Education, Betsy DeVos is not going to watch out for LGBTQ students,  who have plenty of difficulty figuring out life and a pathway to life  in a world in which they don't necessarily find support in many places.  And their concern is amplified by her opposition to nondiscrimination  protections for the LGBTQ community. In fact she has donated hundreds  of thousands of dollars to defeat marriage equality--an opportunity for  opportunity in our Nation. Funding these anti-LGBTQ causes is plenty of  concern for students and their parents across America.   Well, why is she nominated to be Secretary of Education? I think an  objective observer would say that she has been a massive donor to the  party of the President, and that objective observer would be right.  Some $200 million was donated to the President's party.   When discussing her contributions in 1997, DeVos said the following:  ``I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are  buying influence. Now, I simply concede the point.'' She continued:  ``They are right. We do expect something in return.'' She concluded:  ``We expect a return on our investment.'' Well, she is seeking a return  on her investment by seeking the nomination and receiving the  nomination to Secretary of Education, but pay-to-play politics has no  place in our public schools. Let me repeat that once more. Pay-to-play  politics has no place in our public schools. Our children's education  is not for sale. That is why we are here tonight on the floor of the  Senate conveying our passionate dissent against this nomination.   The Secretaries in the Cabinet--their position--should not be sold to  the highest political bidder, and certainly one should have a small  modicum of experience to bring to the post, particularly when it comes  to the education of our children. Throw on top of that this pay-to-play  politics. Throw on top of that a determination to destroy our public  schools and to turn them into for-profit operations for the benefit of  the rich, to squeeze profits out of these schools that are investing in  our children, and this person is uniquely unqualified, the most  unqualified individual to be considered for a post of this nature  probably in the history of the United States of America.    I was home in Oregon last week. I attended a rally of folks who  wanted to share their thoughts about Betsy DeVos's confirmation. CREDO  helped organize the rally, an organization that fights for progressive  change, for opportunity for every child, opportunity for every family  to thrive.   In a short period of time, 1.4 million Americans had signed the CREDO  petition for her nomination to be blocked. Just yesterday, I was at a  rally outside the Russell Senate Office Building, just a few yards from  here, where hundreds of activists came out to rally against her  confirmation.   The phones in my office have been ringing off the hook for weeks,  with folks calling in opposed to this nomination. We have received  19,667 letters and emails from constituents--that is the last count-- who are writing in opposition to her nomination--opposition to  potential confirmation by the Senate.   These letters, these phone calls, they are coming from teachers and  administrators, they are coming from parents, they are coming from  concerned citizens who know what powerful role public education has  played in the opportunity for our children. Now, this vote today has  been laid out as something that virtually equally divides the Senate;  that there may be 50 votes for her nomination, maybe 50 votes against.   Half of the Senate saying no is a rather spectacular rejection of  this individual, but we need another Senator. We need a 51st Senator  who values our children over for-profit destruction of our public  schools. Is there not one more Senator who will stand up and fight for  our children here in the Senate?   We need a Secretary of Education who knows about education policy, a  Secretary who has experience as a teacher, who has experience as an  administrator, and who wants to fight for our schools to thrive, not  for our schools to be exploited, but we don't have that nominee today.  So that is when this body needs to stand up and say no to the  President; say, no, Mr. President. We know you were pushed to do this  because this individual donated massive amounts of money to your party,  but that is not a qualification for serving as Secretary of Education.   We need for the Senate to reject this and the principle it  represents, the principle that experience matters, that the heart for  our children matters, not how much money you pump into the President's  party. I think it might be helpful to look at some of the writings that  have been put forward. Let me read an op-ed from an Oregon paper, the  Register-Guard, our Eugene paper. This article is by Belicia  Castellano. She writes the following: After having donated $9.5 million  to Donald Trump's Presidential campaign, President-Elect Trump selected  Betsy DeVos as his Secretary of Education. This decision has been  widely viewed as controversial. With Trump's decision, it is apparent  that education policy will focus on the privatization of public  education. DeVos is not a suitable candidate for this position and much  more consideration should be taken into who has offered such a  significant role in our government and society. DeVos would not be  actively supporting our public schools, and would not commit to  advocating for only public schools. We need a Secretary of Education  advocate of all teachers, principals, staff, students, and families  within different  [[Page S790]]  types of schools. DeVos never worked in a public school and will  struggle to empathize with public school students and teachers. In  order to hold the position of Secretary of Education, an individual  should have a teaching license or have some experience working within  the field of education.   I guess that is kind of the point here, is someone should have some  experience working within the field of education. This Register-Guard  editorial said:         The morning after Election Day, a Register-Guard editor       asked University of Oregon President Michael Schill what he       knew about President-elect Donald Trump's views on higher       education. Schill's answer: hardly anything.    It goes on to say: DeVos is a long-time advocate of charter schools  and school vouchers, but the Chronicle of Higher Education and other  publications have turned up few grains of information after sifting  through her positions on issues affecting colleges and universities.  DeVos's home State of Michigan has more charter schools run by private  companies than any other State, she is expected to be friendly to for  profit colleges. Maybe, maybe not--who knows.   So the point is that the Secretary of Education should also have  experience related to higher education. Let me speak a little bit to  that. Our public K-12 system, which has now become sometimes a  preschool through community college system, or a K-20 system, has  expanded vision.   We have started to understand that just as we said at some point that  the equivalent of a high school education is essential for a pathway  for opportunity in our country, so now is the ability for many visions  of what you will do with your life, to attend school after high school;  that is, higher education. Now there are many pathways to success  through apprenticeship programs and other routes that we should  publicize and honor, many trades that need more people in them, very  successful pathways to stable family finances, a foundation for raising  your children.   But much of our economy does require the experience of gaining a  higher education through our community and 4-year universities. The  cost of this pathway has exploded. There was a chart a couple of years  ago in the New York Times that showed the cost of different products  over a 10-year period. Over that period, the product that had increased  the most in price was the cost of a university. University education  tuition, that was the very top curve. The bottom curve--the things that  had decreased the most in price--was large flat-screen TVs. Now, you  don't need a large flat-screen TV to thrive in life, but for many  opportunities in our economy, you do need a 4-year education at a  university. So the thing we need, our students need, for many pathways  had increased the most in price. That cost effectively creates a  massive barrier. If you are a millionaire or you live in a bubble  community, a gated community, you don't really see this because parents  just write a check.   But in my community, in a blue-collar community, people worry about  this all the time. Parents worry about whether they can save a little  money to help their child go to college. Then they look at that savings  in the context of the cost of college and realize it is not enough and  that their children will have to take on a lot of debt to be able to  attend even a public 4-year school.   So back a couple of years ago, I held a whole series of meetings with  students on different campuses in Oregon. The students brought balloons  that said on the balloon what their debt was or their anticipated debt  would be at the time of their graduation from college. Some of them  said, $22,000, some said $14,000, but a lot of those balloons said  $55,000 or $85,000. Some students had gone from undergraduate to  graduate school, and their numbers started to get to three figures:  $112,000.   It is in light of that debt in the higher education system that  parents start to wonder whether college makes sense because with that  kind of debt, that is half the price of a home in my community. You can  buy a two- or three-bedroom house for $250,000 in my community,  although the price has been going up.   So you are saddling a child with a debt the size of a home mortgage  or at least a good portion of a home mortgage. The fear is, what  happens if you graduate with that debt and you actually can't get a job  to pay off that debt. That concern has many folks saying to their  children in middle school and in high school that they are not sure  their child should follow that pathway.   When a child hears from their parents that they are not sure that  pathway makes sense, that affects and reverberates back to the way they  treat junior high and the way they treat high school because they see  it as a pathway that has been paved for them by society so they can  thrive. And if they will be able to afford public education on through  college, that is more inspiring and more powerful and can persuade a  person to work hard in junior high and high school than the message  that, no, it is so expensive we don't think that you are going to be  successful going that route and it is going to be a trap. That message  hurts our public schools. But Betsy DeVos has none of this  understanding, how the high cost of college then reverberates back into  junior high and high school.   How about the issue of STEM education--science, technology,  education, mathematics--and the role that plays in our schools. You  know, I feel particularly lucky in life. I am the first in my family to  have gone to college. My mother and father came from very, very modest  backgrounds. Yet thanks to the economy after World War II, they were  able to buy a home on my father's blue-collar income. They were able to  provide a foundation for the family to thrive.   My father told my sister and me: We didn't go to college, but we hope  you will. We are saving some money to help that be possible. Even  though I had no understanding of what college was all about, the  message from my parents, that they were encouraging my sister and me to  aspire to that pathway and that they were going to help us, just sent a  message: It is a feasible pathway.   So I always assumed, not knowing the details of what college cost or  what scholarships might be available, I just always assumed it would be  possible to go. We need a system of higher education in which people  can afford to go to college without massive debt. What is important to  understand is this affects not only the opportunity after high school,  it affects how children feel about schools when they are in school.   We see this, for example, in the DREAMS Program, where children are  sponsored from grade school, and they are told: Listen, you have been  the beneficiary of an individual who is going to pay your college  expenses and for a program for you to get extra mentoring during your  K-12 years of school. Those children thrive at a whole different level  in public schools than the children in an adjacent classroom who don't  have that sponsor and don't have that vision laid out for them that  there is an affordable college awaiting them.   So that is an issue we need to have an advocate for, as Secretary of  Education, as well as an advocate for our K-12 system, and we don't  have that in Betsy DeVos. She doesn't bring her personal experience in  life to bear with that.   I am going to wrap up my part of this conversation by noting that  this is a potential turning point in our history. If we hand over the  reins of our education system to a person who wants to see it as one  more corporation, one more opportunity for profit, we will destroy a  system that is the foundation of the American dream, the foundation of  the vision for every child to thrive. We are a society to make sure  that the pathway of opportunity is there for each and every child,  including children who are English language learners, including  children who have disabilities, including children who come from blue  collar communities, as I do. Every child. That is the vision we are  fighting for that is about to be deeply damaged.   Should the reins of public education be handed over to an individual  who wants to destroy it?   That is why I am encouraging our colleagues to search their hearts,  step aside from party politics and pay-to-play politics, and fight for  the children of the United States of America.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S791]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield  for a question?    I appreciate your point and the belief that the son or  daughter of a millwright, a mill worker as I was, should have the same  opportunity as the son or daughter of a CEO in a big company. That is  embedded in the notion of quality public schools.   What I was really struck by was that DeVos wants to divert all these  public funds from our schools to for-profit schools, and if it is for- profit, you squeeze down the services in the school to maximize the  profit, and that is just exactly the type of attack on our children  that we can't tolerate, but I was also struck about how she imposes the  accountability for these alternative schools. The columnist Stephen  Henderson of the Detroit Free Press said:         Largely as a result of DeVos's lobby, Michigan tolerates       more low-performing charter schools than just about any other       State. It lacks any effective mechanism for shutting down or       even improving failing charters.    He goes on to say:         We are a laughingstock in national education circles and a       pariah among reputable charter school operators who have not       opened schools in Detroit because of the wild west nature of       the educational landscape here.    Do you share the concern about the complete lack of accountability of  these for-profit schools that are pulling the funds out of our public  schools in Michigan?    I thank the Senator from Washington for her answer. So  often I have heard speeches about accountability from across the aisle.  This is a case where accountability matters a tremendous amount because  it determines whether our children have a fair shot at driving America.  So I thank the Senator from Washington for elucidating us in regard to  that issue.    A parliamentary inquiry.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. State your question.    A parliamentary inquiry.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. State your question.    If a Member of the Senate is being considered for  nomination, and we are exercising our advice and consent power, and if  there is factual conduct in that individual's background that is  presented on the floor that is uncomplimentary, would presenting the  facts of that conduct in the process of debating an individual be  considered in violation of rule XIX?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rule makes no distinction between those  Senators who are nominees and those who are not. The rule does not  permit truth to be a defense of the slight.    Mr. President, just to make sure I understand that  clearly, if we are considering a nominee who happens to be a Senator  and we state factual elements of their background, for example, the  conviction of a crime that is inappropriate conduct in the past,  stating the factual record about an individual would be considered in  violation of rule XIX?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each of these cases will be decided by the  Presiding Officer in the context at that time.    Just to clarify, if I could, therefore, the point is  that something could be absolutely true, as, perhaps, a point that was  made earlier--a statement can be true in a letter that is presented-- but even if it is true and accurate for a person under consideration  for a nomination, it would still be in violation. In other words, the  fact that an individual is found in violation of rule XIX doesn't mean  that the statement had to be false. It could have been a true  statement?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. You are correct, Senator.    Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.    Parliamentary inquiry.   Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I will be speaking later tonight, perhaps  about 2 o'clock, possibly on through 4 o'clock, but I wanted to take a  few moments now and share some of the letter that was discussed earlier  and share it in a fashion that is appropriate under our rules. I would  like to thank very much my colleague from New Jersey for yielding a few  minutes in order to do so.   I think it is important for us to understand the context of what this  letter was all about. This letter was a statement of Coretta Scott  King, and it was dated Thursday, March 13, 1986. She noted: ``My  longstanding commitment which I shared with my husband Martin''--of  course that is Martin Luther King--``to protect and enhance the rights  of black Americans, rights which include equal access to the Democratic  process, tells me to testify today.'' Then in her letter she goes on to  essentially present an essay about the essential role of voting rights  in our country, and so I will continue to read in that regard. She  says:         The Voting Rights Act was and still is vitally important to       the future of democracy in the United States. I was       privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to       Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was       particularly impressed by the determination to get the       franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As       he wrote--    Now she is quoting Martin Luther King--         ``Certainly no community in the history of the negro       struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and her       neighboring  [[Page S865]]       town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended largely upon       students and unemployed adults to participate in nonviolent       protests of the denial of the franchise, Selma has involved       fully 10 percent of the negro population in active       demonstrations and at least half the negro population of       Marion was arrested on 1 day.''    That was the end of the quote from her husband. She continued  writing:         Martin was referring, of course, to a group that included       the defendants recently prosecuted for assisting elderly and       illiterate blacks to exercise that franchise.   Each time she refers to franchise, she is referring to this  fundamental right to vote under our Constitution.   And she continued:         In fact, Martin anticipated from the depth of their       commitment 20 years ago, that a united political organization       would remain in Perry County long after the other marchers       had left. This organization, the Perry County Civic League,       started by Mr. Turner, Mr. Hogue, and others, as Martin       predicted, continued ``to direct the drive for votes and       other rights.''    That is a quote from her husband. And then she continued. In this  letter, she says:         In the years since the Voting Rights Act was passed, Black       Americans in Marion, Selma, and elsewhere have made important       strides in their struggle to participate actively in the       electoral process. The number of Blacks registered to vote in       key Southern states has doubled [she said] since 1965. This       would not have been possible without the Voting Rights Act.    She continues in her essay. She says:         However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the       vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to       vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the       enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those       rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal       bench.    She continues in her letter to note:         Twenty years ago, when we marched from Selma to Montgomery,       the fear of voting was real, as the broken bones and bloody       heads in Selma and Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote       at the time, ``it was not just a sick imagination that       conjured up the vision of a public official sworn to uphold       the law, who forced an inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro       children; who ordered the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to       his sickbed; who clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who       callously inflicted repeated brutalities and indignities upon       nonviolent Negroes peacefully petitioning for their       constitutional right to vote.    This is what Martin Luther King is referring to was the specific  actions of sheriffs in the South who were representing the law. And  then Coretta Scott King continued:         Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently.        Over the past century, a broad array of schemes have been       used in attempts to block the Black vote. The range of       techniques developed with the purpose of repressing black       voting rights run the gamut from the straightforward       application of brutality against black citizens who tried to       vote, to such legalized frauds as ``grandfather clause''       exclusions and rigged literacy tests.    Now she proceeds to note that other techniques were used to  intimidate Black voters and that included investigations into the  absentee voting process, and this concerned her a great deal. And she  notes that Whites have been using the absentee process to their  advantage for years without incident. Then, when Blacks, realizing its  strength, began to use it with success, criminal investigations were  begun.   Then she proceeds to address that there were occasions where  individuals with legal authority chose to initiate cases specifically  against African Americans while ignoring allegations of similar  behavior by Whites, ``choosing instead to chill the exercise of the  franchise by Blacks by his misguided investigation.''   Let me continue later in the letter. She addresses her concern over  the prosecution illegally withholding from the defense critical  statements made by witnesses and that witnesses who did testify were  pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct'' testimony.  That is incorrect testimony.         Many elderly Blacks were visited multiple times by the FBI       who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand jury in       Mobile when they could have more easily testified at a grand       jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and others,       have announced they are now never going to vote again.    She obviously is addressing issue after issue that affected the Black  franchise, the franchise of African Americans, the ability to vote, and  then she returns to her essay about how important this is.         The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by       which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will       be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil       right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately       results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is       only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they       are able to participate actively in the solutions to their       own problems.    Coretta Scott King continues:         We still have a long way to go before we can say that       minorities no longer need to be concerned about       discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native       Americans and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented at       every level of government in America. If we are going to make       our timeless dream of justice through democracy a reality, we       must take every possible step to ensure that the spirit and       intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth       Amendment of the Constitution is honored.        The federal courts hold a unique position in our       constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other       citizens without political power have a forum in which to       vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is       essential that the people selected to be federal judges       respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for       individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.        The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they       protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident       that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge       with fairness others holding differing views.    And she concludes her letter having examined a number of incidents in  the historical record with this conclusion:         I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite       judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights       guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for       appointment to the federal district court.    And that is the context of her letter; that voting rights matter a  tremendous amount. I applaud the efforts of my colleague from  Massachusetts to make this point and share this essay with the body of  the Senate earlier this evening.    I yield.    I yield.    I yield.    I yield.    Well, the answer is that it does have a date, and that  is Thursday, March 13, 1986.    I am.    I am.    I am.    I am.    I am.    I am.    I am.    That occasion was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee regarding the potential appointment of the individual to the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.    I do not know if it was made a matter of record.   My impression initially was that she had read this letter at the  hearing, but I am not sure if it was presented in person or as a  document submitted to the committee.    I believe that is probably correct.    I believe that is probably correct.    I believe that is probably correct.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I am rising to speak this morning about  the nomination of our colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama, to  become the 84th Attorney General of the United States. As the highest  law enforcement officer in the land, it is the responsibility of the  Attorney General to ensure that all Americans receive the equal justice  under the law they are entitled to as American citizens.   A commitment to that equal justice has rarely been more necessary  than it is today. We need an Attorney General wholly committed to  serving the people of the Nation, and we need an Attorney General who  fights to expand American's civil rights, not to restrict them, hobble  them, or eliminate them, or to eliminate the Justice Department's  Office of Civil Rights.   We need an Attorney General who will stand up to the President when  he tries to put an illegal and unconstitutional policy in place. So it  has been part of our journey, the story of America, that we have  strived to form a more perfect union. We have worked over time--like  Martin Luther King said, the long arc of history bends toward justice.   But we have worked to bend toward justice. Our vision of opportunity  was incomplete at the founding of our Nation. It was not extended to  all genders and all ethnicities and all races. We have worked hard to  change that, but here we are at this point in time, still not at the  end of that journey.   Part of the question is, How does any given individual fit into the  position of Attorney General in that fight for that more perfect vision  of our Nation?   So I thought I would share a little bit about that. Hillary Shelton,  the Director of NAACP's Washington office, told the New Republic that  Senator Sessions has ``consistently opposed the bread and butter civil  rights agenda.'' When the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of  2013 with Shelby v. Holder, Senator Sessions celebrated the decision  saying: If you go to Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, people are not  denied a vote because of the color of their skin.   Well, indeed, part of this--the point is, when the Voting Rights Act  was in place, it prevented many activities that would have otherwise  denied the vote. We have seen the resurgence of all kinds of measures  since the Voting Rights Act was modified by the Supreme Court, which it  eliminated key provisions.   We have seen the ``almost surgical precision'' of North Carolina's  voter ID law that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down  because they were created specifically to reduce the vote of African  Americans. We are living in times that it just feels like our Nation is  a bit under siege.   During the campaign of last year, we had so many divisive attacks as  part of the Presidential primaries. Even during the general election,  very divisive rhetoric passed from the man who would then become our  President, President Trump--attacks on women, attacks on minorities,  attacks on African Americans, attacks on Hispanics, attacks on people  with disabilities.   Yet, against that, we have a vision of a system of law that treats  everyone equally, impartially. We learned when we were children that  Lady Liberty wears a blindfold with the scales of justice in her hand.  We need an Attorney General who has at their core that vision of  impartial justice, justice for every American, justice regardless of  skin color, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of geography. That is  essential, and we need it now particularly in a powerful way to help  address the divisive rhetoric of the last year, which has left many  people doubting that their government is willing to fight for them,  that they will receive this form of impartial justice.   We have seen what has happened with the strong work of the Justice  Department's Civil Rights Division under President Obama. For more than  half a century, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division fought  for and enforced laws that uphold the basic rights of all Americans,  steadily expanding opportunities.   The work of that division was stifled, restricted in many ways during  George W. Bush's administration. But under President Obama, the Civil  Rights Division has worked hard to apply, in a powerful way, civil  rights for all Americans. In just the last few weeks of the Obama  administration, they won the first hate crime case involving a  transgender victim, they sued two cities that were blocking mosques  from opening, they settled lending discrimination charges with two  banks and sued a third, they filed legal briefs on behalf of New York  teenagers held in solitary confinement, and they accused a business in  Louisiana of moving mental patients into nursing homes. They were  actively, aggressively fighting for the rights of all Americans.   Many wonder now, under the new administration, whether we will have a  powerful Civil Rights Division fighting for those whom others would  choose to exploit. Senator Sessions has downplayed the need for the  Justice Department to prosecute crimes against women and members of the  LGBTQ community, saying: I am not sure women or people with different  sexual orientations face discrimination. I just don't see it, he said.   Well, if you talk to LGBTQ Americans, they will tell you their  stories of harassment and discrimination. So it is very hard not to be  aware of the extraordinary amount of discrimination they experience,  unless you are determined not to see it. To those who say we don't see  discrimination, if you ask, you will hear the stories of  discrimination. You will hear the stories of profiling, individual  young African-American men picked out time and time again to be stopped  and questioned at a rate that someone of a different skin color would  not experience, but you do not see it unless you open your eyes to see  it. At his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions said: These lawsuits  undermine respect for police officers. He was referring to the  investigation of two dozen police agencies, knowing that the Civil  Rights Division reached consent decrees with 14 of them.   He said: These lawsuits undermine the respect of police officers and  create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work  consistent with fidelity to law and fairness. Well, let me explain that  the reason the departments were investigated is because there were a  lot of reports that in fact they were not doing their work consistent  with fidelity to the law. It was not an impression; it was a report  about failure to do that.   Don't we want an Attorney General who rather than relegating the  complaint to, well, don't pursue them because it creates an impression  they are  [[Page S887]]  not doing work, instead says: These are complaints we must investigate  and remedy that situation. That is the responsibility of the Civil  Rights Division, to investigate and to remedy, and that is what this  division did under President Obama. They didn't turn a blind eye. They  didn't say that would be embarrassing to the Department, but my  colleague had a different take, saying: We need to be careful before we  do that because it might create an impression that they are not doing  their work well. Just think if we take that attitude.    We anticipate to have hearings for a labor commissioner. The nominee  for Labor runs a company that has a tremendous number of Hardee's and  Carl's Jr. outlets, and those outlets have a horrendous record of labor  rights abuses, but we wouldn't know about those abuses if the  investigator said: We won't investigate because it might create an  impression that they are doing something wrong.   So I am very concerned about the attitude that you don't investigate  because you might embarrass someone.   When there are reports of injustice, that is the point, that it gets  investigated. And it not only gets investigated in order that the  problems will get remedied but also so it will send a message to others  to operate within the bounds of the law.   Our next Attorney General needs to make civil rights a priority,  fighting for them, ensuring them, securing them as the North Star of  the Justice Department--not something that can simply be left to the  States, not something that can be ignored, not something that will be  allowed to slip backward.   Communities of color aren't the only ones watching Senator Sessions'  confirmation process with some anxiety. Over the last 8 years, the  rights of the LGBTQ community have leapt forward in incredible ways,  from the greater acceptance of gay and lesbian Americans and  transgender Americans. And certainly we cannot forget the historic  milestone of the legalization of same-sex marriage a year and a half  ago. But so many of these long-fought-for and hard-won rights are so  new that the community is terrified that President Trump's  administration will work to restrict those rights or roll those rights  back. But it is the duty of the Attorney General to protect those  rights, to fight for those rights.   So it is of some concern--for me, it is a substantial concern--that  the nominee voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate  Crimes Prevention Act. This act was passed on October 22, 2009, and  signed by President Obama 6 days later. It was part of the National  Defense Authorization Act of 2010, and it expands the 1969 U.S. Federal  hate crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or  perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.   The bill removes the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a  federally protected activity, like voting or going to schools. It is  much, much broader. It gives Federal authorities a greater ability to  engage in hate crimes investigations that local authorities choose not  to pursue.   It provided funding for fiscal years 2010 to 2012 to help State and  local agencies pay for investigations and prosecuting hate crimes.   It requires the FBI--the Federal Bureau of Investigation--to track  statistics of hate crimes based on gender and gender identity. Hate  crimes for other groups were already being tracked.   It was named after Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. In 1998,  Matthew Shepard, a student, was tied to a fence, tortured, and left to  die in Laramie, WY, because of his sexuality. In that same year, James  Byrd, an African-American man, was tied to a truck by two White  supremacists. He was dragged behind it and was decapitated in Jasper,  TX. At the time, Wyoming hate crime laws did not recognize homosexuals  as a subset class, and Texas had no hate crimes laws at all.   Supporters of an expansion in hate crimes laws argue that hate crimes  are worse than regular crimes without a prejudice motivation from a  psychological perspective. The time it takes to mentally recover from a  hate crime is almost twice as long as it is for a regular crime. And  LGBTQ people feel as if they are being punished for their sexuality,  which leads to a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and post- traumatic stress disorder.   In short, in multiple ways, in ways I have enumerated, this law more  aggressively pursued justice. I was pleased to be here as a first-year  Senator to be able to support that law. Hate crimes tear at our  collective spirit. They are based on divisions in our society,  divisions that some choose to amplify and inflame, divisions that  victimize people for being who they are as individuals.   I was proud of this Chamber, of this Senate, that we passed a bill  that would give State and local law enforcement the necessary tools to  prevent and prosecute these types of crimes and move our Nation down a  path toward equality--equality under the law and freedom from  persecution. But my colleague, the nominee, voted against this pursuit  of greater justice for a persecuted group within our society, and that  certainly bothers me substantially. It is my understanding that he  didn't feel that people actually faced discrimination, but the fact is,  they do.   LGBTQ individuals, especially transgender women of color, are more  likely than any other group to be targets of discrimination and hate  crimes. Across the category, and more so in some, look at the 49 people  killed, the 53 more injured at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last  summer. The attacker purposely targeted a gay nightclub for his attack.  LGBTQ people are twice as likely as African Americans to be targets of  hate crimes. Nearly one-fifth of the 5,462 so-called single-bias hate  crimes reported to the FBI in 2014 were because of the person's  sexuality or perceived orientation.   Another issue was raised in 2010 when the proposal was put forward to  repeal a discriminatory law in the military, the don't ask, don't tell  law, which barred openly gay and lesbian individuals from serving in  our armed services. My colleague, our nominee, said that gay  servicemembers would have a corrosive effect on morale, essentially  saying discrimination is justified because of the prejudices of others  who serve. But it is not justified, and the prejudices have taken a bit  of movement along that journey toward justice.   More than 14,500 people were discharged from the military during the  18 years of don't ask, don't tell. An estimated 66,000 lesbian, gay,  and bisexual servicemembers were in the military at the time the ban  was lifted. But here is what happened after that 2010 change--a change  that our nominee opposed. The military family embraced the LGBTQ  community, and instead of having a corrosive effect, repealing don't  ask, don't tell has strengthened the military family. In fact, in 2016,  just last year, the first openly gay Army Secretary was confirmed, Eric  Fanning. Last year, the Navy named a ship after Harvey Milk, the gay  politician and former member of the Navy who was assassinated in 1978.   So a robust pursuit of equality would have been to voice principled  opposition to this discrimination in armed services that was actually  robbing our armed services of a tremendous amount of talent and  experience and was damaging the lives of those who were expelled from  the military. That would have been a principled pursuit of justice, but  that is not the path my colleague, our nominee, chose to travel.  Instead, it was a path of justifying discrimination, justifying  injustice.   During the confirmation hearing, my colleague, our nominee, softened  his stance on LGBTQ issues, and he said he would uphold the statute  protecting LGBT people's safety and ensure that the community's civil  rights are enforced. Well, I wish we had more statutes that protected  LGBT people's safety. Promising to uphold them when they largely don't  exist is somewhat of an empty promise. It sounds good, but it lacks  punch.   We had a debate in this Chamber about the Employment Non- Discrimination Act. This act was specifically about anti-discrimination  in the process of job hiring in America, and I was deeply involved in  this effort.   Back in Oregon, when I became speaker, I worked to end discrimination  for our LGBT community--discrimination in hiring, discrimination in  public accommodations, discrimination on a whole spectrum of aspects of  our society. And we passed a very strong law in the State of Oregon to  end that discrimination, and a piece of  [[Page S888]]  it--a big piece of it--was to end employment discrimination. How can we  claim, as a nation, that we are the land of opportunity if we slam shut  the door to opportunity on a large number of our fellow Americans by  allowing discrimination in employment?   Well, because of that work I did in Oregon--when I came here to the  Senate, Senator Kennedy was ill. Senator Kennedy would champion this  legislation. Senator Kennedy, who had been here--he had been on the  floor, I believe it was 1998 or 1996. And that bill had only failed by  one vote back before the turn of the century. It was a 50-to-49 vote.  The individual who was not here probably have voted for it. The Vice  President breaking a tie probably would have passed it. It would have  been adopted. It would have been signed.   Fast-forward to 2013, and here we were on the floor debating this  issue, and I was very pleased to see it on the floor because Senator  Kennedy and his team had asked me to carry the torch on the bill and  work to see it passed. I had worked for us to hold hearings, and I had  advocated with our leadership that it was time to put this issue on the  floor, that we couldn't allow this discrimination to continue without  at least working to address it. We might fail on the floor to pass this  bill, but we should at least put it before the body, make the case,  have the argument, fight to end this discrimination.   Here on the floor, we no longer have to get 50 votes and the  President because the habits of the Senate changed, and now it is  almost always required to get a supermajority to close debate. So we  had to get 60 votes, not 51, but we did get 60 votes. We did close  debate and go to a final vote. But one of the individuals who placed  himself directly in the path to obstruct success on the bill, to  obstruct the end of discrimination--job discrimination for LGBTQ  communities--was our colleague and our nominee for Attorney General. I  would hope to have a voice in the office that was seasoned through  tough battles and stood up in difficult times to fight any  discrimination, not to perpetuate discrimination. So that concerns me-- substantially concerns me.    In 2013, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women  Act, often referred to as VAWA, after Congress passed it. That was an  important effort because a woman should never be a victim of violence  in her own home. Nobody should be a victim of violence, but  particularly to address the challenges that we see. And the National  Center for Injury Prevention and Control notes that women in the United  States experience roughly 4.8 million assaults and rapes per year from  their intimate partner, and they are afraid to seek medical treatment.  Less than 20 percent of battered women sought medical treatment.   The National Crime Victimization Survey--the statistics that I have  here from 2006, so quite a while ago--says that over the course of the  year, 33,000 women were sexually assaulted, more than 600 women every  day. Women ages 20 to 24 are at greatest risk of nonfatal domestic  violence, and women age 20 and higher suffer from the highest rates of  rape.   The Justice Department estimates that one in five women will  experience rape or attempted rape during her college years--just during  those college years--and that less than 5 percent of these rapes will  be reported.   Income is a factor. The poorer the household, the higher the rate of  domestic violence. Women in the lowest income category experience more  than six times the rate of intimate partner violence as compared to  women in the highest income category. African-American women face the  highest rates of violence. American-Indian women are victimized at a  rate double that of women of other races.   The impact of these kinds of violence is huge and long-lasting.  According to the Family and Violence Prevention Fund, growing up in a  violent home may be terrifying, a traumatic experience that can effect  every aspect of a child's life, growth, and development. Children who  have been exposed to family violence suffer symptoms of post-traumatic  stress disorder, such as bed-wetting and nightmares, and were at  greater risk than their peers of having allergies, asthma,  gastrointestinal problems, headaches, and flu. In addition, women who  experience physical abuse as children are at greater risk of  victimization as adults.   Well, I go through all these statistics to note what a substantial  issue this is in terms of crime and violence and the impact both on the  victims and on the children in homes--an impact that damages children's  ability to pursue a full, healthy path toward thriving as an adult, an  impact that creates a cycle of violence.   In 2011, during one 24-hour period, 1,600 Oregon victims were served  by domestic violence services. What are those services? Emergency  shelter, children's support, transitional housing, support for teen  victims of dating violence, therapy or counseling for children,  advocacy related to cyber stalking. Additionally, during the same 24- hour period, Oregon domestic violence programs answered more than 27  hotline calls every hour.   VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, has been a powerful tool in  fighting these kinds of abuse, these kinds of violence in our  community, and it has proven to dramatically reduce domestic violence.  Among other things, in 2013 the VAWA reauthorization included measures  to ensure that LGBTQ men and women cannot be turned away from domestic  violence shelters. It addressed threats of violence against women in  transgender communities, who face rates of domestic violence and sexual  assault at much higher rates, as I noted before, than those faced by  the general population. It provides tools and encourages best  practices, which have proven to be effective to prevent domestic  violence homicides by training law enforcement, victims service  providers, and court personnel to identify and connect high-risk  victims with crisis intervention services--all of this in the interest  of preventing violence against women, and when such violence occurs, to  get the treatment to be as robust and available as possible to assist  those women.   I would hope to have the champion in this fight to decrease violence  against women in the position of Attorney General of the United States  of America, but my colleague, our nominee for Attorney General, voted  against these practices for decreasing violence, voted against these  efforts to provide greater support when the violence did occur, and  that, for me, is a very substantial concern. This turned many women's  advocacy groups into a position of opposing this confirmation.   And another factor came into play. In October of this last year when  our nominee for Attorney General was asked his opinion about a 2005  audio recording which then-Candidate Trump was--well, he wasn't yet a  candidate at the time of the audio recording--but he was heard bragging  about inappropriately groping women. The nominee said he didn't think  the behavior that was described was sexual assault. Senator Sessions  said: ``I don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that is a  stretch,'' he said.   I couldn't more profoundly disagree. When someone grabs the intimate  parts of an individual, that is an assault. How can one reach any other  conclusion? Envision that your loved one is the one who is groped--your  wife, your sister, your mother, or your daughter. You don't believe  that is a sexual assault? I would like to have as our Attorney General  an individual who would understand in the core of his or her being that  this is an assault and wrong. The law makes it an assault. Morality  makes it an assault. So that bothers me a great deal.   I do want to note that in a confirmation hearing, my colleague  Senator Sessions changed his opinion on this and he noted what we would  expect one to note. He said that yes, activity such as was noted on the  recording of our now President, when asked whether it was an assault,  he said clearly it would be. I appreciate that evolution, but the  initial reaction before the confirmation hearing still disturbs me.   Earlier this month, the National Task Force to End Sexual Violence  issued an open letter opposing his confirmation based on the record. In  the letter, they stated, when referring to the nominee, that ``his  history leads us to question whether he will vigorously seek to ensure  all victims and survivors of gender-based violence, particularly  vulnerable populations and those at the margins of society, have access  to vitally needed services and legal protections.''  [[Page S889]]    This goal to champion justice for all--perhaps it is easy to champion  justice for the groups one most closely identifies with, but the role  is to fight for justice for everyone throughout our society, and that  is why this is of substantial concern.   The letter went on to say: ``Selective application of the law and  outward hostility towards victims of sexual and domestic violence in  historically marginalized populations has a chilling effect on their  willingness and ability to seek services and protection. It then noted  that the Attorney General of the United States must be an individual  committed to protecting the inalienable rights of equal protection  under the law to all--to all within the jurisdiction of the United  States.   Let me say it again. We need an Attorney General who fights for equal  justice for all.   Another issue we face--set of issues, really--is related to  immigration. As we know, President Trump recently signed an Executive  order barring travel by those from seven Muslim countries and also  barring refugees into our country and having a longer ban on refugees  specifically from Syria. And the first ban, the Muslim ban, came out as  Rudy Giuliani told us of instructions to create a Muslim ban that would  be changed enough to make it legal under the law.   There are many reasons to be concerned about this ban based on  religion. We have a tradition of freedom of religion in our country. It  is a freedom enshrined in our Constitution. We have a tradition of  religious tolerance. If we are a nation with religious freedom,  religious tolerance goes hand in hand with that, but we have heard over  the course of President Trump's campaign statement after statement that  essentially presented a war on Islam, the Nation is at war with Islam-- the opposite of religious freedom, the opposite of religious tolerance.   The worst aspect of this--and there are many bad aspects to it--is  that it endangers our national security because of the recruiting  strategy of ISIS. Our President says he wants to diminish and  extinguish. Their recruiting strategy is to claim that the United  States is conducting a war on Islam, so this ban and this campaign feed  right into that recruiting strategy. It has been pointed out by  security expert after security expert after security expert that this  makes us less safe.   Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General, refused to defend this  order in court because she believed it was illegal and  unconstitutional. That is a principled stance, that despite that the  head of the executive branch put something forward, the Attorney  General said: No, that is wrong. That is not constitutional.    Well, she was fired shortly thereafter, for taking that stand, by  President Trump. But then, two attorneys general from Washington State  and Minnesota took the case to court, pointing out that they had  substantial harm in their States as a result of this, giving them  standing to challenge it--harmed because of professors trapped  overseas, harmed from students trapped overseas, harmed from citizens  in the States of Washington and Minnesota whose family members were  trapped overseas. They put it to a district court judge, James Robart,  a judge who was appointed by George W. Bush. The judge put a  restraining order on the Executive order. To do that, one has to reach  the standard that the case has merit and is likely to prevail.   So a judge, given this issue, the design of this issue, and the facts  surrounding these orders, struck them down. And then it went to the  Ninth Circuit Court, and the Ninth Circuit didn't find that there was  enough information to change the decision of the district judge, but  they asked for additional briefs, and they are expected to rule later  this week. We will find out of course then how they weigh the issues.   Part of what is being taken into account are the facts on the ground,  including was this designed around national security, and part of that  debate recognizes that individuals from those seven countries have not  come to America and killed Americans.   Now, individuals from other countries have come to America and killed  Americans, but not from those seven countries. Then there is the  question of whether it was based on religion, and they will be taking  into account and looking at the fact that Rudy Giuliani said he was  instructed to develop a Muslim ban but to make it look legal. So,  clearly, there is evidence that the real intent of this wasn't national  security but was religious discrimination.   Then there is the fact that the Executive order itself has a clause  that says we will discriminate based on religion, letting in Christians  while closing out Muslims. They will consider all of that. We will see  what they say.   There is considerable power in the executive branch and the  Presidency for making rules related to immigration. There is  considerable power to take actions related to national security, but  the design of this suggests serious constitutional problems, and two  very capable lawyers--one, the acting AG for the United States of  America and, second, a district court judge--have found it fails the  test.   I would like for us to have a nominee for Attorney General who would  have the courage and convictions to stand up to a President when the  President goes off track in violating the Constitution, and I am  concerned that our nominee wouldn't reach the same courageous point of  view that Sally Yates found or James Robart found. Even while noting  that the courts are yet to ultimately decide, there are certainly heavy  concerns that should be weighed intensely in this consideration, and I  am not sure that would happen.   In 2015, Senator Sessions, my colleague, our nominee, authored a bill  that would automatically cut off Federal funding to sanctuary cities  that refused to have their police officers act as agents of our  immigration force, as ICE agents. Just today, I had the sheriff of  Multnomah County in Oregon come and speak to me. He was formerly the  police chief of our largest city--the city of Portland. What he  conveyed was that if you have police officers pursue each person they  interact with on the basis of immigration, pretty soon people in the  community will not work with you to solve crimes, and you actually  create enormous public safety risks for the citizens in Multnomah  County. Numerous mayors have pointed this out; that if you see your  police force as one that is continuously trying to be an immigration  agent rather than a police officer and you are pursuing folks with  profiling--stopping everyone in the Hispanic community--that pretty  soon the Hispanic community folks don't want to talk to you. They will  not help you solve the crimes that occur. The community becomes less  safe.   So this assault on public safety is a profound concern across this  country.   I am disturbed that our nominee authored a bill to penalize cities  and States that are seeking to reduce public violence and enhance  public safety. That seems the opposite of what an Attorney General  should do.   During his nomination hearing, Senator Sessions advocated for ending  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA. This is a  program on which one needs to understand it by meeting individuals who  are childhood arrivals. There are folks who have crossed the border  into our country who have brought with them a baby in their arms, or a  toddler, or a 4-year-old. Those individuals--those children, those  babies--grow up in America. They speak English. They only know America.  Most of the time--I will not say most of the time, but in many cases  they don't know they were even born outside the country.   So these children were put into a position of saying: If you disclose  your status and fill out all this paperwork, we will not send you back  to a country you don't even know, that speaks a language you don't even  know because you have grown up in America and you are going to  contribute to America, if we embrace you. And you will just be a lost  citizen--a citizen without a country--if you are sent out of the  country to somewhere that would be totally unfamiliar to you.   In this position that our nominee took, that he thinks we should end  this program, it means that those children would now be eligible for  deportation. There is a substantial concern here because they were  promised that their information would not be used, would not be turned  over for their deportation when they signed up. They trusted that when  the United States of America  [[Page S890]]  made this promise to them, that promise would be kept, but it appears  we have a nominee who wants to end that program and, therefore, place  all of these children at risk of deportation.   The nominee had no answer for what to do with the 800,000 children  who have come out of the shadows because of that program.   In December 2015, Senator Sessions voted against Senator Leahy's  sense-of-the-Senate resolution that affirmed that the United States  must not bar people from another country because of their religion. Our  nominee spoke for 30 minutes against the resolution. This takes me back  to the echoes of this issue of the Muslim ban and discrimination based  on religion that is so alien to the United States of America.   This resolution that affirmed that the United States would not bar  people from our Nation because of their religion had the support of 96  Senators. Four Senators voted against the resolution, essentially  saying it is OK to discriminate based on religion. Our nominee was one  of those four Senators who conveyed through their vote that it would be  OK to use a religious test for those entering the United States.   According to Bloomberg News, our nominee was one of the few lawmakers  to defend President Trump's effort to propose a complete shutdown of  Muslims entering the United States, in this report of November 18,  2016. He told CNN's Dana Bash last June: Well, all I can tell you is,  the public data we have had indicated that there are quite a number of  countries that have sent a large number of people here who have become  terrorists.   During his nomination hearing, our nominee tried to walk back his  support for the Muslim ban. He said he would not back a complete and  total shutdown of all Muslims entering the United States. So he evolved  from a position he took in December of 2015 and was more moderate  during the nomination hearing. But still I am concerned about the  position he put forward at that debate in December of 2015, when he  spoke for 30 minutes and was one of four Senators to refuse to support  a resolution saying that the United States should not discriminate  based on religion.   This Muslim ban and the vote on the December 2015 resolution leaves  Muslim Americans wondering if our nominee would fully defend and  advocate for them; whether our nominee, the President's nominee for  Attorney General, would fight for equal justice for Muslims after  supporting the position that it is OK to discriminate against Muslims  entering our country. That concerns me because that is not the position  I would like to see represented in the President's nominee for this  office.   My office has been receiving an enormous number of phone calls,  emails, and letters about a whole host of nominees, and I think it is  appropriate to share some of those as well as to note that a group of  1,424 law school professors nationwide sent a letter to Congress urging  us to vote no on this nomination, representing 180 law schools in 49  States.   I am not going to share all of the letter because I want to stay  within the bounds of the debate. So I will just note this: They lay out  a whole number of concerns about positions taken in the past.   I will summarize it with a final paragraph: As law faculty who work  every day to better the understanding of the law and to teach it to our  students, we are convinced that the President's nominee will not fairly  enforce our Nation's laws and promote justice and equality in the  United States.   That is 1,424 law school professors from 180 law schools looking at  the record of the President's nominee.   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights gives our  nominee a zero-percent score. The Human Rights Campaign, which fights  for justice for the LGBT community, gives the President's nominee a  zero-percent score. The NAACP has repeatedly given grades of F to the  nominee. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the ACLU have  voiced vigorous opposition.   I will share some of the letter from back home. Cobin from Portland,  an assistant professor, writes: I am writing today to state my strong  dissent for the nominee to be U.S. Attorney General. While this should  be self-evident given his record, in light of this past week's events,  it is all the more critical we have an Attorney General willing to  fight for our Constitution. Protecting our fundamental values as  Americans is priceless.   From Southern Oregon, Karen of Jackson County writes: I am strongly  opposed to the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. His  support of President Trump's views regarding immigration and voting  rights are unacceptable and make him unacceptable to be the Nation's  chief law enforcer.   Letter after letter expresses concerns about the record.   Earlier tonight, my colleague from Massachusetts was sharing  testimony Coretta Scott King presented on March 13, 1986, to the Senate  Judiciary Committee when my colleague was nominated to the U.S.  District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The Senate at that  point in time rejected the nomination. They did so after examining a  whole series of events which had transpired under his leadership. I  can't read those events under the rules of the Senate because they  would constitute a critique of a fellow Senator. So I am just  summarizing that her letter laid them out, and the Senate Judiciary  Committee fully explored the issues presented by Coretta Scott King,  and by many others, and decided there wasn't the judicial vision  appropriate for someone to serve as a judge in the United States of  America.   If that series of events led to the unusual outcome of the Senate  deciding that an individual's background--a background related to  efforts to prevent African Americans from voting, weighed it  incorrectly, not right that an individual be serving as a judge, that  same background should be weighed by all of us here this morning, in  this debate, over whether a nominee has the judicial heart of Lady  Liberty to judge everyone without discrimination, to fight equally for  everyone without discrimination. The answer years ago by this Chamber  was no.   After I have weighed the many positions presented tonight which are  deeply troubling, and the history that led this Chamber to make the  decision it did back in 1986, I will have to join those who say and  vote no on this nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
