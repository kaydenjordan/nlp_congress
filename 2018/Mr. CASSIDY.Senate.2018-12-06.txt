 Mr. President, I rise today to speak to my friend, Dr.  Tommy Middleton, the executive director of the Baptist Association of  Greater Baton Rouge, who just opened us in prayer.   Dr. Middleton oversees 100 churches and missions, which include  services in 6 languages--Chinese, Burmese, Vietnamese, Filipino,  Korean, and Spanish. I should say seven--also English. The ministries  include the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary Extension in Baton  Rouge; student work at the Baptist Collegiate Ministries of Louisiana  State University and Southern University; camp ministries at the Judson  Baptist Retreat Center; prison ministries in four State prisons and six  local parish jails; governmental interface on the local, State, and  Federal levels; ministry to the seamen through the Seafarers  Ministries; church planting regionally; and international missions in  16 different countries in which he has been personally involved. I will  add one more: bringing relief to victims of natural disasters across  our country.   Overall, Dr. Middleton has spread the good news of the Gospel for  nearly 50 years. It was my honor to invite Dr. Middleton to open the  U.S. Senate in prayer this morning. We have all been blessed.   I yield back.                            ____________________
