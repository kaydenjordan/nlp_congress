 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Iam Tongi, a  proud son of Kahuku, on winning season 21 of ``American Idol.'' A  fellow child of the Windward side, a ``keiki,'' ``child'' of  Ko'olauloa, Iam is the first Hawaii-born and Pacific Islander  contestant to ever win ``American Idol.''   Throughout his ``American Idol'' journey, Iam captured the hearts of  viewers across the country with his incredible voice and soulful  tributes to his late father, Rodney.   While on the show, Iam not only showcased Hawaii's local music and  [[Page H2512]]  sound, but also the challenges with getting priced out of paradise.  Like many ``kama aina,'' ``residents,'' Iam and his family were forced  to move to the Mainland because of Hawaii's high cost of living.   I have shared this with many of my colleagues here: Our children like  Iam have become our greatest exports. That is not ``pono''; that is not  ``right.'' We must make Hawaii more affordable so that families like  Iam's don't have to leave their home.    Iam's music, his story, and his spirit have inspired millions of  Americans across this country. Hawaii is so proud of him. Wherever he  goes, I hope he knows Hawaii will always be his home and his ``ohana''  ``family.''                            ____________________
