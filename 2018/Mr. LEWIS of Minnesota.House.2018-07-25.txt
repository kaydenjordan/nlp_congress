 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for his  leadership on this legislation, as well as Chairman Foxx, Ranking  Member Scott, and my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce  Committee.   This great bipartisan effort could not come at a more critical time.  As our economy continues to boom, employers across the Nation are  struggling to find the skilled workers needed to fill well-paying jobs  and grow their businesses. The legislation here strengthens the Perkins  Act to ensure students gain the necessary skills to compete in the  modern economy.   I am particularly pleased that the final legislation includes my  provisions to encourage and expand dual enrollment opportunities,  putting more students on the fast track to a great career.  [[Page H7192]]    Minnesota's Second District is home to some great technical colleges,  and dual enrollment allows high school students to access these  programs and to begin working toward an in-demand credential or degree.   I am proud to support this bill to close the skills gap and help our  students succeed.
