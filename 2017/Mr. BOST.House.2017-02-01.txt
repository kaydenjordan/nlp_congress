 Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration anticoal regulation  was a solution in search of a problem. It wasn't intended to protect  the environment. It was intended to put coal miners out of work. And,  sadly, it has been successful in achieving that goal.   A study of the rule estimates it would destroy more than one-third of  our coal jobs, and that nearly half of all coal resources would  effectively be off limits to mining. In addition, the OSM rule has  ignored clear congressional directives to share information with the  States.   If ever there has been a time for Congress to act, this is it. I urge  my colleagues to support this resolution.  [[Page H844]]
