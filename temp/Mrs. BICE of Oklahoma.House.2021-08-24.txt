 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  American helping our Afghan allies.   The situation unfolding in Afghanistan is dire, but in the midst of  crisis, there is always light to be found. In Oklahoma's Fifth  Congressional District, that light is Allyson Reneau.   She took matters into her own hands to help 10 members of an Afghan  girls robotics team escape. She has nine daughters of her own and met  the girls at a 2019 robotics competition. As the Taliban took over the  country, she could not stop thinking about their safety.   Reneau reached out to a friend who worked in the U.S. Embassy in  Qatar. They completed the necessary paperwork, the Government of Qatar  sent a plane, and the girls were flown to safety.   It is women like Allyson Reneau who remind us that there is always a  light in the dark, even if it shines from one lone candle.                            ____________________
