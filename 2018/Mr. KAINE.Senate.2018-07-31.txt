 Mr. President. As the skills students need to be  successful in the 21st century evolve, so too must the type of  instruction they receive. Educators must provide educational  opportunities that teach to the challenging State academic standards  that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student population. At  the start of every school year we see the same news headlines about  exploding class sizes and districts facing unfillable openings. Teacher  and principal shortages plague the whole country, and are worst in our  rural communities, but it's a problem we can solve.   In 2015-16, more than half of U.S. States reported shortages of  educators in mathematics, science, career and technical education and  for English learners. Further, 48 States identified special education  as a shortage area in their reports to the U.S. Department of Education  and half of all schools and 90% of high-poverty schools are struggling  to find qualified special education teachers. If current trends  continue, we would see as few as 200,000 available teacher hires each  year by 2025, resulting in a gap of more than 100,000 teachers  annually.   Additionally, in public schools today, the majority of the student  population is comprised of students of color; however, teachers of  color only comprised 20% of the teacher workforce in 2015-16. African  American teachers made up more than 8% of teachers in 1987, but only  made up 6.7% in 2015. It is critical for our teaching workforce to grow  more reflective of the population of students it serves.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Preparing and  Retaining Education Professionals Act, or PREP Act. The PREP Act aims  to increase access to high-quality teacher and leader preparation,  diversify the teacher workforce, and address the significant national  teacher and school shortages. More specifically, this legislation would  expand the definition of ``high need'' districts under the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to include those experiencing teacher  shortages in rural communities and in areas such as special education,  English language, science, technology, engineering, math, and CTE, to  allow for access to additional support and improvement. It would also  encourage school districts to create partnerships with local community  colleges and universities to ensure their programs are educating future  teachers in areas where there is a shortage of educators. It would  increase access to teacher and school leader residency programs and  preparation training and require States to identify areas of teacher or  leader shortages by subject across public schools and use that data to  target their efforts. Additionally, the PREP Act increases support for  teacher preparation programs at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) or  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to support a  diverse and well-prepared educator workforce.   The improvement of our country's educational system lies in our  ability to prepare, support, and retain quality educators. When  teachers and school leaders are equipped with the knowledge and tools  they need to succeed, they are more likely to stay in their roles and  positively impact young people and their communities. As we move  towards the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I hope that my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle see the PREP Act as a commonsense  opportunity to help ensure that students in every zip code across the  country have access to t well-prepared teachers and school leaders they  deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
