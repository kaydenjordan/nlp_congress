 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 876) to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to carry out a plan for the purchase and installation  of an earthquake early warning system for the Cascadia Subduction Zone,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 876         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 876, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this overdue action by the  Federal Government, the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act  of 2019, as amended.   Next month will mark the eighth anniversary of the devastating 2011  earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku, Japan. Japanese officials estimate  the event caused 100,000 buildings to totally collapse, 270,000  buildings to half collapse, and partially damaged almost 750,000  buildings.   Fifteen thousand people died. Most of the deaths were caused by the  resulting  [[Page H1370]]  tsunami and not the earthquake because Japan has an early warning  system for earthquakes, and it worked. It sent alarms and text messages  warning citizens to take cover and likely prevented many deaths and  injuries.   Within 15 seconds to 1 minute of warning, depending on location, the  earthquake warning system alerted Japan's high-speed rail system to  stop trains, reducing deaths and injuries; production lines had time to  cease operations; and property damage economic losses were way less  than would have been otherwise.   I went with then-Chairman Denham over to observe their system and  discuss what they are doing now. Now what they are doing is they  realize that most of the people died because they did not have ocean  sensors, and they underestimated the height of the tsunami. They told  people to take shelter in places 10 to 12 feet above wave level. The  waves were much bigger and, subsequently, many of those people died.   So they are not waiting. The technology currently exists for a  realtime warning system that will give them even more notice of an  earthquake and will give them more accurate wave heights on the  resulting tsunami so people can take proper shelter.   We have the same opportunity to do that here in the United States if  we take action soon.   The Cascadia subduction zone sits off the coast of Oregon and  northern California--right at that border, essentially--and experts  believe it has generated at least a dozen major earthquakes between  magnitudes 8 and 9, which is an awesome earthquake, and resulting  tsunamis over the last 5,000 years.   This January was the 319th anniversary of the last large quake, and  many scientists say that we are overdue and it could happen at any  time. It will be essentially a mirror image of the subduction zone off  the coast of Japan that caused the devastating 2011 earthquake and  tsunami.   The technology is here. The question is whether we want to invest in  an offshore earthquake early warning system now or wait until thousands  of people have died and catastrophic property damage occurs. We need to  invest now rather than later.   This bill will begin to address the very real threat of a combined  earthquake and tsunami off the Pacific Northwest coast before it  happens. Some forecasts say there is a 10 percent chance of a magnitude  8 to 9 in the next 30 years; others predict a 35 to 40 percent chance  in the next 50 years.   This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop  a plan to identify funds to purchase equipment necessary for an  earthquake early warning system and to report to Congress on the  implementation of the plan.   It also requires the President to establish an earthquake and tsunami  task force. The task force will consist of representatives from  potentially impacted areas as well as earthquake and tsunami experts to  develop a comprehensive strategy and recommendations on how the Nation  should prepare for, plan for, mitigate against, respond to, recover  from, and adapt to an earthquake, tsunami, or combined event of a large  magnitude in the Cascadia subduction zone.   We need to take this threat seriously and prepare accordingly. Madam  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his  support of the bill, and I will look to support him on issues that deal  with the Great Lakes in the future or other concerns that he may have.   This is just something that, as a nation, as we see threats to our  citizens around the country, we should be pushing for preparedness and  for resilience. This bill, if we move forward with the plan and put out  the instrumentation, will save lives and will be a tremendous benefit  to the Nation as a whole.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JOHNSON-of Texas. Madam Speaker, I support passage of H.R. 876,  the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2019, as amended.  I commend my friend from Oregon, Chairman DeFazio, for addressing the  urgent need to develop better earthquake and tsunami warning systems in  the region of our country most vulnerable to such natural disasters. In  fact, my own committee, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee,  has had for many years a leading role in strengthening earthquake and  tsunami preparedness and response in order to minimize the loss of life  and property.   In December 2018, we enacted a reauthorization of the National  Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which was first  authorized in 1977 but had not been updated since 2004. In the 15 years  since, our scientific understanding of earthquakes as well as how we  apply that science to save lives and property have evolved  significantly. In the reauthorization, we updated the program to  reflect those developments.   Four agencies participate in NEHRP. The National Science Foundation  and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) carry out fundamental research in the  earth sciences that contributes to our understanding of earthquakes. In  addition, USGS develops and manages ShakeAlert--the earthquake early  warning system. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is  the lead agency for NEHRP and also carries out applied research in  support of more earthquake resilient building codes. FEMA provides  earthquake training and awareness to States and territories and assists  communities in creating seismic mitigation plans. Each of these  agencies has a unique and essential role as clearly defined in the  NEHRP statute. I want to thank my colleague Chairman DeFazio for  working with me to ensure that H.R. 876 does not unintentionally create  any confusion or uncertainty as to the respective roles and  responsibilities of each of these agencies.   Our committee also has a lead role in tsunami warning and  preparedness. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) has run a tsunami early warning system for many years. In 2006,  the Science Committee passed the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. We  updated that program just last Congress through H.R. 353, thanks to the  leadership of another colleague from Oregon and a valued Member of the  Science Committee, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici.   We all share he same goal of taking advantage of the strengths and  resources of our federal agencies to minimize the tragic loss of life  and the economic impact of large scale natural disasters. If H.R. 876  becomes law, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure  good coordination and collaboration between the new activities required  in H.R. 876 and the ongoing activities under the NEHRP and Tsunami  warning programs. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 876.
