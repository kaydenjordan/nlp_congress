 Madam Speaker, the USO is on Capitol  Hill today for a service project where volunteers can assemble care  packages for servicemembers who are currently deployed.   More than 2,000 care packages will be assembled today as part of the  Force Behind the Forces campaign.   The USO strengthens America's military servicemembers by keeping them  connected to family, home, and country throughout their service to the  Nation.   The USO has more than 200 locations around the globe. It serves 4.9  million Active-Duty Guard, Reserve, and members of their families.   For more than 75 years, the USO has been by the side of America's  military servicemembers. From the moment they join, through their  assignments and deployments, and as they transition back to their  communities, the USO has been there.   The USO has delivered more than 2.6 million care packages since the  Care Package Program was established in 2003. In 2018, the USO  delivered 120,000 care packages to servicemembers across the globe.   Madam Speaker, I thank the USO for its dedication to our  servicemembers and their families. As a military family, as an  individual who has visited theaters of war, I see what a difference  this makes, and I thank them for their service.
