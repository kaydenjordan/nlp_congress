 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Police  Week and thank our men and women in law enforcement.   Every day, law enforcement officers put on their uniform and go to  work to protect and serve the citizens. However, their service does not  come without danger. Just this year, 123 officers have been shot in the  line of duty, which is 46 more officers than were shot this time in  2020.   Supporting our police and assuring public safety for our citizens  should not be a red or a blue issue but a red, white, and blue issue.   This morning, I joined Leader McCarthy and Republican Members on a  Back the Blue bike tour alongside about 40 Capitol Police officers  after which we honored our Nation's fallen police officers.   One officer along the way did express to me that he was honored to  serve; however, it was difficult as he was pointed at by some and  called terrible names while in uniform. He stated he could take it, but  he lacked a confident tone.   As the son of a former police officer, Madam Speaker, I know the  tremendous stresses on our officers and their loved ones. We all must  back the blue.                            ____________________
