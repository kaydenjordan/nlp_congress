 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Subcommittee on Oversight  chairman, Mr. Lewis, and the ranking member, Mr. Kelly, for getting  this bill to the floor today. This legislation is the product of years  of work, and I am glad to see these commonsense provisions get one step  closer to the finish line.   Congress hasn't tackled real IRS reform in decades. With a  bipartisan, bicameral effort, our goal is to modernize the IRS and  improve the taxpayer experience. With sensible reforms, the Taxpayer  First Act redesigns the IRS with that mission at the forefront--putting  the taxpayer first.   I would also like to highlight that this bill includes a provision to  codify the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, or VITA, matching grant  program and make it permanent. My colleague, Dr. Davis from Illinois,  and I have introduced legislation to make VITA permanent, and I am  pleased to see the provisions included in the bill before us today.   VITA centers provide free tax help by many volunteers to low-income  individuals, persons with disabilities, and limited English-speaking  taxpayers who need assistance with their taxes. These centers, and the  many volunteers who operate them, assist thousands of our constituents  every year. By making this program permanent, we will provide VITA  organizations, volunteers, and the taxpayers they serve with certainty.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see this provision included and this bill  on the  [[Page H3165]]  floor today, and I urge its swift passage.
