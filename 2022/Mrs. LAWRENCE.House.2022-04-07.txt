 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  3807.   Last month I held a roundtable in my district of small businesses,  and their message was loud and clear: the restaurant industry is in a  crisis. Small businesses need us to understand and send relief.   We know that this pandemic has disproportionately affected small  businesses owned by women and people of color. Our small businesses are  the backbone of our communities and local economy. If we are going to  come back as a country, we must pass this much-needed legislation. Now  is the time to take action.
