Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, as the Senate takes to the floor to  debate a long-overdue, bipartisan solution for Dreamers--young  immigrants who came to our country as children--I would like to tell  you a story about one Dreamer in my home State of New Mexico to  illustrate what is at stake here this week.   Immigrants have long helped to write the economic, social, and  cultural story of my home State of New Mexico and, for that matter, our  entire Nation. We are, after all, a nation of immigrants. Over the last  centuries, our Nation's foundation and the enduring American spirit  were built by the hard work and the dreams of so many striving young  immigrants.   When President Trump made the outrageous decision last fall to end  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program--DACA--he threw  hundreds of thousands of Dreamers deep into fear and uncertainty. Two  weeks ago, I was proud to welcome Ivonne Orozco-Acosta, one of the  estimated 7,000 Dreamers from New Mexico, as my guest at the State of  the Union Address.   Ivonne's family immigrated to the United States when she was 12 years  old. She learned English through middle school and graduated from high  school in Estancia, NM. It was during these challenging years of  learning that Ivonne was encouraged by her teachers to grow and to  learn. Ivonne knows the power that educators hold to create positive  change in students' perspective of themselves.   Ivonne attended the University of New Mexico, where she earned her BA  in secondary education with a concentration in Spanish. It is estimated  that somewhere between 500 and 1,000 students at the University of New  Mexico right now are Dreamers like Ivonne. These are some of our  brightest students, and they are our future leaders. Since she  graduated from UNM 4 years ago, Ivonne has been teaching Spanish at the  Public Academy for Performing Arts, a charter school in Albuquerque,  NM.   Ivonne told me what DACA has meant for her. DACA allowed her to get a  work permit, to follow her passion for education. It made it possible  for her to buy a home and her first car. It has also given her an  opportunity to impact the lives of her students each day and to  contribute to our State's economy as a teacher and as a taxpayer. DACA  gave Ivonne, in her words, ``a sliver of hope''--hope that she will  finally be able to have a permanent home and a place in the only  country that she knows how to call home.   Because of her excellent teaching in the classroom and her incredible  passion for her students, Ivonne was just selected as the 2018 New  Mexico Teacher of the Year by the New Mexico Public Education  Department. That is right; Ivonne has been recognized as the teacher of  the year for our entire State.   Ivonne's commitment to education and to giving back to her community  is truly inspiring, and it reminds us just how much is at stake for New  Mexico and our country in this debate. Our State already struggles to  keep schools filled with teachers and has one of the highest teacher  turnover rates in the Nation. Dreamers across the country, like Ivonne,  are stepping up to serve our communities, to teach our students.   Nearly 9,000 of the Dreamers who received temporary legal status and  work permits through the DACA Program are teachers like Ivonne. Many  more are firefighters; they are police officers; they are scientists;  they are doctors; they are members of our military. These inspiring  young people are Americans in every sense of the word, except for a  piece of paper, and they want nothing more than to be productive  members of their communities. But until Congress passes the Dream Act,  these young people like Ivonne will continue to worry about whether  they will be able to stay in school, keep working, contributing to our  economy, or remain even in their homes and their neighborhoods.   I have to ask: Why would we even consider threatening to deport the  teacher of the year from my State? I simply cannot accept that as  living up to all that our Nation stands for.   The Santa Fe New Mexican covered Ivonne's visit to Washington. The  New Mexican's editorial board said: ``It is no exaggeration to state  that as the immigration debate goes, so does her future.''   They went on to call the immigration debate we are engaging here in  Congress as a fight ``for the soul of this country, founded and  strengthened by immigrants throughout our history.''   I, for one, hope that we can learn from the best and most challenging  parts of our Nation's history of immigration and understand that  Dreamers like Ivonne are part of the immigration story that has always  made our Nation great. Deporting these young people who grew up in  America and want to contribute to their Nation is not what the America  that I know and love would do. Dreamers deserve commonsense,  compassionate, and responsible policy.   Two weeks ago, while President Trump was taking cheap shots at  immigrants during his State of the Union Address and insinuating that  all immigrants and asylum seekers pose an existential danger to our  children and our families, I couldn't help but think of the impacts of  his words on Ivonne as she sat in the Gallery. There are hundreds of  thousands of Dreamers like her. They are truly bright spots and rising  stars in our communities and in our country, and the time has come for  us to stop playing politics with their lives. Let's stop stirring up  fear and division when we should be working to find a real path  forward.   This week, I believe we have a path forward here in the Senate in  this debate, and we must pass a bipartisan immigration bill that  includes the Dream Act in the Senate and in the House. I will do  everything I can to pass a solution for Dreamers, to create rational  border security policies, and to make the investments that our border  region and its communities actually need.   I will stand with New Mexicans against President Trump's fear-based  and un-American views, frankly, on immigration and his offensive and  wasteful border wall that have no place in this debate.   I hope that each of us in this body recognizes our moral  responsibility and our obligation to live up to our Nation's ideals and  its values. We must act with a sense of urgency to find a way forward  for these Dreamers. Every day that passes without our passing the Dream  Act is another day of desperation and limbo for young people like  Ivonne who only know America as their home. Now is the time to give  these young Americans a permanent place and an earned path to  citizenship in our Nation. I will do everything I can every step of the  way to make that happen.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Connecticut.                        South Florida School Shooting
