 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3298) to authorize the Capitol Police  Board to make payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial  Fund to employees of the United States Capitol Police who have  sustained serious line-of-duty injuries, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3298         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wounded Officers Recovery       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PAYMENTS FROM UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE MEMORIAL                     FUND TO EMPLOYEES SUSTAINING SERIOUS LINE-OF-                    DUTY INJURIES.

(b) Regulations of Capitol Police Board.--Section 4 of       Public Law 105-223 (2 U.S.C. 1954) is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Capitol Police Board'' and inserting       ``(a) In General.--The Capitol Police Board''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Regulations Governing Payments to Employees       Sustaining Serious Line-of-duty Injuries.--In carrying out       subsection (a), the Capitol Police Board shall issue specific       regulations governing the use of the Fund for making payments       to employees of the United States Capitol Police who have       sustained serious line-of-duty injuries (as authorized under       section 2(b)), including regulations--        ``(1) establishing the conditions under which an employee       is eligible to receive such a payment;        ``(2) providing for the amount, timing, and manner of such       payments; and        ``(3) ensuring that any such payment is in addition to, and       does not otherwise affect, any other form of compensation       payable to the employee, including benefits for workers'       compensation under chapter 81 of title 5, United States       Code.''.        (c) Treatment of Amounts Received in Response to Incident       of June 14, 2017.--The second sentence of section 1 of Public       Law 105-223 (2 U.S.C. 1951) is amended by striking ``deposit       into the Fund'' and inserting ``deposit into the Fund,       including amounts received in response to the shooting       incident at the practice for the Congressional Baseball Game       for Charity on June 14, 2017,''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), chairman of the House  Administration Committee, whom I want to thank for allowing me the  opportunity to manage this very important bill today. I couldn't ask  for a nicer, more respectful chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I do want to thank my good friend, Mr. Brady, for being here today,  managing this bill on the other side, and I also want to thank the  coach of the Democrats, who won this year. I certainly liked it better  when we had the trophy.   But to be able to know that the thoughts and the prayers are with so  many of our Capitol Police officers every single day and also,  especially, the heroic actions of Agent Bailey and Agent Griner, what  you and our next speaker did with this legislation makes all of us who  were a part of this time very humble and thankful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Barton), our manager, the sponsor of this piece of legislation today.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here  can't be stated much better than what my colleague Mr. Doyle just so  eloquently delivered today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall), one of our pitchers, one of our newest members of our  congressional baseball team, and a good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), our  starting pitcher.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my good friend who was there  with us that morning, somebody whom I watched act heroically and his  watchful eye on the entire process, somebody who can give us his  personal anecdotes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I thank my colleagues, Mr. Brady and Mr. Doyle, for the opportunity  to come here today on this floor and show America the bipartisanship  that we see and we witness on this floor every single day--not just  because of a baseball game--to do what is right.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my colleague, Joe Barton, for  leading this effort--not only leading us as a manager of our baseball  team, leading us as somebody who brings their son, their 11-year-old  son to practice to have fun playing with a bunch of old guys who really  shouldn't be playing baseball as much as we enjoy doing it, but to be  able to do it, to raise money for local D.C. charities.   Joe, Jack, Barry, I, and the rest of us who were there that morning,  none of us ever thought that, at approximately 7:09, we would hear the  words: Run, he has got a gun. And it was mentioned by Mr. Doyle about  those of us who dove in that dugout.   Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker. I think I could have beaten  Usain Bolt from home plate where I was standing to that dugout that  day. I dove in that dugout not knowing where the shooter was, what the  shooter's motives were, and what was next.   As I was working my way outside of that dugout, I saw Agent Bailey  come onto that field in the line of fire to protect every single one of  us who were there that day, and it wasn't just Members of Congress. It  wasn't just people who this shooter may have politically disagreed with  that morning that were there that day.   It was an 11-year-old boy like Jack Barton. There were innocent  people walking in that park, walking their dogs, in the line of fire  that morning because this person may have disagreed with what we do on  this floor.   For those people who are watching today, understand, again, what we  are doing here, which is what is right to help those heroes, Agent  Bailey and Agent Griner, get access to the funds that all of America  put forth on their behalf in less than 24 hours after that tragic  shooting. Let us all remind them that we do get along; we do work  together. It is not just when tragic moments like this happen. It is a  lot more often than what you see.    In less than 24 hours after that shooting, the American people  stepped up, and they did what Americans do in the wake of tragedies  every single time we witness them.   We had already raised a record amount of money for local D.C.  charities with this year's game, $600,000, $100,000 more than what was  normal. And they sold, again, 10,000 seats. In less than 24 hours, the  American people from all over this great Nation raised another $900,000  to go to local D.C. charities and to the Capitol Police Memorial Fund,  which was added the last day.   They also sold 25,000 tickets. I think that game that night, we  outsold like three major league games in attendance. We obviously  didn't play as well as they did, but we outsold them.   And that shows you what America is all about. It shows you what  Republicans and Democrats are all about. It shows you that in the wake  of a senseless tragedy, where we watched our friend lay on that field,  not knowing what the outcome was going to be for Steve Scalise and his  family, Matt Mika, Zack Barth, Agent Griner, and Agent Bailey, that  those two saved the lives of everyone on that field that day.   Charging at gunfire is not something I ever thought I would do, and I  didn't do that day. But thank God they were there, and they did. And  those Alexandria police officers, the police officers I never saw  arrive at that scene, thank God they were there.   Because it is the heroic actions of all of those officers, especially  those two who I joked with when I walked onto this House floor when I  would see them here, not knowing that we would have ever been a part of  something that will bind us all together, a tragedy that happens one  morning in Alexandria, Virginia, while a bunch of old guys are playing  baseball.   We will forever be bound by what we saw and what we witnessed that  day. There is not an hour in the day that goes by in my life that I  don't think about what happened on that field that morning.   The smells, the sounds, the fear that all of us experienced that day  could have been, as every speaker said before, much worse without the  heroes who ran toward gunfire, sacrificing themselves for every one of  us, and every innocent person in that park, in that field that day.   This is why we have got to make this technical change, Mr. Speaker.  We are here. We are lawmakers. We write the laws. We can change the  laws. And when this fund was set up, because of the tragedy that many  still in D.C. witnessed that day with Officer Gibson and Officer  Chestnut who were gunned down protecting innocent Americans in this  building, this fund was set up to honor them, not knowing that years  later--and today is the anniversary of that shooting--we would need to  modify this bill to help two more of our heroes who were lucky and  blessed enough to survive.   Today we are going to do that because of the leadership of Mr. Barton  and Mr. Doyle. Let me go back to that day in 1998. I was actually a new  staffer for a new Member of Congress named John Shimkus. I was sitting  in the district office in Springfield, Illinois,  [[Page H6187]]  when I heard the news that shootings were happening in the U.S.  Capitol--the fear as a staffer that went through me, wondering where my  friend and my boss were. But I got to see it from out there. I never  thought years later I would get to witness it as a Member of Congress.   And witness it, we all did, but also we learned from it, and we  learned what America was all about. And today is our day in the U.S.  Congress to stand up for those heroes who protected us that day and  say: We are going to help you.   I, and my family, my kids, my wife, every family member who I was  able to reach out to that morning, and all of those who I wasn't able  to talk to, we cannot say thank you enough to Agent Griner, Agent  Bailey, and the Alexandria Police Department for making sure we have  the ability to make this fix.   I urge every one of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill. Let's  send a message back to America that we thank them for what they did for  our officers, and we thank them for allowing all of us the privilege to  serve in this great institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
