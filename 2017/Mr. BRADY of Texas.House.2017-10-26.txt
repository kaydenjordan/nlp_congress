 Mr. Speaker, with this budget, we have an  opportunity to move forward on a major priority for the American  people, which is delivering the first overhaul of America's broken Tax  Code in more than three decades.   When you look, today, at the way America is taxed, it doesn't take  long to recognize this is completely and utterly broken. You can see  that it is so complex it forces millions of families and job creators  to spend billions of hours and dollars each year just filing their  taxes.   It is unfair. It gives wasteful Washington lobbyists loopholes and  carve-outs to special interests by giving hardworking Americans nothing  but frustration.   You can see that our Tax Code is miserably uncompetitive. That is why  more and more of our American businesses and good-paying jobs are going  overseas to countries with more modern and more competitive tax  systems.   By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the  American people: real tax reform is on the way. A ``no'' vote, as we  heard from our Democratic colleagues, is to block tax reform and defend  the status quo.   We are all working closely with President Trump as he leads this  charge. Together, we have bold ideas to deliver more jobs, fairer  taxes, and bigger paychecks for all Americans this year.   I want to thank Chairman Black and the Budget Committee for all their  hard work. I want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes''--vote  ``yes''--on tax reform, and join me in taking an important historic  step forward to deliver on our tax reform promise.
