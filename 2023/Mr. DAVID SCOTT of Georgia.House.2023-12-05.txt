 Mr. Speaker, I rise at this time feeling  a great honor to be here in the House of Representatives of the United  States to say a few words about an extraordinary person.   Mr. Speaker, as I reflect, I am thinking of three specific instances  of my interactions with this wonderful lady that I think sheds a great  light on the legacy of her story.   One was where I served in the Georgia State Senate. I was chairman of  the State senate rules committee, and we were dealing with a very  serious issue facing our farmers, particularly our peanut farmers. Into  the committee walked this lady, Mrs. Rosalynn Carter, to express the  need to help these farmers. It ruled the day because there was some  debate on that, but she turned it and gave a resounding victory, and  helped to give that victory to our farmers.   The second instance was in the rules committee when we had another  bill. It was to give our young people of Georgia scholarships in our  university systems. Some had great problems with that. It was a good  friend, Zell Miller's bill, Governor Zell Miller at the time, and some  wanted to reference it as gambling because it was related to that.  However, with Rosalynn Carter there, again, she was able to help get a  victory.   The third time was when Rosalynn Carter came into my district in  Georgia. It was in the neighborhood of Summerhill and Grant Park. There  she was with us all, hammering nails and building houses for those who  needed houses in my district. What a lady.   Mr. Speaker:       Them that's got shall get      Them that's not shall lose      So the Bible said and it still is news      Mama may have, papa may have,      But God bless the child that's got his own.    Mr. Speaker, Rosalynn Carter was most assuredly a child of God, and  we thank God for sending Mrs. Rosalynn Carter our way.
