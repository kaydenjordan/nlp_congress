 Mr. President, I want to address my colleagues with  three different subjects. The first one is very, very short. It is  things that are being talked about right now, particularly in the other  body.   Many in the media seem very, very unhappy with the results of the  Mueller report, or they might be embarrassed that the world knows that  they sold a bunch of snake oil for the past 2 years, talking for 2  years about collusion with Russia, and now after the Mueller report has  come out, they find out that the jig is up.   I hope the media will pursue the origins of the Russian collusion  investigation with the very same vigor over the last 2 years that they  pursued the collusion narrative. It will go a long way, then, to  restore the media's damaged credibility, and knowing how all of this  started will help us to prevent such a fiasco from ever happening  again.
