 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Langevin) for his dedication to the National Endowment for the Arts and  the National Endowment for the Humanities, and for organizing this  Special Order today.   As the 12th Congressional District Representative from North  Carolina, as a practicing professional artist, as an arts educator, a  curator, and a retired 40-year visual arts professor, I am pleased to  join with all of my colleagues expressing my support for the National  Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. I  want to associate myself with the previous comments made by my  colleagues from North Carolina and New Jersey as well.   I have learned throughout my professional arts education and arts  management careers that, yes, the arts are nice; but beyond being nice,  they are absolutely necessary and essential to enriching our lives.   Artists connect the past to the present. They convey our unique  experiences. And they are presented in many forms, sometimes familiar  and other times unfamiliar.   A universal language, the arts speak to people everywhere to help  them understand diversity and cultures and some of the most complicated  issues.   The arts and humanities are critical for adding value to our shared  culture. They are not just used to mark celebrations, but to challenge  perceptions of society.   Museums function as tools to house and preserve our collective  history as a nation and bind us together as one community. Visual  artists reflect on our society and they force us to reconcile our past.  Writers record history and expose and challenge readers to different  ideals presented in our society. Musicians transcend social and  cultural boundaries to connect the listener through the sound of their  instruments.   Time and time again, we have made a conscious decision to fund the  arts and the humanities, signaling that we intrinsically value the arts  as being crucial to our collective identity.   The NEA and the NEH have been and continue to be necessary to the  success of the arts and humanities in my home State of North Carolina.  As a Representative of Charlotte, one of the largest cities in the  South, I understand how important the NEA and the NEH is to Charlotte's  unique and thriving art culture.   In 2016, the NEA invested $60,000 in grants in Charlotte for programs  such as the Children's Theatre of Charlotte Inc.'s performance of the  ``Journey to Oz'' and the McColl Center for Art and Innovation's  exhibition and residency featuring Latino and Hispanic artists. NEA  grants make these cultural events possible not just in my State, but in  States throughout this Nation.   The arts not only provide entertainment, but they also encourage us  to think critically. Advocates and researchers have shown that the arts  have a positive impact on a young person's development. And because of  this understanding, the arts and music were included in the Every  Student Succeeds Act as part of a well-rounded education.   The NEA is a critical component to ensuring strong arts education in  our schools. Through direct grants, the NEA is able to support crucial  preschool through 12th grade education projects.    By establishing partnerships with our colleges and universities, the  NEA is able to engage with our institutions of higher learning to  provide necessary grants to preserve and restore historic works of art.   As a college art professor, I had the privilege of working with the  NEA to secure a matching grant, which allowed the college to preserve  and restore a historic painting by Aaron Douglas, the father of the  Harlem Renaissance.   In order to continue to ensure that our students remain competitive  in a global society, we must continue to fund the arts.   In addition to the cultural and educational impact of the arts, they  play an important role in helping our veterans transition to civilian  life and combat physical and mental illnesses. Through the NEA Military  Healing Arts Partnership, the NEA has worked with the Department of  Defense to create an art therapy program to treat servicemembers with  traumatic brain injuries and associated psychological health issues at  the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. This program places  art therapy at the center of a multidisciplinary treatment approach.   Through art therapy, our brave servicemen and -women are able to  receive specialized treatment that enable them to heal both their  physical and their mental wounds. Participants in the program have  found relief and have seen vast improvements in sleep, communication,  pain, and their ability to confront emotional challenges. This program  has also invested in critical research on the impacts and the benefits  of this treatment.   The NEA's budget for fiscal year 2017 was $148 million, just .004  percent of the Federal budget, a small amount.   Through a relatively small investment in the arts, we are able to  yield large returns. Not only do the arts serve us culturally in terms  of being significant, but the nonprofit arts and the cultural sector is  an economic driver, supporting about 4.13 million jobs and contributing  to a gross domestic product of 4.2 percent, or about $729 billion.                                time  1145    The arts are crucial. They are critical to our culture. They are  crucial to our education and to our economy. And in all respects, it is  the arts that make us human. So funding for NEA and the NEH must remain  in the Federal budget.   I would urge my colleagues to support us in that effort to keep the  arts as a viable part of our budget, which means that it will be a  viable part of our communities.   I thank the gentleman so much for putting together this Special Order  and for allowing me to have input today.
