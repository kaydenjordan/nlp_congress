 Mr. Speaker, Congress has exactly 3 weeks  to pass the USMCA before we break for our August work period, and we  owe it to our constituents to get the job done.   The USMCA will benefit every district in America, as it will lead to  176,000 new jobs and grow the U.S. economy by an additional $68  billion.   This agreement will also be a huge benefit to my constituents.  Pennsylvania's 13th District is made up of so many hardworking dairy  farmers who have struggled in recent years. This deal will unleash new  markets and bring our industry back to life.   Instead of hauling Robert Mueller before a committee to rehash a case  that is already closed, Congress should be putting all of our efforts  into making the USMCA agreement law.   During July, my focus will be on passing the USMCA and growing our  economy for years to come. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  this mission.                            ____________________
