 Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of being in  both the House and the Senate during the period of passage and  implementation of the Affordable Care Act and now the debate over  repeal, and I have heard consistently from my Republican colleagues two  things. One is that they did not think the Affordable Care Act was the  right approach to fixing the problems of America's healthcare system.  There were 60-some odd times that the House or the Senate voted to  repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The second thing I  heard consistently over that period of time, dating from 2009, is that  the Republicans were prepared to offer a replacement to the Affordable  Care Act that would be better, that would be an improvement over the  Affordable Care Act--indeed, over the status of the American healthcare  system when the Affordable Care Act was passed. The ground has shifted  mightily since then.   The Congressional Budget Office tells us that, under the Republican  plan either passed in the House or in the Senate, a humanitarian  catastrophe will result in this country. Tens of millions of people  would lose their healthcare. That is not what Republicans said their  replacement would do. They said their replacement would be better than  the Affordable Care Act.   The CBO says that rates will go up immediately by 20 percent on  almost everybody. Then, after that, if you are young and healthy, rates  will probably go down, but for everybody else, the amount of money you  have to pay in premiums, copays, and deductibles will go up. There is  nothing in the Republicans' bill about cost--nothing that addresses the  underlying issues with an American healthcare system that, procedure by  procedure, costs twice as much as in most other countries--and nothing  about quality. There is not a single provision in the bill that  encourages higher quality.   As we get ready for Republican repeal bill 3.0 or 4.0--whatever this  next version will be that will be released secretly to Republicans  tomorrow--I think it is just worth reminding everybody what Republicans  said would happen. I will just use our President's words. I understand  that many of my Republican colleagues here do not ascribe to all of the  beliefs and statements of our President, but he is the leader of the  Republican Party. All of my colleagues did support him, and they stood  with him in the House of Representatives, arm in arm, when they passed  the Republican House's repeal and replacement bill.   President Trump wrote this:         I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state       there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and       Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.    So no cuts to Medicaid was the promise. Yet the bill that the  President has endorsed and is trying to help Leader McConnell push  through the Senate involves debilitating cuts to Medicaid--$700 billion  to $800 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid--resulting in millions of  people being pushed off of that benefit. The cut to the State of  Connecticut would be $3 billion. We are a tiny State. Our Medicaid  Program is somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 billion. We would lose  $3 billion of that. The promise was that we would not cut Medicaid.  This bill cuts Medicaid.   President Trump wrote:         If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real       healthcare, and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare       is in a death spiral!    There is always one long sentence and then one very short sentence.   Here are the two claims: ``Premiums will start tumbling down.'' That  has been the promise, and that has been a consistent promise--that  costs will go down if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced  with a Republican plan. The CBO debunks this from beginning to end. It  says that premiums will go up. They will start tumbling upwards  immediately at rates of 20 percent. If you are older or if you have any  history of preexisting conditions, your premiums will continue to go  up. The danger, of course, is in thinking  [[Page S3938]]  that the only thing that you pay in the healthcare system is premiums.  I could pretty easily construct a healthcare reform proposal in which  your premium would go dramatically down. How would I do that? I would  just shift all of the payments onto deductibles, onto copays, and I  would give you nothing with regard to the actuarial benefit of the  plan. It is easy to get premiums to go down if you do not care about  what you are actually covering and the size of your deductibles and the  size of your copays.   Then, ``ObamaCare is in a death spiral!'' The CBO debunks that as  well. The CBO says that, if you leave the Affordable Care Act in place  over the course of the next 10 years, 2 or 3 million people will lose  healthcare insurance. If you pass the Republicans' healthcare bill,  that is where the death spiral occurs. There are 23 million people who  will lose insurance if you pass the Republicans' bill, but 2 to 3  million people will lose insurance if you do not pass it.   Again, President Trump writes:         Healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower       premiums and deductibles--    Here, he is making a commitment on deductibles. Once again, the  Congressional Budget Office says that premiums will go up and  deductibles will go up, especially for individuals who are older or  individuals with preexisting conditions--       while at the same time taking care of pre-existing       conditions!    This bill does not take care of people with preexisting conditions.  Why? Because it allows for any State to allow insurance companies to  get out from the minimum benefits requirement. If you have cancer,  technically, the Senate Republicans' bill says that you cannot be  charged more, but you may not be able to find a plan that covers cancer  treatments. So that is not protecting people with preexisting  conditions. The CBO says this specifically. It says that, especially  for people with preexisting mental illness and preexisting addiction,  they will be priced out of the marketplace because they will not find  plans that cover their illnesses. You cannot just protect people with  preexisting conditions by saying that insurance plans have to cover  them. You actually have to require insurance plans to offer the medical  benefit they need.   Once again:         Our healthcare plan will lower premiums and deductibles--      and be great healthcare!        Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare--it is dead.    I have already covered the part about premiums and deductibles, but  let's remember that insurance companies were not fleeing ObamaCare  until President Trump was sworn into office. The period of open  enrollment covered a period prior to his inauguration and a period  after his inauguration. Before President Trump's inauguration, open  enrollment was on pace to enroll a record number of Americans in  exchange plans and Medicaid plans--record enrollment. Enrollment fell  off a cliff after President Trump was sworn into office and signed an  Executive order that told all of his agencies to unwind the Affordable  Care Act. People listened to President Trump, who said that he was  going to kill the Affordable Care Act, and they stopped signing up for  those plans.   It got worse when he refused to pay insurance companies. Right now,  the President will not commit to paying cost-sharing subsidies to  insurance companies more than 30 days ahead of time. He stopped  enforcing the individual mandate, and it is no surprise that insurance  companies are saying they do not want to participate in these exchanges  because the President is trying to kill them. He has made it very clear  from day one.   I have had the benefit of being on the floor a number of times with  Senator Barrasso, who often came down to the floor, following my  remarks, during the period of the implementation of the Affordable Care  Act. I heard him talk about the fact that there will be freedom for  Americans to have or not to have insurance if this piece of legislation  is passed. It is a wonderful idea that people will be free to not be  able to afford insurance. The reality is that, yes, some individuals  buy insurance today because they are compelled to by the individual  mandate, but there is a reason for that. If you do not compel people to  buy insurance who are healthy, then you cannot protect people who are  sick.   I sat where the Presiding Officer is during Senator Cruz's 24-hour  filibuster. In the middle of that filibuster, he said exactly that.  Senator Cruz, in the middle of the his filibuster, said that we all  understand that you have to have the individual mandate in order to  prohibit companies from charging higher premiums for people who are  sick, and my Republican colleagues know that because they kept the  individual mandate in their bill.   So this nonsense about no one's being required to buy insurance is  belied by the text of the legislation we are considering. There is a  mandate in this bill. There is a penalty in this bill. It is just a far  meaner and crueler penalty than was included in the Affordable Care  Act.   What do I mean by that?   So the Affordable Care Act doesn't mandate that you buy insurance in  the sense that if you don't buy it, you will be locked up in jail; it  says that if you don't buy insurance, you will pay a penalty on your  income tax. If you don't buy insurance, there will be a penalty.   That is exactly what the Republican Senate bill says. It says that if  you don't buy insurance, you will incur a penalty. In their bill, the  penalty is that you will be locked out of buying insurance for 6  months. If you are sick, or even, frankly, if you are healthy and you  need to go see a doctor for something, you will have to pay for that  out of your pocket for those 6 months. If you are sick, and you have a  serious condition and you are legally refused healthcare because of  this legislation, the consequences could be dire, but whatever the  scope of the consequences, it is still a penalty, just like there was a  penalty in the bill that the Democrats supported and passed in 2009 and  2010.   So it is just not true to say that now Americans have the freedom not  to have healthcare. You don't because you are going to be penalized if  you let your health insurance lapse. If you don't make payments for a  couple months, you are locked out of the insurance market. That is just  a different kind of penalty than the one that is in our bill.   The truth is that while I admit there are some people who buy  insurance today because they fear that penalty, it is necessary, as  Republicans realize, in order to make sure the markets don't spiral out  of control, because if you say that you can't charge people with  preexisting conditions more and you don't require healthy people to buy  insurance, then why would any healthy person buy insurance? They will  just wait until they are sick because they know that once they are sick  and need very expensive care, they can't be charged any more for it.   The nature of insurance is that people who have the good fortune to  be healthy or to be free of accident or natural disaster subsidize  individuals who are not so fortunate--who are sick, who do have an  accident occur to their home or who are subject to a natural disaster.  That is how insurance works.   Republicans realize that because they put a penalty in their bill,  but for as many people who buy insurance because they are forced to,  most people buy insurance because they want it because they recognize  it is better to have insurance in the case that they or a loved one  gets sick, and that is whom we are talking about here. Of the 23  million who lose insurance, according to CBO, under the Republican  bill, millions and millions of those are those people who want  insurance but will not be able to get it because they are priced out by  the Republican bill. I can see there will be some people who will make  that choice, but there will be millions more who had insurance today  who will not be able to get it moving forward.   As Republicans finish up this latest round of secret negotiations, I  just want to make sure we are on the same page about what this bill  does. It mandates that you buy insurance, just in a different way. It  has a penalty just like the Affordable Care Act has a penalty.   I want to make sure we remember what Republicans stated as their  goals for this replacement. The goals were that the system would be  better, but by every single metric, this proposal will result in worse  healthcare for people. Less people will have insurance. Rates  [[Page S3939]]  will go up for everyone except for young, healthy people. Costs will  continue to spiral out of control, and no additional measures will be  taken to make quality better. Every single problem that Republicans  address in the existing healthcare system gets worse.   Senator Barrasso complains mercilessly about these exchanges. CBO  says the exchanges will shed even more people. The costs will go even  higher. Senator Cornyn regularly tweets out that the Affordable Care  Act still left 28 million people uninsured, but this bill you are  debating will double the number of people who don't have insurance.   For all of my Republican colleagues who rightly come to the floor and  talk about the fact that the cost is too high for individuals in our  system, there is not a single provision in this bill that deals with  the actual cost of the service, of the procedure, of the visit, of the  surgery.   I am deeply worried that this next version of the Republican repeal  and replace bill will result in premiums going up by 15 percent and  only 17 million Americans losing healthcare and it will be declared a  victory, but that is not what Republicans promised. They promised to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that is  better, not something that is less bad than the original version of the  replacement plan they introduced.   I think the reason that to many people it appears this bill is  falling apart is because when my colleagues went home this weekend,  they heard an earful from their constituents--from real folks who will  be affected by this piece of legislation.   Alison is 28 years old. She is from Milford, CT. She was in my office  this week. She came to DC this week, she and her boyfriend, I think--I  don't want to ascribe an engagement to them that is not true; I think  her boyfriend. They came down here this week. They were supposed to be  on vacation this week, and they decided to spend some of their vacation  coming to Washington so Alison could tell her story to Members of  Congress.   When she was 9 years old, she was diagnosed with a rare liver  disease. At the time, she and her family were told that they would need  to find a liver transplant in roughly 10 years or she wouldn't survive.   At the start of her sophomore year at Sacred Heart University in  Connecticut, she was starting to have symptoms of a condition that  results from a buildup of ammonia in her brain. She was having a hard  time concentrating, abdominal pain, nose bleeds, nausea, vomiting, and  joint pain. Her doctor said it was time for her to get that transplant,  that she was at that critical moment when she needed it.   Unfortunately, none of her family or 8 other candidates--friends, I  think, of the family--were a match. So in desperation, her parents  wrote an email and just sent it out to people who lived in Trumbull and  in the Sacred Heart University community. From that email, an anonymous  young man stepped forward. He was tested and determined to be a match.  The surgery was a success. When she walked on stage to receive her  diploma from Sacred Heart University, she was joined by that anonymous  donor, and her fellow graduates gave her a standing ovation.   Now, her family was lucky because she had insurance through her  father. She is, because of the Affordable Care Act, allowed to do that,  at the time being under 26 years old. Her insurance paid for virtually  everything that was necessary, but, she says, had my dad not had the  healthcare benefits he did, I know my family would not be in the place  we are today because my parents would have lost everything they worked  so hard for. There was no way we could have afforded to pay for all of  those burdens.   Today she worries that if this bill is passed, she, as a young woman  with a preexisting condition, will be destined to a life of  discrimination because she may not be able to find a plan that covers  her condition because of the withdrawal of protection with respect to  the minimum benefits requirements. Even in Connecticut, she is  vulnerable to that withdrawal of protection, not because Connecticut is  likely to allow insurance plans to offer coverage that doesn't include  the minimum benefits but because if you work for a big company, and  even if you are housed in Connecticut, if that company anchors their  plan in a State that does strip away the insurance protections, then  you lose the protections even as a resident of Connecticut.   Alison is now a nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit at Yale  University Children's Hospital. She is contributing in a big way to our  State and to the healthcare system. Yet she is living in fear of this  legislation being passed. So she took some of her vacation to come to  Washington to share her story with us.   I am with Senator Collins. I think the Republicans should scrap this  garbage piece of legislation. I hope they understand our offer is  sincere--it is not political--that Democrats do want to sit down with  Republicans and try to provide some reasonable fix to what still ails  our healthcare system.   I will end with this thought: It doesn't have to be like this.  Healthcare does not have to be a political football that is just tossed  from one side to the other every 10 years. That is what has been  happening here for my entire political lifetime. I was elected to  Congress in 2006, in part because of the tempest of popular frustration  with the way in which Republicans passed the 2003 Medicare  Modernization Act, which included the new prescription drug benefit  that Democrats saw--and sold--as a giveaway to the drug and insurance  industries. Democrats used healthcare as a political cudgel to bludgeon  Republicans after the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Its  implementation was very rocky, just as the implementation of the  Affordable Care Act was. The Democrats used it against Republicans.   In 2009, it was the Republicans' turn to bludgeon Democrats.  Democrats lost a lot of seats in 2010, in part because Republicans used  the passage of the Affordable Care Act to politically harm Democrats.  Now, once again, it is the Democrats' turn to politically bludgeon  Republicans.   Whether this bill passes or not, the fact that Republicans have  walked out on a plank with a partisan piece of legislation that takes  insurance from 23 million people across the country and, as every poll  shows, is widely unpopular will be a political liability for  Republicans.   What if we decided to stop tossing healthcare back and forth? What if  we decided to jointly own one-fifth of our economy? What if we decided  to sit down and give a little bit, from our side to yours, from your  side to ours? What if I said that I understood you cared about  flexibility in these marketplaces, that I understood your desire for  more flexibility for Governors and State legislatures under Medicaid?  What if you said you understood our interest in providing long-term  stability in these marketplaces, that you understood our desire to try  to get at some of the costs of the actual services and devices and  prescription drugs that are sold? What if we sat down and fixed the  things that aren't working, kept the things that are working, and held  hands together and said that we are going to jointly own the American  healthcare system?   It would leave plenty of things to fight over. There would still be  no shortage of disagreements that we could run elections on. Whether it  be immigration or taxes or minimum wage, there will still be lots of  things we could disagree on, but for as long as I have been in  politics, this issue has just been thrown back and forth, to hurt  Democrats, to hurt Republicans. In the process, we have injected so  much uncertainty into the healthcare system and into the economy at  large, that we make it impossible for private sector reform to take  hold.   Hospitals and healthcare providers have been doing really innovative  things since the Affordable Care Act went into effect because they got  a signal from the Federal Government that we wanted them to start  building big coordinated systems of care, that we were going to reward  outcomes rather than volume. So they started making all of these big  changes, and then, about a year ago, they stopped because Republicans  said they were going to blow up that model and pass something new. We  frustrated innovation because we telegraphed that healthcare policy is  just going to ping-pong back and forth between left and right. We hurt  ourselves politically, we frustrate the  [[Page S3940]]  private sector innovation, and get no benefit to us on the economy.   My offer, and I think the offer from most of my colleagues, is  sincere. If my Republican friends do choose to throw away this piece of  legislation because it doesn't comport with the goals that Republicans  have long said were at the heart of their effort to repeal this bill,  there is an important bipartisan conversation about keeping what is  working in our healthcare system and admitting together that there are  big things that aren't working and fixing them together.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
