 Mr. President, President Biden has a lot of duties and  obligations and a lot on his plate right now. The important thing that  we are involved in, that we are all concerned about, are the nominees,  who they are, what the process is, and what leverage do we in the  minority have to impact that.   I think that Xavier Becerra is not fit to be our Secretary of Health  and Human Services, and I say this because of his appalling track  record disrespecting the sanctity of life, blatantly attacking First  Amendment rights, and his extreme policy views.   Now, throughout his career, Mr. Becerra has proven he has no shame  when it comes to his pro-abortion beliefs. As attorney general of  California, Becerra led a yearslong lawsuit targeting the Little  Sisters of the Poor. This order of Catholic nuns is devoted to caring  for the elderly poor. All they want is to be free to operate in  accordance with their religious beliefs, and I think we can all  understand that. But Becerra sued the Federal Government to force the  nuns--and we are talking about the Little Sisters of the Poor--to  provide access to birth control and abortion-inducing drugs, completely  disrespecting their religious beliefs.   During his confirmation hearings, multiple Senators asked Mr. Becerra  about his lawsuit, and he said:         I've never sued any affiliation of nuns. [M]y actions have       always been directed at the Federal agencies.    But I think it is pretty misleading because he may have sued the  Federal Government, but his actions certainly were directed at the  nuns.   And that is not his only assault on life. Mr. Becerra also fought  against the Trump administration's title X rule in court. We all  remember this. This is where he ensured that Federal tax dollars would  only go toward family planning clinics that don't offer abortions.   And, during the pandemic, Becerra has been an aggressive advocate of  expanding access to chemical abortions, thereby providing abortions by  mail that are done at home and without the supervision of a medical  provider. And all abortions, in my view--and I know a lot of people  don't agree with this, but I think all abortions are bad. But  increasing unsupervised access to chemical abortions, which are four  times more likely to cause problems and complications for the mother  than surgical abortions, shows that Mr. Becerra's concern isn't about  health; it is about his pro-abortion agenda.   We shouldn't be surprised. During his time in Congress, Mr. Becerra  voted against multiple pro-life bills, including the partial-birth  abortion ban, and that was one that was sponsored on both sides. It was  a bipartisan bill. It banned the horrific procedure in which a baby is  partially delivered and then painfully destroyed.   But Becerra isn't just radical in his support for abortion. He also  goes after the First Amendment rights of individuals who disagree with  him. I am sure everyone here remembers the shocking, heart-wrenching  evidence collected by two undercover journalists in 2015 that showed  Planned Parenthood's involvement in selling the body parts of aborted  babies. Becerra has chosen to prosecute the journalists rather than  take the action to protect babies and investigate the evidence of this  behavior.   Becerra also targeted the California pro-life pregnancy centers by  forcing them to advertise abortions, in violation of their First  Amendment rights. Now, he fought them all the way to the U.S. Supreme  Court, and he lost.   But he didn't give up. Last fall, he supported California's ban on  indoor worship services, also in violation of the First Amendment, and  he lost again in the Supreme Court. He doesn't give up. Justice Gorsuch  said--and this is a quote from Justice Gorsuch. He said:         If Hollywood may host a studio audience or film a singing       competition while not a single soul may enter California's       churches, synagogues, and mosques, something has gone       seriously awry.    I agree with Justice Gorsuch in that observation.   Becerra also wants to decriminalize illegal immigration, saying:         They are not criminals. They haven't committed a crime       against someone.    Should he be confirmed to be the HHS Secretary, he would be  positioned to give illegal immigrants access to his programs.   So, lastly, I just want to send a message to the pro-life movement,  to people in Oklahoma and Americans all around the country who really  believe in the sanctity of life. We are not going to give up in trying  to block this nomination, and we will do everything we can to stop the  confirmation of Xavier Becerra.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
