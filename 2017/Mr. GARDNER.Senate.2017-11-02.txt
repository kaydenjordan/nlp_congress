 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to complete my remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I will be brief in my remarks. We are  about to vote on the confirmation of Allison Eid to become a judge on  the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which is  housed in Denver, CO.   I have had the privilege and honor of knowing Justice Eid for over a  decade. Justice Eid now serves on the Colorado Supreme Court. I have  known Justice Eid since the time I was a young law student, 6 foot 4  and with black hair. That is how long I have known Justice Eid. I am  very honored to have worked with her.   I know that a lot of my classmates who had her as a professor are  people who shared political perspectives that were far different from  Justice Eid's, but they never criticized her teaching. They always  found her to be openminded and open to debate of other's views.   Most importantly, what Justice Eid will do, once confirmed to the  Tenth Circuit Court, is to make sure that she rules based on the law,  not on personal opinion or preferences but how the law dictates. That  is the kind of judge she will be and continues to be, from the supreme  court to the circuit court. She will be somebody who is a guardian of  the Constitution, as our Founders were hoping we would see on our  Federal courts when they wrote the Constitution.   I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the  Record. It is from the National Native American Bar Association in  support of Ms. Eid's nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                            National Native American                                                 Bar Association,                                                      July 12, 2017.      Re National Native American Bar Association Support for           Confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison           Eid to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.       United States Senate,        Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Bennet,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Cory Gardner,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steven Daines,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: As President of the National Native American       Bar Association, it is my privilege to endorse Colorado       Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid to be a Judge on the United       States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Since she       began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court in 2006, and       indeed throughout her legal career before her  [[Page S6981]]       appointment to the bench, Justice Eid has demonstrated deep       understanding of federal Indian law and policy matters, as       well as significant respect for tribes as governments. Such       qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the       federal bench and consequently, many in Indian Country       strongly support Justice Eid's confirmation.        The National Native American Bar Association's mission is       to advance justice for Native Americans. As our name implies,       NNABA represents the interests of all populations indigenous       to the lands which are now collectively the United States:       American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Our       members include Native American attorneys, Indian law       practitioners and professors, as well as numerous tribal       court advocates and tribal court judges. As you know, all       branches of the Federal government play an integral role in       justice for Native Americans and their government-to-      government relationship with the United States. The unique       legal posture of Indian tribes to the federal government is       deeply rooted in American history and has always been heavily       intertwined with often-shifting federal Indian policy, but       often a central role in justice for Native Americans rests       with the federal courts. Yet nearly all federal courts have       suffered without any Native voice on the bench and often       without judges with knowledge of federal Indian law or       familiarity with Indian Country. NNABA strongly encourages       the confirmation of judges with experience or interest in       federal Indian law and who respect the role of tribal       sovereigns under the Constitution and treaties with the       United States. It is NNABA's honor and privilege to commend       for your consideration for the confirmation of Justice       Allison Eid, who exemplifies those qualities and who is also       an exceptionally well-qualified candidate in every other       regard, as well as the first Colorado woman to be nominated       to the Tenth Circuit.        Her academic credentials are excellent. Raised by a single       mother in Spokane, Washington, Justice Eid began college at       the University of Idaho and then transferred to Stanford       University where she graduated with distinction and was a       member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After Stanford,       Justice Eid served as a speechwriter to President Ronald       Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett. She went on       to attend the University of Chicago Law School where she       served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated with       High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice Eid       began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry Smith       on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.       She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas on       the United States Supreme Court.        In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her       clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and       appellate litigation for a variety of clients, including       significantly for the Hopi Tribe. She was a key part of       litigation teams asserting the Hopi Tribe's sovereign rights       in litigation against the United States Department of the       Interior, for example in the so-called ``Bennett Freeze''       litigation, wherein the Hopi Tribe sought the right to       develop its lands and resources despite a federal moratorium       on such development.        Justice Eid later became a tenured professor at the       University of Colorado Law School where she taught       Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and served as the       faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at the University       of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service in the legal       community, being active in a number of bar organizations and       serving as a frequent speaker and author. In 2005 she was       appointed by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve       as the Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later,       Governor Bill Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado       Supreme Court where she has served for 11 years, and was       successfully retained by the voters of Colorado on a       statewide ballot. While serving as a Justice on the       Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has continued to teach       at the University of Colorado. She also serves as the       Chair of the Supreme Court Water Court Committee which       works to identify rule and statutory changes to achieve       efficiencies in water court cases, while maintaining       quality outcomes for all. Justice Eid was also appointed       by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the Federal       Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a prestigious       appointment where she has served alongside federal judges,       law professors, and lawyers to craft revisions to the       Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--including her       support for efforts to allow tribes to file amicus briefs       as of right at the Supreme Court just as state governments       can. Justice Eid is also active in her community and       church. As the mother of two children, Justice Eid has       volunteered numerous hours at her children's schools and       for their extracurricular activities.        NNABA is very concerned that federal appointees, whether       judicial, executive branch or independent agency       representatives, be well versed in and respectful of tribal       sovereignty. Justice Eid has significantly more experience       with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court       nominee. Her Indian law cases generally reflect her respect       for tribes as sovereign governments and understanding of       tribes' roles in our federalism. Justice Eid has been       involved in five Indian law cases, each addressing only a       subset of myriad issues of importance to Indian tribes. We       have examined Justice Eid's record and are heartened by the       respect and fairness she has always shown tribes appearing       before the Colorado Supreme Court. We have canvassed NNABA       members who have appeared before or clerked for Justice Eid       (yes, Justice Eid has hired a Native American law clerk!) and       received unanimous positive feedback.        Justice Eid has knowledge gained from living in and working       in a State which has Indian Country and strong tribal       governments, and also from being the spouse of a noted       American Indian Law practitioner, Mr. Troy Eid, who served as       Chair of the Indian Law and Order Commission, as the United       States Attorney for Colorado from 2006-2009, and who now co-      chairs the national Indian law practice group at Greenberg       Traurig LLP, is admitted to practice before numerous tribal       courts and serves as a Tribal appointee on the Navajo Nation       Commission on Judicial Conduct. Her husband is widely       regarded as an expert in Indian law, and in particular on       tribal law enforcement and access to justice issues. In her       personal life, Justice Eid regularly interacts with tribal       leaders and Native American lawyers and often brings that       knowledge to bear on the bench. We believe her to be a       conscientious, diligent, careful and scholarly jurist. Each       NNABA member we heard from concluded that Justice Eid is a       woman of integrity and extremely well-qualified for the Tenth       Circuit.        NNABA has long sought the nomination of federal judges with       knowledge of federal Indian law, and more generally with       experience on western issues directly impacting Indian tribes       such as water law and public lands. With Justice Neil       Gorsuch's elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court, that knowledge       base and experience is lacking in the current makeup of the       Tenth Circuit, and is a vitally important perspective. In       short, Justice Eid has shown herself to be interested and       engaged and willing to make the federal judiciary more       accessible to tribes, who regrettably often find themselves       in the position of federal court litigants.        On the Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has always       ``gotten it right'' on Indian law matters, as reflected in       her majority opinion in Pawnee Well Users v. Wolfe, 320 P.3d       320 (Colo. 2013) (tribal water rights), in her joining of the       dissent in Southern Ute v. King Consolidated Ditch Co., 250       P.3d 1226 (Colo. 2011), and in her votes to grant certiorari       in TMR v. TER, 2013 WL 3809175 (Indian Child Welfare Act       case) and Begaye v. People, 2011 WL 6162622 (Batson challenge       involving Native American jury pool). We also note her       important concurring opinion in Cash Advance & Preferred Cash       Loans v. State, 242 P.3d 1099 (Colo. 2010), principally a       case about tribal enterprises' sovereign immunity from suit       and service of process. This opinion illustrates Justice       Eid's respect for tribal sovereignty and we think is       emblematic of the practicality, fairness, the careful       attention to what the law requires, and the accessibility of       writing style that she would bring to the Tenth Circuit.        In sum, while we do not expect that Justice Eid will agree       with tribal interests on every issue, we also believe that       she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that       Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will       rule fairly on Indian Country matters. We endorse her       confirmation to serve.        Thank you for considering our views.        And special thanks to Senators Daines and Gardner, who have       consistently solicited feedback from tribes and tribal       organizations regarding federal judicial nominations. NNABA       appreciates your continued commitment to Indian country, to       fortifying the government-to-government relationship between       the United States and tribes, and to ensuring that Native       American voices are heard at the highest levels of the       federal government.        If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to       contact our NNABA Nominations and Endorsements Committee       Chair, and Immediate Past NNABA President Jennifer Weddle.            Respectfully and humbly,                                                Diandra Benally,                                          President, National Native                               American Bar Association, 2017-2018.
