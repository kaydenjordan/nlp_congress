 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote is called at 5:30.    Mr. President, I have been working nonstop, reaching out  to my colleagues, who have heard from me all hours of the day and night  this past weekend, to put together a straightforward, bipartisan CR  package that we can pass quickly to prevent a completely unnecessary  government shutdown.   I am pleased to say the senior Senator from Maine and I have put  together a bill that keeps our government funded while we continue to  work on full-year appropriations. It provides critical dollars for  communities that are struck by disasters and Ukraine, which is at a  pivotal moment in its defensive efforts against Putin's brutal,  unprovoked war of aggression. These are important downpayments as we  continue to work now on a full-year bill, but we have more to do.   Importantly, this CR also ensures that wildland firefighters will not  see a pay cut. It prevents critical laws from lapsing to make sure the  FAA and community health centers can continue operating and more.   I hope that all of our colleagues in the Senate and the House will  work with us to get this signed into law as soon as possible so we can  avoid a shutdown that would be nothing short of devastating for our  economy and for families everywhere.   This should not be hard. We have a simple, bipartisan CR, a truly  reasonable bill. We have the support to get it signed into law if it is  put up for a vote in both Chambers. We do not have a moment to waste.  Let's get this done and get right back to work on passing the 12  bipartisan appropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate  floor.   Mr. President, I am here tonight to urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion  to invoke cloture.
