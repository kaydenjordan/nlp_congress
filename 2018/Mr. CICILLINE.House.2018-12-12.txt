 Mr. Speaker, in 9 days, we are going to face another  government shutdown.   The American people want a responsible Federal Government that works  for them, but yesterday President  [[Page H10115]]  Trump said that he will be proud to shut down the government. The  President believes that his idea for an ineffective, $70 billion,  1,000-mile long border wall is more important than keeping the  government open for business.   Our constituents are sick of this stuff. The President told them that  Mexico would pay for the wall, and now he is threatening to close the  government if he doesn't get what he wants. This is exactly why our  constituents voted to put Democrats in control of Congress last month.  They don't want their hard-earned money wasted on an expensive,  ineffective border wall.   We should listen to them. Democrats and Republicans need to come  together and work together to meet their needs, not President Trump's.   While the President throws another Twitter tantrum, let's keep the  government open and work on solutions for the real challenges facing  our constituents: good-paying jobs, lower healthcare costs, and ending  the corruption in Washington. That is what Democrats are committed to  doing.   It is time for Republicans to stand up to this President and work  with Democrats for the benefit of the American people.                            ____________________
