 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  National School Choice Week, because I believe that every family should  be able to choose a school that is right for their children's needs.   School choice is important because it gives families the autonomy and  freedom to do what is in their own children's best interests. It also  creates competition and education, through which we can really begin to  achieve excellence and innovation.   There is enough evidence to suggest that competition created by more  education options increases college readiness and better prepares many  students for life after the classroom.   It opens up balanced opportunities for students and their families,  whether that is traditional public schools, public charter schools,  public magnet schools, private schools, online academies, or other  alternatives. That is because what may be right for one family and  their children may not be right for their neighbors' kids.   National School Choice Week recognizes the need for families to make  that decision for themselves. Your child only goes each step in their  education one time. Let's make the most of each year of a child's  education opportunity, not subject them to experiments.                            ____________________     Thank you, Mr. Gohmert, for leading this tonight and for  allowing me and some of my colleagues some time on this.  [[Page H992]]    Yes, coming from California, you know, we feel the brunt, as any  border State does, especially. But we know it is pervasive through all  50 States of this Nation.   What are the ideals of this country, its founding? We welcome legal  immigration. What is so hard about that concept?   Instead, we get into these euphemisms of just immigration or  immigrants or migrants. And that is the disservice that is being done  by people out there who are listening and watching what we are arguing  about here, that we are somehow all against immigration or against  migrants or evacuees or refugees, and that couldn't be further of from  the truth.   You don't have a sovereign nation if you don't have defined borders  that we as a nation set the policy, set what is going to happen with  who is going to enter, and so it is chaos.   So, Mr. Gohmert, we could do DACA after DACA, amnesty after amnesty.  Ronald Reagan, in good faith, back in 1986, sat down and hammered  something out, and the other side did not adhere to it.    A continued effort at establishing a solid border, a  barrier. Mr. Norman talked about this as well.   We are not talking about a solid fence for all 2,000 miles. We are  talking about a system. We are talking about a system where the fence  makes sense, where there would be patrols where you have the type of  terrain where you don't need to do a whole lot.   So it is a combination, like any other aspect of--whether it is a  sports team, you know, a football offense, you have got linemen,  quarterback, running backs, split ends, or even in the military  situation.   An Army tank by itself is a good piece of equipment, but you have got  to have people in it. You have to have people surrounding it. You have  to have air support. It is not that much different an analogy that you  have to have an overall system that is tailored to each piece of region  there.   So when we have seen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  in previous years, Bill Clinton, right on this floor, talking about the  scourge of illegal immigration in this country--Barack Obama, Senator  Schumer down the hall here, Senator Hillary Clinton, they have all  talked about this, and others that I am not naming, they have all  talked about the need to do this.   So the question is: What has changed? What has changed in the last 2  years, 4 years, 5 years, when we, just as recently as 2013, had funding  put in place in a bipartisan fashion to put stronger and more border  barrier up? What has changed?    Is it merely because of the election of Donald J. Trump, and we are  all in for resistance from here till whenever that Presidency ends,  that we have to hold hostage the entire country to this concept of  merely resistance instead of doing what is right for the border?   This shouldn't be a partisan issue at all, and, in the past, it has  proven not to be partisan. It has proven to be what makes sense for our  sovereign border. And it is so sad and maddening, I think, for a lot of  American people because here we are right now. The line has been drawn  on this, and we need to get this done.   Nobody wants to get the government operations open once again that  are closed, that are being hampered right now, but there is a  combination of things that need to happen here.   What is so appalling is that this President has put a lot of  different ideas on the table: a year ago, the four pillars, and  recently, with different ideas, different combinations. He has invited  every Member of this body to come down to the White House at one time  or another and sit and talk about this.   And when the other side roundly rejects the opportunity to have a  conversation, that is what we are supposed to always try and do, have a  conversation in this body, in this place, where we are duly elected, to  hammer out our differences.   We come from such diverse backgrounds and diverse States and diverse  districts. Just California alone, 53 different Members of the House,  very diverse viewpoints and ideas and geography. It is our job to  hammer this stuff out.   Why are Members of this House and over in the Senate getting away  with roundly rejecting a conversation about our sovereign borders here,  about the need to have a good steel barrier and the other combination,  the other system, parts of the system that make the whole thing work?  It is appalling, and we need to do better.   Mr. Gohmert, you were speaking with Mr. Norman and others about your  recent visit. I have also spent time on the California border, San  Ysidro, and a little bit of time in Arizona as well.    The San Diego portion, yes, but not currently, as  additional pieces have been done. I need to go back again and see how  the newest design is working and such.   But we have had experience at this, and we see that the stations  where people are coming through, we have got an incredible amount of  volume being done, an incredible job by our personnel there to vet  people and vet their vehicles and make sure that stuff is not getting  through that should not get through, whether it is drugs or guns or  what have you, and they are doing an incredible job.   But we are also doing them a disservice by making it so overwhelming  for them by not giving them the whole system and the whole amount of  funding as the President laid out. He wants to put extra border  security personnel, I think 2,750, as well as the facilities for those  who are coming to meet that border for medical attention and for  speeding up the process for those who are seeking asylum.   What is wrong with this package? Or what is wrong with at least the  conversation that could be had about well, if it is a little short in  some area, then talk to the President, talk to all of us about what  needs to be boosted up in it.   Instead, it is a nonconversation, and that is what is so appalling  for the American public who are watching this, who are depending on us  to uphold our oath for the security of this Nation and of its people.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that even Mexico is  catching on to this, because, yes, it is about twice as many miles to  come from those Central American countries just to gain entrance to the  U.S. If you are doing it legally at a point of entry, why wouldn't you  go to Texas and go through the process?   It is almost double the mileage to come over toward the California  border from Central America, because California has a sanctuary-state  and a defy-the-Federal-Government-on-this-work attitude, and so it is a  magnet for that.   We are seeing, in Tijuana on the Mexican side of the border there,  those folks are fed up with what is going on there.   We are doing a disservice. The other side wants to talk about  compassion. Where is the compassion when you are basically fooling  people into saying: Oh, I guess we have an open door up there. Let's  all go do it. Let's all head that way and get an opportunity.   You are teasing people, basically.   When we talk about compassion, as my colleagues mentioned, as a  family, we were talking about this over the weekend. Rape trees?  Articles of women's clothing there that are basically trophies for  these people, showing who is in charge. It is the gangs at the border?  Who are we helping?   Then we talk about the individual names. I can name some Californians  here. I will go back to Kate Steinle; Jamiel Shaw; and, more recently,  a police officer from central California, Ronil Singh, serving  honorably, cut down unnecessarily by people who shouldn't be having  access to be able to commit crime in our country.   So where are we? There are a lot of things we need to do.   California, being very heavily involved in agriculture, high-value  crops that really don't grow anywhere else in this country, we need a  labor force. We need a legal labor force. All this goes hand-in-hand  here.   You do the workers a much better service by having them come here  with legal documentation, with numbers that we decide as a country, and  allow them to take part in what we see fit. They have documents; they  are safer.   We have so much more we can do by having a comprehensive approach to  legally enforcing our borders and who comes across. It is better for  the people and better for those who we ask to come in, and not have  them break in.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line, for our personnel on the border, our  Border Patrol folks: this infrastructure helps them to do their job  much easier, with much less risk. We are talking about the stadium  analogy. Having a focused effort where they don't have to run every  mile. They can put one every 10 miles, one officer every 10 miles.    Of course they do. They have worked for millennia. The  argument these days is really very specious on this.   I throw it right back: How is it compassionate to put people at risk  with the magnet this country is, the opportunity it is, when we are  making people take horrendous risk, whether it is the men in the  family, their wives, their children, the separation, and all the things  that happen. That is not compassion at all. It, indeed, is a horrendous  crime against them, by giving them these mixed signals.   We need to have a legal process for people who want to come here to  work, who want to come here for education, whatever it is. I do not see  the downside of anything they have argued about here tonight: Mr.  Griffith on the environmental side of it, the wildlife and all that.  There is no downside to what we are talking about. Once we put this  barrier in place and that infrastructure is paid for, it will pay for  itself many, many, many times over, not just in tax dollars, but in  people's lives, in people's quality of life, in this country and those  that would approach it.   There is no negative argument to this, other than the rhetoric out  there in this resistance movement that is seeming trying to cash out, I  guess, in terms of elections.   When we are talking about the census that is coming up here, the  number of illegal immigrants that are in California is probably untold.   But here is a distortion that happens in California: We may have up  to three or more Members of Congress in the State who are representing  a population that is not legal here, which is unfair to the other 49  States and their representation because they should be counting  citizens and not illegal aliens in this country in that State.    Absolutely. I think anybody with common sense would look  at it that way.    I can't speak for everything.   Yeah, the common sense seems to be lost because of this obfuscation,  the resistance, and what have you that is a political end.   Normal people sitting around their kitchen table would say: Yeah,  that is right, we should count citizens.   We treat people, otherwise, humanely in this country, we help them.  We need to help people where they come from. Whether we are talking  about the refugee situation, whether it is in the Middle East, or in  Central America, help them to thrive where they are, help them to beat  back the things that are causing the problems there, whether it is the  drug cartel. We shouldn't have the magnet of drug use in this country,  but that is a whole other discussion and battle. But let's help them  where they are. We are that compassionate country that will do so. We  can't be a magnet for, basically, an erased border and think that is  going to provide a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time tonight, and my  colleagues for bringing this argument forward. I hope the American  people can hear that we care about all human life. We do. But address  it in a way that works as a sovereign nation and for other nations as  well.
