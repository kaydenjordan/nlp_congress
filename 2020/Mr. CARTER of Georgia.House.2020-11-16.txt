 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Raquel Salter for being selected for promotion from lieutenant  commander to commander in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserves.   Commander Salter is a 29-year veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard and  served about one-third of her time in Georgia's First Congressional  District.   Throughout her service, she has always gone above and beyond to  selflessly defend our Nation and advocate for the Coast Guard,  especially servicewomen.   Over her 29 years of service, Commander Salter has been activated to  Key West for the Cuban Raft Crisis, to Savannah to assist with the  Olympic sailing security, to Charleston for Operation Iraqi Freedom,  and to Savannah again for 9/11 and to help assist with the G8 summit  security.   This year, Commander Salter was chosen as part of a select group to  help with COVID-19 response in Miami. I can't thank her enough for her  steadfast commitment to serving our country and countless Americans,  and I wish her the best in her new position.                            ____________________
