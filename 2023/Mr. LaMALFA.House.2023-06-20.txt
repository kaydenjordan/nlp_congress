 Mr. Speaker, open borders make a mockery of our Nation's  sovereignty. Democrats have decided to incentivize a flood of illegal  immigrants over the southern and northern borders with their open  border policies.   Every State and every town has effectively been turned into a border  State or border town with all the problems and crime that come with  this problem. Because Democrats seem to care more about the promoting  of illegal immigration than the needs of American citizens, they  prioritize the well-being of the former over the latter.   Illegal immigrants in Democrat States and cities are provided with  everything from free iPhones to healthcare. A contentious point in the  last Democrat Presidential primary was who could provide more free  healthcare to the most illegal immigrants. They are now going so far as  to use our kids' elementary and secondary school facilities to provide  shelter for illegal immigrants.   This is madness. American schools should be used for educating kids,  not for a made-up crisis that has been created by this lack of  leadership.   House Republicans wholeheartedly oppose the hijacking of our American  resources for the benefit of the people who have broken our laws and  violated our Nation's sovereignty. We must pass H. Res. 461, which  condemns the use of elementary and secondary schools to provide shelter  for those who are here illegally, and who are not here playing by the  rules.   Our borders must be protected. We cannot discard this just for some  short-term political gain.                            ____________________
