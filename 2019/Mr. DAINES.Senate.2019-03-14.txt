 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Sean O'Donnell and Ivanna Fritz of Flathead County for  their recent induction into the Montana Forensic Educations Association  Coaches Hall of Fame.   Sean O'Donnell, a lifelong Montanan has spent the majority of his  life in Kalispell, MT. Mr. O'Donnell attended Carrol College in Helena,  MT, and it was here that Sean fell in love with coaching high school  speech and debate. After graduation, he went back to Kalispell to teach  and went on to join the Flathead coaching staff in 1992. Over the past  22 years, Mr. O'Donnell has gone on to win 10 State championships, as  well as winning Class AA coach of the year twice.   Ivanna Fritz, from eastern Montana, fell in love with speech and  debate in college, which she took as a requirement for a communication  degree. Ms. Fritz then went on to coach high school speech in debate,  joining the Flathead coaching staff in 1995, until taking up a teaching  position at Glacier High School in 2007, where she teaches and coaches  today. Ivanna has won a total of 13 State championships, along with  winning Class AA coach of the year.   I congratulate Sean O'Donnell and Ivanna Fritz, for their remarkable  journey of 20 years of teaching and coaching in Flathead County. I look  forward to seeing their continued success.                            ____________________
