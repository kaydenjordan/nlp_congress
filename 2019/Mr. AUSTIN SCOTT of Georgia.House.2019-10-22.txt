 Madam Speaker, House Democrats and the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee seem to think that  impeachment is nothing but a game. If you can't beat him, cheat him.   On September 26, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  fabricated and read on the record during a committee hearing a fake  call transcript between the President of the United States and a  foreign leader, while keeping the actual transcript of the call in a  vault.   Now, he continues to conduct an impeachment inquiry against the  President in complete secrecy with no vote of the House of  Representatives, leaving the American people and most Members of this  body in complete darkness.   What we have here is that good old case of a game created by  illusion. If you can't beat him, cheat him, and game show host Chairman  Adam Schiff is at the lead.   Behind door number one, we had the Mueller investigation, which found  there was no collusion between the President's campaign and Russia.   Behind door number two was the call between President Trump and  Ukrainian President Zelensky. Again, the transcript released by the  White House shows no quid pro quo, which stemmed from a whistleblower  complaint Chairman Schiff orchestrated with in advance and advised the  whistleblower how to proceed.   What is behind door number three? Nobody knows. But this sham attack  on our democracy must be stopped.                            ____________________
