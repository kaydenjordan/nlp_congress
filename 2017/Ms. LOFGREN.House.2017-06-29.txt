 Mr. Speaker, this Saturday marks the 2-year anniversary  of the death of Kate Steinle, which was a tragedy for her family and  for our entire community. My colleague from California has mentioned  the murder of Officers Davis and Oliver, something that shook our  northern California community.   These things are terrible, and I think we can agree that every Member  of this House objects to, mourns, and is tremendously distressed and  opposed to these criminal acts. But H.R. 3004 is not the solution to  prevent such tragedies.   The bill expands criminal sentences for illegal reentry offenses,  but, as has been mentioned by the ranking member of the Rules  Committee, the person charged in connection with Kate's death--I  believe he is, in fact, the murderer--spent over 16 years in Federal  prison. He was repeatedly deported. It didn't prevent his crime.   I think it is important to recall that we are not here writing bumper  stickers. We are here writing laws. So we need to examine what is the  current law and what is the proposal to change the current law.   The discussion I have heard seems to assume that there are no harsh  penalties in law for people who reenter without inspection. Nothing  could be further from the truth. Right now, there is a felony provision  for attempts to reenter. There are criminal penalties for reentry of  certain removed aliens. For example, if you are removed subsequent to a  conviction for a commission of three or more misdemeanors involving  drugs, crimes against a person, or both, or a felony, there is a 10- year sentence. If you are removed subsequent to commission of an  aggravated felony, it is a 20-year sentence, and on and on.   What does the bill do? It, for example, changes the 20-year sentence  to a 25-year sentence. Well, you can argue whether that is wise or  unwise. I personally think whether it is 20 or 25 is not going to be  the major difference for a heinous criminal.   It also expands the definition of the misdemeanors that must be  committed to entail these tremendous penalties. Right now, I mentioned  it is penalties involving violence or drugs. This would just be garden- variety misdemeanors. If you were driving without a license, if you  were loitering, that would count for the 10 years in Federal prison.   I don't think that those provisions are likely to make a material  difference in the kinds of crimes that we all abhor, but there is  something else that is in this bill that I think needs to be attended  to. The bill's sponsor claims this targets immigrants with criminal  convictions, but the reality is the bill mostly affects other people.   The bill, for the first time, would make it a criminal offense for an  individual who was previously denied admission or ordered removed to  seek to reenter the country legally, even if the individual has no  criminal history, no history of repeated reentries. The bill does this  by adding a definition to the term ``crosses the border'' that includes  those who enter the country in ``official restraint.''    This small change means it would be a felony for a person who has  been previously denied admission or previously removed to present  themselves at a port of entry to request asylum, parole, admission, or  another form of entry consistent with immigration laws. This is a  drastic departure from current law.   Under current law, an individual can be prosecuted for illegal entry  if they are trying to evade or intend to evade detection. If they are  trying to sneak in, they get caught, we charge them with a crime. An  individual who comes to a port of entry and voluntarily presents  herself to an immigration officer to ask permission to enter the  country legally has not committed a crime. This bill would change that.   Think about that for a minute. The bill makes it a crime to come to a  port of entry not with the intent to enter the U.S. illegally, but to  ask for a form of entry provided by the immigration laws.  [[Page H5311]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    In other words, this bill makes it a crime for someone  to try to reenter legally.   If you are a victim of human trafficking and come to a port of entry  to seek protection and, ultimately, a T visa, which the law allows, you  would commit a crime under this bill. If your U.S. citizen relative is  critically injured and you show up at the port to ask for humanitarian  parole so you can donate blood or an organ to your U.S. citizen  relative, you have committed a crime. In each of these cases, you can  be prosecuted and put in jail for up to 2 years, even if you ultimately  win your immigration case.   I also want to make a point about some of the other types of people  this bill would affect.   According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, at least half of all the  individuals convicted of illegal entry under the current statute, which  is the most common Federal prosecution in law today, were coming to  reunite with their family in the United States. Half of them had at  least one child living in the U.S. Two-thirds of the offenders had  other family members--a spouse or others--they were trying to get back  to.   So, in addition to the people who are trying to enter legally, this  bill massively increases penalties on people who are trying to get back  to their families, many of whom are U.S. citizens.   The desperation of these broken families is a direct result of our  failed immigration policy. Hundreds of thousands of immigrant parents  have been deported over the years, leaving their U.S. citizen children  as orphans in the United States. These parents--and I understand it-- are trying to get back to their kids.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again  expired.    We may think that is a good thing or a bad thing, but we  don't think that it is a crime to love your child and want to get back  to that child.   The desperation that these families feel is a direct result of our  inability to create a top-to-bottom reform of our immigration laws that  allows families to be united, allows the economy to meet its needs,  allows the crops to be picked legally. We have created this problem by  failing to enforce our laws.   This bill doesn't solve the crime problem that we all care about. It  creates new problems. It is not the answer to the terrible offenses  that are at the name of it. In fact, those terrible crimes seem to me  to be merely an excuse to expand deportation for the many, many people  whose only offense is wanting to be near their families.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't about fixing our  immigration system. In fact, it makes the system more dysfunctional and  puts communities in peril. This bill is about telling communities how  to police themselves and protect their people. It says: We here in D.C.  know better than you do, local police, across the United States.    Now, 600 or more local governments engaged in what they call  community trust policies. These policies promote, among other things,  allowing immigrant victims and witnesses to crime to report these  offenses to local authorities without fear of immigration consequences.  Years of locally informed experience have proven that this approach  best ensures these communities' safety.   I think that is why we have received communications from the National  Fraternal Order of Police in opposition to this bill, from the Law  Enforcement Task Force--that is 36 sheriffs and chiefs across the  country--in opposition to this bill, from the Major County Sheriffs of  America in opposition to this bill, from the National Task Force to End  Sexual and Domestic Violence against this bill, as well as the U.S.  Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the National  Association of Counties.   ICE is not prohibited from doing their job, but as the San Jose  Police Department has told me, San Jose police are not enforcing the  securities laws, they are not enforcing the Federal tax laws, and they  are not enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. They are  doing their job to protect their community against crime.   Now, because they are doing that, the threat is to remove funding  from jurisdictions.   Now, what would that funding be?   It is grants against violent gangs. It is grants for the Anti-Heroin  Task Force and the Anti-Methamphetamine Program, grants on port  security to  [[Page H5320]]  prevent terrorists from getting into the United States, and grants for  the BioWatch Program to prevent terrorists from getting biohazards and  killing us all.   That is not smart to take those programs away from local governments  that are working with us to help keep America safe.   Now, I always think, as I said earlier, we are not doing bumper  stickers here. We are doing laws. It is important to take a look at the  details of what is in this proposed bill. In addition to banning  collaborative grants with localities, the remedies it has made  available is if a community has a community trust policy, the  Department of Homeland Security can refuse to honor warrants--legal  warrants--that are issued by that jurisdiction.   That is astonishing. That is simply astonishing because what the  local governments have said on the detainer policies is that the Fourth  Amendment prevents them from holding people whose sentences have been  served. In fact, there are a number of Federal courts that have made  that determination, you can't hold somebody on a civil detainer request  without violating the Fourth Amendment.   There is a remedy to that: get a warrant like anybody else. The  Fourth Amendment means something, and there is a remedy. Go get a  warrant. I don't know why our Federal Government feels that they can  upend constitutional law for their own convenience.   Now, there is a provision in this bill that I find shocking. What it  says is that if local governments violate the law--violate a court  order--that they cannot violate the Fourth Amendment, that they are  immunized, the Federal Government is going to pay, go ahead and violate  the law. I cannot remember a time when we had a bill before us that  said to States and localities: go ahead, violate the law because we are  going to indemnify you for the violation.   That is not the way our Federal system should work, and it is not the  way those of us who believe in our oath of office to support and defend  the Constitution of the United States think that things ought to work.   Now, finally, it creates something that I think is truly astonishing:  a private cause of action against a State or locality if because the  detainer cannot be honored because of the Federal Court cases and a  person is released and, for any reason, commits a crime that it is the  locality that bears the cost, not the criminal. This is a crazy  provision.   We should oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  National Fraternal Order of Police; Law Enforcement Immigration Task  Force; National League of Cities; U.S. Conference of Mayors; and the  National Association of Counties in opposition to this bill.   [[Page H5326]]            National Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, 27 June 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any       amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law       enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or       resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an       effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The       House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and       Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance       Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered       by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.        The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly       believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should       cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,       withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--      which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety       efforts.        Local police departments answer to local civilian       government and it is the local government which enacts       statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement       officers have no more say in these matters than any other       citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be       argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to       pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out       lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the       civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to       penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because       Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with       respect to our nation's immigration laws.        The FOP issued a statement in January of this year       regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary       cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The       President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law       enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the       political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S.       Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the       public safety impact without an automatic suspension from       Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is       no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's       existing policy.        The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,       which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and       we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce       or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for       local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect       policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find       another way to do so.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R.       3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to       find a better way to improve public safety in our       communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior       Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any       further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                                     Law Enforcement                                          Immigration Task Force,                                                      June 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: As law enforcement leaders       dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our       communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals       that would attempt to impose punitive, ``one-size-fits-all''       policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than       strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us       with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of       our communities, these proposals would represent a step       backwards.        Attempts to defund so-called sanctuary cities regularly       sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in       well-established community policing practices or adhere to       federal court decisions that have found federal immigration       detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose       these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage--      rather than compel--law enforcement agency cooperation within       our federal system.        We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners.       Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and       constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are       not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even       though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful,       some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce       them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would       reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions       and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still       require our agencies and officers carry out federal       directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we       are sworn to follow.        Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal       responsibility. Making our communities safer means better       defining roles and improving relationships between local law       enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in       attempting to defund ``sanctuary cities'' and require state       and local law enforcement agencies. Local control has been a       beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades--having       the federal government compel state and local law enforcement       to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines       the delicate federal balance and will harm locally-based       policing.        Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement       agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement       activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the       broken immigration system to allow state and local law       enforcement to focus their resources on true threats--      dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe       that state and local law enforcement must work together with       federal authorities to protect our communities and that we       can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of       immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the       removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the       health and well-being of communities across the nation would       not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of       our broken immigraton system.        Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of       a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what       our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative       solution--broad-based immigration reform.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the 19,000 cities and       towns represented by the National League of Cities (NLC), I       am writing to express our strong opposition to the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003). The bill, which       was made public just recently, completely bypassed the House       Judiciary Committee and includes provisions that will result       in violations of due process and the Fourth and Tenth       Amendments to the Constitution.        We are very troubled by the fact that the bill--which       preempts local authority, jeopardizes public safety, and       exposes local governments to litigation and potential       liability--was drafted with no input from local officials.        NLC has consistently opposed federal legislation that would       impose harmful sanctions on local governments--sanctions that       prohibit or restrict compliance when a detainer request is       issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration       and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Specifically, NLC has       significant concerns with the provisions in H.R. 3003 that:        1. Undermine local government's authority to govern their       public safety and local law enforcement programs. The bill       would prevent localities from establishing laws or policies       that prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. H.R. 3003       would strip local governments ability to enact common-sense       crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will       seek protection and report crimes.        2. Penalize local governments that fail to comply with       federal immigration efforts with the denial of federal       funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug       treatment, and crime victim initiatives, including the State       Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented       Policing Services (COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide       hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide.  [[Page H5327]]             3. Compel local governments to honor Immigration and       Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests, even though the       federal courts have determined the that ICE use of detainers       violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be       held liable for honoring them.        4. Expand ICE's detainer authority requiring localities to       hold undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours, which is       twice what is currently allowed even if probable cause has       not been shown. The bill also does not provide any additional       funding to local governments to cover the costs associated       with detaining the undocumented immigrants. Requiring cities       to shoulder the financial burden being forced upon them with       no input impacts our ability to pay for essential       infrastructure and services such as roads, schools and       libraries.        5. Create a ``private right of action'' that would allow       crime victims or their family members to sue localities if       the crime was committed by someone who was released by the       locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. This       provision could allow frivolous lawsuits against a local       government by anyone who alleges that they were a victim of a       crime committed by an immigrant.        6. Compel local governments to utilize their local law       enforcement resources to implement federal civil immigration       enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment's       ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment does not       permit the federal government to force counties and cities to       allocate local resources, including police officers,       technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration       law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from       localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the       programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal       program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature.        Since the inception of the United States of America, lawful       immigrants and refugees have played a vital role in the       civic, economic and social life of cities. We recognize that       local governments address issues associated with federal       immigration laws in a variety of ways that best meet the       needs of all their residents. Some cities provide greater       leniency towards undocumented immigrants who do not violate       state and local laws by not dedicating municipal resources to       enforce federal immigration laws. Unfortunately, these cities       are wrongfully characterized as safe havens for undocumented       immigrants who violate state and local laws.        We believe the power to enforce federal immigration laws       remains exclusively a federal power and we strongly oppose       federal efforts to commandeer our local law enforcement to       take on the duties of federal immigration enforcement agents.        Our nation's local elected officials call on you to do the       right thing and vote against H.R. 3003 when it is considered       on the floor. We urge you to move beyond punitive bills like       H.R. 3003 and work with us to develop a positive legislation       that will fix our broken immigration system and make our       cities safer.        Thank you for your leadership and for willingness to stand       up for America's cities by voting against this legislation       that would impose harmful sanctions on local governments.            Sincerely,      Matt Zone,        President, National League of Cities, Ward 15 Councilman.                                   ____                                        The United States Conference                                                       of Mayors,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: I write to register the strong       opposition of the nation's mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan       bill that seeks to punish so-called ``sanctuary cities,''       which is expected to be considered by the full House this       week.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a       thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we       concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of       Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on       previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in       this bill. Specifically, the nation's mayors:        urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that       attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to       ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that       violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United       States citizens and immigrant populations, and further       criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of       immigrant;        oppose punitive policies that limit local control and       discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the       Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that       recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources       and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and       the safety of our communities;        oppose federal policies that commandeer local law       enforcement or require local authorities to violate, or be       placed at risk of violating, a person's Fourth Amendment       rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration       agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities       beyond what is determined by local policy.        H.R. 3003 would do all of these things and more:        It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical       public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their       police officers not to ask an individual their immigration       status. Many departments have such policies to encourage       crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build       trust with immigrant communities.        It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an       individual's Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable       cause standards for ICE's issuance of detainers that do not       require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous       federal courts have found that continued detention under an       ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for       a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining       officer or jurisdiction to civil liability.        While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions       which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any       suits filed against them, they would still be subject to       Fourth Amendment challenges.        Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain       enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and       cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not       comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents       and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety,       preempt local authority, and expose local governments to       litigation and potential findings of damages. America's       mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against       H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on       positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration       system and make our cities safer. The nation's mayors pledge       to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation       that will fix our nation's broken immigration system. We need       to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an       immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and       our people.        To make our cities safer we urge you to consider       legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent       terrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities       Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America       safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between       communities and police, expand homeland security grants,       invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce       gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and       strengthen reentry services.

Landrieu,                                               Mayor of New Orleans,      President.                                   ____           Major County Sheriffs of America and National Association             of Counties,                                                     June 29, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker, Majority Leader McCarthy and       Representatives Pelosi and Hoyer: On behalf of the Major       County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) and the National       Association of Counties (NACo), we write to express our       commitment to work with Congress and the Administration on       measures to prevent crime and violence, but are concerned       that H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is not an       effective approach. While we applaud measures to protect the       public from repeat, violent predators, we cannot support       further cuts in funding that weaken crime prevention efforts,       officer recruitment, and safety and wellness programs.        Most sheriffs want to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and       Customs Enforcement (ICE) so that it may remove criminal       illegal aliens from the United States, but sheriffs must       follow the law that has rendered current ICE requests       illegal. Without proper arrest authority, sheriffs cannot       willfully disregard an individual's 4th amendment rights as       articulated in these court cases. Make no mistake, the       American public has a right to know which jurisdictions are       blatantly ignoring the rule of law and are endangering       community safety and they should be held accountable. If a       jurisdiction is following the law of its state or a binding       court ruling, it is misguided for Congress to cut funding for       programs that support State and local law enforcement       agencies in nearly every jurisdiction in this country.        ICE's removal of illegal aliens who are committing crimes       in our communities is important to ensure public safety.       Their removal mitigates the drain on sheriffs' resources by       ensuring these criminals are not sitting in our jails and       that our deputies are not continually investigating their       crimes. As leaders in law enforcement, the MCSA been working       collaboratively with the Department of Homeland Security to       find an agreeable solution that is lawful, effects good       public safety policy, and allows ICE to effectively do its       job of removing criminal illegal aliens from our country.        We know Members of Congress believe that efforts to stop       violence in American cities  [[Page H5328]]       must be strengthened, not weakened. While we appreciate       Congress' support for law enforcement, we strongly feel a law       enforcement grant penalty solution would not only negatively       impact law enforcement efforts across the country, but also       not achieve its intended purpose.      Very Respectfully,      Michael J. Bouchard,        Sheriff, Oakland County (MI), Vice President--Government       Affairs, Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA).      Matthew D. Chase,        Executive Director, National Association of Counties       (NACo).     Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to reflect back on  why localities adopt these community trust policies.   The chairman of the committee mentioned somebody in San Francisco who  is suing the city. In a way, that shows the efficacy of the trust  policies.   This man, Mr. Figueroa-Zarceno, was a victim of crime. His truck was  stolen. He went into the police department to report that his truck was  stolen. There was a removal order that was 10 or 20 years old. He has  an American citizen child. He is a working person. When he went  outside, he was picked up by ICE.   I think what that tells other people who are victims of crime who  might have an outstanding removal order is: Don't report the crime. It  is one thing if you have lost your truck. It has been stolen.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Not that I am for stealing trucks, but here is a bigger  problem.   The cities of Houston and Los Angeles report a dramatic drop-off in  reports of sexual violence. Why? Because immigrants are afraid to  report; and not just because they might be undocumented, but they might  have a sister or a next-door neighbor or a spouse who is undocumented,  even if they are a citizen. So what has happened is with these threats  come an unwillingness of immigrants to report crime, to be witnesses to  crime, to keep our communities safe.   These stories that we have heard of the victims of crime are  heartbreaking, but we are not without remedies under current law.   The most important law in our country is the Constitution. The  Constitution includes the Fourth Amendment.                                time  1515    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again  expired.    The Constitution is the most important law we have. We  read it aloud on the first day of our Congress. It includes the Fourth  Amendment, which requires probable cause and warrants. A bunch of  courts have made that ruling relative to detainers.   Well, that doesn't leave the Federal Government without remedies. Get  a warrant. There is not a jurisdiction in the United States that will  not honor a judicial warrant. Don't blame the local police. Look to the  Department of Homeland Security for why they have dropped the ball and  been unwilling to take the steps that are well within their authority  today to make sure if there is someone that they need, they get a  warrant and they obtain that person for whatever is the next step in  their process.   To somehow suggest that this misguided bill is the answer is a big  mistake.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  additional letters in opposition to H.R. 3003. These are additional  letters of opposition that I mentioned earlier on H.R. 3003.                                                      June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.        We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,      Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.      Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD.,        President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                                         National Task Force to End,                                    Sexual and Domestic Violence,                                                      June 27, 2017.        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations       advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence       victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the       country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence       receive the protections they deserve, write to express our       deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, or ``Kate's       Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual       assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on       communities at large.        This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan       Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was       first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant       victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors       and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into       danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically,       the nation's leading national organizations that address       domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004       because:        Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing       community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine       the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA       and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant       victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.       Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that       supports local community policing and sustains community       trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs       contrary to community policing efforts and will deter       immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not       only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for       themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not       require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant       victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in       the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.        Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.       Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law       enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement       (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating       trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,       which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and       traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a       tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to       call the police because of fear of deportation, they become       more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the       individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear       of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting       violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,       dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.        As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes       often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they       will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting       the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will only       exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be       able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S.       Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim       advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by       immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help       from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and       attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs       indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened       fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78       percent of advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are       describing fear of contacting the police; 75 percent  [[Page H5330]]       of them reporting that victims are afraid of going to court;       and 43 percent reporting working with immigrant victims who       are choosing not to move forward with criminal charges or       obtaining protective orders.        In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie       Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among       Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to       concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.       According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have       dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since       the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop       among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse       among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas       the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston       Police Department reported in April that the number of       Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.       In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that       some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in       court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had       dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers       will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and       Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having       trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain       public safety and prosecute crime.        H.R. 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire communities.        H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional       guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not       supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers       more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which       do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional       mandates as ``sanctuary'' policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal       grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       other federal grants related to law enforcement or       immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit       analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would,       ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to       combat and prevent crime in their communities.        In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources       being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from       enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,       including those protecting victims of domestic violence,       sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and       prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violaters.        H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims.        By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding       criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will       have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of       human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are       often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition       of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when       police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may       be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be       wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English       better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural       barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the       survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor       faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty       (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in       order to be released from jail and reunited with her       children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often       arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.       These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly       to be reunited with their children following their arrests or       pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal       counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of       criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will       likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused       victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of       domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003       imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3004 imposes       expanded bases for detention without consideration of       mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these       victims.        In addition, H.R. 3004 expands the criminal consequences       for re-entry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling       humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been       previously removed return for their safety. Victims of       domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence       in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking       protection from harm. In recent years, women and children       fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and       Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.       Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal       representation, they are unable to establish their       eligibility for legal protections in the United States,       resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of       domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking       in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims       subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect       themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and       sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their       abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from       obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with       some victims having to leave their children behind in the       custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004,       these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for       attempting to protect themselves and their children.        On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,       sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human       trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote       against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit       of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law       enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for       public safety in general, and particularly essential for       domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.            Sincerely,        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (www.4vawa.org).                                   ____                                                      June 28, 2017.      Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,           and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned       local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-      based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R.       3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public       safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and       its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and       incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly       needed law enforcement funding for state and local       jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,       and unnecessarily expands the government's detention       apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal       government's ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for       immigration-based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian       protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on       the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration       violations.        Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or       ordinances that disentangle their state and local law       enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.       The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to       attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do       not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and       local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Ameniment of the       U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally       infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,       including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       any other federal grant related to law enforcement or       immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding       federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely       runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on       commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law       professors.        ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public       safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of       crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local       law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have       repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that       community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public       safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime       and more economic development than similarly situated non-      ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed       federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the       ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the       public safety needs of their communities.        Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the       immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for       immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation       Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with       employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under       Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes       immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical       measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,       wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished       thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the       United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.       We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry       would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison       population, and cost billions of dollars.        Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only       legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just       immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to       citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring       Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation       programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation       that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic       processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns       represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to       enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of       the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 414, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. The bill  is part of a larger mass deportation bill marked up by the House  Judiciary Committee earlier this month. I think the message it is  intended to convey is that this bill is needed to keep us safe.   We have heard the sad story of the murder of Kate Steinle, which was  not news to any of us in northern California. That was a horrible  murder, and the fact is, this bill would not have prevented that  murder. The offender had been deported multiple times. He had served 16  years in Federal prison, so the idea that the 10-year enhancement would  have somehow fixed this is just misplaced.   When we talk about the bill, it is as if we don't have harsh  penalties now for misbehavior in the law. If you take a look at the  enhancements, it expands criminal sentences for individuals who reenter  the country after removal. We already have very strong penalties  against that.   To say that this bill will keep us safe because, for example, we have  a 20-year--under current law, a 20-year sentence for a conviction for  an aggravated felony, this would raise it to 25; I don't think that is  going to fix this problem. If it were only that, we could have a  discussion which, unfortunately, we never did on a bipartisan basis.   The bill does other things that are very damaging. It actually makes  it a felony, punishable by up to 2 years, to attempt to reenter the  country legally, in full compliance with our immigration laws; and this  is true for individuals who have no criminal background whatsoever.   Now, the sponsors of the bill may argue that is necessary, but I have  seen no rationale for why that would make any sense, nor why it would  certainly not have prevented the tragic murder of Kate Steinle.   Now, let's give some examples of who that could apply to. You have  individuals who have lived here, we have met them, DREAMers, people who  have been here all their lives, brought over as children, who were  removed. If that person who has been removed becomes a victim of sex  trafficking, the process is this: They can come and seek asylum. They  can flee from their traffickers. And if they present themselves to our  port of entry today, they are not trying to evade detection. No, they  are trying to be found. They are turning themselves in, saying: I am  fleeing from the sex traffickers; I want to make a claim for asylum; I  need to be kept safe from the sex traffickers. This bill would make  that act a felony.   Now, the chairman has said how wonderful it is that we have created  an affirmative defense in the act. What he has neglected to mention is  that right now we don't need an affirmative defense because it is not a  crime to go to the port of entry and seek a benefit, either  humanitarian parole for a purpose that is sometimes granted to travel  if a member of your family is dying, to provide an organ donation to a  member, an American citizen, who is in the U.S. who is dying. That is  not a crime today, and you don't need an affirmative defense because it  is not a crime.   Now, I think the fact that it eliminates an important constitutional  provision is problematic. We all know we can't change the Constitution  by statute. The case of U.S. v. Mendoza-Lopez basically says this: If  you are going to prosecute somebody for entry after removal, which  happens all the time--in fact, that is the single most prevalent  Federal prosecution in the system today; that is number one--you have  to--and you did not have an opportunity to actually contest the first  removal because, for example, you were never notified at a hearing----   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Since that is an element of the offense, the Mendoza  case says you have to be able to at least collaterally attack that  because you never had a chance to do so initially. This eliminates that  constitutional case. You can't do that by statute.   So the point I am making is that the majority of those who enter the  United States without inspection are coming back to try and get next to  their families, their U.S. citizen kids, their U.S. citizen spouses.  They are not criminals. They are not creating any kind of crime.   We all oppose crime, but this remedy is unrelated to the horror  stories that we have heard.   You know, we are creating law here, not bumper stickers. I hope that  we will vote against this misplaced law and work together to solve the  real problems that we face.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in  opposition to this bill from the National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence, the CATO Institute, Church World Service, and the  ACLU.                                          National Task Force to End                                      Sexual & Domestic Violence,                                                      June 27, 2017.        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations       advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence       victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the       country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence       receive the protections they deserve, write to express our       deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, or ``Kate's       Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual       assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on       communities at large.        This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan       Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was       first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant       victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors       and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into       danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically,       the nation's leading national organizations that address       domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004       because:        Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing       community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine       the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA       and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant       victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.       Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that       supports local community policing and sustains community       trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs       contrary to community policing efforts and will deter       immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not       only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for       themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not       require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant       victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in       the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.        Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.       Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law       enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement       (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating       trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,       which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and       traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a       tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to       call the police because of fear of deportation, they become       more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the       individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear       of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting       violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,       dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.        As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes       often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they       will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting       the police and H.R. 3003 proposes to further intertwine       federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will       only exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators       will be able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and       U.S. Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim       advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by       immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help       from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and       attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs       indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened       fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of       advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing       fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that       victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting       working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move       forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders.        In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie       Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among       Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to       concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.       According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have       dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since       the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop       among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse       among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas       the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston       Police Department reported in April that the number of       Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.       In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that       some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in       court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had       dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers       will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and       Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having       trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain       public safety and prosecute crime?              H.R. 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire Communities         H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional       guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not       supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers       more than 600 jurisdictions  [[Page H5342]]       across the country, most of which do not characterize their       policies to follow constitutional mandates as ``sanctuary''       policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating       their access to various federal grants, including federal law       enforcement grants, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice       Assistance Grant Program, and other federal grants related to       law enforcement or immigration, such as those that fund       forensic rape kit analysis. Withholding federal law       enforcement funding would, ironically, undermine the ability       of local jurisdictions to combat and prevent crime in their       communities.        In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources       being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from       enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,       including those protecting victims of domestic violence,       sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and       prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violators.             H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims         By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding       criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will       have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of       human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are       often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition       of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when       police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may       be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be       wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English       better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural       barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the       survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor       faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty       (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in       order to be released from jail and reunited with her       children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often       arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.       These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly       to be reunited with their children following their arrests or       pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal       counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of       criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will       likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused       victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of       domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003       imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3004 imposes       expanded bases for detention without consideration of       mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these       victims.        In addition, H.R. 3004 expands the criminal consequences       for re-entry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling       humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been       previously removed return for their safety. Victims of       domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence       in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking       protection from harm. In recent years, women and children       fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and       Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.       Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal       representation, they are unable to establish their       eligibility for legal protections in the United States,       resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of       domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking       in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims       subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect       themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and       sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their       abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from       obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with       some victims having to leave their children behind in the       custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004,       these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for       attempting to protect themselves and their children.        On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,       sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human       trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote       against H.R. 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and       spirit of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law       enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for       public safety in general, and particularly essential for       domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.            Sincerely,      The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.                                   ____                          [From the CATO Institute]                  Kate's Law: A waste of Federal Resources                              (By David Bier)         The House of Representatives will vote on a bill this week       titled ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). While it is nominally an       ``immigration'' bill, its principal aim relates to criminal       justice--namely, an increase in the maximum sentences for       immigrants who reenter the country illegally after a       deportation. The bill is a waste of federal resources. It       would likely balloon America's population of nonviolent       prisoners, while not protecting Americans against serious       criminals.                    Kate's Law Would Not Have Helped Kate         The bill's namesake is Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old medical       sales rep killed in San Francisco in 2015. Her killer was       Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez who was in the country without       status after five removals. Proponents of this bill--      providing lengthier prison sentences for people who reenter       the country after a removal--believe that this would have       somehow helped Kate Steinle. This assertion cannot withstand       a moment's contact with the facts of the case, which I have       previously laid out in detail here.        After his last three apprehensions, the government       prosecuted Lopez-Sanchez for felony illegal reentry. He       served 15 years in federal prison in three five-year       increments. None of the facts of this case would have changed       if he had served those 15 years consecutively. Indeed,       because Lopez-Sanchez never actually made it across the       border without being caught since 1997, the only reason that       he ended up in San Francisco is because the Bureau of Prisons       inexplicably decided to ignore a request for transfer from       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Instead, it       shipped him to the city based on a 20-year-old marijuana       charge--an offense no longer even exists in the city. Thus,       deterrence against reentry has no relevance whatsoever to       this case.                         The Provisions of Kate's Law         This legislation introduced by House Judiciary Committee       Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) should not be confused with       other bills of the same name introduced in the House and the       Senate by Rep. Steve King (R-IA) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX),       respectively. The entire purpose of the prior iterations of       ``Kate's Law'' was to create mandatory minimum sentences for       crossing the border illegally after a removal. Indeed, the       alternate title for the bills was the ``Establishing       Mandatory Minimums for Illegal Reentry Act.'' This new Kate's       Law, however, mercifully contains no mandatory minimum       sentences--a sign that criminal justice reformers' criticisms       of them (including Cato's) have started to penetrate the       mainstream.        But the purpose of the law in the broader sense remains:       trying to lock up more immigrants for longer periods. Most of       the actual text comes from section 3705 of the Senate       comprehensive immigration reform bill (S. 744) passed in June       2013, but the Kate's Law authors have added several odious       provisions. The heart of the bill would create a new 10-year       maximum sentence for any person removed or denied entry more       than two times who reenters. The current maximum for regular       reentry is just 2 years. It would increase the maximum       sentences for people who reenter after being convicted of       various criminal offenses--including for immigration       offenses--to up to 25 years.        Kate's Law deletes two important provisions from the 5.744       language that would have protected from prosecution non-felon       juveniles (p. 772-73) and humanitarian groups that provide       immigrants caught in deserts or mountains food, water, or       transportation to safety, which are sometimes the target of       the ``aiding and abetting'' statutes (p. 774). Kate's Law       would also prohibit challenging the legality or validity of a       prior removal order, which is a common defense in these       cases. If the earlier removal was not valid, as in at least       one case where a U.S. citizen was deported, it should not be       the basis of prosecution.        Kate's Law also would allow for prosecutions of immigrants       who attempt to enter the United States unsuccessfully. Under       current judicial interpretation, an alien must be ``free from       official restraint''--that is, not in the custody or control       of a government official. The 9th Circuit has interpreted to       include even chases along the border. Thus, the bill would       significantly expand the number of people eligible for       prosecution for the criminal reentry statute.                Kate's Law Would Further Over-Criminalization         The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimated that the original       mandatory minimums version of Kate's Law would increase the       federal prison population by almost 60,000 in 5 years--a       massive 30 percent increase in the total federal prison       population. Unfortunately, the House is moving this new       version--revealed late last week--without an estimate of       either its financial impact or its impact on the federal       prison population. But the law would likely completely       reverse the recent 5 percent decline in the federal prison       population, the first reduction since the 1970s.        Immigration offenses are already the top reason for a       federal arrest, composing half. of all federal criminal       arrests up, a share that has doubled since 2004. From 1998 to       2010, 56 percent of all federal prison admissions were for       immigration crimes. Locking up immigrants requires taxpayers       to pay to watch, house, clothe, and feed them, and unlike       U.S. citizens who are released into the interior, their       incarceration does not prevent other U.S. residents from       being exposed their criminal behavior (assuming illegal       crossing is a concern in that regard).        While naturally locking people up has some deterrent effect       on future crossing, Border Patrol doesn't bother to keep good       data on this impact compared to its other efforts. Given the       costs of incarceration--both to the person incarcerated and       to the U.S. taxpayer--this seems like a critical insight. In       any case, if Congress was serious about discouraging illegal       immigration, it would make legal immigration significantly       easier. As I have shown, the availability of work permits has       a major impact on illegal immigration.  [[Page H5343]]         It's not clear that the motivation for Kate's Law is       reducing illegal immigration per se, but rather the belief       that illegal immigrants are more likely to commit serious       crimes and so should be singled out. Yet as my colleagues'       recent paper demonstrates, illegal immigrants are much less       likely to end up behind bars than U.S.-born citizens. Because       unauthorized immigrants are required to serve sentences       before their removal, this is the best indication that they       are less likely to commit crimes that require jail time.        In the end, Kate's Law is an improvement on its prior       versions, but still an unjustifiable use of federal       resources.    CWS Statement to Opposing H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals                       Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law         As a 71-year old humanitarian organization representing 37       Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee       resettlement offices across the country, Church World Service       (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support the long-      standing efforts of law enforcement officials to foster       trusting relationships with the communities they protect and       serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of       violence that are too prevalent in this country, CWS       encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing       tragedies or conflating the actions of one person with an       entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and       oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and       H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.        H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target       more than 600+ cities, counties, and states across the       country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in       federal funding that local police use to promote public       safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies       that strengthen trust and cooperation between local law       enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all       residents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal       government should not hurt intentional, community-based       policing efforts that are vital in communities across the       country. Many cities have already recognized that requests by       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals       beyond their court-appointed sentences violate due process       and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This       bill would raise profound constitutional concerns by       prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE       detainer requests even when such compliance would violate       federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police       that refuse ICE detainer requests see an increase in public       safety due to improved trust from the community. It is       precisely this trust that enables community members to report       dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or       separated from their families. When local police comply with       ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because       victims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they       contact the police. This bill would also undermine local       criminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal warrants and       refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in       certain circumstances. This bill would reduce community       safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from       holding people accountable.        The United States already spends more than $18 billion on       immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal       law enforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate's Law,       would expand the federal government's ability to prosecute       individuals for ``illegal reentry'' and impose even more       severe penalties in these cases--even though prosecutions for       migration-related offenses already make up more than 50% of       all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill does not include       adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in       order to seek protection, which would place asylum seekers at       risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they       fled. We have seen how Border Patrol's current practices       violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by       preventing viable asylum claims from moving forward. DHS has       found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers       for criminal prosecution despite the fact that they have       expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was       released highlighting that many asylum seekers, who had       expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are       being turned away by CBP agents. New barriers to protection       are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations       under international and U.S. law.        Federal, state, and local policies that focus on       deportation do not reduce crime rates. Individuals are being       deported who present no risk to public safety and who are       long-standing community members, including parents of young       children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with       family, work, and make meaningful contributions that enrich       their communities. Several studies over the last century have       affirmed that all immigrants, regardless of nationality or       status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent       crimes. A recent report found a correlation between the       increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in       violent and property crime rates. Immigration is correlated       with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in       the unemployment rate, and immigrants have high       entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that       hire immigrant and U.S. citizen employees.        As communities of faith, we are united by principles of       compassion, stewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members       of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. What we need are       real solutions and immigration policies that treat our       neighbors with the dignity and respect that all people       deserve and affirm local law enforcement officers' efforts to       build trust with their communities.                                  American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act)           and H.R. 3004 (Kate's Law)        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the American Civil Liberties Union (``ACLU''), we submit this       letter to the House of Representatives to express our strong       opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,       and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.                  No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003)         H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC       Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'')       to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests       or risk losing federal funding. This is despite the fact that       an ``increasing number of federal court decisions'' have held       that ``detainer-based detention by state and local law       enforcement agencies violates the Fourth Amendment,'' as       recognized by former Department of Homeland Security       Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014.        Disturbingly, H.R. 3003 seeks to penalize the 600+       localities that abide by the Fourth Amendment. These       jurisdictions have recognized that by entangling local       authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration       detainers erode trust between immigrant communities and local       law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers       ultimately undermine public safety, as entire communities       become wary of seeking assistance from police and other       government authorities that are supposed to provide help in       times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with       unlawful detainer requests, H.R. 3003 will only make       communities less safe, not more.        H.R. 3003 would also amend Section 287 of the INA to allow       the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS'') to take custody       of a person being held under a detainer within 48 hours       (excluding weekends and holidays) ``but in no instance more       than 96 hours'' following the date that the individual would       otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again,       raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as the Supreme       Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial       finding of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. This       provision would disregard the Court's ruling entirely and       allow a local law enforcement agency to hold a person for up       to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention--and never       requiring the person be brought before a judge for a probable       cause hearing.        Protection against unreasonable detention by the government       is the bedrock of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which       provides that the government cannot hold anyone in jail       without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral       magistrate. This constitutional protection applies to       everyone in the United States--citizen and immigrant alike.        Immigration detainers, however, do not abide by these       standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses       to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and       state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a       written request from DHS to that local law enforcement       agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an       additional 48 hours after the person's release date, in order       to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to       take that person into custody for deportation purposes.        DHS's use of detainers to imprison people without due       process, without any charges pending, and without probable       cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth       Amendment protections. Policies that allow DHS to detain       people at-will are ripe for civil and human rights violations       and have resulted in widespread wrongful detentions,       including detentions of U.S. citizens. That is why many of       the 600+ localities targeted by H.R. 3003 have decided not to       execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is       accompanied by additional evidence, a determination of       probable cause, or a judicial warrant.        Unfortunately, H.R. 3003 does nothing to address the       fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS's use of       immigration detainers. Rather than fix the constitutional       problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill       perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices and       forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for       the constitutional violations which will inevitably result.       This is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling       taxpayers with the liability the federal government will       incur from Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end       the use of DHS's unconstitutional detainer requests.  [[Page H5344]]         H.R. 3003 violates the Due Process Clause by allowing DHS       to detain people indefinitely without a bond hearing.        Section 4 of H.R. 3003 radically expands our immigration       detention system by amending Section 236(c) of the INA to       authorize mandatory detention ``without time limitation.''       This empowers DHS to detain countless immigrants for as long       as it takes to conclude removal proceedings--even if that       takes years--without the basic due process of a bond hearing       to determine if their imprisonment is even justified. This is       a clear constitutional violation, as the federal courts have       overwhelmingly held that jailing immigrants for months and       years without bond hearings raises serious problems under the       Due Process Clause.        Although the bill claims to provide for the ``detention of       criminal aliens,'' it massively expands mandatory detention       to people with no criminal record whatsoever, including       immigrants who lack legal papers or who overstay a tourist       visa. The ``lock 'em up'' approach to immigration enforcement       is cruel, irrational, and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court       has permitted brief periods of mandatory detention only in       cases where individuals are charged with deportation based on       certain criminal convictions. The Court has not endorsed the       mandatory lock-up of people who have never committed a crime.                            Kate's Law (H.R. 3004)         H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands       America's federal prison population and lines the coffers of       private prison companies.        Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is       unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a       federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylum-      seekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to       migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to       public safety in returning to the U.S. to reunite with       children who need their care (individuals with children in       the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of       illegal reentry).        Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on       anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has       committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys' Offices       aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S.       Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for       52 percent of all federal prosecutions--surpassing drugs,       weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99       percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to       federal prison time.        H.R. 3004 would drastically expand America's prison       population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is       bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population.       It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks       on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme       Court's contrary ruling in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez.       Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main       consequence of border-crossing prosecutions, which the       Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of       Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent       support.        H.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration's mass       deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences       for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed       federal criminal-justice stakeholders; rather they represent       this administration's anti-immigrant obsession and would       expensively expand substandard private jail contracting       despite the life-threatening conditions in these facilities.        In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are fraught with       constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human       rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law       enforcement's ability to keep our communities safe, and would       balloon our federal prison population by financing private       prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach       to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to       balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep       their communities safe, Congress should end DHS's       unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional       deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer       requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so       that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond       hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison       individuals who are not a threat to public safety.

Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 6  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 9 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the things I think is worth addressing is the  provision of this bill that changes current law relative to unlawful  entry or attempted unlawful entry.   Under 8 U.S.C. 1326, this is a crime if the individual evaded  detection. This has been the principle in Federal law for more than 100  years. Since 1908, the Federal courts have recognized that illegal  entry and illegal reentry require entry free from something called  official restraint, otherwise known as detention.   Now, this bill would change that longstanding law. The bill amends  U.S.C. 1326 to make the physical act of crossing the border a crime for  any individual who has been previously removed or denied admission  regardless of whether the individual was ``free from official  restraint'' when doing so.   Now, why is this a problem?   As I mentioned earlier, individuals who, for one reason or another,  need to come into the United States go to a port of entry, and they ask  to see the Border Patrol agent. Under this law, that is a crime.   Now, let me give you some examples of what that would mean. I will  just talk about the case of Juliza, who was a Guatemalan-Indian woman.  She faced violent persecution really based on her ethnicity. She was  raped by family members who referred to her as a dirty Indian as they  assaulted her. As she went to report this assault to the police, she  was sexually propositioned by the officers.   After a family member threatened her with sexual violence and death,  she fled to the United States. She sought asylum, but she was promptly  deported--turned away--by the Customs and Border Patrol. Within a month  of returning to Guatemala, she was drugged, raped, and thrown into a  river. She fled to the United States for a second time and, once again,  was turned away without seeing an immigration judge or speaking to an  asylum officer.   Finally, the third time she came, her 8-year-old son had been  threatened by gang members, and she was finally allowed to make her  case and was granted asylum.                                time  1630    Or the case of Carla. In June of 2016, Carla, who was from Mexico,  and her children sought asylum after her father, son, grandfather, and  uncle were killed in a span of 7 days, targeting her family. She went  to the border to turn herself in. She was turned away by CBP agents  twice.   After the family sought assistance from an attorney, they went back  to the border, to the port of entry, and the CBP officers finally  processed them appropriately under American immigration law. This was  their third attempt. The U.S. immigration judge in Texas ruled that  they were indeed refugees and granted asylum.  [[Page H5351]]    Now, I raise these two cases because you think deported, if you are  turned away at the border, it counts for removal under the law. These  individuals would be felons under this bill.   Making Juliza and her 8-year-old son or Carla a felon does not save  an American from crime; it just doesn't. The two are not connected. And  so to think that this bill, which does such harm to asylum seekers, is  necessary to save Americans from threats is simply incorrect. It is  important to stand up for our long-term values in international law.   There are other ways that one could become a criminal by showing up  at the border. It is not uncommon that young people who have a valid  visa issued by a U.S. consulate or Embassy come. They fly into the  country and they are interviewed by a Customs and Border Patrol agent.   Now, if that person on the visitor visa is a 20-year-old young man  who is unmarried, doesn't have a job in the country he is from, doesn't  own a home, and is from kind of a poor country, it is not all that  uncommon for the Border Patrol agency to make a decision that that  person is not a good risk for entry, that they might overstay their  visa and not return home.   I am not questioning that exercise of judgment, but if that same  individual, 20 years later, is now a doctor and he has got a J visa to  come in and be a doctor in the middle of America where there is a  doctor shortage, he lands at Kennedy Airport with his visa to be a  doctor, that would be a felony.   So the point I am making is there is much in this bill that does  nothing about crime but to make criminals of people who have done  nothing wrong. That is one of the reasons why we should vote against  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  additional letter of opposition to H.R. 3004. This is a letter I  mentioned earlier on the bill.                                          National Immigrant Justice                                                          Center,                                                      June 27, 2017.    H.R. 3003 and 3004 Undermine American Values NIJC Opposes the ``No              Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' and ``Kate's Law''         This week the House of Representatives will vote on two       bills that attempt to re-write our nation's immigration laws       to reflect a dangerous philosophy of governance. For decades       now, elected officials across the bipartisan divide have       joined together calling for a compassionate and common sense       approach to immigration legislation. These bills move us       further away from that goal. H.R. 3003, ironically named the       ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' will endanger the safety       of our communities by forcing local police to abandon       community policing efforts and become a full partner with the       administration's massive deportation force. H.R. 3004, known       as ``Kate's Law,'' will result in the unnecessary       incarceration of countless immigrants for the mere act of       migration.        The National Immigrant Justice Center calls on elected       officials to reject such nonsensical and harmful legislation.       In the face of hateful rhetoric, now is the time to stand       with immigrant communities.    H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'', will further erode     community trust in local police and put our communities in danger         H.R. 3003 amends 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 to prohibit states and       localities from enacting policies that in any way limit       cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement       (ICE), even when federal courts have ruled such cooperation       unconstitutional.        The law would strip localities of vital discretion to enact       immigration-enforcement-related laws and policies that are       smart and effective for their communities. Specifically, it       prohibits localities from declining to comply with requests       from ICE to jail individuals under detainer requests even       when doing so will put them in blatant violation of binding       federal court orders. Our communities are safer when       residents feel safe calling for help and assisting police in       investigating and prosecuting cries. By effectively forcing       localities into the business of federal immigration law, this       law will preclude cities and counties from using their       limited local resources to address public safety concerns in       the ways they deem most appropriate and effective.        On top of the danger the bill poses to community safety,       this law arguably violates the ``anti-commandeering''       principle of the Tenth Amendment of the United States       Constitution.        H.R. 3003 punishes jurisdictions for engaging in smart       community policing.        The law would punish jurisdictions that choose to limit       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement by stripping       federal funding that fulfills vital law enforcement needs,       including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program       (SCAAP), the ``Cops on the Beat Program,'' the Byrne Justice       Assistance Grant Program, and any other grant administered by       the Departments of Justice or Homeland Security that are       deemed ``substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism,       national security, immigration, or naturalization.'' In       addition to running further afoul of the Tenth Amendment,       this law cruelly forces jurisdictions to choose between       maintaining critical funds, including  [[Page H5352]]       for community policing, or exposing themselves to the       significant legal and financial liability that accompany       compliance with detainer requests under the Fourth Amendment       and the Fourteenth Amendment.        H.R. 3003 upends the criminal justice system by permitting       and in some cases requiring ICE to ignore criminal warrants       issued by state and local jurisdictions that it deems in non-      compliance with other provisions of the bill.        H.R. 3003 vastly expands ICE's authority to force       localities to detain immigrants with no regard for the Fourth       Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and gives local actors       immunity for resulting constitutional violations.        The law makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment by giving       lip service to the notion of ``probable cause'' but in       reality allowing ICE to ask localities to detain immigrants       longer than they would otherwise be held simply on the basis       of a belief that the individual is removable from the United       States. The law then goes on to provide local actors immunity       for resulting constitutional violations. In practice, this       piece of the law essentially requires local actors to violate       the constitution and then gives them immunity for doing so.       It is legislative overreach at its worst.        H.R. 3003 demonizes immigrants by creating a new private       right of action for victims of crime solely on the basis of       the citizenship status of the perpetrator of the crime.        The law provides that an individual or surviving relative       can bring a lawsuit against a state or locality if the       perpetrator of the offense is a non-citizen and was released       from custody pursuant to a trust policy. This provision       allows the worst kind of scapegoating, manipulating       individual tragedies to demonize all immigrants.        H.R. 3003 expands the already damaging ``mandatory       detention'' provisions of immigration law, requiring no-bond       detention for large categories of undocumented individuals       for the duration of deportation proceedings against them.        The law thumbs its nose at the basic due process       protections of our United States Constitution, explicitly       approving of indefinite detention for individuals in       immigration custody regardless of their community ties to the       United States or necessity for detention. Specifically, the       law expands greatly the categories of immigrants who are       denied access to any individualized bond determination       throughout their time in immigration jail. With deaths in       immigration detention occurring with alarming frequency and       rates of representation in detention alarmingly low, these       provisions are nothing but cruel.      H.R. 3004, ``Kate's Law,'' will further the mass incarceration of   immigrants--including asylum seekers--by increasing penalties for the                           mere act of migration         H.R. 3004 expands the existing criminal offense of illegal       reentry to punish legitimate asylum seekers fleeing violence       in their countries of origin.        The law expands the category of individuals punishable by       section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to include       even those men and women who surrender themselves at the       southern border to seek protection in the United States.        H.R. 3004 senselessly expands sentencing enhancements for       illegal reentry at a time when more than half of all federal       prosecutions target migration-related offenses.        The law provides incredibly harsh sentencing enhancements       for individuals seeking to return to the United States after       a previous removal on the basis of prior convictions or       entries. Apart from the cruel and unnecessary use of federal       prison to separate families, this bill will prove exorbitant       in its costs at a time when taxpayers have already footed a       bill of more than $7 billion to incarcerate migrants for       migration-related offenses over the past decade.        H.R. 3004 punishes immigrants for illegal reentry even if       their previous deportation orders were unlawful and deprived       them of the opportunity to seek protection. This law entirely       prohibits defendants in illegal reentry cases from       challenging the validity of their prior deportation orders.       This provision is blatantly unconstitutional and in violation       of Supreme Court jurisprudence that protects against       punishing immigrants on the basis of legally defective       deportation orders. See U.S. v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828       (1987). This law will criminalize, for example, asylum       seekers who return to the United States after being       previously denied the opportunity to present their claims for       protection. Given the already anemic protections for asylum       seekers at our southern border, these provisions will       inevitably harm the most vulnerable among us.        A vote for H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 is a vote for hatred and       a vote against community safety. NIJC calls on Members of       Congress to stand on the right of history and oppose these       harmful measures.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 415, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    I am.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Lofgren moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3004 to the       Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the       same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:         Add, at the end of the bill, the following:       SEC. 3. PROTECTING VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.         Section 276 of such Act is further amended by adding at the       end the following:        ``(i) Protecting Victims of Trafficking.--It shall not be a       violation of this section for a victim of sex trafficking to       voluntarily present herself or himself at a port of entry to       request protection.''.    Mr. GOODLATTE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading of the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle insist that  today's bill is intended to keep Americans safe by enhancing penalties  for criminals who reenter illegally or attempt to do so. I am offering  an amendment that takes Republicans at their word.   This amendment would make clear that H.R. 3004 would not be used to  criminally prosecute and incarcerate sex trafficking victims merely for  seeking protection at ports of entry.   As should be evident at this stage of debate, the provisions of this  bill extend well beyond immigrants with criminal histories; in fact,  they reach many of the most vulnerable and persecuted members of  society. Perhaps most egregiously, H.R. 3004 authorizes, for the first  time, the prosecution of individuals who voluntarily present themselves  at points of entry to seek relief consistent with our immigration laws,  and that includes individuals seeking protection as victims of sex  trafficking.   Let's be clear on the law. Today, it is not a crime for an individual  who has been previously denied admission or removed to voluntarily  present herself at a port of entry seeking to reenter the country  legally. This bill changes that by making the simple act of going to  the port of entry, which itself requires the physical act of crossing  the border, a felony offense for such individuals.   These are not individuals attempting to evade immigration agents.  They are not trying to sneak into the United States. They are simply  exercising the right to lawfully approach a U.S. port of entry to seek  permission to enter.   Under this bill, the act of approaching CBP agents now becomes  criminally prosecutable as an illegal reentry. Anyone with a prior  removal order or even merely denied admission commits a crime by so  much as stepping into the port of entry.   I mentioned the two asylee seekers a few moments ago. These are  people who are fleeing danger and under our laws have the right to  present their cases. Now, H.R. 3004 would do this to the women I  mentioned: It would make them criminals, and it would allow for the  prosecution and imprisonment for up to 2 years.   Now, even if our immigration system awarded these victims protection,  such as a T visa for human trafficking, the criminal justice system  could take away her liberty.   I strongly hope that my colleagues across the aisle would not seek to  punish women who are fleeing from sex traffickers, because there are  thousands of women who are innocent, abused, sexually trafficked by the  worst of civilization, and instead of offering help to these women,  this bill would put them in prison. It would prosecute them for asking,  of all things, that their life be saved.   I mentioned earlier, we put in the Record, the opposition of the  Tahirih Justice Center to this bill. They advocate for victims of  trafficking and gender-based violence, and they oppose this bill with  all their strength. Here is what they say, and it is a quote: ``H.R.  3004 will punish women fleeing horrific abuse. . . . `'  [[Page H5353]]    Now, I disagree with some of the elements of this bill, and I have  tried to make clear why, but I take Mr. Goodlatte at his word that he  wants to make sure that we have a safe society. I think, if that is his  hope, we will make clear that sex trafficking victims are not going to  be prosecuted or considered criminals when they enter a port of entry  and present themselves to U.S. officials.   This amendment is the chance for Republicans to show that they really  are for the rule of law. It would stipulate that this bill would not  subject sex trafficking victims to criminal prosecution merely for  voluntarily presenting themselves at the border to request protection  from the unspeakable harm that they have suffered.   I will close with this. Years ago, we worked together on a bipartisan  basis to fight sex trafficking. We created the U and T visas. It was a  broad bipartisan coalition. I remember now Governor Sam Brownback and  others, people who are at other ends, opposite ends of the ideological  spectrum, but we came together to fight sex trafficking. We should do  the same thing today. Let's not forget that we can work together to do  the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
