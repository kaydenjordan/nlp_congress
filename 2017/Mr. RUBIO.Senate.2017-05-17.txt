 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about an  emerging crisis in our hemisphere in the nation of Venezuela. It has  been covered extensively in the press. I wanted to come today with an  update and a suggestion, a request of the administration about a step  we can take.   First of all, I am very pleased that today our Ambassador to the  United Nations, Nikki Haley, scheduled a discussion at the U.N.  Security Council with regard to Venezuela. It was not an open press  discussion. Again, it showed extraordinary leadership, and I thank her  for her work and for doing so. This deserves attention.   By the way, Venezuela is a country that is blessed with natural  resources. It was once Latin America's richest country, but today the  people of Venezuela are literally starving, its financial system has  collapsed, and there are, as you have seen from the press reports,  massive protests in the streets. Its once proud democracy is now in the  hands of a dictator, Nicolas Maduro, and his cronies and thugs, who  have plunged that nation into a constitutional crisis. They are using  violence and bloodshed to suppress and silence citizens speaking out  against the regime's corruption and its abuse of political prisoners.   What the people of Venezuela are calling for is pretty  straightforward: free and fair elections as called for under the  Constitution of that country, a return to representative democracy--the  democracy they once had. They are paying for these requests with their  blood and even their lives. According to the most recent reports,  dozens of people have been killed, including teenagers. The Washington  Post reported yesterday the recent deaths of 18-year-old Luis Alviarez,  who was killed by a bullet to the chest, and 17-year-old Yeison Mora  Cordero, who died from a bullet to the head.   There were two reports today in the press of great interest, one from  the New York Times and one from the Washington Post. Both documented  the plight of members of the national guard who have been tasked with  the job of suppressing the protests in the street. The gist of the  articles was this: These people who are putting on these uniforms--they  didn't sign up for this. They signed up for security. They signed up to  protect the people of Venezuela, not to oppress them.   They, too, are suffering from poor food. There was one article that  said that basically breakfast in the morning for the national guard in  Venezuela consists of a boiled carrot or a potato, and then they are  sent to the streets for hours. Then they come back and maybe have an  arepa, which is a corn cake, and, if they are lucky, some butter. They,  too, are suffering from this.   Here is the most enlightening part of this: A lot of their family  members--their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, loved ones,  husbands, wives, girlfriends, and boyfriends--are on the other side of  the protest lines. Their fellow Venezuelans are on the other side, and  they are being tasked to do this.   I just say to them: Remember what your oath was. To the members of  the national guard in Venezuela, remember that your job is to protect  the people of Venezuela, not to oppress them.   Beyond what we see there--the innocent people dying because of the  dictatorship trampling the will of the people and destroying their  democratic institutions--one of the specific things that Maduro has  done to become a dictator is he has undercut and frankly tried to wipe  out the authority of their National Assembly, which is their unicameral  legislative body. The way he has done that is by highjacking the  supreme court of the country, and they call it the Supreme Tribunal of  Justice. It is packed with puppets who do his bidding. As an example,  these puppets recently ruled that they would rescind the democratic  powers vested to the elected members of the National Assembly by the  constitution of that country. In essence, they ruled that the National  Assembly no longer had legislative authority. The protests were so  massive, even within the government, that they had to backtrack from  that ruling.   Here is what is interesting. This is a recent opinion piece written  by Francis Toro and Pedro Rosas in the Washington Post which said it  best: ``Beware Maikel Moreno, the hatchet man who runs Venezuela's  supreme court.''   Here is what they wrote:         Moreno, a former intelligence agent, was tried and       convicted of murder in 1987, though the corroborating       documents from the court system are no longer available. . .       . He spent just two years in jail before being released. He       was then immediately implicated in a second killing, in 1989,       for which he was charged but never tried.    He was a loyalist of Hugo Chavez, and he became a judge in the early  2000s. His ``career as a judge hit a snag in 2007,'' Toro and Rosas  note, ``when he was removed from the bench for `grave and inexcusable'  errors after releasing two murder suspects against orders from the  Supreme Tribunal. The government handed him a new job as a diplomat  abroad. After a few years out of sight, he was appointed a supreme  court justice in 2014.''   Then in 2017, Moreno--not once but twice a killer--was appointed the  chief justice of Venezuela's supreme court. The Venezuelan supreme  court is run by a murderer. Think about that. A convicted criminal is  presiding over Venezuela's supreme court. So it is no wonder that the  court's members have acted as a rubberstamp for Maduro's illegitimate  power grab, and they have created a political and a humanitarian  crisis.   Venezuelans, as I said, are struggling to get basic goods, like food  and medicine, and access to basic services. The Wall Street Journal  reported that Venezuelans have lost, on average, 19  [[Page S3002]]  pounds in the last year--not due to some incredible new diet, but due  to the country's food crisis. This is staggering. It is appalling. It  is unconscionable. It cannot be tolerated.   The Venezuelan people deserve a return to democracy. They deserve a  government that respects the rule of law and the constitution.   I believe it is the responsibility and the duty of the nations of the  Western Hemisphere, including our Nation, to help the Venezuelan  people. Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter states:         In the event of an unconstitutional alteration of the       constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic       order in a member state, any member state or the Secretary       General may request the immediate convocation of the       Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the       situation and to take such decisions as it deems appropriate.    This is what must be done because if we fail to help the Venezuelan  people in their time of need and if the worst comes to pass, what will  follow will not be confined to the Venezuelan borders.   The United States as a result, I hope, should impose sanctions  against corrupt individuals--not the government, not the people;  individuals--responsible for human rights violations, narcotics  trafficking, money laundering, undermining the country's democratic  process. President Obama began that process. President Trump actually  sanctioned some additional people earlier this year, including the  kingpin drug dealer who is now the Vice President of Venezuela, Tareck  El Aissami.   Here are some people who should be sanctioned by the current  President. He should target for sanctions Chavista officials within the  judiciary--all of these magistrates who have enabled Maduro's takeover.  That includes the murderer who is the chief justice of their supreme  court, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, and others like him who are part of  that so-called constitutional group within the supreme court of  Venezuela, many of whom have access to money and use visas to travel  freely within the United States. Among these names are Calixto Ortega,  Arcadio Delgado, Federico Fuenmayor, Carmen Zuleta, Lourdes Suarez  Anderson, and Juan Jose Mendoza. These are the people who have helped  in this coup d'etat that has canceled the democratic order in  Venezuela, and they should be punished for what they have done.   I will close by pointing to two things that are of deep concern. The  first is this report today in El Nuevo Herald in Miami, which basically  cites that Maduro has now ordered the militarization of a border region  with Colombia. We are concerned about that because we have always  feared he would create some sort of a military pretext to distract  people from the crisis within the country.   Then there is this unusual behavior on the part of Maduro. For  example, yesterday he said that the Chavistas--the followers of Hugo  Chavez--are the new Jews of the 21st century. Basically he is comparing  the Chavistas with the Jews who were exterminated during the Holocaust  in World War II. These comments were broadcast on state television last  night. It is incredible.   By the way, this is the same man who about a week ago was caught on  camera, with a straight face, asking a cow to vote for a constitutional  referendum he is seeking to pass. I don't even think the cow would  support him at this point in Venezuela.   Mr. President, I hope President Trump in the next few days or weeks  will act against these individuals who have carried out this coup  d'etat against democracy in Venezuela and have plunged this proud  nation and proud people into a constitutional, humanitarian, and  economic crisis.   I yield the floor.
