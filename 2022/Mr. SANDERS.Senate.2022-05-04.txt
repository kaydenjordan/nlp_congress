 I call up my motion to instruct, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, no one disagrees that we need to  manufacture more microchips here in the United States, but we should  not be providing a $53 billion blank check to the highly profitable  microchip industry with no protections for the American taxpayer.   The five companies that will likely receive the lion's share of this  funding: Intel, Texas Instruments, Samsung, Micron Technology, and  Global Foundries made over $75 billion in profits last year and spent  over $18 billion on stock buybacks.   We have strange priorities here in the Senate. We can't extend the  child tax credit to combat child poverty. We can't deal with the crisis  in childcare. We can't provide dental care to seniors on Medicare. We  can't deal with climate change. But somehow we can provide a massive  amount of corporate welfare to a handful of corporations.   The motion I am offering today would instruct the conferees to impose  the following conditions on companies receiving this assistance: They  must agree to issue warrants or equity stakes to the Federal  Government.   If private corporations are going to benefit from $53 billion in  taxpayer welfare, the financial gains must be shared with the American  people--not just wealthy stockholders. Further, these companies must  agree to not buy back their own stock, not outsource American jobs, not  repeal existing collective bargaining agreements, and remain neutral in  union organizing efforts.   What we are talking about here is not a radical idea. These exact  conditions, word for word, were included in the bipartisan CARES Act,  which passed the Senate 96 to 0.    Mr. President, may I have 30 seconds in response?    No one debates the need for chips. But to my friend from  Ohio, I would say: You are right. We lost tens of thousands of jobs  over the last 20 years. You know why? Because the same microchip  companies shut down plants in America to go for cheap labor in Asia,  and now we are rewarding them with $53 billion in corporate welfare.   For all of my friends who talk about the deficit and how we can't  fund the needs of our children or the elderly, $53 billion going to  some of the most profitable corporations in America without any  taxpayer protection is an absolute outrage.   Let's vote for this proposal.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, recent polls suggest that Congress has a  19-percent favorability rating, and I find that shocking. Clearly, if  that 19 percent had any inkling as to what goes on here in the Senate,  that number would be much lower.   Over and over again, I hear Members of the Senate express their deep  concerns about the deficit. ``Oh, my God, our deficit.'' We can't  maintain a child tax credit to cut child poverty, and we can't make  sure that senior citizens on Medicare have teeth in their mouths--we  just can't afford it--but, apparently, we can afford to provide $125  billion in tax breaks over the next 4 years to some of the most  profitable corporations in America, including Amazon, Intel, AT&T,  Boeing, you name it.   This amendment would repeal--now, this is amazing, and I say this to  my Democratic colleagues. This amendment would repeal a modest tax  increase on profitable corporations that President Donald Trump pushed  to partially offset the cost of his massive tax giveaway to the rich a  few years ago. This was Trump's initiative to kind of cover the tax  breaks he gave to billionaires and large corporations. If this  amendment were enacted, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon would receive a $2  billion tax break each year, and Northrop Grumman would receive a $1  billion tax break.   Is that what we are in the business of doing, telling working  families we can't help them but that we are giving huge tax breaks to  some of the wealthiest and most profitable corporations in America?   I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion.    Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, this motion is cosponsored by Senator  Johnson of Wisconsin, and I have to say that we are on a roll tonight.  [[Page S2322]]    We have already voted to give $53 billion in corporate welfare to the  microchip industry. We voted to give $125 billion in tax breaks to some  of the wealthiest corporations in the country.   But now we have the opportunity to do even better. We can give $10  billion to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in this country,  who is the owner of the space company Blue Origin.   Clearly, Mr. Bezos desperately needs this Federal assistance. He is  only worth $150 billion, and with all of his lawyers and accountants,  in a given year, he pays nothing in Federal income taxes.   He is the owner of Amazon, which in a given year also pays nothing in  Federal income taxes.   Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a $500 million yacht, $175 million  estate in Beverly Hills, and a $23 million mansion here in Washington.   I am sure that your constituents will be very excited to hear that  you are going to give him this $10 billion, which he clearly  desperately needs.   Further, for those people here who believe in trade unions, Mr. Bezos  has spent millions of dollars at Amazon preventing workers at Amazon  from exercising their constitutional right to form a union.   He is part of Amazon, a company that has been fined over and over  again for violating the law.   Mr. President, at a time when 70 million are uninsured, when 600,000  people are homeless in this country, when we are seeing a growing gap  between the very rich and everybody else, it does not make a lot of  sense to give $10 billion to the second wealthiest person in this  country.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this motion.    Mr. President, you know, I hear this word  ``competition,'' but I want everybody to know what the competition is  in the space program.   The competition is between Mr. Musk and SpaceX. Musk is the  wealthiest guy in the country, and Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin, the  second wealthiest guy in this country.   Is that really the kind of space program that the American people  want? I think not.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
