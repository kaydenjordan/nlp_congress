 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  appreciate that very much.   My amendment will ensure level funding for distributed wind  technologies and research within the Department of Energy's wind energy  program.   Distributed wind is the use of typically smaller wind turbines owned  primarily by rural and local entities, such as homes, farms,  businesses, and public facilities, to offset all or a portion of onsite  energy consumption. This type of energy production strengthens American  communities by helping them become more energy independent while  lowering costs for consumers.   Distributed wind also strengthens domestic manufacturing, as 90  percent of all small wind turbines sold in the U.S. last year were made  in America.   The funding provided over the past few fiscal years has helped  unleash distributed wind power's vast potential, but continued  investment is needed to support the critical research and development  that will reduce costs and maximize the benefits of distributed wind  power throughout the United States.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.
