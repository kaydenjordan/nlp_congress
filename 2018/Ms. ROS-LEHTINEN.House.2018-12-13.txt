 Mr. Speaker, my colleague and good friend Debbie  Wasserman Schultz's Spanish was perfect, ``perfecto.''   As she has pointed out, I have long supported the cause of statehood  for Puerto Rico, but the lack of action on our part has kept Puerto  Rico from having a voice and a vote on this very floor, which is  imperative for our great democracy.   For over 100 years, the people of Puerto Rico have been proud  American citizens. Plebiscite after plebiscite, Puerto Ricans have  voted that they will no longer accept the territory status.   Statehood will promote economic development and jobs on the island so  that these American citizens can have a better life and stop losing its  people to the mainland after the devastating impacts of Hurricanes Irma  and Maria.   Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon--that is her proper title,  that is what it should be--whom I am proud to call my friend, has made  statehood for Puerto Rico her priority, urging Republicans and  Democrats alike, as you have heard, to act. We must listen and we must  do what is right.    As chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I recognize  that statehood will enhance our national security, serving as our  Nation's third border in the Caribbean.  [[Page H10190]]    Mr. Speaker, the status quo is simply unacceptable. I urge my  colleagues to support statehood for Puerto Rico.                            ____________________
