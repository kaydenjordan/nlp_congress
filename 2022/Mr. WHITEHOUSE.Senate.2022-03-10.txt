 Mr. President, let me thank Senator Thune for his  remarks.   I would simply add that I hope we can all keep in our hearts the  prospect that the Ukrainians might actually win this thing, given the  success they have already seen, as long as they get adequate support  from us and the world community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here for a rather different  reason. It is to call on this Chamber yet again to wake up to the  urgent threat of climate change.   I wish I was done with these ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches. Frankly, I  wish I had never had to deliver a single one.   I wish Congress had dealt with this threat--for instance, back when  another Senator from Rhode Island, Republican John Chafee, held  hearings on the looming challenge of carbon dioxide pollution.   I wish we had dealt with it when the House, under Speaker Pelosi,  passed the Waxman-Markey climate change bill, only for Majority Leader  Harry Reid and President Barack Obama to kill it in a Democratic Senate  with a filibuster-proof majority.   I wish the Citizens United decision hadn't allowed the fossil fuel  industry to capture the Republican Party and kill the bipartisanship on  climate that existed before that decision in this Chamber.   In my church growing up, there was a prayer about things we have left  undone that we ought to have done. In that spirit, here is a graphic on  carbon emissions we prepared in conjunction with the Biden White House  that charts out where we are on this problem.   Green, this line here, is carbon emissions business as usual if we  keep kowtowing to the fossil fuel industry here and don't take serious  climate action.   Orange, this line, with quite significant emissions savings, is the  Finance Committee's climate tax package. That is the effect just of  that climate tax package if it comes into law.   Down here is a clean electricity standard. If you could put into law  a national U.S. clean electricity standard, you could reduce emissions  to this gray line.   If you were to combine the two, if you were to combine the Finance  Committee tax package and the clean electricity standard, you push  emissions down to this yellow line.   Look at the blue line. This upper blue line is the carbon savings  from a modest price on carbon, one that we have discussed and  negotiated with the White House--$15 per ton in 2023, rising to $70 per  ton in 2032. Look at how powerful the emissions effect is of that  single intervention.   Now, this lowest one that reduces emissions the most, this is the  safety pathway. This dark blue emissions line is all of those policies  together. That is what they add up to. That is what we could be doing.  We could be creating a pathway to safety.   As these emissions results show, a carbon price is the key policy to  hit the 50-percent emissions reduction target we have and to get on a  pathway to safety. Well, that is not happening right now.   So, while fossil fuel-funded Republicans block legislative action on  climate, what could be done through executive action? Regulation. It is  not a substitute for ambitious legislation, but it can make a big  difference.   The EPA has more or less restored Obama-era fuel economy and  greenhouse gas emission standards for cars and light trucks. It has a  proposal to regulate methane leakage from oil and gas facilities. It  restored an Obama-era rule limiting mercury and other toxic air  pollutants from coal-fired powerplants. That is all good, but it is a  return to the pre-Trump polluter status quo, not progress--not new  progress.   Here is what EPA could still do:   Start with regulations for big, easily identified sources of  greenhouse gases, not just coal-fired powerplants but point sources,  including in the industrial sector, which generates more than one-fifth  of total greenhouse gas emissions. We need a multipronged regulatory  approach targeting all major classes of point sources.   We need stronger rules for mercury, coal ash, soot, and other  pollutants. Public health demands this, and it is even more urgent in  light of climate change.   EPA can update the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and tighten  National Ambient Air Quality Standards.   We need greenhouse gas emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles and  for aviation. Focusing just on light-duty vehicles won't cut it.   Over at the Office of Management and Budget, they could finish an  updated social cost of carbon and issue guidance requiring its use  throughout--throughout--Agency decisionmaking. This is a big one. The  social cost of carbon calculates the long-term damage from carbon  pollution, and it should figure in permitting, leasing, grant-making,  investments, international development assistance, trade agreements,  and procurement.   A Trump judge--likely installed on the Federal Bench using fossil  fuel dark money--just blocked the Obama-era social cost of carbon.  While that is litigated, the administration is correctly pausing  leases, permits, and other actions for greenhouse gas emitters.   At the Department of Interior, stop doling out leases to big  polluters. The President promised to end new fossil fuel leases on  public lands and waters, so pause them while the social cost of carbon  is litigated, and review them all to make sure that taxpayers are paid  royalties that reflect the actual cost of fossil fuel production and  combustion.   At the Department of Energy, update energy efficiency standards for  light bulbs, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, and all the  electric appliances and products we use every day. There is low-hanging  fruit there. I hear many of these rules are nearly ready but are held  up in bureaucratic delay.    Get a move on.   The Department of Energy should also, along with the EPA and the  Department of Agriculture, update the renewable fuel standards to  ensure that renewable fuels actually generate considerable emissions  reductions.   Here is another simple one: Federal procurement.   Update Federal acquisition regulations so Agencies price in the cost  of emissions when they are buying products. Do that, and maybe we  wouldn't wind up purchasing Postal Service delivery trucks with  internal combustion engines no more efficient than their decades-old  predecessors. Heck, we might even end up with clean, high-performing  electric postal trucks. There is more to this regulatory list, but let  me leave it there.   With legislation and regulation ought to come litigation. There are  States, cities, counties across the country that have filed lawsuits  against the fossil fuel industry based on local harm suffered as a  result of climate change, and there is precedent for those at the  Federal level.   In 1999, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Big  Tobacco and its front groups, charging that they ``engaged in and  executed--and continue to engage in and execute--a massive 50-year  scheme to defraud the public.'' That is the language in the Department  of Justice's complaint.   Well, it went to trial, and a few years later, U.S. District Judge  Gladys Kessler agreed. She found that the tobacco industry had  ``coordinated significant aspects of their public relations,  scientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of a shared  objective--to . . . maximize industry profits by preserving and  expanding the market for cigarettes through a scheme to deceive the  public.'' That is the language in the decision, ``a scheme to  deceive.''   So here is a useful exercise: Pop out the word ``cigarettes'' in that  decision, and drop in ``fossil fuel.'' Judge Kessler's finding in the  tobacco case describes exactly what the fossil fuel industry has  perpetrated: ``coordinated significant aspects of their public  relations, scientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of  a shared objective--to . . . maximize industry profits by preserving  and expanding the market for fossil fuels through a scheme to deceive  the public.''   Nothing--nothing--prevents the Department of Justice from at least  investigating whether to follow its own  [[Page S1077]]  successful blueprint; yet nothing has been done.   Progress will be easier on climate if we take on the fossil fuel- funded front groups that are armed to the teeth with dark money  political weaponry. With proper countermeasures like exposure, we can  help achieve victory on climate by exposing the rightwing, dark money  groups fomenting and funding climate obstruction very likely as part of  a scheme to deceive the public.   I will end with an example from a book I read recently about a ship  that went down.   In September 1857, the S.S. Central America, which was known as the  ``Ship of Gold,'' set sail from California to New York City with nearly  600 passengers and crew and 30,000 pounds of gold from the California  Gold Rush. A few hundred miles off the Carolina coast, a hurricane hit  the S.S. Central America. In the teeth of the gales, the passengers and  crew did everything they could. Stewards and waiters and other staff  were taken off their regular duties to fight the storm, to fight the  flooding. Passengers were put into service to save the stricken ship.  Heavy cargo was thrown overboard. In fact, divers are, right now, down,  recovering the gold that was thrown overboard to save the ship. The  ship itself--its doors and panels--were broken up to help block the sea  out or were thrown overboard to lighten the stricken ship. At the end-- at the end--passengers and crew were side by side, deep in the hold,  shoulder deep in water, desperately pumping to save the ship.   The lesson here: The passengers and crew did everything they could,  but at each step, they started too late. They ultimately took all the  necessary measures, but each one--each one--they took too late, and the  ship sank.   I fear that that is the analogy for our present predicament.  Indolence in the face of known danger is a particularly stupid form of  cowardice. It is made worse here by a fossil fuel industry that pays  people to block our efforts to save the ship.   For the steamship the S.S. Central America, there was another boat  that stood by in the storm to help rescue passengers, and out of the  600 men and women on that ship, a few dozen were saved. Us? We have no  other planet standing by. This is our chance for this ship of ours, and  it is time to wake up. It is time to take self-rescue seriously by  every available means--and fast.   I yield the floor.
