 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  effort to establish a national veterans cemetery on the south plains of  west Texas.   Dating back to the Civil War, the 147 national cemeteries across  America are a powerful way to honor those who have gone before us who  wore the uniform of the United States and remind us every day of the 1  percent of Americans who were willing to sacrifice everything in  defense of our freedom and security.   For some, they serve as what President Lincoln called ``a final  resting place for those who gave their lives that our Nation might  live.''   Yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting with several distinguished  veterans who have made it their mission to see this vision become a  reality.                                time  1015    Among them were four generals, who have chosen to reside in a little  slice of heaven that Chairman Mike Conaway and I call west Texas. I am  so honored that they are with us here today in the gallery.   General Edgar Murphy was the commanding general of the 49th Armored  Division of the Army National Guard for the State of Texas. In his  distinguished 42-year military career, he was awarded numerous medals,  including the Legion of Merit. Today the Armed Forces Guard and Reserve  Center in Lubbock is named in General Murphy's honor.   General Anne Sobel is a former major general in the Arizona Air  National Guard who served as the first female homeland security  director for the State of New Mexico. Today she continues by serving  and teaching at my alma mater, Texas Tech University.   Brigadier General Gary Harber is a veteran with 42 years of service  and a master army aviator. General Harber also served as the NATO  northern regional wartime construction manager and commander from 1989  to 1995, responsible for the United Kingdom, Norway, and Denmark.   Last but certainly not least is my good friend Lieutenant General  Bernie Mittemeyer. General Mittemeyer served 28 years in the U.S. Army,  earning numerous awards and decorations. He served as our Surgeon  General of the Army from 1981 until his retirement in 1985, and he also  served as commanding general of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in  Washington, D.C.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent over 40,000 veterans in my  district and rural America. If you take into consideration eastern New  Mexico that this national cemetery would serve, it is over 70,000  veterans.   We must ensure that the commitment we make to our veterans isn't  reserved only for those veterans living in population centers, whether  it is long-term care, services for the disabled, or respect that is  owed our honored dead. We must never forget all veterans, including  those living in rural parts of our country.   Madam Speaker, no group of Americans believes more adamantly in the  importance of a strong defense and the mission of our military to keep  us safe and free than the good people of west Texas.   Their duty was to serve. Our duty is to remember them. One of the  best  [[Page H4015]]  ways we can do that is by giving them a hero's burial in a national  cemetery.   God bless our veterans. And go west Texas.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, what a joy and a pleasure and an honor  to serve under the ranking member's leadership in the 115th Congress,  my first term. I thank him for letting me lead the subcommittee and  initiate the legislation that will have an impact--I believe a  tremendous impact--on the lives of folks like my friend Bill, so I  thank him.   Madam Speaker, I enjoyed working with Chairman Takano, and I  congratulate him on his chairmanship. I thank him for being a great  colleague and for being a friend to the veterans, most importantly.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Levin for being such a gracious  gentleman and statesman, to come up to me on the floor of the House and  tell me he was going to pick up this ball and he was going to run it  all the way down the field and into the end zone so that we can score  points, not politically for Democrats or Republicans, but for the  American people who expect that we take care of our veterans and, most  of all, for our military men and women who are transitioning and have  unique challenges in that regard, as Bill had. It meant so much to me.   If I don't say anything else here, I want to say thank you. I say  that on behalf of Bill's family because I know it means a lot to them.   He is worthy. Bill Mulder is worthy to be on this legislation. Don't  ask me, ask his teammates, his fellow Navy SEALs.   I mean, just look at him. He is Captain America. I am so jealous. I  was always jealous. He was tough. He was strong. He was courageous.   Madam Speaker, I promise you this, that when he stood between you and  me and the enemy, we were safe, and the enemy was scared, as they  should be.   Thank God for Bill Mulder, and thank God for our men and women who  wear the uniform.   Our country makes a tremendous investment in preparing our citizen  soldiers to be freedom fighters, to be part of the greatest fighting  force in all the world, but then we invest a fraction of that in their  transition back to civilian life.   This is an investment in prevention, as has been said. If we can do a  better job on the front end, then we can prevent folks from struggling  with addiction, unemployment, homelessness, suicide, and a number of  challenges that disproportionately affect our veterans.   Next Monday, we will celebrate Memorial Day and take time to pay  tribute to those who not only served but made the ultimate sacrifice,  those American heroes who never made it home.   However, even when our soldiers do return home from war, it doesn't  always mean that the conflict is over for them. There is often a battle  that continues to rage on. It is a big reason that we see so many  soldiers take their own lives.   One of those veterans, sadly enough, was my friend Bill, my fellow  Plainview Bulldog for whom this bill was named. I am so proud that this  legislation bears his name, and I am so grateful that you guys kept it  that way.   Bill was a warrior's warrior. He served this country with honor and  distinction.   Like many veterans, Bill's greatest fight wasn't on the battlefield.  It was the struggle that often ensues from the mental, emotional, and  physical wear and tear of military service.   After 20 years as a combat Navy SEAL, Bill bore scars you couldn't  see, and he struggled to make that transition from Active Duty to  civilian life.   For a lot of these folks, it is not the skills gap that is important.  It is not always the education gap. It is not even redefining your  mission and purpose after such a sacred calling as to wear the United  States uniform. Sometimes, it is a mental health issue.   I am grateful that we have included that in that comprehensive  assessment and in this legislation because that was the case for Mr.  Mulder.    Madam Speaker, I am sorry for going on a little long.   Let me just say, we owe this to the likes of Bill Mulder.   I really believe, Ranking Member, Chairman Takano, and Chairman  Levin, of all the things I worked on, on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee--and it was a tremendous honor; I didn't serve our country in  the military, so this was my way of serving those who served--I don't  believe anything is going to have a greater impact. And it may just  save lives. I believe it will. I really do.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to be a small part of it. God bless our  veterans. God bless those guardian angels that keep guard over us every  day. God bless the United States of America.
