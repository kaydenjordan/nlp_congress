 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise as someone who in my past life defended  corporations and entities that often had mandatory arbitration clauses  in their contracts. As such, I am uniquely qualified to address the  myths that have been perpetuated about the FAIR Act. By the way,  ``myths'' is a polite term for ``lies.''   One has to consider that if we believe these claims that forced  arbitration is cheaper, fairer, and faster, then surely workers and  consumers would voluntarily choose it. So, there is no harm in  restoring Americans' freedom to choose for themselves how to seek  justice.   First myth: The FAIR Act eliminates arbitration entirely, and no one  will choose arbitration if it is voluntary.   Fact: The FAIR Act doesn't eliminate arbitration, as has been said  over and over here today. It just prohibits forced arbitration and  allows both parties to choose arbitration voluntarily after a worker's  rights or a consumer's rights have been violated.   If forced arbitration were instead voluntary, the private market  would incentivize arbitration providers to treat both parties fairly  and equally so that both parties would choose that process because they  would feel like they are getting an equal opportunity at justice.   Second myth: Consumers and workers are more likely to win and get  higher awards in forced arbitration than in court.  [[Page H3796]]    Fact: This is a lie. That is the result of a misleading study, which  deliberately cherry-picked data by excluding all results for the most  common way consumers and workers file their cases in State courts and  through class actions.   The Chamber of Commerce only examined outcomes of individual cases  filed in Federal court because it knows that very few consumer and  worker cases are filed in Federal court. Americans are, in fact, more  likely to be struck by lightning than they are to win a monetary award  in a forced arbitration.   A study based on self-reported data from two of the leading private  arbitration providers revealed that, on average, only approximately 382  consumers won a monetary award each year, less than the number of  people struck by lightning every year in the United States. While an  estimated 60 million workers are subject to forced arbitration clauses,  only 82 prevailed in employment forced arbitration claims in 2020.   Third myth: Forced arbitration is faster and, as we have heard from  some people across the aisle, cheaper than litigation.   Another completely false claim is based on faulty data from a forced  arbitration database, which systematically deleted older cases,  completely skewing the average length of a case in forced arbitration-- simple data manipulation.   The idea that arbitration would provide consumers a cheaper way to  litigate their claims, perhaps suggesting that they would do that  without a lawyer, no major company will ever go to arbitration without  their highly paid company lawyers. And every individual, whether they  are in court or in arbitration, would need representation against a  corporation regardless of the forum that they are in.   Fourth myth: The court system is overbooked, so forced arbitration  provides more flexibility for scheduling.   While more powerful defendants have an incentive to drag out  resolution of a case, that incentive exists whether they are in court  or arbitration.                                time  1315    It is in the best interest of the individual who is filing the claim  to seek the fastest possible resolution for his or her claim, and that  would be done regardless of which they choose.   By the way, corporations often choose courts over arbitration to  resolve disputes that they initiate, showing that they do so when it  benefits them.    Madam Speaker, myth number 5, the FAIR Act violates the  freedom to contract. This is my favorite one. Whose freedom? That of  corporations or Americans? There was a comment that we are in the most  successful economy in the history of the world, but for whom? Not  necessarily for consumers or workers.   Don't Americans have the right to participate in the economy without  being forced to forego the rights and protections that are afforded to  them under the law? The United States Constitution's Seventh Amendment  guarantees the right to trial by jury for every American.   What if corporations inserted provisions into their contracts forcing  Americans to give up their First or Second Amendment rights to get or  keep a job? Would we still be talking about the freedom to contract?   Finally, the last myth. The FAIR Act is retroactive. It is not  retroactive. It only applies to cases filed on or after the date of  enactment. We need a level playing field between corporations and  industries and the people who find themselves aggrieved by them. The  arbitration process--make no mistake about it--is a private process.  People bringing their claims need to be able to fairly evaluate the  best forum for that claim to be adjudicated.
