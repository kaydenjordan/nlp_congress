 Mr. President, today I would like to applaud the Senate's  passage of S. Res. 203, a resolution recognizing Jewish American  Heritage Month. This resolution is an important reminder of the  numerous contributions of Jewish Americans to our society.   I have long felt connected to the Jewish values of ``tzedakah'' and  ``chesed,'' values that, at their core, speak about justice, decency,  kindness, and mercy. I would not be where I am today if it were not for  the Jewish Americans who embodied these values, people like Rabbi  Heschel, who marched side-by-side with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and  demanded equality and justice, or leaders like Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who  fled Berlin in 1937, moved to Newark, NJ, and was one of five people  who spoke before Dr. King at the March on Washington. Rabbi Prinz's  entire speech was focused on helping people understand that one of the  most urgent challenges we face in society is silence, silence in the  face of injustice. Because of the leadership of so many Jewish  Americans, who refused to be silent and decided to act, we were able to  move the moral arc of this Nation towards justice.   So I stand here in the Senate incredibly proud to represent vibrant  Jewish communities across New Jersey. And I stand here, at a time when  anti-Semitism is on the rise, to speak out against this hate that  violates our most commonly held values. We all have a responsibility to  stamp out anti-Semitism and remind ourselves that our diversity  strengthens the society and culture of the United States.   S. Res. 203 does just that by honoring and celebrating the incredible  history of the Jewish people in the United States and their  contributions to our country, and I strongly support this resolution's  passage.                            ____________________
