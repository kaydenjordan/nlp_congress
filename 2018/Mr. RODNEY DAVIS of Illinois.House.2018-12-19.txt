 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from  Florida for yielding. I know he is probably worried about what I might  say in this final speech here on the floor tonight, but I have got to  tell you about a friend that I met just shortly after going to a  meeting across the street where I had the honor of becoming a mentor to  a candidate who wanted to run for Congress.   His name was Carlos Curbelo, and I knew we were going to get along  well when I called him the first time on the phone and he said: ``Why  are you my mentor?'' I said: ``Because you have Key West in the  district you are winning in. I would like to come visit you.''   He took my first joke well, and we hit it off and became very close  friends. And imagine my glee when, on election night, in 2014, my  mentee became a newly elected Member of Congress. And to see him walk  into this institution, to see him immediately become, not just a friend  to me and to many others, but a legislator and one of the best  legislators I have ever had the opportunity to serve with.    It is bittersweet for me to stand here tonight and wish him the best  in his next endeavors. I know he will have plenty of opportunities to  spend a great deal of time with his wife Ceci and their two lovely  young daughters in one of the most beautiful places in the world, in  Miami-Dade.   But I have got a feeling this isn't going to be the last for my  friend, Mr. Curbelo. And this speech may be the last one he delivers as  a Member of this institution, but whether it is he comes back here or  whatever his next step is, he knows that it is not only me who is going  to be standing there right behind him, but so many of his colleagues  and friends that he has met along the way and has meant so much to.   I thank him for being a great friend. I thank him for being a member  of the wolf pack, and I will always know him as my good friend, Chuck  Curbelo.
