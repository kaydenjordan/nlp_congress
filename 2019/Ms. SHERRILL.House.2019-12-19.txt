 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), for yielding.   I rise today to defend the taxpayers of our country, people who  believe in a strong America with great schools and great  infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I launched ``12 Days of SALT'' last week to urge this  House to lift the 2017 tax bill's $10,000 cap on the State and local  tax deduction.   Today is the 11th day of SALT. I have been on the floor for 11 days  to talk about this. This is an issue of tax fairness, with people  investing in their communities, in schools, and in infrastructure only  to face double-taxation as the Federal Government punishes these  efforts.   The 2017 tax bill was an attack on New Jersey taxpayers. New Jersey  already sends more money to Washington and gets back less than nearly  every State in the country.   Our bill will put money back in the pockets of our residents and  communities, and not just in New Jersey. This bill provides relief for  13.1 million Americans.   It also doubles the deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket expenses  and creates a new deduction for first responders to offset work-related  costs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support tax relief to support  our teachers and first responders and pass this bill.
