 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  life of Lieutenant Colonel Adolf ``Wes'' Wesselhoeft, who, as a child,  was one of 11,000 German-Americans placed in internment camps during  World War II. You see his picture to my left.   Wes was born to German immigrants in Chicago in 1936. When he was  seven, his family packed what few things they could and were taken to  Crystal City, Texas, to a detainment camp built there for German,  Japanese, and Italian immigrants.   Just a year later, in 1944, his family packed up once again and was  sent to New York City to board the M.S. Gripsholm. The M.S. Gripsholm  headed to Portugal where the Wesselhoeft family and 633 other German  expatriates and repatriates were exchanged for American prisoners of  war and then sent back to Germany.   Once back in Germany, Wes and his family lived in the town of Hamburg  with his grandparents. Unfortunately, Hamburg was the center of Allied  bombings during World War II. Wes has vivid memories from the bombings,  seeking shelter in bunkers with his family. Despite those experiences,  Wes remained a true American patriot, and he was committed to coming  back home to the United States of America.   After the war ended, Wes and his family moved to Konstanz where he  finished school and worked manual labor jobs to save money for a return  to America. He stayed in touch with the American consulate in  Stuttgart, riding his bike 2 days each way to meet with them until  finally in 1958 the consulate informed him he could return home. He  bought the cheapest passage to the United States.   Upon arriving in New York, he went straight to a recruiting office to  enlist in the United States Air Force. Wes served 22 years in the Air  Force and flew EC-121Rs and B-52s during the Vietnam war. During his  service, he was exposed to Agent Orange. He is now legally blind.   Wes and his wife, Shirley, now live in Ruston, Louisiana, where I  proudly represent them in Congress. Wes represents the best of America,  a patriot who never gave up on his country. His service to his country,  as well as the horrors he and his family suffered in Germany, will  never be forgotten. America is better because of people like Wes, those  willing to give up everything to serve the American cause.                            ____________________
