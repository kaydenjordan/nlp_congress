 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 91, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 57) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to accountability and  State plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 57         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Education       relating to accountability and State plans under the       Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (published at       81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (November 29, 2016)), and such rule shall       have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita) and  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 57.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 57.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 57.   Mr. Speaker, I was here also on this floor listening to the debate  that just finished on H.J. Res. 58, and I have a feeling a lot of the  same things are going to carry over because we are dealing with the  same Department. In fact, we are dealing with the prior administration  generally.   I was struck by the words that we need to ``give direction to the  States.'' I think, by definition, those words demonstrate how one side  here thinks that they know best; that their judgment is somehow better  than the judgment of governors, of State legislators,  [[Page H1047]]  of parents, teachers, and superintendents themselves when it comes to  this issue and, in fact, in a larger perspective, when it comes to most  issues around here. We must give direction to the States--no.   The fact of the matter is, when the President signed into law, when  we passed ESSA--the Every Student Succeeds Act--in a lot of ways we  were saying to the States: You give the direction. You set the way that  you think is best to educate your best assets. Your best assets, of  course, being our next generation.   While we at the Federal level would like to be partners, the fact of  the matter is it is their property. The tax dollars we are talking  about are the property of the individuals living in the 50 States and  other jurisdictions.   So now here we are using the Congressional Review Act to get rid of  some regulations that are doing that very thing. We wrote a very  specific law saying the States are in charge. Here we have a Federal  agency inserting itself, not just interpreting law, but actually making  law and taking us in the exact opposite direction that all of us  intended.   When I say all of us, I say that in a very bipartisan way, Mr.  Speaker, because--I am now in my fifth year of being chairman of the  Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education  here in the House. My first 4 years were consumed working with past  Chairman John Kline, current Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, other members of  the committee, and all our Democratic counterparts in getting this very  bipartisan law passed and signed into law.   Let me go back, Mr. Speaker, and set the table here. You will have to  remember that under the No Child Left Behind law, which was the law of  the land for some 13 years--perhaps a well-intentioned law, but  completely unreasonable in terms of its forced, ridged, one-size-fits- all accountability system that heavily dictated how we would gauge and  address school performance--that system represented a top-down approach  in K-12 education. After 13 years, the data is in and the results are  in. It simply didn't work.   So that is why just a little more than a year ago, Congress passed-- again, former President Obama signed into law in a very bipartisan  way--the Every Student Succeeds Act. With this law, Republicans and  Democrats worked together to reform our education system to ensure that  all children are able to receive the education they deserve. It  represents a fundamentally different approach to education and, in the  words of one superintendent, empowers local leaders to ``dream and lead  and transform public education in this country.''   Unfortunately, almost immediately after the bill became law, the  Obama administration began its attempt to roll back these bipartisan  reforms. With the Every Student Succeeds Act, Congress promised to  reduce the Federal role and restore State and local control over K-12  education. The law empowers States to develop their own policies to  hold schools accountable to parents and taxpayers.   For accountability to work, Mr. Speaker, it must be driven by the  State and local leaders who are best equipped to directly address the  issues in their school. Those leaders know better than any Federal  bureaucrat in the Department of Education what their kids need, even  down to what their kids' names are. I challenge any Federal bureaucrat  to know better.   Unfortunately, the Obama administration's flawed accountability  regulation would reestablish the Washington-knows-best approach to  accountability. It is the very same thing I mentioned earlier that we  just heard regarding H.J. Res. 58. It is an approach that is deeply  flawed.   How do I know? What is the best metric to prove the point that that  Washington-knows-best approach is deeply flawed?   Look at it. Look at the test scores since the Federal Government has  been involved in education. You see that they haven't gone up. Yet we  have spent billions and billions of dollars since the 1970s here at the  Federal level on local education to see no improvement in the test  scores.   Not only does the regulation dictate prescriptive accountability  requirements, but it violates many of the prohibitions that we put in  on the Secretary of Education. As we all saw, the top-down approach  simply didn't work. So that is why we repealed No Child Left Behind and  passed a bill to transform K-12 education.   Our students deserve better than the failed policies of the past, and  that is what the Every Student Succeeds Act does, if implemented as  Congress intended.   Now, our intent was not ambiguous, and the law is far from silent. We  were very specific in the law we wrote. Our specificity dictated that  the States and localities were back in charge. They were driving  the bus again. No pun intended.    The Department has taken some kind of ambiguity, I guess, some kind  of silence, and has inserted themselves into the lawmaking role. That  wasn't our intent.   Our intent was for a new role for the Department, a much smaller role  for the Department, a less supervisory role for the Department, and a  less punitive role for the Department, one that would simply ensure  that our specifically written law, as passed off this floor, passed off  the Senate floor, and eventually signed into law, was followed as we  wrote it. So an example of that was we require the States to have plans  for how they were going to test, that they would test, but nothing more  prescriptive than that. That is just one example, the testing. There  were some other parameters.   Then they were to submit those plans to the Federal Government, and  the Department of Education was simply to check the box and make sure  that the plans were done and otherwise comply with the law. The  Department wasn't to be more prescriptive than that. It wasn't to give  any more regulation than that. It wasn't to, frankly, give too much  more direction than that because we recognize that this responsibility  is primarily that of governors, State legislators, school  superintendents, parents, and teachers.   Now, States are already working to implement the law in their school  districts. I want to be very clear that this resolution in no way does  anything to stymie those efforts. States should move straight ahead.   Instead, the resolution gives States the certainty they need to  continue moving forward, confident that their plans will be reviewed by  the Department of Education against the requirements of the statute and  nothing more, with deference given to the judgment of these local  legislators, local superintendents, et cetera, as the law requires.   We are also committed to working with the new administration to  ensure States receive the support they need consistent with the limits  placed in the statute.   So, my colleagues, by passing this resolution and blocking  implementation of the Obama administration's flawed accountability  rule, we can ensure that the promises we made under the Every Student  Succeeds Act to restore State and local control in K-12 education are  kept.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 57 and protect those  important bipartisan reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would only comment that the comments made  to the rule in this regard--the ones I have seen--were almost all bad.  They were negative against this rule, except for maybe a few groups.   I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx) who is chairwoman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I finally realized what is happening here.  What the other side considers ambiguous is really flexibility. I think  that is the difference here. But, let's be clear. What we intended  through ESSA was flexibility for the States. Nowhere in the law are we  ambiguous about what we intended.   I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Ferguson), who, in the month that he has been here, has already  injected a lot of energy to the committee and is doing a great job for  his constituents.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentlewoman: ESSA was a  landmark bipartisan achievement. Unfortunately, the Obama  administration's partisan implementation of it is what brings us here  today. Instead of choosing to take every opportunity to work with us,  the Obama administration is choosing to do through the regulatory  process what it couldn't achieve legislatively.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Costello), who is doing a great job for his State.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   The effect of this action will not halt State implementation efforts.  Let me say that again. The effect of this action will not halt State  implementation efforts.   Our intent is to require clarity and consistency so implementation  can, in fact, continue. States are continuing to develop State plans  that comply with the law, as you have already seen being done across  the country. The States and school districts are in the driver's seat  here, Mr. Speaker, and they should continue moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to say to the  gentlewoman that I agree that we have to be careful to make sure  underserved children are not vulnerable, which is what we did in the  underlying law in a bipartisan manner when we passed it and when the  President signed the law.   I reject the premise that State and local leaders, however, cannot be  trusted to deliver an excellent education to all of their students.  More importantly, that premise was rejected by Congresses in ESSA  itself.   Beyond that, the criticism just levied is simply not true. The  Department of Education has the right and, indeed, the obligation to  enforce the law. That has never been in dispute.   There are clear requirements in this statute for States to develop  ways to hold their schools accountable and to report information about  school performance to parents and their communities. That duty  continues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The gentleman talks about accountability. I want to reassure all the  Members here that will be voting on this joint resolution that we are  not throwing accountability out the window.   What we decided last year when we passed the Every Student Succeeds  Act is that accountability was a good thing. But the best leaders and  the best persons to determine what that accountability should be and  what that accountability should look like are found in our States and  are found in our local jurisdictions. They know our best assets the  best--our best assets being our children. They know what they need.   So we are not throwing accountability out the window. We are saying  accountability is to be measured at the State level by the States, by  the local jurisdictions, and they are to simply report to the  Department of Education what their accountability plan is in a  transparent way so that, again, parents, teachers, and taxpayers can  decide if that State is doing a good job, so that people like the  NAACP--if they are and should be, as we all should be, worried about  achievement gaps--could affect how to close those achievement gaps in  those respective States and, by the way, perhaps come up with a more  effective way, a better plan, a more aggressive plan to close that  achievement gap rather than the one-size-fits-all bureaucracy that is  the Federal Department of Education. That is the whole point.    Secondly, regarding civil rights. Nothing in this resolution that  takes back this draconian rulemaking from the Department of Education  affects civil rights. We are very clear in the Every Student Succeeds  Act that the civil rights protections remain. We agreed with that in a  bipartisan way, and all of that remains. Don't let the gentleman from  Colorado scare you into thinking anything different.   There was a lot of talk about uncertainty from previous speakers-- uncertainty for States--and that blocking implementation of these  regulations will create that uncertainty. Let me address that for just  a couple of minutes.   We, Congress, cannot allow Federal agencies to ignore the clear  prohibitions against executive overreach. These regulations clearly  attempt to reassert Federal control that was returned to the States by  Congress under ESSA.                                time  1630    Repealing these regulations is the only way to give States and school  districts the certainty that they need with sufficient time to move the  implementation process forward. The law itself provides enough  guidance. We were very specific how we wrote this law. We were very  specific in the requirements needed. That removes the need to have the  kind of rulemaking that the Department of Education, either through  habit or through direct intent, is trying to do here. We don't need to  do it here.   The law itself lays out clear criteria for the State plans. It states  explicitly that the onus is on the Department of Education to  demonstrate how a plan does not comply with the law that we wrote and  that the President signed into law. It does not require, and the States  are not required, to go jump through the hoops that the Department is  trying to have them jump through now through this rulemaking.   The law also requires the Department to review the State plans with  deference to State and local judgments. The Department is trying to  take that judgment away from the States and put it under its own  umbrella.   Under the law, as long as States can demonstrate that their plans  comply with the statute, they will be approved. We wrote that into the  law. Because of this, States can have the certainty that the work they  began can continue. The Department, with this rule, is trying to  unravel all that. The resolution stops the Department from doing that.   I know Congressman Costello mentioned teacher performance. Others  have talked about student assessment participation rates. Let me give  you a few examples for the record, Mr. Speaker. ESSA allowed States to  determine how to hold schools accountable for assessing students. The  final rule limits States to only four options for assessing students  and requires schools to implement a plan to address low test  participation--not required in the law, not part of what we are doing  here. The Department, by doing that, is making up law.   Regarding teacher performance and some things that Mr. Costello  referenced, ESSA explicitly prohibited the Secretary from mandating the  creation of teacher evaluation systems. As the Federal Government, we  are getting out of the business of teacher evaluation systems. It  didn't mean the States couldn't do it. It didn't mean that most States  wouldn't do it. However, the final rule requires States to establish a  statewide definition for what an ineffective teacher means that  differentiates between categories of teachers.   Now, if you look at this in effect, in practical terms, it would be  almost impossible for States to fulfill this requirement without  implementing a teacher and school leader evaluation, something the law  specifically didn't require, specifically prohibited. Yet, here we are  with the Department's rule basically making States do it. Not what was  intended. Not what we wrote. Not what we voted on on the floor of this  House, and not what was signed into law by the President of the United  States at the time.   So these are the kinds of things that we are fighting against here,  Mr. Speaker. These are the kinds of things that H.J. Res. 57, and H.J.  Res. 58 for that matter, would stop the Department from doing. H.J.  Res. 57 protects the positive reforms Congress made with Every Student  Succeeds Act and ensures that those reforms are implemented as Congress  intended. In doing so, the resolution preserves State and local control  over K-12 education and provides States and school districts the  certainty they need to proceed with the plans that they are already in  the process of writing.   That is why a number of groups--including the National Governors  Association; AASA, the School Superintendents Association; and the  Council of the Great City Schools--have spoken out in support of the  resolution. It is also why the National School Boards Association  supports this resolution, and it is why H.J. Res. 57 is supported by  Citizens Against Government Waste.   I am confident that Congress will continue working in a bipartisan  manner to empower our State and local communities to take the lead in  accountability. There will be accountability. By putting a stop to the  Obama administration's flawed and overreaching accountability  regulation, however, we can keep the promise we made to reduce the  Federal role, restore local control, and ensure all children receive  the high-quality education that they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
