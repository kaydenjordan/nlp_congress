 Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from Delaware  and his comments on trade.   I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Ohio, Sherrod Brown,  be permitted to address the Chamber for a brief tribute following my  remarks.    I am on the floor today to talk about international  trade. What a week it has been. In the same few days, we are seeing the  culmination of nearly 3 years of effort by this administration to  deliver wins for American workers, for businesses, for farmers, and for  consumers with regard to our three biggest trading partners, China,  Canada, and Mexico.   This is a big week. While the media is focused on impeachment--and I  can say that because as I walked in that is all the reporters wanted to  talk about--here we are on the floor talking about something that  directly affects the constituents we represent. I think it is very  positive in all three areas--China, Canada, and Mexico. In a way, it is  like  [[Page S231]]  the World Series and the Super Bowl of trade all in the same week  because these are big agreements that make a big difference.   The U.S.-Mexico agreement is being finalized, and it will be voted on  tomorrow.   Second today is the signing of phase one of the China agreement,  something many of us have been focused on over the past few years and  wondered whether we would get here, and here we are.   As a former trade lawyer and as a former U.S. Trade Representative  under George W. Bush and as someone on the Trade Committee, which is  the Finance Committee here, I follow these issues closely. Most  significantly, I come from Ohio, which is a State that depends on trade  and depends on that trade being fair to our workers, our farmers, our  service providers, and our small businesses. We have a lot of  manufacturing and a lot of agriculture. In fact, 25 percent of our  State's factory workers have export jobs. One out of every three acres  planted in Ohio is planted for export. Think about that. When you drive  through our beautiful State and you see the corn and the soybeans out  there in the field, one out of every three acres is being planted to be  exported somewhere else. That is great for our farmers. It gives them  markets, and it raises prices for their product at a time when they  really need it. By the way, these trade jobs are good jobs too. Jobs  dependent on trade pay, on average, about 16 percent more than other  jobs, and they have better benefits. We like to be able to send more to  the rest of the world.   We have about 5 percent of the world's population in this country. We  have to be sure that with 25 percent of the world's economy here and 5  percent of the people, that we are selling stuff overseas to the other  95 percent. It is always in our interest to open up overseas markets  for our workers, our farmers, our services, and our service providers.  While promoting those exports, we need to ensure that we are protecting  American jobs from unfair trade and from imports that would unfairly  undercut our workers and our farmers.   Simply put, we want a level playing field. With that level playing  field, where you get fair and reciprocal treatment from other  countries, we will do just fine.   American workers and businesses can compete, and they can win if it  is fair. That is all we are asking for. To me, the sweet spot is  balanced trade, where we are able to send our exports overseas without  high tariffs and other barriers, and we are able to see imports coming  in fairly traded into the United States. If we do that, we will be  fine.   The good thing about this week is that both of these agreements--the  new USMCA, which replaces NAFTA, and this phase one of the China  agreement--are exactly focused on how to have balanced trade. At times,  recently, other countries have been wondering whether the United States  was going to make progress on trade, to be frank, so this week is also  important because the world is watching. What the world is seeing is  that we can fulfill our stated interest in renegotiating and improving  trade agreements and trade relationships.   Concluding these two agreements proves that the United States can get  to ``yes'' on these very big issues. We are able to work through our  partisan differences here at home. We just saw this on the floor this  afternoon where Democrats and Republicans alike are talking about their  support for USMCA. In tough negotiations with our trading partners--we  had some tough negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and China--we can  reach outcomes that benefit our country and help to create that more  effective balance for American workers.   There is, perhaps, no better example of this balance than USMCA.  Without it, by the way, we go back to the status quo, which would be  NAFTA. That is a 25-year-old agreement that had to be updated. It just  doesn't reflect the realities of a modern economy. Thanks to important  measures designed to strengthen our economy, create jobs, and increase  market access for American exports, this new USMCA will help level that  playing field we talked about.   First of all, USMCA means American jobs and economic growth. The  independent International Trade Commission has studied it. They have  said this new agreement will create at least 176,000 new jobs and will  grow our economy. It also says that with regard to the auto industry,  it will create tens of thousands of jobs. That is, again, very  important to Ohio. We are a big State for auto production. These jobs  are going to mean a lot to workers in my State.   Part of the way it is going to create jobs is by leveling the playing  field with enforceable labor standards. We just heard about this from  the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Ohio, about how this  agreement has new enforceable standards with regard to labor.   It also, though, has higher content requirements for U.S.-made steel  and auto parts. This is important. I will give you an example. USMCA  requires that 70 percent of the steel and 75 percent of overall content  in USMCA-compliant vehicles come from USMCA countries. In other words,  other countries can't come in and take advantage of the lower tariffs  that we are providing under USMCA by adding too much to the content of  those vehicles. The 75-percent overall content requirement is up from  62.5 percent in NAFTA. That makes that 75 percent the highest  percentage of any trade agreement we have. It means more jobs in the  United States, in particular, and fewer imports from countries like  China, countries like Germany, countries like Japan that otherwise  would come in and take advantage of this.   Some have criticized these content provisions as being somehow  protectionist. I disagree. We are saying to these countries that if you  want freer trade with us, enter into a trade agreement, lower your  barriers, and give us access to your markets as we are giving Mexico  and Canada access to our markets. That is what a trade agreement is all  about. If you don't want to do that, you shouldn't be able to free ride  on our USMCA. I think this makes sense. Why should Japan or China or  Germany be a free rider on our agreement with Canada and Mexico?   This will incentivize good jobs in America, but it also incentivizes  these other countries to enter into trade agreements with us. They can  see that if you do an agreement with the United States, it is balanced  and fair. You will have some benefit as well. The International Trade  Commission expects that USMC will grow our economy by double the gross  domestic product of that projected to be increased under what is called  the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I tell you that because TPP, Trans- Pacific Partnership, is one that Members on the other side of the aisle  have talked about as being such a great agreement. This grows the  economy by more than double based on the ITPF estimate. Again, this is  a big deal.    USMCA also means important new rules of the road for online sales. So  much of our commerce today takes place over the internet, but there is  nothing to protect it or promote it in NAFTA. Because it was done 25  years ago when there was hardly any internet business, it doesn't have  any protection.   This USMCA was written to fix that. It does. It prohibits data  localization requirements by banning tariffs on data online and by  raising the de minimis level on customs duties for sales to Mexico and  Canada. This means they can't require the servers to be in Canada or  Mexico, as an example, for our digital economy here in the United  States, which is one of our great advantages. For a lot of small  companies in Ohio and around the country and for startups that do  business online and rely on smaller shipments, this is very important.  The relief from the customs burdens and also the data localization  requirements and the inability for other countries to put tariffs on  data is really important. This is great for us as a country.   The third thing I want to mention is that American farmers are going  to see unprecedented levels of access to new markets in Canada and  Mexico under USMCA. Between bad weather, low prices even going into the  bad weather, and the tariffs that were in place to get to this  agreement with China, in particular, farmers have been hit pretty hard.  So this is the light at the end of the tunnel. This gives them a  chance, under USMCA, to get some new markets. That is why nearly 1,000  farm  [[Page S232]]  groups around the country have announced publicly that they strongly  support this agreement.   A lot of politicians and pundits have their views on who won the  negotiations over USMCA that we will vote on here tomorrow on the  floor. You can go back and forth on that, but in my view, thanks to the  hard work of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and thanks to  President Trump pushing on this, the winner here is the American  people. That is who I think benefits the most. They are going to  benefit from a new, more modernized trade agreement that will replace  an agreement that has shown its age with unenforceable labor and  environmental standards, nonexistent digital economy provisions, and  outdated rules of origin provisions that allow more automobiles and  more auto parts to be manufactured overseas rather than being  manufactured here in the United States.   I think the American people benefit. We all benefit. I am glad we are  going to finally have a chance to vote on this landmark trade  agreement. I urge that tomorrow we pass it on a bipartisan basis, and I  think we will. Getting this to the finish line is a significant  achievement but to also do it signing onto the phase one agreement with  China today is really incredible.   Again, it has been a strong week. I want to congratulate Bob  Lighthizer, the Trade Rep, President Trump, and others who worked to  bring this win to the finish line.   When I was U.S. Trade Rep for George W. Bush, we conducted the first- ever economic relationship review with China. We issued a report, and  it concluded that our trade relationship with China lacked equity,  durability, and balance. Well, 13 years later, China still doesn't play  by the rules. So much of that continues. One reason the trade deficit  with China is going to be the largest in the world is because of that.  In 2018, we sent China about $180 billion in exports, and they sent us  about $560 billion in exports. That means we had a resulting trade  deficit of about $380 billion--the biggest trade deficit in the history  of the world. That is a problem, but it is more than just the trade  deficit. That isn't the only way to measure trade.   Beijing routinely uses subsidies, state-owned enterprises, and a lack  of transparency by government control on their own economy in order to  surpass the United States as the world's economic and innovation  leader. China's current policies undercut critical commitments China  made, both to the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and to us and  other countries--agreements that they would open up their market,  protect intellectual property rights, adhere to international  recognized labor rights, and meet its WTO commitments on unfair trade  practices such as subsidies, which they provide.   I encourage you to read the U.S. Trade Representative's section 301  report on China. That is its basis for this phase one agreement and the  basis for the administration putting those higher tariffs in place on  Chinese products over the past couple of years. The report notes that  in 2016, the multilateral Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, OECD, ranked China the fourth most restrictive investment  climate in the world, despite them being the second largest economy in  the world. Based on this OECD report, China's investment climate is  nearly four times more restrictive than that of the United States. That  is why we needed to take some action and have a negotiation with China  to come up with something that was mutually beneficial.   I have supported these 301 actions by President Trump to create this  more level playing field for American workers, farmers, and business  owners. The only significant leverage we had to be able to do that, by  the way, was by controlling access to our own market by raising  tariffs. Higher tariffs had collateral consequences, and we have seen  that for our consumers and other countries. They have been a necessary  evil to hold China's feet to the fire and force them to the negotiating  table and to get the result we have seen today.   These tough measures are now paying off. Think about it in terms of  what I said before--equity, durability, and balance. In the interests  of a more balanced relationship, phase one directly addresses that $380  billion trade deficit we talked about. China has agreed to increase its  purchases of American products by at least $200 billion over the next 2  years, with additional increases likely in the future. That is going to  help reduce our trade deficit and provide some relief, particularly in  the agricultural, manufacturing, and energy sectors.   The agreement includes provisions to make our relationship more  equitable. That includes new commitments on intellectual property  protection, new obligations on tech transfer, and a discipline on  currency manipulation, similar to that which is in the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement. Specifically, Beijing committed to eliminate pressure  on U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to Chinese  firms as a condition of doing business in China. This is a big deal,  and it is a critical step in addressing the IP theft China has used to  fuel its economic rise. Chinese companies aren't forced to hand over  their patents as a condition of doing business here in America and  American companies shouldn't be forced to do the same in China.   We will also be able to keep a closer eye on China's currency  manipulation. When the Treasury Department found evidence of  manipulation to boost Chinese exports, they labeled Chinese a currency  manipulator for the first time since 1994. That designation was just  lifted because of phase 1. This new agreement contains new transparency  and accountability commitments to ensure that American trade enforcers  can better monitor future manipulation.    The phase 1 agreement is a first good step toward creating a more  balanced and equitable relationship between our two countries, but our  trade relationship will remain durable only if we enforce these  agreements. That is why it is also very significant that this agreement  includes the option to reimpose tariffs should China fail to live up to  the commitments it has made.   Enforcement is critical. Just as the rest of the world is watching  our success at getting to ``yes'' on these trade agreements, it is also  watching how aggressively we are going to enforce these commitments.  That is why it is imperative that the United States utilize this  enforcement process assertively and swiftly should we find evidence  that China has violated its commitments. Congress is watching.   With such a big day for trade, especially only a couple of weeks into  the new year, it would be easy to ask if anything else is left for the  rest of the year. My answer is, yes, there is a lot. We should  celebrate our accomplishments tonight, but tomorrow continues to bring  a host of challenges and opportunities to advance a bold trade agenda.   Most importantly, the next step is to negotiate the phase 2 agreement  with China that will address the additional structural issues I  mentioned earlier--the subsidies, the state-owned enterprises, and the  lack of transparency--that make doing business in China an uphill  battle. Resolving these issues will be critical to ensuring that our  two economies are playing by the same set of rules, not different sets  of rules.   Between the USMCA and this phase 1 agreement, 2020 has already been a  significant year for trade, but there is even more progress we are set  to make. I look forward to phase 2 negotiations with Japan this spring,  especially regarding new market access for ``Made in America''  automobiles. I look forward to potential FTA talks with Switzerland and  with the United Kingdom post-Brexit--new trade agreements to open up  more market access. We also want to ensure that the extension of the  WTO moratorium of tariffs on data continues, and I hope we will see  renewed efforts at WTO reform. We need to address America's  longstanding fundamental concerns about the appellate body, special and  differential status, and the decline of the WTO's negotiating function.  We have lots to do.   I hope Congress will consider new legislation to toughen our anti- dumping and countervailing duty laws this year to crack down on trade  cheats, and I hope we will pass the Trade Security Act to return  section 232 to its original purpose of protecting genuine national  security threats.   Clearly, there is a lot of work we can do in 2020, and I look forward  to it. Yet we should pause today and congratulate the Trump  administration on these two successes we have talked  [[Page S233]]  about. I have long advocated for balanced trade that prioritizes market  opening and tough enforcement, and I believe that both the USMCA and  the China agreement embody this philosophy of balanced trade. Most  importantly, I believe our country is better off because of it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.                           Remembering Chris Allen
