 Mr. Speaker, Chairman Nadler, ranking members, this is an  important piece of legislation. How do I know that? Because the people  have told us that.   Every time they have had the opportunity to vote in America, they  have voted to do this. They know that filling our prisons and creating  criminal records for people who use marijuana--and knowing full well  that if they are people of color, the possibilities of adverse  consequences are geometrically greater.   I tell my colleagues, I am tired of hearing this argument that, ``Oh,  my goodness, we are doing this. We ought to be doing something else.''   We are all working on issues of great concern not only to us but to  the global community: on the war in Ukraine; on the criminal activities  that Putin is subjecting us to; on inflation, a critical problem for  all of our people. We are working on that. We are having trouble  getting some legislation in the Senate  [[Page H4094]]  that will bring down inflation and bring down costs for the American  people--not on our side of the aisle.   So, when I hear this argument, ``Oh, we ought to be doing this. We  ought to be doing that. We ought to be doing the other,'' this is an  important, fair piece of legislation, fair for the American people.   I thank Chairman Nadler. I thank the Judiciary Committee. I thank  Members on my side of the aisle. I thank Barbara Lee, who is walking  down the aisle right now, who has worked so hard on this.   Why did she work so hard on it? Because she knows the extraordinary  unfairness of the application of existing laws. You don't have to argue  that. Just look at the statistics, and you find that to be the case.   Chairman Nadler has long been a champion of decriminalizing marijuana  and addressing the systemic injustices and inequities resulting from  the war on drugs. I was a supporter of the war on drugs. I have been  here a long time.    The gentleman who spoke about this as a gateway drug, it is not a  gateway drug. I have been convinced of that.   Marijuana has been legalized in 19 States. That is 40 percent of our  States, save one, and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana is  legal in 36 States. This is not out of the ordinary. This is what the  American people tell us they think is the appropriate thing to do.   Now, for some in this House, those who are treated with inequality,  particularly in this area, you are on your own. Make it out for  yourself. We are not going to address it because we have other issues.   Of course, we have other issues, and we pass bills on those-- unfortunately, not with much support from the other side of the aisle.   Despite the changes in State laws and social norms around the usage  of marijuana, its use remains illegal under Federal law. The gentleman  who is presiding over the House today comes from a State that has said  that is not good policy. Now, that is not some wacko coastal State. It  is Colorado.   Despite changes in State laws and social norms, as I have said, its  use remains illegal under Federal law, often resulting in devastating  consequences. Hear me, my colleagues: devastating consequences for  Black, Latino, and Native communities.   Now, I am not any of those. I would tell you, when I was in college  in the 1800s, it was alcohol. We were not the generation of drugs; it  was alcohol. It devastated the lives of literally hundreds of thousands  of young people. But nobody cried out to make it illegal. They tried  that, of course, in the twenties.   According to the Center for American Progress, Black Americans are  four times more likely than White Americans to be arrested for  marijuana possession, even though they use it at similar rates.   The gentleman who spoke asked why we are dealing with this. For the  same reason our Founders said that we believe in equality, that all  men--and they surely would add women today--are created equal and ought  to be treated fairly and equally. Four times more convictions and  prosecutions for people of color--that is why we are dealing with this,  because it is unfair in America.   Those criminal records can haunt people of color and impact the  trajectory of their lives and careers indefinitely. I regret that there  are some Members of our Congress who apparently think that is not  worthy of attention.   It can result in difficulty in finding employment, difficulty in  finding housing, denial of access to government benefits, denial of  financial aid at colleges and universities, and denial of the right to  vote. That is why we are dealing with this, because the adverse  consequences to people are substantial and negative, and negative not  only for them but for our country.   The legislation before us would remove marijuana from the list of  scheduled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, allowing our  police departments--which we want to fund, by the way, so get off that  line that we want to defund the police--allow our police departments to  focus on serious crimes. The legislation before us would remove  marijuana from that list.   The bill already, by the way, includes a requirement that a study  will be conducted to understand the societal impacts of decriminalizing  marijuana, including the impact on juveniles, education,  transportation, veterans, employment, and many others.   This bill also expunges the records of individuals convicted of  nonviolent--let me repeat that--nonviolent cannabis offenses and  provides resources for job training, reentry services, and youth  recreation and mentoring programs.   Now, if you take the position that all of these people are on their  own and want no help from us or get no help from us, then perhaps you  don't care.   This bill also addresses the disproportionate economic impact of the  war on drugs by providing access to small-business grants, opening up  the legal marketplace to communities that have been largely excluded.   This bill is a matter of justice and equal opportunity. It is about  addressing systemic inequities and reforming our criminal justice  system so that Americans and America can become a better, stronger,  more fair, and more just America.   That is why we are spending time on this bill today.   I thank my friend one more time, Chairman Nadler, for his leadership  on this bill. I also thank Mr. Neal for helping us get this bill to the  floor. I also thank Barbara Lee, my dear friend.   Barbara Lee and I have been working for some years now on how to lift  people out of poverty into the middle class. We talk a lot about the  middle class, and the way you grow the middle class is to let people  who aren't in it in it so they can contribute to making a better,  stronger America.                                time  1000    This bill will help that because it will take the stigma away from  four times as many people of color being stigmatized by our laws.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, support  this bill. The people of Mississippi supported this bill when they went  to the polls and voted--not on this bill, that is not accurate--but on  the decriminalization of marijuana, because they knew that it was  neither necessary to be criminalized, and they knew the adverse  impacts.   I don't ask you to support something the people of California did or  the people of New York, or even Maryland, but think about supporting  the people of Mississippi, who voted on a policy that would make a fair  and more just America.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the Republican whip  from Louisiana, for yielding.   On Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m., Madam Speaker, for  morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   The House will consider several bills under suspension of the rules.  The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   The House will consider a resolution from the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol recommending the  House ask the Justice Department to charge Peter Navarro and Dan  Scavino, Jr., with criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to  testify about their actions and knowledge relating to the violent  effort to prevent the certification of the 2020 election.   Additionally, Madam Speaker, the House may consider legislation  related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional legislative items are  possible.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that question,  and I have been thinking about that because he asks that regularly.   I particularly have been thinking about that question in the context  of the fact that we have so much available acreage on which to produce  oil and gas currently permitted. When I say a number, we are talking  about literally millions of acres.   Madam Speaker, there are 9,000 unused, approved permits right now.  There are 26 million acres of public land available right now. There  are 11 million acres of Federal waters available. That is 37 million  acres in total.   In addition to that, 80 million acres in the Gulf were put up for  auction last fall, 2021, under President Biden, which was the largest  lease sale in U.S. history. Unfortunately, the private sector bought  only 1.7 acres out of 80 million.   Frankly, it appears to be that no matter what we pass, no matter how  many permits we make available, there is not an appetite in the private  sector for producing more.   I say that in the context of the producers. To their credit, they are  claiming victory. They are claiming victory at the extraordinary  profits that they have gotten. They are buying back stocks. They are  paying large dividends. But they are not producing more product.   Now, it may well be that they think the price is pretty high, and  they are making a good profit and don't need to do anything more. But  the gentleman's questions, Madam Speaker, continually imply that there  is some impediment to producing more product.   Of course, the United States is the largest producer of oil and  natural gas in the world, and we have increased very substantially over  the past few years in production.   I say to the gentleman the committees are looking at the bills the  gentleman refers to. But in terms of production, the United States is  producing 18.61 billion barrels per day, which is 20 percent of the  world's production.   The President announced, just the other day, the release of a million  barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is going to  be 180 million barrels over the next 6 months.   In fact, when he did that, I don't know whether it had direct impact,  but as the gentleman knows, the price on the global market has come  down. I think it came down $7 in the last month or $7 in the last week.   The administration is clearly making some substantial policy changes,  one of which is use it or lose it. I said there were 9,000 permitted,  ready to go, ready to drill, right now, today.   The President has said, in his policies: We have given all these  permits. If you are not going to use these permits, then you are either  going to pay a fee or give them back, and we are going ask other people  who want to produce more product.   You would think in the capitalist system which we have, which I  strongly, strongly support, that given the price of oil being so high,  people would look for more product, unless they want to limit the  availability of product and, therefore, keep the price even higher.   I don't know which is the option there, but I will tell the gentleman  that the President has activated the Defense Production Act, looking  for critical materials, not just oil, but lithium, nickel, cobalt,  graphite, manganese, for all sorts of things that we need. The  President has taken very, very strong steps.    In addition to that, which is very important, Madam Speaker, what we  have done is passed legislation which will, in the relatively near  term--not tomorrow, not next week, not next month--make us less and  less reliant on overseas suppliers of energy that clearly have shown  themselves to be not reliable and clearly have been seen to be people  who want to create a monopoly, a cartel, so that they can keep prices  unusually high and, of course, in the process continue to assault the  environment and damage the climate of this global community, which will  have an extraordinary cost.   In answer to the gentleman's question, the committees are looking at  those bills that you mentioned. I will mention to them again looking at  those bills.   Very frankly, any implication that we are not producing more product  because there is some constraint by the Federal Government on  production is simply not accurate, Madam Speaker. Again, 9,000 leases;  37 million acres available--26 million on public lands--permitted,  ready to go, and they have not been drilled on.   The President is saying: If you don't drill, if you are not going to  produce more product--we want more product. We need more product in the  short term. If you don't want to produce it, then we are going to give  those leases to somebody else.                                time  1245     Millions, millions.    Well, I am not surprised that the gentleman, and many of  the bills that he refers to, want to undermine the regulation to  protect the health and welfare of the American people which those are  designed to do, and most of which I think, you know, the gentleman's  side of the aisle did not support or enforce when they were in charge  of the Presidency.   Madam Speaker, all of that rhetoric about the President doesn't want  to do this, doesn't want to do this, 80 million acres. 1.7 million  acres bid on. If, in fact, people were looking for additional ways and  means to produce at a price that is historic, they would do so. And he  dismisses, Madam Speaker, the 9,000 leases that exist. Now, maybe----    Madam Speaker, yes. If, in fact, that was the reason for  non-production, we all would have heard of the fact when we are not  producing, and the stock market would have heard about that, and the  companies would be lamenting the fact that they are not producing more.   In fact, when you read their reports, they are indicating we are  making very high profits. We are not putting money into production at  this point in time, and we are buying back stocks, and we are paying  high dividends.   I do not criticize them for making what is a business decision. That  business decision, however, has had an adverse effect. Why? Because we  are not moving quickly enough to not be reliant on fossil fuels which  the President, in his remarks, wants to get to.   We have a disagreement between our parties, Madam Speaker, on that  issue. Drill, baby, drill. That has been the mantra forever. And it was  73 degrees yesterday. And our planet is hurting.   The trees on my property produced blossoms long before they usually  do. They are confused. But not only are they confused; it is dangerous  for agriculture. It is dangerous for human beings. It is dangerous for  animal life. It is dangerous for our seas. And we have a difference of  opinion.    That is what the President was speaking to, that we need to move  towards that end, but he understands, as we all understand, that fossil  fuels are necessary right now.   Natural gas is--we are the biggest producer of natural gas in the  world. We are the biggest producer of oil in the world. That hasn't  stopped. And, yes, we need to get to, as our Build Back Better bill  does, that none of the Republicans voted for, it gets to a reliance on  fuel that will not help Putin.   Now, there are some people in the Republican party who apparently  think Putin is a pretty good guy. He is a genius. He is this, that, and  the other.   We don't think so. We think he is a war criminal. And we think there  are some other folks who are providing us with oil on whom we ought not  to rely, not only for the global health, but also for our national  security.   And to the extent that we invest in alternatives which, by the way,  every energy company in America, and I think the world, probably--I am  not going to say that, but in America--that I thought wants to do. They  are all doing research on alternative energy sources because they know  that at some point, we need to get off of the reliance on fossil fuel.  That is what the President was speaking about.   But he leased--he put 80 million acres in the Gulf for lease. Well,  why would anybody put 80 million if there was no more drilling? He put  80 million acres, and only 1.7 million the private sector even sort of  nodded at, before any tests, before any knowledge. You know, they need  the lease to test it.   So I say to my friend, we are going to need fossil fuel, and we need  to bring gasoline prices down. But, very frankly, we are not going to  bring prices down if we don't produce more product, and the focus is  not higher profits, buying back stock, and making high dividends. There  is no incentive to do that.                                time  1300    We need to do it. I have urged the President to talk to the leaders  of the energy companies in our country. They are part of the success of  America. We are at war. We are at war with Putin, a war criminal, a  tyrant, and that has destabilized world markets; since the last month  up a dollar. That is Putin's dollar we are paying. We are paying that  dollar because of Putin.   Madam Speaker, the whip mentioned Putin as an aside; just as an  aside, as if the contemplation, as the President pointed out, Madam  Speaker, that Russia was going to invade Ukraine. Even Mr. Zelenskyy  thought maybe you are overstating the case. Extraordinarily courageous  leader in Ukraine.   So even in preparation for the instability that this war that Putin  has criminally undertaken without any provocation--murdering people,  women and children, people in hospitals, people in schools--yes, oil  prices have gone up because the world market was very concerned about  this. We don't control it here.   So although it is a dollar since he invaded, I am convinced that a  substantial amount of the increase was caused by the instability of his  threat. Marshalling troops at the border of Ukraine and Belarus from  Russia destabilized the market, no doubt about it.   I tell the gentleman again, there is an ability to drill. There is an  ability to do research and discover and do the seismic tests. There is  that ability now. I don't accept the gentleman's premise that there is  a roadblock.   The President does not want to expand. You understand that. He has  said that; you quoted him. He wants to get to alternative energy  sources. He wants to save the planet. I share that view with him. But  we are going to have to have fossil fuels in the short term because we  won't be able to power our economy or our people for some years to  come.   Hopefully, by 2035, we will have a substantial reduction, and  hopefully, by 2050, a very, very substantial reduction, perhaps zero.  But in the short term, we are going to need a resource that has been a  critical resource for the growth of our economy and other economies  around the world.   Nobody is criticizing those who produce that. I say nobody. At least  I am not criticizing them. But I really believe that we could get more  production under present circumstances, and that is what we ought to be  doing.    Mr. Biden didn't make that decision; the courts made that  decision.
