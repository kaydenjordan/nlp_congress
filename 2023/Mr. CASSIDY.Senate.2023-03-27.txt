 Mr. President, last Tuesday, President Biden formally  nominated Julie Su to be the Secretary of the Department of Labor. Now,  as ranking member of the committee that oversees her nomination, I felt  it was important to express some concerns that have only grown since  her previous nomination.   Deputy Secretary Su has a troubling record and is currently  overseeing the Department of Labor's development of anti-worker  regulations dismantling the gig economy.   This does not inspire confidence in her current position, let alone  confidence that she should be promoted. Ms. Su's record now and in her  previous position as secretary for the California Labor and Workforce  Development Agency deserves scrutiny. I look forward to a full review  and hearing process for her nomination.   In California, Ms. Su was a top architect of AB5, a controversial law  that removed the flexibility of individuals to work as independent  contractors.   Now, independent contractors, you can call them freelancers. They  make their own hours, and they choose the type of work they wish to do.  I was recently taking a Lyft. The driver told me he was able to clear  $500 a day. He has Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash on his phone. He flips  between the apps, he chooses the job from whichever one is immediately  available, and through it all, he clears 500 bucks a day. I said, wait  a second, man, you gotta pay your gas, you gotta pay your insurance;  are you still--Oh, yeah, I clear 500 a day.   Now, if he is working five days a week, he is doing $10,000 a month.  Independent contractors are shielded from forced or coerced  unionization that could strip that flexibility away. This, of course,  has made eliminating this classification a top priority for large labor  unions who benefit from more workers being forced to pay mandatory  union dues.   Now, it is important to note, even in California, AB5 is extremely  unpopular. And 59 percent of California voters supported a measure to  exempt ride-share drivers from AB5.   The law is so flawed, the Governor and State legislature have had to  pass multiple laws to exempt over 100 occupations. The statutory  exemptions are longer than the text of AB5 itself.   But Ms. Su has taken her support for this anti-worker, pro-union  policy to the U.S. Department of Labor. During her tenure as Deputy  Secretary of Labor, essentially the Agency's chief operating officer,  the Biden administration pushed to eliminate independent contracting  via Federal Executive rulemaking.   Now, there was never any hope of getting AB 5--an AB 5-like law  through Congress, so they pursued their goals through regulation.   And, if finalized, the new regulation strips 21 million Americans of  their ability to classify themselves as independent contractors and  enjoy the flexibility this provides.   This regulation would undermine the business model of services like  Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash that provide valuable services and give  drivers the ability and freedom to set their own hours and even hop  between States.   I got off at the airport in New Orleans, Louis Armstrong  International Airport, and the guy that picks me up has Maryland  plates: Oh, yeah, I moved here like six months ago, wanted to come down  for jazz fest, and so I just notified the different--you know, Uber and  Lyft, and now I am down here working instead of back where I started.   We are talking maximum flexibility. By the way, it is not just the  Uber and Lyft drivers affected; truckers are severely impacted.   Many truckers are independent owner-operators. They own their own  trucks. This regulation could devastate the freedom of these truckers.  It could potentially impact the supply chain in the process, as  trucking moves more than 72 percent of the goods in the United States  annually.    Now, as a conservative from a conservative State--but I think as an  American from any State--I can say that we don't need the application  of a law from one of the most liberal States to the entire Nation.   A law rejected in California is not a policy to be pursued on a  Federal level. We need to support the right of workers and their  ability to choose what is best for them, not put them in a straitjacket  to serve other people's goals.   I also want to hear Ms. Su's position on DOL's effort to uproot the  franchise model, which employs over 8 million Americans. Deputy  Secretary Su has made public comments indicating that she will pursue  attempts at DOL to forcibly impose a joint employer classification on  the almost 800,000 franchises operating in our communities,  [[Page S968]]  the same as any other small business. Sadly, franchisors with liability  for thousands of franchise owners that actually operate the small  business would be a sure way to destroy the system of franchising, a  model which has allowed those underrepresented in the business  community--women, people of color--to have the ability to live the  American dream, becoming successful small business owners as they help  create jobs, lifting other workers out of poverty.   No one is surprised that the joint employer rule is a major priority  for large labor unions. It is easier for them to pressure one company  to unionize to increase their union dues than to pressure thousands of  independent businesses.   The priority of the Biden administration should not be to do whatever  makes it easier to forcibly and coercively unionize workers while  undermining the business models of the establishments they work for. It  should be to increase individual freedom and opportunity.   What comes to mind, there is a fellow north of Baton Rouge who moved  here from West Africa to attend LSU. After he attended LSU, he became a  citizen, and now he is a franchisor for multiple outlets. And he talks  about the American dream: coming here from Nigeria as a transfer  student; getting his citizenship; and now being an owner, involved in  rotary, running for political office--a better American than most  Americans. Somehow, this threatens the Department of Labor.   Now, in addition to our policies, we should ask questions about how  Ms. Su presided over a mismanaged California unemployment insurance  program during the pandemic and why California paid $31 billion in  fraudulent claims when she chose to suspend the eligibility  determination process.   Some of these payments went to inmates and known domestic and  international criminals. To put into context, the Department of Labor's  requested budget is $15 billion and employs more than 17,000 people.  This means that Ms. Su lost more than double the annual budget of the  Agency she will be responsible for managing in Washington, DC. This  calls into question her qualifications as a manager.   Unfortunately, there will be many reasons to be concerned about Ms.  Su's nomination to head the Department of Labor, and I look forward to  a full hearing process to further discuss.                                Student Loans    Mr. President, today we introduced the Congressional Review Act,  Resolution of Disapproval, to overturn the Biden administration's  unfair student loan schemes that transfer the burden of $400 billion in  Federal student loans from those who willingly took on that debt--and  took on that debt to get a degree that would help them make more  money--to American taxpayers who, perhaps, never went to college or  already fulfilled their commitment to pay off their loans, oftentimes  sacrificing to do so.   The resolution would also end the pause on student loan payments,  which, by August, will have cost taxpayers almost $200 billion.  President Biden has extended this pause six times, for a total of 31  months, far beyond the original justification of an ongoing pandemic. I  am joined by 38 of my colleagues in offering this resolution.   Last August, President Biden announced his plan to cancel up to  $20,000 in Federal student loans from most borrowers and to extend the  payment and interest accrual pause in student loans via executive fiat.   Make no mistake, this reckless student loan scheme does not forgive  debt. It does not forgive debt at all. It just transfers the burden  from those who willingly took out these loans for college--and, again,  in order to make more money when they graduate--to Americans who never  attended college and who have already paid off their loans.   And I would ask: Where is the forgiveness for the guy who didn't go  to college but bought a truck, went to work, and is now working to pay  off that loan? Is his truck loan going to be forgiven? It will not be.   And what about the woman who paid off her student loans but is now  struggling to afford her mortgage? Does she get a refund to help her  with the mortgage?   Is the administration providing them relief? And the answer is no.  Instead, the administration had to not only pay their bills, but the  bills for those who decided to go to college in order to make more  money and then have their student loans forgiven. This is irresponsible  and unfair.   And, by the way, the plan does nothing to address the problems that  created the debt in the first place. It doesn't hold colleges or  universities accountable for rising costs. According to the College  Board, in the last 30 years, tuition and fees have jumped at private  nonprofit colleges by 80 percent and at public 4-year institutions by  124 percent.   And it doesn't ensure that students are prepared for life after  college. Indeed, it creates a terrible moral hazard that tells students  that Federal student loans aren't real commitments and tells colleges  that no matter how high they raise their prices or what product they  produce, the Federal Government will cover the tab, courtesy of the  American taxpayer.   Our resolution prevents average Americans, the 87 percent of whom  currently have no student loans, from being stuck with a policy that  the administration is doing, not to be fair to all but, rather, to  favor the few.   Our resolution also protects the rule of law, which President Biden  must know he is violating.   During Supreme Court arguments on the legality of the student loan  forgiveness in February, Justice Roberts clearly indicated that if $400  billion was to be spent on student loan cancellation, it would and  should require congressional approval. That has not been given.   It is a clear example of this administration attempting to subvert  Congress for what appears to be purely political purposes. It is a  wildly dangerous precedent if left unchecked.   For Americans who cannot afford their debt or want a proactive  approach to paying off their loan commitments, Congress has already  authorized--again, let me just say this. For someone who can't afford  their debt or wishes to be proactive to pay off their loan commitments,  Congress has already authorized 31 different programs to help pay or  forgive student loans.   I ask unanimous consent that the list of Federal programs already  available to Americans who are struggling to repay their loans, work in  public service, or who are in high-demand fields be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          The Biden Administration's Reckless Student Loan Scheme         There are already 31 active student loan repayment and       forgiveness programs.           Three Full or Partial Student Loan Forgiveness Programs       Direct Loan PSLF--        Government organizations at any level (U.S. federal, state,       local, or tribal)--this includes the U.S. military        Not-for-profit organizations that are tax-exempt under       Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code        Other nonprofit organizations that provide specified types       of service (e.g., public health, public safety)      Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers--        Teachers who:        teacher in a school or education service agency serving       students from low-income families;        special education teacher, including teachers of infants,       toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities; or        teacher in the fields of mathematics, science, foreign       languages, or bilingual education, or in any other field of       expertise determined by a state education agency to have a       shortage of qualified teachers in that state.      Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation--        Early childhood education provider        Employee at a child or family services agency        Faculty member at a tribal college or university        Firefighter        Law enforcement officer        Librarian with master's degree at Title I school        Military service        Nurse or medical technician        Professional provider of early intervention (disability)       services        Public defender        Speech pathologist with master's degree at Title I school        Volunteer service (AmeriCorps VISTA or Peace Corps)        Teacher in a low-income school        Teachers of math, science, foreign language, bilingual       education, or other shortage subject areas  [[Page S969]]         Special education teachers      23 active loan repayment programs for:        12 active repayment programs for federal employees in the       following areas:        Senate employees        House Employees        Congressional Budget Office        Government Employee        Defense Acquisition Workforce--hard to staff civilian       acquisition positions        Armed Forces: Enlisted members on Active Duty in Military       Specialties        Members of the Selected Reserves        Health Professionals Officers Serving in the Selected       Reserve with Wartime Critical Medical Skill Shortages        Chaplains Serving in the Selected Reserves        Education Debt Reduction Program--VA program for hard to       staff areas        National Institutes of Health Intramural--Biomedical or       biobehavioral research careers        National and Community Service grant program--Americorps      11 Federal Student Loan Repayment Programs for broad           employment needs or shortages        Veterinary Medicine--USDA        Indian Health Service--        National Health Service Corps--Health Resources and       Services Administration (HRSA)        National Health Service corps students to service--HRSA        National health service corps state--HRSA        Loan repayments for health professional school faculty--      HRSA        General, pediatric, and public health dentistry faculty       loan repayment--HRSA        Nursing education LRP--HRSA        Nurse Faculty--HRSA        National Institutes of Health Extramural--NIH        John R. Justice loan repayment for prosecutors and public       defenders--DOJ    Mr. President, they range from total forgiveness under  public student loan forgiveness, the PSLF; Stafford loans for teachers;  and Perkins loans cancellations for law enforcement officers, military,  early childhood educators, and social workers, to name few.   There are also repayment programs for high-demand fields, where  education is specialized and the need is a public good. For example,  through the Department of Health and Human Services, therapists and  behavioral health providers who are needed to help our children as we  face a mental health crisis are eligible for loan forgiveness.   In addition, there are repayment policies related to the income of an  individual. There are five different programs to keep payments low  compared to an individual's income and to cap the total time for  repayment.   These are quite different from this mass transfer of debt under this  reckless student loan scheme, which forgets that these existing  programs were set up to target limited taxpayer resources to benefit  those using their degrees to serve and to fill broader public needs or  who can demonstrate that they, themselves, have a personal, individual  need.   By the way, what benefit does the GI bill hold when students can just  wait to have their student loans forgiven? Why contribute to your  community by teaching in a public school while getting your Federal  loans paid off through your service when you can just wait for  President Biden to forgive your loans? Irresponsible policies like  President Biden's student loan scheme weaken these incentives and  discourage Americans from going into public service.   President Biden and Secretary Cardona, come to the table. There are  real problems in the student loan system and Federal financing of  higher education. Let's fix them legally through a lasting, bipartisan  solution.   I close by encouraging all my colleagues to join me in supporting  this Congressional Review Act resolution to prevent this  unconstitutional student loan forgiveness scheme. It is unfair to the  hundreds of millions of Americans who will bear the burden of paying  off hundreds of billions of dollars of someone else's student debt.   I yield the floor.
