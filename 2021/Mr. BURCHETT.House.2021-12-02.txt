 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, our U.S. Supreme Court Justices  held oral arguments in the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which addressed the  constitutionality of Mississippi's law banning abortions after 15  weeks.   It is time to get rid of the rules that prevent our legislators from  enacting the will of the people and passing laws to protect the unborn,  Mr. Speaker.   Chief Justice John Roberts once argued that the right to abortion has  ``no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution.''  I pray he and the eight other Justices uphold that view in Dobbs v.  Jackson. They know the ability to murder unborn children is not one of  our fundamental rights.   The Biden administration suspended basic healthcare regulations so  doctors  [[Page H6865]]  could pass out abortion pills like candy, Mr. Speaker. It is time for  our third branch of government to step up now, show some common sense,  and make the right decision to protect millions of our unborn babies.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I always remember a story that happened  shortly before my momma left this Earth. She was in hospice, and she  started talking to folks that had passed a long time before her: my  daddy, her daddy, her brother who died in the Second World War. She was  looking off at one point, and I said: ``What are you looking at,  Momma?'' And she said: ``Baby, I am looking at all of those sweet  little babies over there.''    I can't help but think some of those sweet little babies my sweet  momma was looking at were some of the unborn that were murdered in  abortion.                            ____________________
