 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  legislation, particularly the natural resource provisions, much  maligned by the minority Member just now. However, the health of our  ecosystems and the industries that depend on healthy ecosystems are  part of our natural infrastructure. That is part of our  competitiveness, too.   Case in point, seafood supply chains. We know foreign fisheries do  not have the same environmental and labor standards we have here in the  U.S. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or IUU fishing, is a  scourge. In the United States we intend to do something about it. I am  proud to lead a bipartisan bill with my colleague from Louisiana,  Garret Graves. That bill has been largely incorporated into the America  COMPETES Act. It will help level the playing field for American fishing  industries, and it is part of what will make us more competitive in the  long run.   Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
