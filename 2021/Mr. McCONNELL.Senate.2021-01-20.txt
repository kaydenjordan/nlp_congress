 Mr. President, today, before the American people and  the world, the peaceful transfer of power that has helped define our  Nation for more than 230 years was carried out. We swore in the 46th  President and the 49th Vice President of the United States.   President Biden and Vice President Harris are both alumni of the U.S.  Senate. They are well known to us in this Chamber. They begin their  terms with both challenges and opportunities before them, and with the  prayers of our whole Nation at their backs.   President Biden made unity the major theme of his inaugural address.  He pledged to be a President for all Americans, to work as hard for the  many millions of Americans who did not support his candidacy as he will  for the millions who did. So I congratulate my friend from Delaware. I  look forward to working with him as our new President wherever  possible.   Our country deserves for both sides, both parties, to find common  ground for the common good everywhere that we can and disagree  respectfully where we must. Last fall, the American people chose to  elect a narrowly divided House of Representatives, a 50-50 Senate, and  a President who promised unity. The people intentionally entrusted both  political parties with significant power to shape our Nation's  direction. May we work together to honor that trust.   Earlier today, I was honored to present our former colleague, Vice  President Harris, with a flag that flew over her historic swearing in  as our Nation's first woman Vice President. This groundbreaking  achievement elicits national pride that transcends politics. All  citizens can applaud the fact that this new three-word phrase, ``Madam  Vice President,'' is now a part of our American lexicon. So, once  again, our sincere congratulations to our former colleague from  California on this day.   I also join my colleagues in warmly welcoming our three newest  Senators. Senator Padilla of California and Senators Ossoff and Warnock  of Georgia have been sent to this Chamber by their home States to  represent their neighbors and to serve our Nation. We have plenty of  Senate business to discuss at length in the days ahead, but, for now, I  just want to congratulate each of our new colleagues. I look forward to  working alongside them.                            ____________________
