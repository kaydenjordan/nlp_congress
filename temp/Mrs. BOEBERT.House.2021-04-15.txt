 Madam Speaker, there are consequences to Biden's energy  bans. They are job-killing impacts that affect my district, my State,  and our Nation.   There are two drilling rigs operating in western Colorado right now.  That number was once as high as 112 and in the last 13 years there were  as many as 80 rigs. An economic analysis from Colorado Mesa University  found that each drilling rig in the region supports the creation of 208  jobs. And now there are just two in the Piceance Valley.   Madam Speaker, 9,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry have been lost  in the last year. Keep in mind that that does not include the jobs that  we have lost from industries serving the rigs and their workers. These  9,000 jobs produce substantial paychecks for folks back home to feed  their families and to put a roof over their head, and now they are  gone.   Madam Speaker, this hits our schools, where superintendents from back  home have spoken out on the need for these funds. Colorado's oil and  natural gas industry provided $839 million for K-12 schools in 2015 and  2016.   And that is why I have introduced the Protecting American Energy Jobs  Act. My legislation will nullify Biden's executive orders.                            ____________________
