 Madam Speaker, this has been a bloody week in America. It  seems like every day we have woken up to news of another mass shooting,  starting with the one 5 days ago when a gunman, armed with an assault  pistol and high-capacity magazine, killed 11 Californians as they  celebrated Lunar New Year.   Three weeks from now, Valentine's Day will be the 15th anniversary of  a mass shooting on the Northern Illinois University campus in DeKalb.  The shooter started firing at 3:06 p.m. By 3:11 p.m.--just 5 minutes  later--he had taken his own life. But not before firing off 55 rounds  of ammunition, killing 6 people and injuring another 21.   In Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day they don't memorialize  Northern Illinois University, they memorialize the anniversary of the  shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. That shooting lasted  for 6 minutes, 139 rounds were fired, 17 people were killed, and 17  were injured.   Six months from now, on Independence Day, folks in Highland Park,  Illinois, will be memorializing the first anniversary of a mass  shooting when 83 rounds were fired, 7 people were killed, and 48 were  injured before the police--who were present at the scene--could even  identify the location of the shooter.    We do not get our holidays back unless we act.   Too often, this body has responded to these shootings with thoughts  and prayers. Prayers that the American people won't notice that some of  my colleagues are putting the economic interests of gun manufacturers  ahead of people's lives. But every once in a while, we do act. I want  to talk about what we are capable of when we are touched by the better  angels of our nature.   To do that, let's flash back to another Valentine's Day not that long  ago. Two Chicago gangs were fighting over narcotics turf. One of them  surprised the other, and in a flash of bullets, seven people were dead.  Chicagoans and Illinoisans--Americans--were outraged. Yes, these were  gang members, but they didn't deserve to die.   The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre was in 1929. It was when Al  Capone's Italian gang killed seven members of Bugs Moran's Irish gang  as whiskey bootleggers fought over drug turf. And we acted. That  shooting led to the passage of the National Firearms Act that banned  civilian access to fully automatic Tommy guns and any rifle with a  barrel longer than 18 inches.   That law is still on the books today. It saves lives, and no one has  ever claimed it was unconstitutional.   By the way, Madam Speaker, if you weren't expecting that a story  about Chicago gangs was going to be about White people, I would like to  thank you for attending today's class in critical race theory. As that  poet Ice Cube says: You better check yourself.   But I digress.   Seven people died in 1929, and we acted. Eleven people died on Lunar  New Year 5 days ago. There have been 40 mass shootings in the first 26  days of this year, over 1,300 gun homicides in the United States this  year, and another 1,700 gun suicides. I am proud that my State of  Illinois has just passed an assault weapons ban. It is time for this  body to do the same.   I know I speak for all Americans when I say that I want to enjoy my  next holiday without fear of getting shot, and that inaction in the  wake of way too many avoidable deaths is completely unacceptable.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 66.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would require oil and gas  companies drilling on public lands to submit plans for cutting the  greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and use of  their products in half by 2030 and to zero by 2050, as is called for by  climate science. My amendment would allow the release of no more than 1  percent of the superpollutant methane brought to the surface by  drilling operations.   Mr. Chairman, let's be honest here. We have been here a long night.  H.R. 21 is not about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, nor is it about  domestic energy security, because if it was, we would be talking about  the fact that the United States is an oil exporter.   We have a lot of tools, not just limited to what is in a few tanks  around the country, to affect domestic supply of oil, but we are not  talking about that, are we? We are talking about using the SPR to get a  nose under the tent to meet the larger and consistent Republican goal  to expand drilling on public lands.   Since this bill is really about public lands, we cannot discuss this  bill without addressing our stewardship responsibilities for those  lands, forested lands that are increasingly prone to climate change- driven wildfires; coastal lands that are prone to climate change-driven  sea level rises; and wild lands where climate change and drilling is  destroying habitat and contributing to the most rapid rate of  extinction in our history. Our stewardship of those lands, Republicans  and Democrats, compels us to eliminate the causes of global warming, to  stop emitting greenhouse gases.   Public reporting has shown that Exxon scientists not only knew their  products were responsible for climate change in 1977, but they did a  really good job of predicting the changes that were going to follow. So  did the world's climate scientists, who called for global action.   The 1992 Rio summit and Kyoto Protocol were designed to avert climate  disaster, but as we know, the fossil energy industry did not respond  with stewardship. They started a massive disinformation campaign that  continues to this day, spending enormous amounts of money to confuse  the American public and to delay climate action.   Today, I will be honest, every major oil company pays lip service to  the reality of climate change and the need to address it. Many have  even pledged sharp reductions of their direct emissions, but they know  that most of their contributions to global warming are downstream--it  is what people do with their products--or upstream, the methane that  gets released from their production.   It would take leadership on their behalf, it would take  entrepreneurial vision, and it would take stewardship for them to  realize that they are experts at giving people useful energy. They are  in the business of providing that. They could do that, but instead,  they have decided that they just want to be committed to the extraction  of oil.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment just provides an appropriate stewardship  of our public lands to this bill. We know from history that the oil  companies cannot be trusted to protect those lands, and so it behooves  us in this body to require that any expansion of drilling on those  lands must be met by a reduction in the gross greenhouse gas emissions  associated with drillers' operations.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 67.    Mr. Chairman, my friend from Texas and I are going to get  to continue talking about a few tanks.   My amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to determine  whether curtailing U.S. oil exports would be more effective than  drawing from the SPR to stabilize U.S. oil prices and protect U.S.  energy security. If it is determined that curtailing oil exports would  be more effective, the increased drilling on Federal lands otherwise  required by H.R. 21 would not be allowed.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 21 is based on the false premise that a drawdown from  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve weakens our energy security and  therefore must be made up for by expanding drilling on Federal land.   Let's run through a little history here. The Strategic Petroleum  Reserve was created in 1975 in response to the first OPEC price shocks  to provide a domestic buffer against future global market volatility  and supply constraints.   We had that oil in our country, and we wanted to use that to bolster  domestic supplies. The conditions under which it was created changed in  October 2019. That was the month when the United States, for the first  time, became a net oil exporter, and we have remained one since.   That means that, for the last 4 years, we have had not one but two  tools we could use to protect ourselves domestically from global  volatility. We could either release from those few tanks in the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve or we could reduce the exports that are  leaving our country, keep that, and prioritize good old, apple-pie- smelling United States oil for United States use.   As an economic matter, both of those are equivalent, right? If we add  a barrel to our domestic supplies, that is a barrel we don't have to  import. That is a barrel that eases price pressure internally,  regardless of where that barrel came from.   Moreover--and this is important because this is about those few tanks  we were talking about before--the volume of oil that we export today is  way bigger than the amount that we release from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve. If I may, Mr. Chairman, most of our Strategic Petroleum  Reserve is still underground.   When the United States became a net exporter in 2019, though,  something changed. The thing that changed was the politics of this  conversation because it created a new set of players at the table: oil  exporters, who have a vested interest in a high oil price.   They don't seek to maximize value for the American people. They seek  to maximize value for their shareholders. I would point out, many of  their shareholders are not U.S. citizens. They want to maximize that  value by selling American oil overseas at the highest possible price.   Now, let's be really clear. Every single American is an energy  consumer. A tiny number of Americans are oil exporters. The greater  good is always to maximize the benefit to U.S. consumers by lowering  energy prices.   I have introduced this amendment to ensure that we use the full suite  of tools available to us when we face domestic price or supply  constraints, inclusive of SPR releases and export curtailments.   This amendment would simply direct the Secretary of Energy to  determine whether curtailing U.S. exports would be more effective than  drawing from the SPR at stabilizing U.S. oil prices and protecting U.S.  energy security. If it is determined that curtailing exports would be  more effective, the increased drilling on Federal lands otherwise  required by H.R. 21 would not be allowed.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 68.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to tell you I will not need 5  minutes. This is a really short amendment. It simply strikes the words  ``natural gas'' from this bill.   Mr. Chairman, domestic production of natural gas has nothing to do  with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve  is a strategic reserve of petroleum. Today, it holds about 372 million  barrels of petroleum--oil, if you prefer. It does not hold natural gas.                                time  2000    Yet, H.R. 21 says that a release from the SPR--again, of oil--should  be linked to an increase in drilling for oil and gas on Federal lands.   Now, if you are not following that, I want you to imagine that you  are at the grocery store, and your significant other calls you up and  says: ``Hey, we are out of turkey.'' You come back and say: ``Well, I  will return with turkey or milk.'' You might not have a happy spouse.  Same deal here.  [[Page H411]]    If the majority would like to provide more subsidies to drill for gas  on public lands, you are, of course, free to do that and propose  legislation to do that, but that has nothing to do with releases from  this Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Since the underlying bill is predicated on an event of SPR release,  my amendment is both simple and necessary. It simply strikes all  mentions of ``natural gas'' from a bill that claims to be about oil.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
