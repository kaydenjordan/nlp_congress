 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which reduces Federal education funding by $37,735,000.   This amendment maintains fiscal responsibility, protecting Americans'  hard-earned tax dollars from going to waste at the Department of  Education.   According to the Congressional Budget Office's estimation, this  amendment would reduce allowances by $38 million and outlays by $30  million for fiscal year 2024.   Like many Americans, I don't trust the Biden administration with our  tax dollars as they trample on our constitutional protections and allow  violations of these protections on college campuses across the U.S.   In Arizona, we are seeing the Department of Education impose a  record-setting fine of $37,735,000 on Grand Canyon University.   Foolishly, this fine is being imposed for something that the  university has already been cleared of in a court of law. Adding insult  to injury, they are imposing a record fine on GCU that would unjustly  impede their ability to operate.   As the largest private Christian university in the Nation, GCU's  enrollment has grown to an estimated 118,000 students because of their  innovative approach to higher education.   If GCU is forced to pay this fine, I believe the Department of  Education should be defunded by the same amount. We the people are sick  and tired of the woke indoctrination of our youth.   I find it absurd that the Department of Education would target  private Christian schools while ignoring the larger systemic issues  within higher education.   The cost of college tuition has skyrocketed 175 percent in the last  four decades, far exceeding inflation rates. Meanwhile, the values of  these degrees have not kept up.   Despite the Supreme Court establishing that college and university  campuses are not immune from the protections of the First Amendment, we  are seeing a suppression of free speech rights on college campuses  across the Nation.   Mr. Chair, 63 percent of students believe the political and social  climate on their campus prevents people from freely expressing their  opinions--an increase of almost 10 percent in the past 2 years.   The University of Texas at Austin threatened to fire or penalize a  professor who exposed the university's plans to ensure that new hires  have uniformly leftwing views on cultural issues.   Virginia Tech and other universities deploy teams that rely on  students to  [[Page H5819]]  snitch on classmates who express offensive views and then subject those  classmates to investigations, reeducation, or even discipline.   Following the recent terror attack against Israel, we have seen anti- Semitism skyrocket at universities, especially at Ivy League  institutions, who reap the benefits of billions of taxpayer dollars.   At Columbia, we saw a tenured professor describe the terrorism  inflicted by Hamas upon Israelis as awesome and a stunning victory.   We also saw more than 30 student groups at Harvard blame Israel for  the terror attacks conducted by Hamas.   To combat this infiltration of woke mind rot in our classrooms,  Congress needs to pass a substantial funding reduction for the  Education Department for fiscal year 2024.   My amendment is designed to mitigate and thwart the weaponization of  the public education system against Americans.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this issue has already been settled in  Federal court. In January, the 11th Circuit Court found GCU innocent of  the charges ED is using to impose this record-setting fine.                                time  1930    What right do bureaucrats have to overrule our judicial system?   This is a multimillion-dollar fine we are talking about. It is the  largest penalty ever handed down by the Education Department. I want to  repeat that. This issue has already been settled in Federal Court.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that my colleague on the  other side says that Grand Canyon University is ripping people off. If  that is the case, then why didn't the 11th Circuit Court find GCU  guilty? That is not what happened at all.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle is not the judge or jury.  As I said, the 11th Circuit Court has already found GCU innocent.   My colleague also said that there are only 87,000 students at GCU.  There are 118,000 students because of their innovative approach to  higher education. We are very proud of this college in Arizona.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
