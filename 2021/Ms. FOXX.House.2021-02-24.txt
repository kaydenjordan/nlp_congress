 Mr. Speaker, government intervention often causes more harm  than good. I have spent my time in Congress working to protect  individual freedoms from unnecessary bureaucratic burdens.   I recognize that a strong family is vital to our Nation's progress  and prosperity, which is why I have worked to advance legislation that  allows families to flourish and protects life at all stages. It is  unconscionable that in America, where we fight for life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness, we tolerate the systemic extermination of an  entire generation. The right to life demands that we protect our  Nation's most vulnerable, including the unborn.   Our First Amendment is a powerful instrument that has protected our  most sacred freedoms for hundreds of years.                                time  1015    Few other countries provide the same protections and freedoms that  our First Amendment guarantees. We are the land of the free because of  it. Our individual liberties are the envy of people around the world  and they are the cornerstone of the world's oldest democracy.   Yet, today, these essential rights are under attack. H.R. 5 is the  latest example of Democrats' misleading and partisan manner of  legislating.  [[Page H593]]    As a former educator and the Republican leader of the Education and  Labor Committee, I can tell you that the bill may have equality in the  title, but it certainly does not serve all Americans.   This legislation has a clever name and an allegedly noble purpose,  but it is a vehicle for serious harmful consequences.   The Equality Act would empower the government to interfere in how  regular Americans think, speak, and act. Specifically, it would amend  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make sexual orientation and gender  identity protected classes. According to the National Review, this  extreme legislation ``redefines sex to include gender identity,  undermines religious freedom, gives males who identify as females the  right to women's spaces, and sets a dangerous political precedent for  the medicalization of gender-confused youth.''   Under H.R. 5, our Nation's K-12 schools would be forced to treat  gender as being fluid, subjective, and not tied to biological reality.  The bill would undermine Title IX protections for girls by outlawing  sex-based athletic competitions.   Even more troubling is the bill's meticulous and intentional  destruction of religious freedom protections.   Religiously-affiliated colleges and universities that maintain  student codes of conduct, hiring practices, or housing rules reflecting  sincerely held beliefs about marriage and sexuality, risk losing  Federal funding under the Equality Act, as such policies would be  deemed discriminatory.   Beloved secular private colleges that maintain single-sex policies,  like Smith College and Morehouse College, would be forced to change  their policies or forego Federal funding.   In the State of Virginia, we have already seen the displeasure among  parents regarding such policy implementation. In an opinion piece  published by the Washington Post in 2019, a former middle and high  school teacher whose children attend Arlington public schools said:  ``It would erode parents' rights over their children's education,  corrode Title IX protections for girls, and risk convincing healthy,  normally developing boys and girls that their bodies are wrong and must  be altered with hormones and be vandalized by surgical instruments.''   The bill also lacks any pro-life protections, which is why I am  submitting my amendment that will protect religiously affiliated groups  and individuals from being forced to perform abortions.   This bill is a brazen attempt to replace longstanding constitutional  rights with the identity politics of the moment.   We have entered treacherous waters by considering legislation that  stifles proven, bipartisan solutions and, more seriously, our Bill of  Rights. It is outrageous that Democrats would advertise these proposals  as guaranteeing fundamental civil and legal rights.   Mr. Speaker, as elected Representatives, we all strive for equality  before the law, but H.R. 5 is another classic example of Democrats  passing a law now and figuring out what it means later. This is no way  to legislate.                            ____________________
