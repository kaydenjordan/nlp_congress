 Madam Speaker, the Democrats would have you believe that  their impeachment crusade is a moral imperative. It is not. It is an  act of pure cowardice.   Their failure to bring a formal impeachment vote to the House floor  shows that this witch hunt has no legitimacy whatsoever, and they know  it. They are using it as a punch line.   This informal inquiry is being conducted in secret behind closed  doors and betrays the true intention of what they are trying to do to  our good President, to conduct an endless, shallow campaign of half- truths and manipulated facts against President Trump.   I have called on my fellow Members of this House to denounce the  unconstitutional farce that they are doing and support my resolution to  expel the Speaker and vacate the chair.   It is time to end this charade and get back to doing the people's  business. We can certainly start by passing the USMCA.                            ____________________
