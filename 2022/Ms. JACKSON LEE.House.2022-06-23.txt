 Mr. Speaker, I love this Nation, and I stand on the  premise of the Declaration of Independence. Even though my ancestors  did not benefit at the origins of this Nation, I am a patriot.   I remind my fellow colleagues of the Declaration of Independence:         We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and       women are created equal, that they are endowed by their       creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are       life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.    Our Founding Fathers understood that this Nation would grow and would  breathe life into these words and breathe life into democracy. The  Constitution began with:         We the people of United States, in order to form a more       perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic       tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the       general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.    This is a living document that ensures that we safeguard America and,  particularly, that we safeguard its citizens and our children.   This Pride Month, I wish all of those who are in our wonderful  community of LGBTQ a wonderful existence and recognition of their  individual liberty. I am so grateful that this Nation allows everyone  to have a seat at the table.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their vigorous celebration of  Juneteenth, which is legislation that I introduced and fought for, for  over a decade. I am so amazed at the celebrations from east to west and  north to south, understanding the ancestors of African descendants  didn't get free in Texas until June 1865.   All of us, no matter our backgrounds, were having celebrations.  Members, Republicans and Democrats, were joining in on the liberty of  Juneteenth. That gives me hope as we move to discuss the response to  H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for  African Americans Act, and find ways for repair and restoration. It  gives me hope.   As I mentioned, this Pride Month is about liberty and empowerment for  all people. I stand here on the floor of the House with such excitement  and exhilaration that I have standing on the foundation of this very  book that covers the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  That is why it is so important to fight for democracy and to recognize  the sovereignty of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in fighting for  the release of Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, and many others who are  held as hostages, and those who went to volunteer to fight for  democracy in Ukraine who are now held.   I raise my voice for Brittney Griner today, a young woman born and  raised in Houston, Texas, a graduate of Nimitz High School whose family  in Houston is in desperate need for us to pay attention to the very  vile way that she now is being held as a hostage in Russia.   I ask the Russian people and Mr. Putin to release these people,  release them from this inappropriate detention, incarceration, and  holding. Release them now.   Let us pray with the family. Release them now. Release Brittney  Griner. Free Brittney Griner, a renowned WNBA player and Olympian, but  just a plain human being, an American who has shown herself to love  this country and to be such a wonderful, generous person who gives to  others, as many have said.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague Congressman Stanton of Arizona, my  colleague Congressman Allred, and I will be presenting a resolution  that says: Free Brittney Griner now.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about how we honor our dear friend, who  passed away in 2020, John Lewis.   I am reminded of his nonviolent tendencies, and he taught us well. In  teaching us, we were here on the floor of the House to demand gun  safety legislation some years ago. At one point, we just couldn't  manage it and take it anymore. We sat on the House floor. I  [[Page H5833]]  have pictures that I will cherish because it was nonviolent resistance.   Now, we have an opportunity to stand in the gap for the families in  Uvalde, families in Buffalo and Tulsa, and pass real gun safety  legislation. Join us and be what America is all about, taking care,  creating a more perfect Union, Mr. Speaker, and passing gun safety  legislation that I and the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Nadler, and  other Members have really stood up for.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support  of the House Amendment to S. 2089, the ``Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022.''   Today's bill is a matter of urgency.   If Congress does not act now to pass this emergency legislation,  millions of children will spend their summer hungry. Millions of  children may be forced to spend their school days not learning and  growing but feeling the pangs of empty stomachs.   Hungry children cannot focus their attention on their studies and  learning. They simply cannot thrive while trying to survive.   Free and reduced breakfast and lunch waivers are lifelines for  families across the nation.   I think of the struggling families in my district who have battled  against the COVID-19 pandemic for the past two years.   Families who now face record high inflation rates, skyrocketing gas  prices, and the rising cost of food.   Families who are stretching dollars to pay for rent, to get to the  doctor, to keep the lights on.   Families for whom every penny counts.   I think of how these families must have felt when they learned that  the aid on which they had relied to feed their children was suddenly  going to be taken away.   I imagine they felt helpless.   It is in our power to feed these children.   The ``Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022'' would allow schools to feed  children throughout the upcoming school year. This bill would extend  free meals and snacks for children during the summer months, and it  would provide enhanced supports to Child and Adult Care programs--all  without disrupting the budget.   In the summer of 2020, hungry children were provided with more than  10 million meals via the federally supported Summer Meal Program.   195,000 children were fed.   195,000 children were given apples, sandwiches, yogurts, juice boxes.   They were given the opportunity to enjoy a summer free of hunger.   That is reason enough to act.   The ``Keep Kids Fed Act'' would also increase reimbursements to  school nutrition programs for both breakfast and lunch meals.   American families are not the only ones struggling to put food on the  table amidst the current economic crisis.   School nutrition professionals have expressed deep concern over the  impacts that supply-chain issues and inflation have had on their  ability to provide quality meals to their students.   With the end of pandemic-relief nutritional aid fast approaching, and  the cost of labor rising, some schools could see their yearly budgets  decrease by 40 percent this year.   School cafeterias cannot produce meals out of thin air.   They need our help.   The House Amendment to S. 2089 would increase the reimbursement rates  for the 2022-2023 school year by an additional 15 cents per breakfast  and 40 cents per lunch--money that our nation's schools desperately  need.   This bill would not fix the inflation problem, lower the cost of gas,  or unclog the supply chain. But it would put food on the plates of  hungry children across America.   That is why I rise in support of the House Amendment to S. 2089, the  ``Keep Kids Fed Act'' and urge my colleagues to do the same.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5407--to amend the ``Higher Education Act of 1965'' to promote  comprehensive campus mental health and suicide prevention plans within  the Higher Education Act of 1965.   The mental health crisis plaguing our Nation is astounding.  Particularly in our Nation's institutions of higher education, we see  higher reported rates of anxiety and depression, which have  unfortunately led some students to suicide.   According to studies done in the year 2020, suicide was the 12th  leading cause of death within the Unites States. Within this year,  45,979 Americans died by suicide, and an estimated 1.2 million  Americans attempted suicide.   Within the reported suicide rates of 2020, people ranging from ages  15-34 made up 32.59 percent of the total.   The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the mental health crisis showing a  25 percent increase in the number of depression and anxiety cases  recorded globally.   In my home state of Texas 34.2 percent of adults reported symptoms of  anxiety and depression between September 29, 2021, and October 11,  2021.   The transition period into institutions of higher education can be  difficult for numerous reasons. Some of the leading triggers for  anxiety and depression are the constant pressure for success,  homesickness, adjustment to workload, or even the social aspects of the  collegiate environment.   No matter the cause, it is our job as elected officials of the United  States to ensure that we are putting our time and resources into  ensuring that we are providing outlets for those struggling with mental  health issues to seek refuge.   I want to be very clear when I say that providing these resources  alone will not ensure that zero lives are taken at the hands of mental  health struggles.   However, taking the steps to ensure that there are proper resources  and parameters in place on the campuses of our college campuses will  aid in helping our young adults receive the assistance they need to  lead healthy lives.   We cannot sit idly as our Nation stares down the barrel of an all- time low for mental health.   By invoking comprehensive mental health and suicide prevention plans  across higher education institutions, we are pouring into our next  generations.   H.R. 5407 allows for collegiate institutions to draw on the expertise  and resources provided by the Suicide Prevention Centers nine strategy  model, while also working with the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to create a comprehensive approach to mental health concerns  and suicide prevention.   This mental health assistance model will allow for all institutions  throughout the Nation to collectively pool together and ensure each  campus is administering the highest level of care for students with  mental health struggles.   I urge for each of my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 5407 to  help us get our college students across the stage.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6493--to amend the ``Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for  Students Act of 2022'' to promote substance misuse treatment  rehabilitation and re-entry within institutions of higher education.  [[Page H5845]]    Today substance misuse targets our nation at a volatile rate.  Specifically, when looking at our institutions of higher education our  students are much more susceptible to being victims of substance  misuse.   Common triggers for substance misuse include peer pressure, stress,  social organization, and mental health issues.   Currently the ``Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students  Act of 2022'', seeks to ensure that our public institutions are using  funding given to them to provide the necessary outlets for recovery and  re-entry into campus life.   Solutions the original bill provides include models for ``prevention  of the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol'' by students and  staff through connecting them with campus intervention, and  rehabilitation resources.   As it stands the bill targets many of the necessary areas it needs to  promote rehabilitation of substance abuse, but what it fails to do is  provide the necessary funding allocations in ongoing to ensure the  longevity of keeping our students safe.   Students who are struggling with substance misuse issues deserve to  know that they are receiving the best possible care that they can, and  we can foster that by making sure that our institutions of higher  education have the resources they desperately need to be able continue  to serve their student populations.   Through H.R. 6493 it will further push campuses to ensure that they  are working with organizations both on and off campus.   Campuses will now be required to work with the Secretary of Education  in conjunction with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  ensure that each campus is using their funding for the highest quality  of rehabilitation and re-entry services.   H.R. 6493 will grant $15 million to institutions annually from to  2021-2028 to aid in funding public institutions' recovery,  rehabilitation, and re-entry programs.   I ask that my colleagues join me in support of H.R. 6493--the Campus  Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act of 2022.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6411, known  as the STRONG Veterans Act of 2022.   As a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland  Security, I care deeply about our veterans.   I offer my deepest gratitude to our Nation's troops and reservists,  their families, and the 21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 in the  18th Congressional District of Texas that I proudly represent.   In Congress, I have sponsored many legislative proposals and co- sponsored well over 50 pieces of legislation that will positively  benefit our veterans and their families.   Veterans with mental health diagnoses have a significantly elevated  suicide risk. Suicide rates of veterans are at an all-time high, rising  25 percent in 2021 over the previous year. Veterans continue to have a  50 percent higher risk of suicide than their peers who have not served.   More than 80 percent of post-9/11 veterans say that the public does  not understand the problems that veterans face when transitioning to  civilian life.   Current resources to help the mental health of our veterans are  inadequate. Our veterans need our support when transitioning back to  civilian life.   The STRONG Veterans Act will:   Open eligibility for more student veterans at Vet Centers;   Expand culturally competent suicide prevention at VA for native  veterans;   Significantly increase mental health staffing and training at VA  medical centers and Vet Centers;   Further strengthen the Veterans Crisis Line;   Allow more veterans to benefit from engaging with peer specialists;  and   Collect data for VA to guide expansion of inpatient mental health and  substance use treatment.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 6411.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York, Chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, for her leadership, and  Chairman Grijalva for his dynamic leadership, as well.   I rise today because I just feel moved by the moment to really talk  about truth in the moments that I have. I started this morning by  citing the Declaration of Independence that said, we all are created  equal--a portion thereof--with the unalienable rights of life and  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   It is important that today in Pride Month, as I recognize my  constituents in Houston, all of them, and the caucus that has been a  steadfast advocate in Houston for the rights of all people in the  LGBTQI community.   It is important to be counted, to be recognized, and I want to  emphasize, again, the distortion of how punitive this will be. It is  voluntary.   I know my constituents. Some of them don't even fill out the Census  because they are free. They know they don't have to do it. Some of them  don't answer questions on the Census.                                time  1530    For anyone to suggest that this would be punitive and that people  would be fearful and they would think not to do it, it is voluntary.  And I can assure you that this community, LGBTQI+ Americans, remains  vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis.   Only 21 States have laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination  based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public  accommodations, and only 20 States have such protections for gender  identity.   H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, is to include and affirm  and to be counted.   Do you realize that in most States a same-sex couple can get married  on Saturday, then be legally denied service at a restaurant on Sunday,  be fired from their jobs on Monday, and evicted from their apartment on  Tuesday?   We thought we would be past that after years of working and fighting,  but it is important to note that this bill will provide us with the  appropriate information.    Madam Speaker, it is high time that we provide equal  protection for all members of the LGBTQI community in accordance with  the 14th Amendment.   H.R. 4176--again, not punitive--will take us one more step forward in  the decades-long journey toward equality by creating a tool kit through  which our LGBTQI community members can be represented and the  demographic data can be taken.   Let me just simply say that the numbers speak truth. I said I wanted  to discuss a moment of truth. When we have the data, we can help with  housing, healthcare, schooling, or special needs that this community  would have, representation as it relates to them being counted in  Federal funding that may be necessary to aid in their circumstances.   I am reminded of tragedies that have happened before. Does anyone  remember a young man being assailed against a fence just because he was  part of the LGBTQI+ community?   I met with Matthew Shepard's mother. I remember these atrocities.   I see in a State like mine that transgender families are threatened  over trying to find resources for their children. We love our children.  We love our families.   The only thing I can see in this legislation is the importance of  affirming, counting, treating with dignity, and recognizing that this  wonderful community, the LGBTQI+ community, they, too, are America. We,  too, are America.   This is a moment of truth, and it is simply collecting data,  punishing no one but uplifting all Americans. I ask my colleagues to  support H.R. 4176.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support  of H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, and to discuss my  amendment to this legislation.   Despite significant legal advances over the past several years,  including marriage equality, LGBTQI+ Americans remain vulnerable to  discrimination on a daily basis.   Today, only 21 states have laws that explicitly prohibit  discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and  public accommodations, and only 20 states have such protections for  gender identity.   In most states, a same-sex couple can get married on Saturday, then  be legally denied service at a restaurant on Sunday, then be fired from  their jobs on Monday, and evicted from their apartment on Tuesday.   Our country is comprised of trans people of color, lesbians living  with a disability, gay immigrants, and those experiencing all other  manners of intersecting and layering levels of oppression and  privilege.   H.R. 4176 would make note of these stories and add their voices to  the mosaic of our country.   The data available through these newly developed federal surveys will  allow federal agencies to create better policies and practices designed  to accommodate the needs of all our Nation's people.   I am conscious of the fact that if Congress expects the LGBTQI+  community to trust the federal government with their information, we  must ensure their privacy and protection.   It is imperative that this data not be used to exclude, discriminate  against, vilify, ostracize, or in any other way negatively impact  anyone in this already vulnerable community.   That is a promise we make today.   Again, I remind you of the long path to full equality we walk. Let it  be known, however, that one day our Nation will find itself knocking on  equality's door.   When that happens, future LGBTQI+ Americans will look back and see  themselves not hidden in shame, but present.   Present in our census, in our housing surveys, in our employment  surveys.   They will be present in our metropolitan cities and in our rural  towns, from the Atlantic beaches to the Pacific Northwest. From the  forests of Alaska to the plains of my own Texas.   Through the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, LGBTQI+ Americans will be  able to say--I was there. I am here.   It is high time that we provide equal protection for all members of  the LGBTQI+ community in accordance with the 14th Amendment, which  ensures equal protection for ALL Americans.   H.R. 4176 will take us one more step forward in the decades-long  journey towards equality by creating a toolkit through which our  LGBTQI+ community members can be represented in demographic data  collection--and ultimately protected under the law.   This bill will require federal agencies to assess the ways in which  they document sexuality, gender identity, and gender variance in  surveys and provide new opportunities for LGBTQI+ individuals to self- identify themselves--all while ensuring the privacy and dignity of the  people involved.   Though this legislation enacts a simple change on federal surveys, it  represents a great gesture for our future.   We are not just talking about numbers today.   We are not just talking about percentages and ratios and clusters.   We are talking about the documentation and legacy of the great  diversity of this Nation, and about enacting tools through which that  diversity can be represented and protected.   As you all know, representation is the bedrock of American democracy.   If the government does not see you, how can it serve you?   As we discuss this Act, I especially want to keep in mind the members  of the LGBTQI+ community who experience the fluidity and  intersectionality that are aspects of gender and sexual identity.   Of course, gender and sexuality are just two facets of personhood.   Race, religion, socio-economic status, geographic region, disability  status, and culture all play a part in crafting identity.   Madam Speaker, all of this is true about H.R. 4176, and yet, I  encourage my colleagues in Congress to push for more.   That is why I believe my amendment is very important.   My amendment would direct the Comptroller General to issue a report  to Congress about the impact of the implementation of this Act on the  provision of services to LGBTQI+ persons.   It would assess the impact of H.R. 4176 by ensuring transparency into  the correlation between the provision of services and one's gender  identity, sexual orientation, and variations in sex characteristics.   Data collected through this Act would be used to monitor the flow of  social services to LGBTQI+ communities. This will encourage the  provision of services to the LGBTQI+ community, and if there are  shortcomings, Congress and the public will be informed of them so that  they can be remedied soon thereafter.   Despite our many gains, the United States is not always a welcoming  place for individuals across the spectrum of genders and sexualities.   This is especially true for those coming from un-affirming  communities and families--those for whom living their authentic lives  may come at the cost of social ties and support systems.   For some, authenticity can be isolating.    As my colleagues know, the depression and suicide rates of LGBTQI+  individuals are horrifically high.   LGBTQI+ youth in particular are at greatest risk.   In Texas, The Trevor Project saw nearly 15,000 crisis contacts from  LGBTQI+ youth in 2021.   Research consistently shows that trans and gay youth are more likely  to experience depression when living in un-affirming or discriminatory  environments.   Alternatively, the presence of supportive close friends and family in  the life of an LGBTQI+ youth has a direct positive impact on that  youth's self-esteem and overall health.   That supportive person could be a teacher, an athletic coach, a  mental health counselor, or a troop leader.   The data available in H.R. 4176 could be used to help put more of  these mentors in the lives of LGBTQ+ youth every day.   The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act would enable agencies that provide  mental health and other social services to gain access to a wealth of  information about the communities they serve, so that they can better  serve the LGBTQI+ community.   My amendment would allow us to see if they then use this data and  their resources to safeguard the well-being of some of our Nation's  most vulnerable individuals.   Ultimately, the Comptroller General study required by my amendment  enables Congress to monitor the progress of H.R. 4176 in action.   It is with that in mind that I urge my colleagues to step forward in  support of the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act and my amendment.   Our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex  communities deserve to be documented in our Nation's history. They  deserve to have their stories collected and used for their well-being.  I am honored to be a part of that aim today.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this  legislation and the chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee  for bringing this legislation to the floor.   Data collection is an indispensable tool to understand and address  changes facing the LGBTQI community and other sexual- and gender- diverse communities.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from American  Progress dated May 24, 2022.                   [From American Progress, May 24, 2022]     Collecting Data About LGBTQI+ and Other Sexual and Gender-Diverse                                Communities         Data collection is an indispensable tool to understand and       address challenges facing LGBTQI+ and other sexual and       gender-diverse communities. Although strides have been made       in recent years, a persistent lack of routine data collection       on sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex       characteristics (SOGISC) is still a substantial roadblock for       policymakers, researchers, service providers, and advocates       seeking to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQI+       people. More comprehensive and accurate point-in-time and       longitudinal demographic data on SOGISC are crucial to:        Advance research agendas;        Evaluate population trends;        Identify community-based needs;        Provide high-quality services;        Track and address discrimination;        Equitably distribute funding and other resources; and        Shape evidence-based policy solutions to promote equity and       reduce disparities faced by LGBTQI+ populations.        As the size and diversity of LGBTQI+ populations in the       United States continue to expand, particularly among youth       and young adults, the importance of collecting data on these       communities only continues to grow. Failing to collect these       data can create harms by hindering the ability of       researchers, policymakers, service providers, and advocates       to understand the experiences of LGBTQI+ communities,       identify disparities, generate policies that promote equity,       and evaluate the effectiveness of those policies. Yet       currently, the number of federally funded surveys that       include questions to identify LGBTQI+ respondents is limited.        While there are many kinds of data relevant to the       experiences of LGBTQI+ communities, this report focuses       specifically on data collection to capture SOGISC in two       types of settings: general population surveys and surveys of       LGBTQI+ communities. General population surveys assess a       large sample of the entire population, of which the majority       identify as cisgender and heterosexual and will not have       intersex traits. In contrast, LGBTQI+ community-based surveys       sample a population predominantly comprising sexual and       gender minorities. Community-based surveys can provide       important opportunities to learn more about even smaller or       less-studied sexual and gender minority populations, such as       people who are asexual, same-gender-loving, or Two-Spirit.       Because of their specific focus on sampling LGBTQI+       populations, community-based surveys may also be more likely       to reach larger proportions of groups such as LGBTQI+ people       of color, older adults, youth, people with disabilities,       people receiving social welfare support services, people       whose primary language is not English, and people interacting       with the criminal legal system.        When designing questions to accurately and effectively       survey either the general population or a predominantly       LGBTQI+ population, researchers must carefully weigh a number       of key considerations that are explained in this report.       Regardless of the type of survey, however, it is imperative       to ensure the following:        Entities collecting demographic data, including data       related to SOGISC, do so with a specific and well-defined       goal, such as collecting statistics on health experiences or       understanding the performance of a government benefit       program.        Data are collected, used, maintained, and shared only with       strong privacy, confidentiality, and ethical standards in       place to minimize the risk of data disclosure and misuse.        Entities collecting data adopt and post clear       nondiscrimination and confidentiality policies. These       policies should identify relevant legal nondiscrimination       protections; state why the data are being collected and how       they will be used; share contact information for resources to       enforce protections; and provide assurance that       confidentiality will be respected and that participation is       voluntary, allowing respondents to provide well-informed       consent with the knowledge that disclosure is voluntary and       that they have the right to opt out of responding.        Research and researchers comply with and are certified       through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative       and consult community-based resources about how to conduct       effective and ethical research with LGBTQI+ populations that       ensures minority populations have a voice and role in the       design of survey questions.        LGBTQI+ people are meaningfully involved in question       development, testing, and the evaluation process.        This report examines best practices and key considerations       for collecting data on SOGISC in both general population       surveys as well as LGBTQI+ community-based surveys. The first       section of the report highlights evidence related to asking       these questions in general population surveys and examines       critical considerations, as well as avenues of future       research that policymakers and researchers should support.       The second section of the report compiles both evidence from       existing survey designs and interviews with LGBTQI+       individuals to create new suggestions and recommendations for       SOGISC question design in surveys of LGBTQI+ communities.       Ultimately, improving SOGISC data collection through these       kinds of general population and community-based instruments       is crucial to identifying disparities and crafting policy       solutions that promote more equitable outcomes for LGBTQI+       communities.        General population surveys are used to collect data from       representative samples of the population, allowing       researchers to create population estimates, describe       population demographics, assess disparities, compute       statistical weights for survey analysis, and develop policy,       program, and funding priorities. Federal, state, and local       governments rely on data from general population surveys such       as the decennial census, the American Community Survey (ACS),       and the Current Population Survey (CPS) for everything from       allocating budget resources to deciding where to locate       hospitals.        The persistent lack of routine data collection on SOGISC       remains a significant challenge for policymakers,       researchers, service providers, and advocates seeking to       improve the health and well-being of LGBTQI+ people.       Currently, most surveys, including those fielded by the U.S.       federal government and many state governments, do not collect       SOGISC information. While some surveys, such as the census       and the ACS, now invite people to answer questions about       their marital status or living arrangements in ways that       allow researchers to identify same-sex couples, this only       captures a small segment of the LGBTQI+ population. By not       asking specific questions about SOGISC, these surveys fail to       account for single LGB people or LGB people who are in a       relationship but not cohabitating with their partner(s), as       well as transgender people and intersex people altogether.       For example, according to the latest Gallup data, just 10       percent of LGBT adults in the United States are married to a       same-sex spouse, while an additional 6 percent live with a       same-sex domestic partner. This means that more than 5 in 6       LGBT adults cannot be identified by existing questions in       nonexperimental surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau       such as the ACS and the census, which only account for       cohabitating same-sex couples. Failing to collect SOGISC data       creates real harms--hindering the ability to fully understand       the experiences of LGBTQI+ communities; to craft sound       policies that are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people and their       needs; and to evaluate the effectiveness of policies to       address disparities and promote more equitable outcomes.        More than 5 in 6 LGBT adults cannot be identified by       existing questions in nonexperimental surveys conducted by       the U.S. Census Bureau such as the ACS and the census.        As recommended by the National Academies of Sciences,       Engineering, and Medicine in their 2020 report, U.S.       population surveys must routinely collect, analyze, and       report demographic data that include SOGISC questions. The       information gathered by general population surveys shapes       major policy decisions and allocations of critical resources       related to health care, housing, employment, education, and       other services and benefits, affecting the everyday lives of       LGBTQI+ people and making the need to adopt SOGISC measures       even more urgent. Notably, expanding data collection on       SOGISC through government population-based surveys will       result in a larger sample size than in privately conducted       surveys. This is important because larger samples allow for       better, more reliable study and a richer understanding of the       diversity of the LGBTQI+ community. Moreover, having larger       samples will facilitate analysis and provide greater       comprehension of the experiences of populations that are       living at the intersection of multiple marginalized       identities.        Expanding and enhancing SOGISC data collection also       provides critical tools necessary to craft policy solutions       to improve outcomes and advance equity. By improving data       collection on LGBTQI+ populations, government agencies can       take meaningful steps to fulfill the directives set out by       executive orders 13988 and 13985, which President Joe Biden       signed on day one of his presidency.        LGBTQI+ advocates have long called for the federal       government and researchers to add SOGISC questions to major       surveys and other data collection efforts as a way to begin       addressing the deficiency of data on LGBTQI+ populations and       gaps in knowledge and policy affecting LGBTQI+ people.       Government officials, researchers, and others have questioned       whether the general population, composed mainly of non-      LGBTQI+ people, would understand these questions, answer them       accurately, or even refuse to answer them. The answers to       these questions are important because they affect the quality       of data gathered about LGBTQI+ people and, by extension, the       resources allocated, decisions made, and policies created       that affect LGBTQI+ communities.  [[Page H5864]]         Importantly, numerous federally supported entities and       other expert bodies have issued reports to determine       methodological best practices and improve measurement of       SOGISC in federal surveys. These groups have contributed to a       robust and continually growing body of research providing       evidence that SOGISC questions can be readily deployed in       federally funded and other surveys. For example, evidence       indicates that:        Sexual orientation and gender identity data are not       considered especially difficult or sensitive for survey       respondents to report, meaning that people generally       understand what the questions are asking and are willing to       answer them.        Securing participation of sexual minorities in surveys does       not require higher levels of effort, meaning it will not       create added costs or obstacles that would prohibit the       government or other researchers from conducting more       inclusive data collection.        People with intersex traits appear willing to disclose       their status and support collecting data on this measure in       research.        People will answer sexual orientation and gender identity       questions even across a variety of modes (for example,       telephone surveys and paper surveys) and via both self-      reporting and proxy reporting (for example, when a single       household member responds on behalf of all household members)       in federal large-scale general population surveys.        In other words, existing evidence addresses many of the       major hesitations or questions posed by government       researchers and others. Put simply, while more research is       needed to continue improving SOGISC measures, evidence       suggests these questions can function well in major general       population surveys, and they should be asked. For example, in       2021, the Census Bureau updated its experimental data       collection effort on the COVID-l9 pandemic to include       questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in the       Household Pulse Survey. This historic step marks the first       time a Census Bureau-sponsored survey has asked sexual       orientation and gender identity questions and highlights the       ways in which these questions can--and do--work in large,       nationally representative surveys. Expanding LGBTQI+-      inclusive data collection by asking SOGISC questions on       general population surveys is paramount to advancing equity       for LGBTQI+ communities.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article  from the National Education Association, ``New Survey Data Shows LGBTQ+  Youth Mental Health Crisis.''          [From the National Education Association, May 25, 2022]          New Survey Data Shows LGBTQ+ Youth Mental Health Crisis         Last year, nearly half of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered       killing themselves, including more than half of trans youth,       according to new data from The Trevor Project.        These figures reveal a deadly, mental-health crisis among       high school and college-age LGBTQ+ youth of all races, which       has been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic and by recent,       political attacks on LGBTQ+ students by state legislators       across the nation.        ``The [Trevor Project] study is actually on my computer       screen right now to send it to my colleagues,'' says Florida       high school teacher Michael Woods, whose state recently       passed a law that enables parents to sue school districts for       teaching LGBTQ-positive curriculum. ``Especially here in       Florida, with the `Don't Say Gay' law, which should also be       called `Don't Say Trans,' we have a lot of kids in stress,''       he says.        The study, which involved 35,000 LGBTQ+ high school and       college-age youth, of various races and identities, also       shows how schools and colleges can help. A little more than       half of LGBTQ+ youth identified their school or college as       ``an LGBTQ-affirming space''--and those students reported       lower rates of attempted suicide. Even something as simple as       using the correct pronouns--the ones that match students'       gender identify--can decrease suicidal ideas.        ``Small steps can make a big difference,'' says Joe Bento,       a Seattle high school teacher who also is chair of the       Washington state chapter of GLSEN, a national organization       that helps educators make schools more affirming for LGBTQ+       students.        The Trevor Project data shows how things have gone from bad       to worse for LGBTQ+ youth in the past two years. In 2019, 40       percent of LGBTQ+ seriously considered suicide; in 2021, the       rate hit 45 percent.        And it's even scarier among students of color. About one in       five Black LGBTQ+ students attempted suicide last year, as       did a slightly higher rate of Indigenous LGBTQ+ students.        Meanwhile, mental-health care is scarce. Nearly half of       LGBTQ+ youth--and more than half of Latino LGBTQ+ students--      told the Trevor Project that they wanted counseling and       didn't get it.        The pandemic is an obvious factor, educators say. When       colleges and schools switched to virtual learning, many       LGBTQ+ students were closeted in homes where their identities       are hidden. (Only 1 in 3 LGBTQ+ youth said they have LGBTQ-      affirming homes.) These students may have lost access to       counselors or other supports, like a Gay-Straight Alliance or       GenderSexuality Alliance (GSA) club.        ``For a lot of queer students, school is their safe       space,'' says Bento. ``For a year and a half, they weren't in       that safe space.''        Now, students are back on campuses, in school buildings--      but that doesn't mean everything is okay, notes Bento. After       two years of pandemic-related isolation and trauma, students       desperately need mental-health support ``When we got back,       that didn't necessarily happen,'' he says. ``Suddenly it's       state testing! And it's this, this, this! Everything is `back       to normal,' but normal was garbage.''        Many students are suffering. But it's almost always the       most marginalized students who have the least access to       mental-health supports, Bento points out.        It's not just the pandemic. Making matters worse for LGBTQ       students, nearly 240 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been filed this       year in state legislatures, most of them targeting trans       people, according to an NBC News analysis.        Many of these bills have been signed into laws that ban       trans women and girls from participating in high school       sports, prohibit trans students from using school bathrooms       and locker rooms that match their gender identity, and       restrict LGBTQ-positive school curriculum. For example,       Florida's new law enables parents to sue districts if they       think their child has had inappropriate instruction on gender       and sexuality. The cost of litigation will be borne by       districts, which already are removing curricula.        LGBTQ+ students are very aware of laws that seek to harm       them, educators say--and it causes them anguish. ``They're       just coming back to the rigors of school [after the       pandemic]--and now this!'' says Woods.        NEA and its affiliates strongly oppose these laws. This       spring, NEA President Becky Pringle wrote an open letter to       Florida students, published in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper.       ``From protests to walkouts, you are bravely showing these       politicians that you aren't afraid to stand up for yourselves       . . . To our students in Florida and elsewhere: We see you!       We hear you! We are with you!''        For his part, Woods, an educator of 29 years, isn't afraid       either. He wears his ``We're All Human'' t-shirt and answers       his students' distressed questions. But he worries about       younger teachers with less job security, living in more       conservative areas. Many may feel like they can't be the       educators that students need.        ``When young people don't feel like they have anywhere to       turn or anyone to talk to . . . well, I know why the stats       are the way they are,'' he says.        NEA members and their unions are working hard to get more       supports for students. In St. Paul, Minn., educators went to       the brink of striking this spring to protect the presence of       mental-health teams in every St. Paul school. Other K12       unions--like in Natrona County, Wyo.--are making sure federal       pandemic-relief funds are spent to hire more school       counselors and other professionals.        Recently, the Biden administration urged colleges and       universities to do the same with their money.        But it's also possible for individual educators to create       affirming spaces in their offices, classrooms, buses, and       other spaces. ``Words matter,'' says Bento, who introduces       himself to his students like this: ``My name is Mr. Bento. I       use he/him pronouns.''        Safe space posters are great at signaling that you support       your LGBTQ+ students but may not be allowable in all places.       ``In those places, you can still put something on your body,       like a lanyard,'' says Bento. (The NEA LGBTQ+ caucus, of       which Bento is a member, offers ``Safe Person, Safe Space''       cards for educators to put in their lanyards.)        Bento uses the word ``partner,'' instead of boyfriend or       girlfriend, a subtle nod to the fact that not every       relationship looks the same and that some students may not       identify as male or female. ``Think about who is not       represented [in your words, in your curriculum],'' urges       Bento.        Yes, curriculum matters, too. (See GLSEN's inclusive       curriculum resource.) ``Students need curriculum that       reflects who they are, they need positive representation,''       says Bento. ``And not just Harvey Milk! Not just the AIDS       epidemic! Where's the joy?''        In fact, The Trevor Project asked LGBTQ+ youth the same       question: ``Where do you find joy?'' The responses can guide       educators in creating better spaces for all students. Answers       include:        Learning about LGBTQ history;        Learning I'm not alone and there are more people like me;        Supportive teachers;        Having a safe space to express gender, gender identity, and       sexuality;        LGBTQ clubs on campus; and        Living as their authentic self.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article  from National Public Radio titled ``The Census Bureau's first ever data  on LGBTQ+ people indicates deep disparities.''                [From National Public Radio, Sept. 24, 2021]    The Census Bureau's First Ever Data on LGBTQ+ People Indicates Deep                                Disparities         The U.S. Census Bureau in July began asking Americans about       their sexual orientation and gender identity--a watershed       moment that marks the first time the federal government has       tried to capture data on LGBTQ+ Americans in its large real-      time national surveys.        The results so far are preliminary, but they do indicate       that the disparities queer  [[Page H5865]]       Americans experienced prior to the pandemic have continued to       endure 18 months in. For some, those disparities have grown       deeper.        According to the data, which captures results from July 21       to September 13, LGBTQ+ people often reported being more       likely than non-LGBTQ+ people to have lost employment, not       have enough to eat, be at elevated risk of eviction or       foreclosure, and face difficulty paying for basic household       expenses, according to the census' Household Pulse Survey, a       report that measures how Americans are faring on key economic       markers during the pandemic.        While think tanks like the Williams Institute at the UCLA       School of Law and advocate-led research groups have       previously studied LGBTQ+ poverty, no large government       population surveys, like those conducted by the census or the       Treasury Department, have attempted to capture the realtime       economic experiences of LGBTQ+ people.        Previously, those analyses were limited to studies of       ``same-sex couples,'' a question the census began analyzing       with limited success in 1990, but that leaves out significant       portion of LGBTQ+ people. Lack of accurate data on the       population as a whole--and particularly on transgender       people, a group that has been chronically under surveyed--      hampered any federal response to persisting inequities,       advocates say.        ``Having this on [the Pulse survey], both as a way to       understand what's going on during the pandemic, but also       hopefully as a starting point to more federal data       collection, is really an important moment,'' said Bianca D.M.       Wilson, the senior scholar of public policy at the Williams       Institute.        The data has only begun to be collected, and it's still too       early to tell whether the differences between groups are       representative of the LGBTQ+ population overall or just those       who were surveyed by the census at a given moment in time.        While researchers cautioned against drawing major       conclusions, the trends that emerge in the data are       consistent with what other surveys have found prior to the       pandemic as a result of employment discrimination, underpay,       discriminatory lending practices and other policies that have       limited economic mobility for queer people.        According to The 19th's analysis of the first four releases       of data from the census survey, as much as 23 percent of       LGBTQ+ people and 32 percent of trans people reported having       lost employment in the month before the census conducted its       questionnaire. About 15 to 16 percent of non-LGBTQ+ people       reported the same.        About 12 percent of LGBTQ+ people said they sometimes or       often did not have enough to eat. For non-LGBTQ+ people, the       figure was between 6 and 7 percent, and for trans Americans,       it was as high as 24 percent. About 31 percent of queer       people also said they had difficulty paying for basic       household expenses; for non-LGBTQ+ people it was 23 percent.        Housing insecurity was prevalent across all groups, with       more than 40 percent of people--both LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+--      saying they were very or somewhat likely to face eviction by       the end of September or October.        It's unclear how accurate the data for transgender       Americans is because the sample sizes are much smaller. But       it does follow what is already known: Roughly 29 percent of       respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, done by the       National Center for Transgender Equality and seen as the only       comprehensive study of its kind, said they lived in poverty.       About 30 percent said they had experienced homelessness in       their lifetimes.        ``These are sort of the systemic disparities that we       observed pre-pandemic, that the pandemic has not only       deepened for both groups, but also sort of widened,'' said       David Schwegman, assistant professor of public policy and       administration at American University, who has conducted       research on ``same-sex couples'' and housing discrimination.        Wilson at the Williams Institute said that absent this kind       of large-scale data collection about LGBTQ+ people,       policymakers couldn't truly answer big questions about       whether attempts to address economic stress exacerbated by       the pandemic--like the now-expired federal eviction       moratorium--were working for everyone.        But data collection is only one step toward equity.        Dean Spade, an associate professor at Seattle University       School of Law who has also advised the upcoming National       LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey by think tank Justice Work,       said that real change requires more than just counting trans       and LGBTQ+ people at the federal level.        Counting marginalized people to better understand the       issues they face doesn't necessarily mean their suffering       will be addressed through policy, he noted--and trans people       are accustomed to social services leaving them out or not       being designed with them in mind. It's why trans people, for       example, are helping each other pay for medical procedures       that aren't covered by insurance, housing those experiencing       homelessness and creating mutual aid networks, Spade said.        ``We're helping each other survive right now,'' he said.        And there are still significant challenges with the data as       it is. Samples sizes are small, an issue that has barred       marginalized communities, including Asian women, Native       Americans and Pacific Islander women, from representation in       real-time data on some national surveys.        Those small sample sizes make it difficult to draw big       conclusions from the data until months down the line. The       Census Bureau said in a statement that it currently doesn't       have additional analysis to offer on the data, though it did       publish a report on the first set of LGBTQ+ data this summer,       finding that LGBTQ+ people are more likely than non-LGBTQ+       people to face economic hardship.        ``The primary focus has been on collecting and releasing       data in a timely manner but there are plans in the future to       release data products that will provide additional context,''       the bureau said in a statement.        The other challenge has been crafting questions in a way       that takes into account knowledge gaps people may have about       what terminology best describes them.        The census survey, for example, asks respondents to choose       which best represents how they think of themselves: ``gay or       lesbian''; ``bisexual''; ``something else''; ``I don't       know''; or ``straight, that is not gay or lesbian.'' In past       attempts to phrase these questions, heterosexual people have       been found to incorrectly mark themselves, economists said,       so additional phrases have been added to improve clarity.        The survey also asks if people describe themselves as male,       female or transgender, and some transgender people may not       want to identify themselves given the rise in anti-trans       bills across the country, Schwegman said.        Spade pointed to smaller studies led by advocates as       important pools of information that can't be found anywhere       else, since they ask questions about daily threats like over-      policing and poverty.        ``I think that those kinds of studies can be, to a lot of       us, more valuable than something larger that didn't ask the       questions or that missed whole groups of people in our       community,'' he said.        The real-time data from surveys like the current census       one, which will be collecting responses from July 21 to       October 11, could help impact policies in real time. The       problem for pandemic-related policies being negotiated in       Congress this fall is that this data may be coming too late,       Wilson said.        ``It's 18 months into the pandemic, and had that been the       starting place, we would not be looking at a sample size that       would create problems for all the analyses that we want to do       to understand a trans-specific experience,'' Wilson said.     Madam Speaker, my amendment would direct the  Comptroller General to issue a report to Congress about the impact of  the implementation of this act on the provision of services to LGBTQI+  persons. It would ensure the impact of H.R. 4176 by ensuring  transparency in the correlation between the provision of services and  one's gender identity, sexual orientation, and variation in sex  characteristics.   Again, I have emphasized, we want to have truth and discussion here.  We want to be helpful. We want to affirm people and have them counted.  Data collection through this act will be used to monitor the flow of  social services to LGBTQI communities.   This will encourage the provision of services to the LGBTQI+  community, and if there are shortcomings, Congress and the public will  be informed of them so that they can be remedied soon thereafter.   Despite our many gains, the United States is not always a welcoming  place for individuals across many spectrums. This is essentially true  for those coming from unaffirming communities and families, those for  whom living their authentic lives may come at the cost of social ties  and support systems.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because  it affirms children, families, our fellow colleagues, our soldiers, law  enforcement, first responders, firefighters, teachers, people who see  us in the retail area. It affirms America. This knowledge about who we  are can be enormously helpful to being a better America.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chairwoman  of the full committee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains  on each side.    Madam Speaker, let me offer what we are living in.  There are more than 300 laws that have been passed across the Nation  that are discriminating against the LGBTQI+ community. In addition, we  find that less than half of these 50 States are protecting this  community. That means that there is a half loaf for many in this  community.   How do we remedy and educate States and local communities? We do so  by ensuring that information is given. That is how you protect taxpayer  dollars, that you are constructive in the use of dollars.   This is only to help with better implementation of social services  that are already rendered, but such social services may not be geared  toward addressing some of the populations here in the United States.   My amendment, which is what we always ask for, is making sure that we  are accountable when we are addressing the concerns that have not been  addressed in the LGBTQI+ community.   That is what I hope most people will see. But at the same time, I  hope my amendment characterizes what America is: a compassionate, with  passion, caring, and humanitarian Nation.   We go all over the world to fight for human rights, justice, and  equality. Our soldiers put on the uniform to dignify our Constitution.  Why not here in America?   Do my friends on the other side of the aisle realize how many men and  women in the United States military come from the LGBTQI+ community?  They didn't ask questions; they put on the uniform. I know they fought  really hard not to have questions asked.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment for  accountability and fairness and to recognize all of us are Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Houston pride community and the 44th annual pride parade in Houston and  to celebrate the caucus that has fought against HIV/AIDS, political  empowerment, educating the public, and helping those in the LGBTQI  community who could not help themselves.   I congratulate them for a stupendous commitment to civic  participation in our State and in our community.   Let me also say that I rise again to raise the Protect Our Kids Act,  an act passed by this House really dealing with gun safety and  protecting our kids by raising the age for assault weapons, by banning  magazines, by ensuring they are stored, by stopping trafficking,  stopping ghost guns, and stopping bump stocks.   Yes, we did a magnificent job in the House. We look forward to moving  forward with legislation that we hope will make a difference. We are a  part of the change, and I hope that we will move some elements of the  Protect Our Kids Act as we go forward to make sure we do, in fact,  protect our kids.                            ____________________
