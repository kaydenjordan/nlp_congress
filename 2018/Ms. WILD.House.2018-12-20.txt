 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, volunteers across the  country honored fallen servicemembers on National Wreaths Across  America Day. While the focal point of this national day of remembrance  is the laying of wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, ceremonies  also took place at local cemeteries across the country.   I had the honor of participating in a wreath-laying ceremony in  Prospect Park, Pennsylvania, a tiny borough no more than a mile square,  in Delaware County. On a raw and rainy Saturday, 2 weeks before  Christmas, nearly 50 community members turned out to lay wreaths upon  veterans' graves at an historic cemetery atop Prospect Hill. Among  those honored was George Wood, a soldier who lost his life at  Gettysburg on July 7, 1863.   As we stood in the drizzle, listening to ``Taps,'' I thought about  the many ways in which people served their communities. Obviously,  those who serve in our Armed Forces commit to providing the ultimate  service. But on that hilltop last weekend, there were so many others  willing to spend the time to step up with their neighbors, honor the  sacrifice of others, and bring a community together.    I want to recognize Joyce Foresman-Capuzzi, the nurse who learned  about the Wreaths Across America program and brought her neighbors  together to have it in Prospect Park. I want to recognize Reverend  Chris Hensley Terrell, the pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church,  which hosted the event.   But the event wouldn't have been the success that it was without the  participation of other volunteers, the members of the Prospect Park  Borough Council, the Prospect Park Volunteer Fire Department, and local  veterans and their families. There was also great support from the  local elementary school principal and students at Prospect Park  Elementary, many of whom helped lay wreaths.   I want to thank all these community members for allowing me to  participate in their ceremony, and I thank them for their service.                            ____________________
