 Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recommend again  Dr. Carson as the Secretary of HUD. Dr. Carson brings a fresh set of  eyes to every issue and every problem he faces, and he has an  incredible record of success and of achieving outstanding results. We  look forward to his bringing that same kind of analytical mind and  management to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.   I don't think there is a better pick that could have been made. I  urge my colleagues to support this motion to invoke cloture.   I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Montana.                          Confirmation of Ryan Zinke     Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is no one  else who wants to speak on either side. So at this time, I yield back  all time on both sides.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending  cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination       of Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., of Florida, to be Secretary of       Housing and Urban Development.          Mitch McConnell, Johnny Isakson, Jeff Flake, Steve             Daines, James Lankford, Roger F. Wicker, Dan Sullivan,             Thom Tillis, Rob Portman, John Thune, John Hoeven, Deb             Fischer, James M. Inhofe, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham,             Jerry Moran, Pat Roberts.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  nomination of Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., of Florida, to be Secretary of  Housing and Urban Development shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I applaud my colleagues for voting in favor  of cloture on the nomination of Dr. Benjamin Carson to be the next  Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.   On January 12, the Senate Banking Committee held its confirmation  hearing, and Dr. Carson responded to questions and concerns thoroughly  and thoughtfully. Dr. Benjamin Carson was unanimously reported out of  the Senate Banking Committee on January 24.   To many Americans, Dr. Carson needs no introduction; however, his  impressive resume bears repeating. Dr. Carson was raised by a single  mother in an impoverished part of the city of Detroit. He attended Yale  University and the University of Michigan Medical School and later  became a highly accomplished and respected neurosurgeon. Dr. Carson was  named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in  1984, at the age of 33--the youngest such director in the Nation.    He gained national fame in the 1980s by becoming the first doctor to  lead an operation that separated twins who were conjoined at the head-- one of many high-profile operations led by Dr. Carson. He also ran for  President this past election and spent months traveling the country,  listening to the American people about the problems and the issues they  face with respect to housing.   During his testimony before our committee, Dr. Carson highlighted his  commitment to carrying forth the  [[Page S1514]]  mandate of HUD and to learning more from the people who are directly  affected by HUD policies. He has also received bipartisan letters of  support from four former HUD Secretaries--Henry Cisneros, former  Senator Mel Martinez, Alphonso Jackson, and Steven Preston--who served  under both Republican and Democratic administrations.   He has said he plans to continue his conversation with the American  people and do a listening tour if confirmed. This is an encouraging  sign that Dr. Carson wants to hear from stakeholders and, more  importantly, from the American people.   There are many HUD issues to be addressed. Once confirmed, we can  begin working on several important issues under HUD's jurisdiction.  Streamlining requirements for local public housing authorities,  revising certain public housing programs, and strengthening financing  for small and rural affordable housing developments are areas that  should be addressed. Tackling homelessness, especially among our  Nation's veterans, is another issue that is important to me and should  be addressed.   It is critical that HUD allow local communities to craft solutions  that work best for their needs. There has been bipartisan interest in  several of these reforms over the years, and I am confident we can make  progress once Dr. Carson is confirmed.   Dr. Carson has consistently demonstrated a commitment to improving  the lives of his fellow Americans, and his intellect, leadership, and  life experiences are unique, valuable assets for leading an agency like  HUD.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Dr. Carson's nomination so  we can continue the great work of improving America's housing system.   Senator Cornyn very graciously gave me his time, which he was lined  up to take first. He has asked if he could take his time at this point.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be next  allowed to speak.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The majority whip.
