 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman,  Congresswoman Wagner, for yielding.   As the Representative of North Carolina's Ninth Congressional  District, I am proud to represent 55,000 members of the Lumbee Tribe.   When I served in the North Carolina General Assembly, just before  this special election in September, I cosponsored legislation  clarifying North Carolina's recognition of the Lumbee.   It became law just in July.                                time  1715    H.R. 4029 would allow the Lumbee to apply directly for homeless  assistance grants instead of having to rely on nonprofits or other  governmental entities.   This commonsense proposal will empower the Lumbee to act directly to  provide shelter and other services to their own members and will not  cost the Federal Government one penny.   The Lumbee are in the best position to help their own Tribal members,  and this bill will empower them to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4029.
