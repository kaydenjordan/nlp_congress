 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 266, which  provides badly needed financial support for small businesses and  hospitals. Our Nation continues to struggle with the health and  economic impacts of COVID-19.   But I must also comment on the function of Congress. We passed the  CARES Act almost 30 days ago. Since then, the lights have been off  here. Today, we vote for one crucial item and depart again.   I will vote ``aye'' on the relief package, but I stress Congress must  get back to work here in the Capitol. We all must resume our full  duties and obligations to the Constitution and, most importantly, to  the American people. We took an oath to preserve and protect both.
