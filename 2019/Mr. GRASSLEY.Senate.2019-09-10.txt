 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, agriculture and the family farmers of  America depend upon exports for prosperity. Passing the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement is then critical to provide farmers and ranchers with  the certainty they need to make long-term business decisions.   Over $10 billion worth of agricultural products are exported each  year to our neighbors, and that supports more than 86,000 jobs.  Modernizing and improving our trade relationships with Canada and  Mexico is a bipartisan no-brainer.   Former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and I discussed the USMCA  in Des Moines last month at a local dairy processing plant. Secretary  Vilsack and I agree we must pass the USMCA to help our farmers.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
