 Mr. President, there is a reason that the  John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act bears his name, and the reason is that  John Lewis was truly a civil rights hero, an icon, a trailblazer, a  model, and a mentor to so many of us, not because of what he said but  because of what he did.   In marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where he was beaten and  bloodied in leading those civil rights activists, in fighting for  equality and justice here in the Halls of Congress, he set a model of  courageous public service that inspires us today.   It has inspired voting rights since 1965, when those acts of courage  led the Congress to adopt that Voting Rights Act of 1965. It was  bipartisan then; it has been a bipartisan cause since then. In fact, it  was most recently reauthorized in 2006 by an overwhelming bipartisan  vote.   There should be nothing partisan about voting rights, which go to the  core of our democracy. They are the lifeblood of our democracy, as we  know better or as well as anyone in this Chamber, because we know that  we act here with authority by the consent of the governed, as the  Founders said. We govern by the consent of the people who elect us,  hopefully fairly. That is the reason we need now the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act, because the U.S. Supreme Court, in two  decisions, Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National  Committee, has in effect eviscerated--more bluntly, gutted--two key  sections, 5 and 2, of the Voting Rights Act.    Now, we have the opportunity--in fact, we have the obligation to make  sure that the memory and the cause of John Lewis in advancing voting  rights are upheld. We have that obligation not for ourselves but for  the country, which is why John Lewis fought so hard and so well.   Today, State legislatures are taking advantage of the gaps and  defects opened by those two Supreme Court decisions to attack America's  right to vote. What we are seeing is the greatest assault on voting  rights in the history of this country, maybe with the exception of Jim  Crow.   I know some have called these laws a second Jim Crow. It may be the  son of Jim Crow or the nephew or niece of Jim Crow, but the goal is the  same: suppression of voting rights, discriminating against individuals  who have that right to vote.   Last week, I chaired a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee on  the impact of these two Supreme Court decisions on voting rights. What  we heard from the witnesses appearing there was nothing less than a  call to action to protect our democracy and live up to America's  founding ideals. We heard from men and women who have been litigating-- in the trenches, on the frontline of this battle to preserve voting  rights--about the impact of these two Supreme Court decisions and the  lower court decisions that have been in their wake.   Since Shelby County in 2013, approximately 21,000 polling places  nationwide serving the people of the United States on election day have  been eliminated. Millions of voters have been purged from the voter  rolls. This year alone, 17 States have passed 28 laws to restrict  voting rights.   This assault on the right to vote, this effort to suppress men and  women who by law should have that right, is purposeful, relentless,  unremitting, and it is supported, unfortunately, by elected officials  across the country. We have seen it in Arizona, in Florida, Texas, but  many more State legislatures are moving in this direction. The voting  rights of this Nation are at stake because what we are seeing is a  deliberate, systematic attempt to make it harder and more difficult to  register to vote and particularly for people of color to have this  right. It is an attempt to subvert our democracy and attack the  lifeblood of our Nation.   We know in theory that the Founders intended that, in fact, our  government ``derives [its] just powers from the consent of the  governed.'' But more than an exercise in theory, this effort is a  direct, clear attempt to defend against the tsunami of voter  suppression bills now crashing on our Nation. That is why the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act should be bipartisan. I have no  illusions about it being so, but one way or the other, we ought to  follow the advice of John Lewis, who said:         The right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the       most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a       democratic society.    In memory of what he said but more in tribute to the ideals of  democracy that he advanced by his actions, we should stand up to this  assault on our democracy and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act. There is no time to waste.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
