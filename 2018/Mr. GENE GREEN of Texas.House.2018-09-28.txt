 Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland  Security announced a proposed rule change that would increase the  number of immigrants considered a public charge.   This rule change is a dangerous departure from our current  immigration policy. The administration is hurting immigrant families,  including families that are U.S. citizens, by penalizing those who seek  a green card or visa and use programs like SNAP, housing assistance, or  Medicaid.   This rule has the potential to impact about 1.8 million Texas  children whose parents may forego critical needs like food and health  assistance for their families in fear that, if they use these programs,  it will hinder their access to citizenship. This is another step by the  Trump administration to restrict immigration into the country.   In Houston, we have a long history of immigrants and newcomers  bringing innovation, entrepreneurship, and hard work. It has made  Houston what it is today. From the separation of our families at the  southern border to punishing immigrant families for using programs they  legally qualify for, I am deeply saddened by this administration's  constant disregard for the children and their families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act, bipartisan legislation that will help stem the tide  against the Nation's opioid crisis and support Americans overcoming  opioid addiction.   In 2016 alone, 42,000 Americans died from opioids, including  prescription pain relievers and illicit opioids like fentanyl. This is  a serious national crisis that affects public health and the social and  economic welfare of communities throughout our great country.   The Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I am proud to  serve on as ranking member, held several hearings on the opioid crisis  last spring. I am proud to see our committee and both Chambers of  Congress come together and support the package before us today that  includes the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act that I  introduced, along with my friend Representative Brett Guthrie from  Kentucky, earlier this year.   This legislation would fund designated treatment centers where  Americans suffering from opioid abuse can receive comprehensive  patient-centered care. The bill would allow designated treatment  centers to provide wraparound services, including mental health,  counseling, recovery housing, and job training and placement to support  reintegration into the workforce. These wraparound services have been  shown to help many Americans successfully overcome opioid addition.   The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes several  provisions to combat this crisis, including strengthening the Federal  Government's authority to restrict illegal drugs entering our country,  and providing Medicaid for at-risk youth and former foster children.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and support this  important legislation.
