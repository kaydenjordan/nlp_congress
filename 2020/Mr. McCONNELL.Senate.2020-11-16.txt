 Mr. President, once again, this morning brought two  different sets of headlines on the pandemic we have been battling for  the last 9 months.   On one hand, rates of infection and hospitalization are rising  rapidly nationwide. We must all continue taking smart precautions, such  as wearing masks and practicing social distancing.   But at the same time, we continue to receive hopeful signs that  victory may actually be on the horizon.   This morning, the American biotech firm Moderna and our National  Institutes of Health announced that early trials suggest the vaccine  they are jointly developing may be both safe and more than 94 percent  effective.   This follows Pfizer's similar announcement last week. As former FDA  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb summed it up this morning, ``when the full  data comes out, we may have two highly effective vaccines against  COVID.''   If these results hold, we are told the first doses of a vaccine could  be administered to certain vulnerable people as soon as next month,  with wider distribution by next spring. This is a remarkable testament  to American ingenuity: to bright researchers and brave test  participants, to bold commitments from the private sector, and historic  support from smart public policy like Operation Warp Speed from the  Trump administration and from this Senate.   As Moderna's CEO said this morning, ``I want to thank our partners at  BARDA and Operation Warp Speed who have been instrumental in  accelerating our progress to this point.''   Operation Warp Speed spent billions in funding to expedite research  and development. It provided a streamlined regulatory environment and  prepurchase agreements to reduce risk. It has mobilized the compilation  of the basic supplies--things like needles and swabs--that need to  travel with the vaccine itself.   We have every indication that this historic public-private  partnership is on track to deliver a scientific miracle and help us  defeat the virus in the months ahead.   Certainly there is no time to waste. Kentucky just announced our  highest ever weekly count of new positive cases. The numbers are  troubling in places all across our country. So, for now, our job is to  continue doing all we can to stay safe and slow the spread.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a totally different matter, the last  several days have brought renewed speculation about the prospect of  rapidly withdrawing all U.S. military forces from Syria, Iraq, and  Afghanistan.   Here in Congress, a small minority in both parties seem to think it  is in America's power to unilaterally remove conflicts by simply  walking away from them.   Let me say that again. A small minority in both parties seem to think  it  [[Page S6688]]  is in America's power to unilaterally resolve conflicts by simply  walking away from them.   Of course all wars must end. The question is now how they end and  whether the terms on which they end are favorable or unfavorable to the  security and interests of the United States.   And nothing about the circumstances we face today suggests that if we  lose resolve, the terrorists will simply leave us alone.   Over the last 4 years, the Trump administration has made tremendous  headway in creating the conditions that will secure the enduring defeat  of the terrorists. This President and his policies have strengthened  America's hand in multiple Middle East conflicts while reducing the  risks and costs to our country. The ISIS caliphate has been shattered,  and millions have been liberated from their brutal rule. We have  removed master terrorists like al-Baghdadi, Soleimani, and senior al- Qaida and ISIS leaders from the battlefield.   The Trump administration has brokered diplomatic successes that  should help bring long-term stability and more economic opportunity to  a troubled region. The Abraham Accords are a geostrategic game changer.   The last 4 years have also brought increased skin in the game from  our allies and our partners. Our friends in Europe and elsewhere have a  shared interest in stopping safe havens for terror. Today, in Africa,  our limited American presence supports a multinational initiative led  by France to combat radical Islamic terrorists.   Likewise, in places where American forces continue to play roles in  ongoing conflicts across the broader Middle East, Secretaries Mattis  and Esper worked hard and successfully to secure renewed contributions  from European partners and to transition our posture more and more  toward a supporting role.   Our local partners are demonstrably shouldering the lion's share of  the burden in the fight. In neither Afghanistan nor Iraq nor Syria are  American combat forces playing a primary role.   We have scored major battlefield successes by supporting and working  with and through local partners, such as the Afghan National Security  Forces, the elite Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service, and the local  Kurdish and Arab fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces.   So the situation we face today is totally different than what we  faced 10 years ago. We do not have hundreds of thousands of soldiers  engaged in combat abroad.   We do not have hundreds of thousands of soldiers engaged in combat  abroad. We are not an occupying force.   Today, our limited American military presence in the Middle East is  supporting local forces and enabling multinational efforts.   We are playing a limited--limited but important role in defending  American national security and American interests against terrorists  who would like nothing more than for the most powerful force for good  in the world to simply pick up our ball and go home.   They would love that. That is why, last year, 70 Senators--a  bipartisan supermajority--voted for an amendment I authored that  acknowledged the progress made in Syria and Afghanistan, identified the  risks that remain, and cautioned that precipitous withdrawal would  create vacuums that Iran, Russia, and the terrorists would be  delighted--delighted--to fill.   There is no American who does not wish the war in Afghanistan against  terrorists and their enablers had already been conclusively won. But  that does not change the actual choice before us now.   A rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan now would hurt our  allies and delight--delight--the people who wish us harm. Violence  affecting Afghans is still rampant. The Taliban is not abiding by the  conditions of the so-called peace deal.   The consequences of a premature American exit would likely be even  worse than President Obama's withdrawal from Iraq back in 2011, which  fueled--fueled--the rise of ISIS and a new round of global terrorism.  It would be reminiscent of the humiliating American departure from  Saigon in 1975.   We would be abandoning our partners in Afghanistan, the brave Afghans  who are fighting the terrorists and destroying the government's  leverage in their talks with the Taliban that are designed to end the  fighting.   Our retreat would embolden the Taliban, especially the deadly Haqqani  wing, and risk plunging Afghan women and girls back into what they  experienced back in the 1990s. It would hand a weakened and scattered  al-Qaida a big, big propaganda victory and a renewed safe haven for  plotting attacks against America. And it would be welcome news to Iran,  which has long provided arms and support to the Taliban and explicitly  seeks our retreat from the Middle East.   A disorganized retreat would jeopardize the track record of major  successes this administration has worked hard to compile. A number of  former officials and Ambassadors recently stated: ``The spectacle of  U.S. troops abandoning facilities and equipment, leaving the field in  Afghanistan to the Taliban and ISIS, would be broadcast around the  world as a symbol of U.S. defeat and humiliation, and a victory for  Islamist extremism.''   President Trump deserves major credit--major credit--for reducing  U.S. forces in Afghanistan to a sustainable level, scoring major  victories against terrorists across the region, and ensuring the  Afghans themselves are at the front of the fight.   That same successful approach should continue until the conditions  for the long-term defeat of ISIS and al-Qaida have been achieved.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 505, H.R. 6395.
