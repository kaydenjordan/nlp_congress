 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for allowing me  to speak today on behalf of my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 5332, the  Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2020.   Madam Speaker, since I took office, I have been committed to helping  protect seniors and other vulnerable communities from fraud and to  protect their financial well-being. Like many of my colleagues,  constituents in my district are feeling the economic pain caused by the  ongoing pandemic.   Just this week, in fact, a constituent of mine, Patricia from  Wantage, New Jersey, reached out to me to ask: What can we do as  policymakers to help protect people's credit during this crisis?   Madam Speaker, I am proud that we were able to provide Americans with  debt and credit relief as part of the bipartisan CARES Act, protecting  homeowners in forbearance and Federal student loan borrowers. We were  able to continue to work to do so with the bipartisan HEROES Act, which  has yet to become law. It is in the Senate now waiting action. And that  act, including suspending negative credit reporting during the  pandemic, giving Americans time to recover economically before there is  a risk of being hit on their credit reports. It is also time that we  look at the way hardworking Americans are able to track and ensure  accuracy in their credit reports so that their scores are where they  need to be as we progress into our economic recovery.   Madam Speaker, I really want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her  impactful leadership and partnership on this bipartisan bill and her  incredibly supportive and smart team. I also thank Ranking Member  McHenry for spending so many months working with me in such a  constructive and cooperative manner. My bill reflects a lot of his wise  input. I, too, am sorry we weren't able to find ultimate common ground.  I also want to thank my good friend and co-chair of the Problem Solvers  Caucus,   Tom Reed, for his work cosponsoring this important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, after working on this bill for a year, I was proud  when the bill was reported favorably out of the Committee on Financial  Services on December 11, 2019.   I am also proud the House last night passed the landmark George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. We must continue to come together as a country  to fight for racial justice on all fronts, and to combat inequalities  that have plagued this Nation for too long, which includes the ability  to access credit.   Credit affects all communities, impacting what Americans pay for a  car, whether they can get a mortgage for a house, the rates on a credit  card, and how much they can receive for a small business loan. The  impact it has is especially strong on communities of color. And experts  have testified to the Committee on Financial Services that the credit  reporting system is biased, particularly against these communities.   Running this crucial part of our economy are three companies in the  United States that literally hold the keys to the kingdom. It is an  oligopoly. They decide Americans' credit fate and whether they should  get access to credit, and it is all done in a closed-off system behind  the drapes. And we don't know what goes on, how they develop those  scores.   I am very glad the ranking member is interested in trying to get more  competition into that process. And I am very eager--and I am sure the  committee is, too--to work together on that front.    I am also glad that there are areas that he would like to go further  on overall when it comes to access to credit. And I am also eager to  sit down as well.   Madam Speaker, the bottom line is these three credit bureaus come up  with their own magic number: Your credit score. Houdini, himself, could  not figure out how these credit scores are calculated. They have their  own secret formula. It impacts every aspect of your life, as I said,  from your car loan to your mortgage, and it is up to you to track it  and beg them to fix inaccuracies when they arise, which is far too  often, and most often not your fault.   The best way to discover whether there are errors on your credit  report is to check your three reports from these companies, and FCRA  currently only gives consumers the right to view their report for free  once every 12 months.   Otherwise, you have got to pay out of your own pocket and chase down  these three credit bureaus--anywhere from $9.95 a report to $15.95 a  report. Experts recommend that you check your report before applying  for any new line of credit or making a large purchase or renting or  buying a home because a mistake can easily seriously affect your  credit. It could lead to more costs and things like rising interest  rates that would affect your loans, and even worse, you may be  ineligible to qualify for financing altogether.   The Federal Trade Commission has previously found that one in 5  consumers have verified errors in their reports, not of their own  making. And one in 20 consumers have errors so serious that they would  be denied credit or need to pay more for it. That adds up to 42 million  Americans with errors in their credit and 10 million with errors that  can be life-altering.   We also now live in a world where data breaches are a constant  threat. Unfortunately, every year 15.4 million Americans are victims of  credit card fraud--42,000 people every single day.   According to the Merchant Risk Council, 80 percent of all credit  cards are compromised. And the Identity Theft Resources Center has  reported that as of June 11, there have been 475 reported data breaches  already this year, exposing more than 5 million records. And once you  are a victim, almost immediately the criminals, they start in. They  apply for new cards, for mortgages, for loans, for cars--anything else  they can get their hands on, all under your name--affecting your credit  score within these three credit bureaus. And it is vital that these  fraudsters be caught immediately and not be allowed to cause further  damage undetected between the one free annual report.   It has happened to my sister, to my constituents, to people I know.  And I am sure everyone out there knows someone this has happened to.  And when someone is the target of this fraud right now, it is up to the  victim to fix these issues. They receive all of the burden of chasing  after these three companies with their own systems and procedures and  beg them for help. And that can take 3 to 6 months.   Madam Speaker, my bipartisan legislation with Congressman   Tom Reed  from New York asked the private sector, not the government, to help fix  this. And this is a big distinction here that I want to point out to  the ranking member, this is driven by the private sector, not the  government, to fix this issue. My bipartisan bill sets up a one-stop  shop online portal to check your credit report for free at any time. It  allows victims to shut off the ability of credit crooks from using your  information to apply for credit under your name.   The portal will also provide the ability to initiate and resolve  disputes between you and the credit bureau, and you will be able to see  who the bureaus have sold your data to in the prior 2 years. Because,  yes, they take your data and they go make money on your information.   Madam Speaker, the bill strengthens cybersecurity safeguards of  information held by consumer reporting agencies, to help prevent a  repeat of the  [[Page H2564]]  2017 Equifax data breach. The bill also asks the GAO to examine the  most secure and accurate marker to track your credit, whether it is  your Social Security number or another Federal identifier. And this is  very important.   I am glad the ranking member raised this issue, because I agree. We  should find the best possible identifier that is most secure, and that  is exactly what this study is all about because we need to make sure we  keep your identity secure. By creating this one-stop portal, all three  credit bureaus will now have to work together to help protect you and  make your lives better, not the other way around.   And I understand the issue that is raised about the security and  making sure that this is not handed off to someone. That is why, again,  as I say, the private sector will develop these websites.   And to a point about this that was raised: If my friend is actually  really concerned, and he thinks that these three bureaus don't have  secure websites now, well then we better get them here immediately and  find out why he is worried about that and if they actually should be  more secure. Because what we are asking them to do is develop a website  just like they have now, which I hope--and I will ask the companies  again--I hope that they are doing everything possible to keep their own  websites secure.   Madam Speaker, well, my own sister had her credit hacked last year.  She told me she was lucky to get a day off from her job to figure all  this out. She had to sit on the phone and chase everyone. But what if  you don't have the ability to take a day off to sit on the phone with  each credit company and chase down every single issue? Our bipartisan  legislation will help fix this and help Americans protect what they  spent a lifetime building, and that is their credit.   Madam Speaker, I am also proud, lastly, to have the support of  several businesses and consumer groups. Vince Malta, the President of  the National Association of Realtors, sent a letter to me this week on  the bill, which states: ``Access to free credit scores, transparency in  the reporting process and use of consumer credit information high  standards for vetting credit information, and a reliable method for  contesting and correcting inaccurate information are critical to a  vibrant housing market and economy.''    Other supporting groups include the National Consumer Law Center, the  Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Action, and World Privacy  Forum.   Madam Speaker, while we did not earn the support of every group--and  I recognize that--I am proud that even among those who disagree with us  acknowledged the efforts that we took in order to work towards a  bipartisan agreement. I will continue to work to make every effort to  reach consensus, and I appreciate their acknowledgment of that effort.   Madam Speaker, finally, let me say that during an economic downturn  and throughout the years we are going to spend recovering from it,  Americans' financial security will and must be paramount.   We have already seen spikes in fraud throughout this pandemic,  especially related to direct payments and different types of loans. And  the chairwoman has worked overtime in all of our bills to make sure we  do everything possible to protect Americans during this time. I am  grateful for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, as we recover from this crisis, I want to make sure  Americans can protect their credit and resolve disputes that may arise.  As SEC Chairman Clayton testified just yesterday to the House Committee  on Financial Services, for a consumer, the best thing you can do for  yourself is understand your credit and get your credit under control.   We need a modernized system that empowers all consumers, especially  those facing new challenges with this new pandemic, with transparency  and the ability to correct errors to their credit reports, and to make  sure everyone can have access to credit so that they can have a home, a  car, and enjoy everything that everyone who works hard should have  access to.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  bipartisan bill, which will help every American.    Madam Speaker, just one point I want to bring back  up, if I may. I want to thank my friend for his comments, and I  appreciate his work and our efforts together here.   The one point about the Social Security number that I want to raise  is, the bill requires a study at the GAO to see what the best answer  is, whether if that is a Federal identifier number or a Social Security  number, whatever the best answer is.   I know we spent a lot of time talking about this. I, too, am very  concerned with making sure that we have the best possible outcome to  protect people and protect their information.   So if the GAO comes back and says that we need to develop a new  Federal identifier so that we keep it separate from the Social Security  number, then, to me, that would be the best outcome. That is exactly  why the bill requires the GAO to study this.   Again, just one other point, if we are concerned about current  security and cybersecurity.  [[Page H2565]]         I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Reclaiming my time.   Yes, they also have a period of time to develop the site. It is not  going to happen overall. In that period of time, we will get direction  on what the best outcome is in terms of using a Federal identifier, and  we will execute against that as we develop this site.   Back to the site. If the oligopoly of the three bureaus--if right now  our concern is that their sites are not secure, then we better have  them in immediately and have them take us through their sites again.  Because if you are still concerned about this--    I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Right, right. I remember that.    Reclaiming my time.   Just one question on that. Do you feel now that the three are still  insecure? And are you concerned about them?    Reclaiming my time.   Does the gentleman agree that we should have them back in  immediately, again, to talk to them and find out if they have made  progress?    The whole point is that, because they are still  insecure, we better let people actually have access to their data all  the time. That is what this bill does, so they can find out, instead of  having to pay 10 bucks or 15 bucks every time to see if these sites are  secure. That is my concern.   I thank the gentleman. I think we are good.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Riggleman for his points.  He is a good friend, and I respect him deeply.   I disagree here, respectfully. The whole point of this is to protect  consumers. Giving consumers more data to have access to about  themselves and to understand their own credit scores and their own  credit history and have more transparency into their own lives does not  hurt them; it helps them.   That is exactly what we are doing today, so that if you are hacked,  if you are one of the millions of Americans whose credit is stolen  every single day and you are trying to put your credit life back  together, not by your own making, because someone did it to you, and  they are opening accounts and doing things to you, what this  legislation will do is help you.   Instead of having to spend hours chasing down the three bureaus and  hoping that they actually do what they say they are going to do and put  your credit back together, so that when you want a house and a  mortgage, or you want a car, and you want to do the things that you  have worked very hard to build your credit for, someone else who stole  your credit won't be able to undermine that. That is what this bill  does.   One point, just to clarify this important point that the ranking  member made. The bill does not mandate the collection of Social  Security numbers. It simply requires that credit bureaus match the  information they already have on file to ensure that Jane Doe in  Illinois who defaults on her payments does not impair the credit of  Jane Doe in Indiana.   One of the biggest reasons consumers have errors in their files is  because of the mixed files when negative information is assigned to the  wrong person.   It is, once again, another reason why we need a place for consumers  to go to get free access to their reports, to file complaints  immediately, to contest issues when they see them, and to make sure  their credit isn't sold off to someone else right underneath them.   That is the point of this. And why we are having a GAO study is to  make sure we find the best way, the most secure way, to do this going  forward.   This legislation protects consumers; it protects Americans; and it  doesn't look out for the oligopoly. We need more competition there. It  looks out for the American consumer, and that is the point.                                time  1600
