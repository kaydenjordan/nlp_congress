 Mr. Speaker, almost 820,000 Minnesotans live with  arthritis every day. When you think about arthritis, you likely think  of it affecting only folks in their older years. But many of those  Minnesotans coping with arthritis are actually children.   Nationwide, 300,000 children suffer from juvenile arthritis, which  makes it harder to do all the things that are essential to being a kid:  Running, playing, enjoying the outdoors, and a chance to be themselves.  Families with children coping with this condition face very unique  challenges.   We have made a lot of progress, Mr. Speaker, in the fight against  juvenile arthritis, but there is still a lot of work to be done. July  is National Juvenile Arthritis Awareness Month, an opportunity to  recognize, to refocus, and redouble our efforts to find a cure.
