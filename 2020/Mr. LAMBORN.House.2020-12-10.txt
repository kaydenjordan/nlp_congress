 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to fill in for the ranking  member of the full committee, Representative Bishop. He was here  briefly earlier, but he is definitely under the weather.   Mr. Speaker, on this bill, I simply yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Huffman, for his  support of this bill. He made some great points in favor of it, and I  acknowledge and appreciate that.   I commend Congressman   Don Young from Alaska for his tireless  commitment to our fishermen.   Don Young is the dean of the House,  having served longer than any other of the 435 Members of Congress.   Research funded by Alaska Sea Grant found that the average age of  Alaskan fishers was over 50 years old, an increase of more than 10  years over the past generation.   Young commercial fishermen are facing increasing challenges, such as  barriers to entry and limited training opportunities, not to mention  that U.S. fisheries are among the most highly regulated, monitored, and  enforced fisheries in the world.   While NOAA has stated it has existing programs that address some of  these concerns, no one program is dedicated to training, educating, and  assisting the next generation of commercial fishermen. This bill  addresses that deficiency.   Again, I thank Congressman Young for his leadership on these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5040, the AIR Safety Act,  authored by Congressman   John Curtis from Utah. This is a simple bill  that will improve our ability to fight the wildfires that have  continued to wreak havoc in our Western States.   Although laws exist prohibiting interference with wildfire fighting,  many people still fly their private drones near fires to take pictures  and videos.   Unauthorized drones flying in these areas can cause all aerial  firefighting tools, including helicopters dropping flame retardant, to  be grounded, which wastes valuable time and money that could otherwise  be used to suppress the fire and save lives and property.   The AIR Safety Act directs our land management agencies to study  drone incursions over the past 5 years and mandates that the agencies  develop better strategies to prevent drones from interfering in  firefighting activities in the first place.   In the wake of yet another devastating wildfire season, it is  critical that we do everything we can to empower our brave wildland  firefighters with the tools they need to safely and quickly respond to  fires. This bipartisan bill is a small but important step toward  achieving that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Curtis), who introduced the bill and has sponsored it, along  with the bipartisan sponsorship of Mr. Huffman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5458 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  acquire, by donation only, approximately 40 acres of non-Federal land  for inclusion in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.   As many of you may know, Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the  crown jewels of our National Park System.   The land to be donated is directly adjacent to the current park  boundary and was recently donated to the Rocky Mountain Conservancy.  The land being donated is entirely undeveloped, so it won't increase  the deferred maintenance of the National Park Service in any way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H7123]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5459 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  exchange a 0.18-acre parcel of park land for the same amount of private  land to resolve a land ownership issue within the boundary of the Rocky  Mountain National Park.   In the 1970s, the National Park Service purchased land surrounding a  private inholding. An error in the bank's legal description incorrectly  included a 0.18-acre parcel in that purchase. As a result, the parcel  the National Park Service acquired included a family cabin, and the  private owner acquired a vacant lot, not the cabin site.   This bill will permanently resolve this issue with an equal value  land swap and ensure that the intent of the original purchase is met.  This may be the tiniest amount of land that we have ever considered in  a land use bill, but it is, nevertheless, an important piece of land  and a good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7098 would expand the boundary of Saguaro National  Park, Arizona, by a cumulative total of approximately 1,232 acres.   For those who haven't visited this park, it is another one of the  jewels of our National Park System. I have been there, and I would urge  everyone who has a chance to also visit this beautiful place.   The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire  land owned by the State of Arizona within the boundary of the park.   In addition, the bill also authorizes agreements where the National  Park Service would manage State-owned land within the boundary of the  park where acquisition is not possible.   Finally, the bill also authorizes a study to identify future  potential park expansions to better protect desert habitats in the  greater Tucson area.   Now, while I don't understand why the State of Arizona would want the  National Park Service to manage any more land within its boundaries,  this bill does go about expanding a park unit in the right way: through  an open, deliberative process in Congress. This bill authorizes a  rather large addition to the park, but we heard no local opposition to  the expansion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 7489, offered by our Natural Resources Committee colleague from  Virginia, Mr. Wittman, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  convey about 4.4 acres of Federal property for the construction of a  new commuter rail and pedestrian bridge spanning the Potomac.   Current law allows a right of way for railroads on most Federal  lands, but not for railroads on National Park Service lands, therefore,  legislation is needed to authorize a small amount of National Park  System land to be conveyed or used by Virginia to construct a railroad.   The Long Bridge Project will double the capacity of the Potomac River  rail crossing by adding a second two-track bridge adjacent to the  existing bridge, as well as a pedestrian crossing.   I commend Representative Wittman for his hard work on the Long Bridge  Project and for this bipartisan and tri-jurisdiction legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
