 Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, February 2, 2017, Gainesville,  Florida, and the State of Florida lost a favorite son in Mr. Perry C.  McGriff. Perry was an icon in my hometown of Gainesville, Florida, and  was known for his strong civic duty in helping people wherever and  whenever they needed it.   Perry was born in Arcadia, Florida, in 1937, and went to school at  the University of Florida, where he became an all-star standout in both  Gators football and baseball. His contributions on the field earned him  entry into the prestigious Hall of Fame as a Gators Great in 1969.   Perry was married to his wife, Noel, for 57 years, raised four  children--Jana, Mark, Keith, and Matthew--and enjoyed the joy and  laugher of their 15 grandchildren.   A tremendous family man, Perry was also successful in business. He  was an insurance agent for 48 years. He had the honor of being the  youngest person ever elected as mayor of Gainesville, and he was a  representative for the State of Florida.   He was a tireless volunteer and doer in Gainesville, receiving  countless awards and recognition for his community service. Two of  those particularly stick out to me. He received the first ever Ethics  in Business Award and the Service Above Self Award, given by the  Gainesville Rotary for his lifetime of service. In addition to his  time, Perry donated more than 60 gallons of blood and set an example  for all to follow.   For all the things Perry was and all the good things Perry did, I  will always remember him most for his smile, his great attitude, and  his notorious reputation to have his camera at the ready. He was always  snapping pictures of people enjoying life and making sure to send to  each individual a copy so they could remember the happy moments in the  life that he captured.   To Noel and the McGriff family, thank you for sharing Perry's time.  Thank you for sharing your husband and father with all of us. We will  miss him forever, but we will never forget Perry. All of us, the city  of Gainesville, the State of Florida, and I are all better for having  known Perry.                     Standing Strong Against North Korea     Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, North Korea said it had  successfully completed the launch of a new ballistic missile. The  Pukguksong-2, a medium-range ballistic missile, was test-fired on  Sunday. The actions by the North Korean regime are unacceptable and in  clear violation of the U.N. Security Council.   It is imperative that the U.S. stand strong with Japan, South Korea,  and all of our allies in the region against the provocative and  threatening actions of the North Korean totalitarian regime. It is a  regime that is determined to thumb their nose at the world by advancing  their nuclear capabilities, thus threatening their neighbors, the  region, and for that matter, the world.   The United States and its world partners must continue to persuade  North Korea to adhere to the U.N. Security Council resolutions or they  choose to invite worldwide sanctions upon them. This is North Korea's  decision and nobody else's.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Bilirakis for the work  that he has done. And I want to congratulate Chairman Roe for taking  over the Veterans' Affairs Committee.   I would also like to thank the committee staff for their diligence  and help on this piece of legislation, as well as the co-leads of this  bill, Representatives Rodney Davis, Kyrsten Sinema, and John Delaney.   Last Congress, WINGMAN passed the Veterans' Affairs Committee  unanimously in the House due to the bipartisan support of the Members  of this Chamber. While it was disappointing that we were unable to get  it across the finish line in the Senate, I feel confident, given the  support this bill has witnessed early on in this year, with 175 Members  in the House and 7 Members in the Senate, I am encouraged, and my hope  is that we will see it pass the Senate this Congress and be signed into  law by the President.   Congressional constituent advocates worked diligently in our district  offices to help veterans navigate the VA claims appeals system. But,  they are hampered by having to wait weeks, months, and sometimes even  years to receive documents from the VA that are often vital to helping  the veteran reach a favorable resolution.   WINGMAN will help to expedite the process by cutting out the  middleman and providing direct access to the files our office already  has permission to obtain. Currently, advocates must have a privacy  release form signed by the constituent prior to acting on their behalf.  This doesn't change. What changes is the wait time our offices,  veterans, and their families must endure while the VA sends us the  appropriate documents.   WINGMAN will help veterans such as James, from my district, who had  eight separate, but related, claims filed. He didn't know which files  were attached to which claims, the dates they were received, which  department they were referred to, or that he could have filed one  single, fully developed claim. Had my staff had access to the files,  which WINGMAN permits, they would have been able to assess the issue  and update his claims without having to go on a wild goose chase for  the documents with the VA system. Getting his case on track could have  happened in a matter of days, rather than years. He is more than  deserving of this, especially since some of his claims are over 6 years  old.   Another constituent lost her husband while he was serving this  Nation. The VA was mailing all correspondence to his widow to an  incorrect address. This resulted in an overpayment, which she was  unaware of since she was not receiving the mail. The long-term result  was a veteran's widow having her account sent to collections, which  damaged her credit, and ended with her new spouse's tax return being  confiscated. With access to the system files, our office would have had  a clearer picture of the timeline of events and been able to direct and  streamline our inquiry. Instead, our staff had to hunt down the  relevant files from numerous branches within the VA and reassemble them  like a jigsaw puzzle.   When I hear the story of Sergeant Abraham or Colonel Bergman or Staff  Sergeant Brian Mast behind me, these people have paid a price for their  service to this country, and our country owes them a debt. As a  country, we can do better by our veterans and their families. WINGMAN  will not get rid of the claims backlog or solve all of the problems.  What it will do, however, is make the process helping our veterans  easier.   Let's put the words ``customer service'' into our government. So I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
