 Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator  Murkowski, to bring awareness to National Education and Sharing Day  U.S.A., which we recognized on April 2, 2023. On this day, we  acknowledged the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson's global  campaign to educate youth about our responsibility to be a moral and  compassionate society.   Education and Sharing Day is observed each year on the Rebbe's  birthday in recognition of his outstanding and lasting contributions  toward the improvement of education, morality, and acts of charity  around the world. It is a day to pause and reflect on our  responsibility to ensure our youth have the foundation necessary to  lead lives rich in purpose and fulfillment through service and good  works.   This year's National Education and Sharing Day coincided with the  121st birthday of the Rebbe, one of the most significant Jewish leaders  of the 20th century. The Rebbe was a global spiritual leader and  leading advocate for the advancement of education. He stressed that a  moral and ethical education empowers every individual to develop their  full potential in making the world a better place. This year's  Education and Sharing Day has even greater significance as this year is  also a year of ``Hakhel,'' a biblical event of unity, education, and  spiritual growth emphasizing how every person is crucial to perfecting  the world.   The basis for the continuity of any society is education, and in the  great State of Alaska, the education of our youth is a priority. We  recognize that in order to achieve its highest goals, education must  not only impart knowledge but also help our youth learn how to live  meaningful lives by strengthening their moral character to make a  better life for themselves as individuals and for society as a whole.  Such education can nurture the unity of diverse peoples by encouraging  increased acts of goodness and kindness, imbued with the awareness that  even a single positive act of an individual can change the world.   We strongly affirm the purposes of National Education and Sharing Day  U.S.A. and encourage educational institutions, businesses, community  and civic associations, and all people of the United States to  celebrate and promote National Education and Sharing Day U.S.A.                            ____________________
