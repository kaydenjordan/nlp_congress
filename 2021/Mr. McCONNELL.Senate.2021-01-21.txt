 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for this 117th Congress, the American  people chose an evenly split Senate--50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.  With the election of Vice President Harris, that means the Democratic  leader will act as majority leader.   So I want to congratulate my colleague from New York. His pride and  emotion were palpable yesterday as this self-described ``kid from  Brooklyn [and] son of an exterminator and a housewife'' became the  first Jewish Member of Congress to lead either Chamber--a historic  milestone.  [[Page S80]]    Now, the Senate has handled an even split before. Twenty years ago,  faced with the same scenario, the two leaders brokered a power-sharing  agreement so the institution could function smoothly.   The Democratic leader and I are discussing a similar agreement now. I  have been heartened to hear my colleague say he wants the same rules  from the 2000s to apply today, because, certainly, 20 years ago there  was no talk--none whatsoever--of tearing down longstanding minority  rights on legislation.   The legislative filibuster is a crucial part of the Senate. Leading  Democrats, like President Biden himself, have long defended it.  Democrats themselves just spent 6 years using it, literally, to block  bills from Senator Tim Scott's police reform to coronavirus relief.   And less than 4 years ago, when it was Republicans who held the  Senate, the House, and the Presidency, 27 current Democrats plus Vice  President Harris signed a letter insisting this longstanding rule  should not be broken.   So if the talk of unity and common ground is to have meaning and,  certainly, if the rules from 20 years ago are to be our guide, then I  cannot imagine the Democratic leader would rather hold up the power- sharing agreement than simply reaffirm that his side won't be breaking  this standing rule of the Senate.   I appreciate our ongoing, good-faith discussions and look forward to  finding the solution together.   Our side takes a great deal of pride in the accomplishments that  three consecutive Republican Senates have delivered for the American  people.   In 2014, our majority was elected to check and balance the last years  of a lameduck Presidency.   In 2016, we were reelected to help ignite a real, all-American  economic comeback, rebuild and modernize our military, and fight for  the forgotten corners of our country. Together with the Trump  administration and a Republican House, we did just that.   In 2018, we were rehired again on those strong results, especially  the historic job market for American workers and our commitment to the  judiciary.   And now, even as voters chose President Biden for the White House,  they simultaneously shrunk Democrats' House majority and elected this  evenly divided Senate.   The 2020 election was as far from a sweeping mandate for ideological  transformation as any election we have seen in modern history. The  American people stunned the so-called experts with the number of  Republicans they sent to the House and to the Senate to make sure  commonsense conservative values have a powerful say in the government.   So our side is ready to share ideas and work with the Biden  administration, applying common sense to find common ground for the  common good. But if and when our Democratic friends depart from common  sense, when they retreat from common ground or their proposals harm the  common good, then we will use the power the American people have given  us to push for what we think is right.   On the Biden administration's very first day, it took several big  steps in the wrong direction. The President reentered the failed Paris  climate agreement, a terrible bargain that would set us up to self- inflict major economic pain on working American families with no  assurance that China or Russia would honor their commitments. In fact,  the United States has already been reducing carbon emissions, while  China and other nations in the agreement have kept increasing theirs.  Rejoining will just set us up to kill American jobs while our  competitors continue to roar on by.   The President also unilaterally canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline.  The day-one priority was to kill thousands of American jobs, including  union jobs, disappoint our strong ally Canada, and reverse some of our  progress toward energy security. This is a project that the liberal  Canadian Government and Prime Minister Trudeau support--an investment  in North American energy. Even the Obama State Department concluded it  would not harm the climate. But because canceling the pipeline project  just feels like the green thing to do, the new administration killed  all these jobs. This was not the day one the American workers deserved.   The new administration has also sketched out a massive proposal for  blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while  creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the  same time. This kind of failed approach will invite another  humanitarian crisis on our border and privilege powerful interests  ahead of American workers.   For all the talk about norms within government, last night brought a  truly unprecedented move at the National Labor Relations Board. The  President fired the Board's independent general counsel almost a year  before the end of his term. Even leftwing activists called the  unprecedented move ``aggressive.''   Now, it is still early. There is still plenty of time for President  Biden to remember that he does not owe his election to the far left.  The President can and should refocus his administration on creating  good-paying American jobs, not sacrificing our people's livelihoods to  liberal symbolism. Senate Republicans will be ready, willing, and eager  to help make that happen.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, for more than two decades, my friend  Dr. Michael Carter has made Campbellsville University an oasis where  students can answer their calling. Nestled in the heart of Taylor  County, CU offers quality Christian higher education to thousands of  future leaders. As the school's president, Michael accomplished one  remarkable goal after another. He also set the university on a path  toward long-term success. At the end of last year, Michael began a  richly-earned retirement leaving behind a grateful university  community. I would like to take a moment today to recognize my friend  for his servant leadership and his lasting impact in Kentucky and  beyond.   According to CU's board chair, Michael's leadership ``forever  transformed'' the century-old school. I couldn't agree more. When  Michael came to campus in 1999, the university was home to around 1,600  students and 74 full-time faculty. His tenure has seen the CU family  grow to include more than 13,500 students and a record-setting freshman  class despite the coronavirus pandemic. CU recently graduated its first  class of Ph.D. students, marking a major milestone for the school's  academic excellence. He also nearly tripled the faculty ranks with  leading scholars and dedicated educators.   To accommodate the new students and faculty, Michael undertook an  ambitious plan to grow CU's physical footprint. That plan--like  everything at CU--was centered on faith. Michael embarked on the  construction of a landmark chapel anchoring the entire community in its  mission. Then, under the steeple of the new Ransdell Chapel, the growth  has continued to surpass expectations.   CU's expansion wasn't limited to the city of Campbellsville, either.  Michael oversaw the opening of eight additional centers of learning in  Kentucky and around the country. The university was even approved for a  new international arm in Ontario. Today, CU properties account for 1.1  million square feet, giving it the ability to serve current students  with plenty of space to expand its reach.   In each of my visits to the school, I have been impressed by the  remarkable development under Michael's leadership. From its 850 student  athletes to a $137 million economic impact in Taylor County, Michael  has helped CU reach previously unbelievable heights. With the rest of  his all-star leadership team, including my friend Dr. John Chowning,  Michael drove the school's growth while keeping focus on an unmatched  student experience.   When CU bid farewell to its president, the community also said  goodbye to its consequential first lady. Debbie Carter has a long list  of accomplishments in her own right. She took a leadership role in  securing a national accreditation for CU's Carver School of Social  Work. She was also a driving force to create pathways for students with  financial needs to attend CU. Michael and Debbie made an incredible  team that changed this university and our Commonwealth for years to  come.   Whatever the future holds in store for Michael and Debbie, I would  like to wish them the very best. They leave office with the sincere  gratitude of a university community made better by two decades of  devotion. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring Dr.  Michael Carter for his leadership at Campbellsville University.                            ____________________
