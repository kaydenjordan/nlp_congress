 Madam Speaker, I am grateful to be  recognized by the Magnet Schools of America as a Champion of Magnet  School Excellence and to be a steadfast supporter of magnet schools. I  appreciate that President Donald Trump's praising of magnet schools was  included last night in the State of the Union.   Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Dutch Fork Elementary  School Academy of Environmental Sciences, a magnet school in Irmo,  South Carolina. Dutch Fork is one of many amazing examples of how  magnet schools are important for academic excellence. I had the  opportunity to meet with students and teachers and talk with them about  their unique educational experiences.   I was thankful to talk with Katrina Goggins, the Director of  Communications for District Five of Lexington and Richland Counties,  Principal Julius Scott, Assistant Principal Brandon Gantt, School  District Five Magnet Director Sara Wheeler, and Shirley Cope.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the courageous  leadership of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
