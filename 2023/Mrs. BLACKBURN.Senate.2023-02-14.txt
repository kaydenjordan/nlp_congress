 Mr. President, in 1973 the citizens of  Fairview, TN set out to solve a problem. Their community was growing,  but individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities were  being left behind. Not content to ignore their plight, a small group of  families and local leaders put their heads together. After much  deliberation, Waves was born.   50 years later, what started as a small but significant passion  project has blossomed into a pillar of the Williamson County community.  Each day, close to 100 full-time and part-time employees and volunteers  serve more than 700 children and adults through early learning, adult  day service, adult residential, and employment programs.   Here in Washington, we provide what support we can to community  programs like these. But, as the people at Waves and other places like  it will tell you, what keeps these organizations going is the support  of their friends and neighbors and the belief in the possibility of a  loving and more supportive world.   As they celebrate their 50th anniversary, I want to thank the  dedicated team at Waves for giving so much of themselves to this cause.  On behalf of all Tennesseans, I wish you the very best and look forward  to seeing what you do next.                            ____________________
