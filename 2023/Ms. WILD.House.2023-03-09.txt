 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a fellow  Pennsylvanian, Gary Wasserson, of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.   A little over a year ago following the beginning of Russia's full- scale invasion of Ukraine, Gary found out that he had distant cousins  in Lviv. That realization prompted him to act, and soon he was on the  Poland-Ukraine border assembling a team to cross the border and bring  his relatives to safety.   Gary didn't stop there.   He has helped build an entire support network coming to the aid of  Ukrainians in need: assisting in the successful extraction of thousands  of Ukrainians to safe havens in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, and across  Western Europe; and sending hundreds of thousands of pounds of needed  aid into Ukraine. Gary recently brought a gravely injured Ukrainian  soldier to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City where he  was able to receive the complex medical procedures that he urgently  needed.   These are just a few examples of the profound difference that Gary, a  private citizen, is making.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Gary for his compassion, for his willingness to  act, and his dedication to standing with the Ukrainian people as they  continue to resist this horrific war of aggression.                            ____________________
