 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to  posthumously award Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu with the Congressional  Gold Medal. Fred challenged the illegal internment of Japanese  Americans during World War II and devoted his life to expanding civil  rights and liberties for all people. Awarding him the Congressional  Gold Medal, Congress' highest civilian honor, would be a fitting  tribute to his lifelong pursuit of justice and equality.   Fred was born in Oakland, California on January 30, 1919, to Japanese  immigrant parents. Although he was an American citizen, Fred was  discriminated against due to his Japanese ancestry. As the United  States entered World War II, Fred tried unsuccessfully to enlist in the  U.S. military, and was fired from his job at the Oakland shipyard. In  1942, Fred was arrested and convicted of defying military orders issued  under Executive Order 9066, a discriminatory presidential order that  authorized the mass removal and incarceration of more than 120,000  Japanese Americans during World War II.   Fred challenged the constitutionality of the government's order but  was convicted in federal court of violating  [[Page S252]]  military orders issued under Executive Order 9066. After a federal  appeals court upheld his conviction, he appealed his case to the U.S.  Supreme Court. On December 18, 1944, the Court ruled against him in a  6-3 decision, finding the government's discriminatory policy to  incarcerate Japanese Americans was justified due to military necessity.   Decades later, legal historians discovered key information that the  federal government did not share with the Supreme Court, including a  report that concluded very few Japanese Americans represented a  national security risk. After this evidence of government misconduct  emerged and was presented to the court, Fred's conviction was  overturned by a Federal court in San Francisco nearly forty years  later, on November 10, 1983. Fred believed that the Supreme Court's  decision was wrong, and stated, ``I would like to see the Government  admit that they were wrong and do something about it so this will never  happen again to any American citizen of any race, creed or color.''  Although the Supreme Court's infamous ruling in Korematsu v. United  States has been widely rejected by historians and legal experts, it has  never been formally repudiated, and stands as one of the Supreme  Court's worst precedents.   The internment of Japanese Americans was a shameful act, and it was  not until 1988 that the Civil Liberties Act was passed and our  Government formally apologized to Americans of Japanese ancestry who  were incarcerated during World War II. Fred Korematsu fought for this  redress legislation and continued working to expand civil rights  throughout his life. He spoke out against prejudice directed at  minorities and immigrants, and after September 11, 2001, filed amicus  briefs with the Supreme Court, warning our nation not to repeat history  by committing civil and human rights travesties.   During his lifetime, Fred Korematsu did not choose the easy route.  Instead, he chose to fight and speak out against injustice his entire  life. He fought not just for himself, but for everyone, particularly  minorities who could be discriminated against based on their ethnicity.  However, many of these injustices remain, and can be reborn as we have  seen with the rise in anti-Asian prejudice during the COVID-19  pandemic. Fred Korematsu reminds us that we must remain vigilant  against discrimination, particularly when it is disguised in times of  emergency or for reasons of security. On January 30, Fred Korematsu Day  of Civil Liberties and the Constitution, we honor the life of this  civil rights hero whose legacy continues to inspire people of all  backgrounds to speak up and fight for justice. This day uses one of the  most blatant examples of racial discrimination to educate individuals  on the dangers of political scapegoating and works toward a future that  guarantees civil rights for everyone. I am proud to introduce the Fred  Korematsu Congressional Gold Medal Act in his memory, and I call on my  colleagues in the United States Senate to swiftly pass this bill during  the 117th Congress.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to  posthumously award Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu with the Congressional  Gold Medal.
