 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  life and military career of one of New York State's most decorated  World War II veterans, U.S. Army National Guard veteran Private First  Class Kenneth C. Thayer, the handsome man you see pictured behind me.   Mr. Thayer is part of a distinguished National Guard unit that  displayed heroic and patriotic service in defense of the United States.  In recognition of his unwavering service to our Nation, I recently had  the opportunity to present Mr. Thayer with the Presidential Unit  Citation, one of the highest honors a military unit can receive. Here  is the picture of me meeting Mr. Thayer this weekend.   The Army has requested this Presidential Unit Citation for the 30th  Infantry Division since 1946. It wasn't until last year, nearly 75  years later, that President Trump recognized this unit and the well- deserving group of men for their selfless acts of bravery and devotion  to our country.   Mr. Thayer was a soldier in the National Guard's 30th Infantry  Division, a unit known for their exemplary conduct in both World War I  and World War II. The 30th Division was formed in 1917, soon after the  United States had entered World War I. They fought heroically in France  against the German Army, and once the war ended, they returned to their  prewar status in the National Guard.   Then, on September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, initiating World  War II. The 30th Division was quickly reinstated by 1940 and called  upon to fight. They first saw combat on Omaha Beach on June 11, 1944.   Mr. Thayer entered Active service on December 9, 1943, just 2 years  after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. A Utica native, Mr. Thayer  was sent to the 30th after recovering from an injury he sustained in  1944. His division was nicknamed ``Old Hickory'' because the majority  of the men were from Southern States closely associated with President  Andrew Jackson, and Mr. Thayer would grow very close with many of them.   The 30th would go on to become one of the most important forces in  the United States' European Theater Operations. The 30th Division was  in active combat from June 1944 to April 1945, a total of 282 days.   One of its most challenging battles was fought at Mortain, France.  From August 6, 1944, to August 12, 1944, the 30th Infantry Division was  faced with continuous attack from German forces, who were attempting to  break through Allied lines.   Over 2,000 men in this division alone died while fighting to drive  Germans from France, but the courage of this division helped turn the  tide of the war and will be remembered for generations to come.   Mr. Thayer coauthored two volumes titled ``The Young Liberators: From  Civilian to Soldier''--I have the book here, a wonderful account--with  historian Allan Foote, whose father also served in the 30th Infantry  Division during World War II, Master Sergeant Arthur A. Foote.   Writing about one of the artillery barrages during that period, Mr.  Thayer states in his book: ``I kept on scrambling around in a futile  attempt to find someone, anyone I could help. . . . Out of 220 men, I  was the only survivor. It was an absolute nightmare.''   It is almost impossible to imagine the atrocities that these men  witnessed. As Americans, we remember the bravery and sacrifice that Mr.  Thayer and so many of the 30th endured.   Between June 1944 and May 1945, the men of the United States 30th  Infantry Division participated in every major Western European  campaign, from Normandy to the Elbe River. Known as the ``Workhorse of  the Western Front,'' the 30th was ranked as the top infantry division  by a team of historians who worked under General Eisenhower. His chief  historian, Colonel S.L.A. Marshall, declared the 30th ``the finest  infantry division in the European Theater of Operations.''   The reputation of Old Hickory is that of resolute dedication and  valor. They are viewed as heroic not only to Americans but to those  whom they saved overseas.   For instance, in the Netherlands, where the 30th Division liberated  the town of Maastricht, the townspeople created a cemetery for these  lost souls. To this day, the community continues to place American  flags at the gravesites every May in their memory. The town officials  still keep in touch with Mr. Thayer even though he is living in  assisted living.   For this service, Mr. Thayer has been awarded the Distinguished  Service Cross, two Bronze Stars, and three Purple Hearts.  [[Page H3016]]    A man of incredible courage and personal fortitude, Mr. Thayer is a  true hero. He served our Nation through tremendous strife, yet he  remains humble, gracious, and incredibly sharp.   It was an honor to meet Mr. Thayer, along with his coauthor, Allan  Foote, this past weekend and present him with this well-deserved  recognition. His life of courage and commitment to our Nation is  unparalleled. It would have been easy for him to give up in the face of  evil, but Mr. Thayer and the men of the 30th Infantry never gave up.  They were fiercely dedicated to changing the course of the war, and  they worked fearlessly to ensure that America and freedom would  prevail.   It is truly an honor to share Mr. Thayer's unique story in this  historic Chamber today. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to spend  time with Mr. Thayer and hear his firsthand account of his experiences  as a critical player in this major event of human history.   At age 95, nearly 96, he is the last survivor of this venerable group  of heroes. We will remember him, and we thank him for his great  service.   I highly recommend this wonderful book by this great veteran of World  War II.                            ____________________
