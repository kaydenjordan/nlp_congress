 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS  Act. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  taking charge of this bill in the 115th Congress and Judiciary Chairman  Goodlatte for quickly bringing it to the floor.   This week and next, the primary focus of debate here in the House is  the stranglehold of regulation on the economy and its intrusion into  the everyday lives of Americans. These onerous burdens are well-known  to Members of Congress on both sides.   Over the past several years, I have spent countless hours traveling  across the nearly 6,600 square miles of my district. I have met with my  constituents in their homes, in their workplaces and social halls. They  have pleaded with me for release from the regulations that limit their  ability to prosper, innovate, and grow.   Unlike the nameless, faceless, ever-growing bureaucracy here in  Washington, we have listened to the people's concerns. We have made  regulatory reform a priority and the focal point for jump-starting our  economy. By placing final approval of major regulations in the hands of  Congress, the REINS Act is an important launch point in our efforts to  dismantle the administrative state and make government more accountable  to the American people.    Our Founders vested in Congress--and Congress alone--the power to  write the laws. Unfortunately, over our history, we have delegated much  of that power away. The Founders could not have imagined our current  scenario where the complaints of many fall on the deaf ears of an  unelected few in Washington.   Thinking over the past 8 years, the REINS Act could have prevented  numerous regulations that the American people knew were threats to  their very way of life. Perhaps a trillion dollars in costs could have  been avoided. I cannot even imagine how many jobs might have been saved  or created if we avoided the regulatory barrage brought on by the Obama  administration.   For example, we could have prevented the waters of the United States  regulation that impacts the farmers near my home in rural Pennsylvania.  The FCC's net neutrality rule might have been overturned, a classic  rulemaking bait and switch where the FCC ignored the mountains of  public comment to achieve its own political ends. An unaccountable sum  of environmental regulations might have been avoided before destroying  large swaths of our industry and imposing huge costs on taxpayers.   Our prime takeaway from these instances and others is that the  runaway regulators issued wide-ranging and economy-destroying  regulations with complete disregard for the hardworking American  citizens whose livelihoods were at stake.   Today we take an important step to reassert the voice of the American  people in our government. The REINS Act reestablishes the Congress as  the final judge of whether or not any particular regulation actually  does what the Congress meant it to do.   Returning this responsibility to the branch of government most  attentive and accountable to the people adheres to the principles of  our Nation's founding. It is an effort that all elected to Congress  should support.   I urge my colleagues to support the REINS Act.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment renders congressional  findings on climate change and requires that agencies report to  Congress on greenhouse gas impacts associated with a rule. It also  requires agencies to report on a rule's effect on low-income and rural  communities.   Further, the amendment expands the definition of major rule to  include rules that allow increases of carbon emissions by more than  25,000 metric tons per year or that might increase the risk of certain  diseases in rural or low-income communities.   I oppose this amendment.   The REINS Act is not designed to address one or two subjects of  regulation with heightened scrutiny but not others. It is to restore  accountability to the people's elected representatives in Congress for  the largest regulatory decisions, whatever subject is involved.   Further, and consistent with that, the addition of congressional  findings in one policy area--climate change--but no other, has no place  in the REINS Act.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts from the bill any  rule reducing the incidence of cancer, premature mortality, asthma  attacks, and respiratory diseases in children. But do not be fooled.  This amendment is not about reducing these maladies. It is about  transferring the power to decide how best to do so from elected  representatives to unaccountable bureaucrats.   For example, government could substantially reduce teenage mortality  by barring teenage drivers off the road. Of course, there would be a  substantial cost to that policy, and there are surely less burdensome  ways to achieve the same reductions in mortality. The right decision  requires a delicate balancing of interest. Agencies can provide  valuable expertise, but, when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate  decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected  officials accountable to the people.   That is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point  that is lost on those who oppose it.   Reducing the incidence of mortality and serious disease is a goal  that all Members share. This bill does not frustrate that goal. It  merely ensures that elected representatives decide how best to achieve  that policy so that our Republic remains a government by the people as  the Constitution designed.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts from the bill any  rule pertaining to health or public safety.  [[Page H139]]    Health and public safety regulations done properly serve important  goals, and the bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement  of those goals; but Federal health and public safety regulations  constitute an immense part of total Federal regulation and have been  the source of many of the most abusive, unnecessarily expensive, and  job- and wage-destroying regulations. To remove these areas of  regulation from the bill would severely weaken the bill's important  reforms to lower cumulative regulatory costs and increase the  accountability of our regulatory system and the Congress to the people,  so I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reforms regulations that would reduce the amount of lead in  public drinking water.   But, like other amendments, this amendment is not so much about  achieving a particular health or safety result. It is about taking the  decision on how best to do that away from elected Representatives and  handing it down to unaccountable bureaucrats. Agencies can provide  valuable expertise, but when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate  decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected  officials who are accountable to the people. This is the intuition  behind the REINS Act, and the fundamental point is lost on its  opponents.   Preventing dangerous levels of lead in our drinking water is a goal  all Members share. This bill does not frustrate that goal. It merely  ensures that elected Representatives decide how best to achieve that  policy so that our Republic remains a government by the people, as the  Constitution designed.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just to reiterate what our position is, it  is about time that we in D.C.--in Congress--take our responsibility  back from unelected bureaucrats and make these decisions. We have seen,  over the past 8 years, what overburdensome regulation has done to this  country as far as crushing jobs.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reforms regulations intended to protect young children and  infants from harm.   Child safety is a goal all Members share, but to shield bureaucrats  who write child safety regulations from accountability to Congress is  no way to guarantee a child's safety. The only thing that would  guarantee is less careful decisionmaking and more insulation of  faceless bureaucrats from the public.   The Constitution entrusts to Congress the authority to protect  children--and all citizens--from harmful products flowing in interstate  commerce. The public should be able to trust Congress--and we should  trust ourselves--to make sure that Washington bureaucrats make the  right decisions to protect child safety when we delegate legislative  authority to regulatory agencies.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the REINS Act doesn't prevent the  bureaucracy, the agencies, from making recommendations and suggestions  to Congress. It simply says Congress will have the last word and not a  handful of bureaucrats, and many of them don't even have experience in  these areas.   I urge my colleagues to not support this amendment but to support the  REINS Act.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's  congressional approval procedures regulations that attempt to improve  employment, retention, and earnings, particularly for those with  significant barriers to employment.   The danger in the amendment is the strong incentive it gives agencies  to manipulate their analysis of a major regulation's jobs and wages  impacts. Far too often, agencies will be tempted to shade the analysis  to skirt the bill's congressional approval requirement.   In addition, regulations alleged to create new job prospects often do  so by destroying real, existing jobs and creating new, hoped-for jobs  associated with regulatory compliance. For example, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act rules have shut down existing  power plants all over the country, throwing myriads of workers out of  work. EPA and OMB attempt to justify that with claims that more new  green jobs have been created as a result.   In the end, this is just another way in which government picks the  jobs winners and the jobs losers, and there is no guarantee that all of  the new green jobs will ever actually exist.   The REINS Act is not intended to force any particular outcome. It  does not choose between clean air and dirty air. It does not choose  between new jobs and old jobs.   Instead, the REINS Act chooses between two ways of making laws. It  chooses the way the Framers intended in which accountability for laws  with major economic impact rests with Congress. It rejects the way  Washington has operated for too long in which there is no  accountability because decisions are made by unelected agency  officials.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's  congressional approval procedures all regulations that pertain to  nuclear reactor safety standards. REINS Act supporters believe in  nuclear safety. We want to guarantee that regulatory decisions that  pertain to nuclear reactor safety are the best decisions that can be  made.   That is precisely why I oppose the amendment. By its terms, the  amendment shields from the REINS Act's congressional approval  procedures not only major regulations that would raise nuclear reactor  safety standards, but also regulations that would lower them.   All major regulations pertaining to nuclear reactor safety standards,  whether they raise or lower standards, should fall within the REINS  Act. That way agencies with authority over nuclear reactor safety would  know that Congress must approve their major regulations before they go  into effect.   That provides a powerful incentive for the agencies to write the best  possible regulations, ones that Congress can easily approve. It is a  solution that everyone should support because it makes Congress more  accountable and ensures agencies will write better rules. All Americans  will be safer for it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this administration has proven  how thousands of regulations have crushed jobs for the middle class  people in this country. The REINS Act does designate and allows and  wants agencies to make decisions as far as what they think the law  should be and send it to Congress.   We do have the time. We have the resources and the knowledge. That is  why we have full committees. That is why we have subcommittees and we  have experts come in and testify. Yet, we still need to get back--that  the 535 Members of Congress, the House and the Senate, make the final  decision and not a handful of unelected bureaucrats.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reform regulations that concern natural gas or hazardous  materials pipeline safety or the prevention of pipeline spills and  their adverse impacts.   We all support pipeline safety and the prevention of harm from  pipeline spills, but there is no assurance that the amendment would  guarantee the achievement of those goals. On the contrary, the  amendment would shield from congressional accountability procedures,  regulations, that actually threaten to decrease safety. They also would  shield from the bill's congressional approval requirements new,  ideologically driven regulations intended to impede America's access to  new sources of cheap, clean, and plentiful natural gas.   The legislative body is the legislative body. We are trying to have  oversight over the bureaucracy. The House and the Senate is not a  bureaucracy. It is a legislative body, according to the Constitution  that represents the people of the United States. Therefore, the House  and the Senate and the President should have the last say in whether  something becomes law or not.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, what better group, such as the Committee on  Energy and Commerce or other committees here, the full committees, the  subcommittees, would be looking out and should be looking out for the  public safety and the welfare than the 535 Members of Congress?   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment carves out of the REINS  Act's congressional approval procedures any workplace safety rules  issued by OSHA or the Mine Safety and Health Administration to reduce  traumatic injury, cancer, or lung disease.   But please do not be fooled. This amendment is not about reducing  these maladies. It is about transferring the power to decide how best  to do so from elected Representatives, being House Members and  Senators, to unaccountable bureaucrats.   Arriving at the right decision requires a delicate balancing of  interests. Agencies can provide valuable expertise, but when there is a  lot at stake, the ultimate decision on how best to strike that balance  is properly made by elected officials accountable to the people. That  is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point that is  lost on its opponents.   Preventing workplace injury is a goal all Members share. This bill  does not frustrate that goal. It merely ensures that elected  Representatives make the final call about major decisions so that our  Republic remains a government by the people as the Constitution's  Framers designed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I fully support Congressman  King's amendment. It improves the viability of the REINS Act and makes  sure that the responsibility of legislation is in the hands of we  legislators.   Let me just ask this simple question. My good friend on the other  side says that we should let the agencies and departments regulate and  make rules. Let me ask this: How has it been going in the last 20 years  in this country?   We are $20 trillion in debt, and 20 million people are out of work or  underemployed.   Are we going to continue to let bureaucrats make these decisions that  crush jobs?   No, I don't think so. It is our responsibility in the House and it is  our responsibility in the Senate. We can hear from those individuals,  as I have repeatedly said here, in those agencies. We need to make the  final decision because just look at the track record over the last 20,  30 years of unelected bureaucrats making these rules, laws, and  regulations.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Byrne) having assumed the chair, Mr. Poe of Texas, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 26) to  amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major  rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a  joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
