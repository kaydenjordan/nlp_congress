 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  rule and underlying act, the American Rescue Plan Act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the lives of over 525,000 Americans.  Our communities are struggling and our constituents are desperate for  relief. Millions remain out of work, and as many as 12 million children  are living in households where they don't get enough to eat.   We are grateful to have new leadership in the White House and in the  Senate. I look forward to passing legislation that will end the  pandemic and open our economy and let America get back to work. The  American Rescue Plan puts money directly in the hands of American  people.   The direct cash infusion will help millions of Americans pay their  rent and keep the lights on at home. In addition to $1,400 worth of  direct stimulus payments for a large chunk of Americans, support for  small businesses and restaurants, and an extension of unemployment  insurance benefits, the American Rescue Plan Act expands the child tax  credit and the earned income tax credit to give families the support  they so desperately need. The child tax credit expansion alone will cut  childhood poverty in half.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to passage of this act because, unlike  the political charade that our colleagues just treated us to and  wasting the time of the House and the American people, the American  Rescue Plan Act will, number one, crush the virus; number two, get  Americans back to work; and number three, actually help children get  out from behind their screens and back in the classroom.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and  this rule.
