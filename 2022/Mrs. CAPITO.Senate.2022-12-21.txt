 Mr. President, I thank my chairman of the Environment       and Public Works Committee for his great statement but also for his       great work through the year.        He did mention several of the bipartisan wins that we had. Many of       them have been unanimous through the committee because we all know you       can't get everything. We know you can't get everything you want. You       have got to give a little to get a little.        And so I salute him and our staffs for being able to work that out.        But today I want to also briefly talk for a few minutes about the       bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of 2022. The chairman       described it. It is kind of nice to get up here and talk about       something that has already passed. So we don't really have to be       persuasive, we are just reminding Members of how important this is in       their districts and across their States.        I am grateful to my colleagues for the support of this legislation,       and I am pleased that it is now on the way to the President's desk for       his signature.        Through WRDA, Congress authorizes water resources projects and sets       national policies for the Civil Works Program of the U.S. Army Corps of       Engineers.        I live about a half a mile from a river that has a lot of commerce on       it. It is very important that the Corps is able to do their work. The       work of the Corps facilitates commerce throughout the country and       internationally.        Projects along our inland waterways and at our ports enable the       movement of cargo, while also bolstering our supply chain.        We know that natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes can       strike at any time and have devastating consequences on our       communities. But the Corps' work to protect the lives and livelihoods       of millions of Americans is supported by the congressional       authorization of flood and coastal storm risk management policies that       are contained within this bill.        Since 2014, as the chairman said, we have enacted WRDA every 2 years,       and I am happy to say that we are carrying on that tradition.        I want to thank again Chairman Carper for his leadership and       dedication, and I would also like to thank our colleagues in the House,       the chairman of the T and I Committee, on which I served for 12 years,       Chairman Peter DeFazio, and Ranking Member Sam Graves. They did great       work here, and we were able to work out our differences. We would not       be here today without their tireless efforts to reach an agreement that       addresses the priorities of Members from both sides of the aisle and       both sides of the Capitol.        I would also like to thank two Senators from our committee, Senators       Cardin and Cramer. We are the four Cs, as we call ourselves--Cardin,       Cramer, Carper, and Capito. If you can say that quickly, you are in       better shape than we are going to be later on tonight, hopefully, as we       vote late, I think, I hope. But I would like to thank them for their       support and partnership during this process.        I want to express my gratitude, as the chairman did, to the staff of       our committee, the staff of T and I, the staff of the Army Corps of       Engineers for the technical assistance, and to the House and Senate       Legislative Counsel for their diligence, professionalism, and       commitment to many long hours throughout this process.        I am pleased that our final agreement with the House maintained the       vast majority of provisions that were in our Senate bill. True to the       Corps' tradition, this bill moves forward projects that both benefit       both local communities and the entire country.        Specifically, the WRDA bill authorizes 25 new projects and 6       modifications to existing projects around the country, including       projects for navigation, flood and coastal storm risk management, and       ecosystem restoration. And it authorizes more than 100 feasibility       studies that will develop solutions to water resource challenges in our       years ahead. It is so smart, I think, to look to the future.        While this bill is very much oriented toward advancing critical       projects and studies in our States, it also contains several policy       changes that will help the Corps better succeed in civil works       missions.        The bill bolsters the Agency's technical assistance authorities,       specifically the Flood Plain Management Services and Planning       Assistance to States' Programs.        Every State is different, and we know that some of these challenges       are vast. It authorizes the Corps to conduct outreach--and the chairman       mentioned this--to ensure that our communities are knowledgeable in the       ways in which the Agency can help them with their water resources       needs.              The bill makes important improvements to the Tribal Partnership       Program and other authorities to assist our Indian Tribes. It also       expands existing programs and includes new authorities to assist       communities that are economically disadvantaged, including those       located in rural areas.        It requires reporting on timelines for the environmental review       process for projects. We know that is essential.        The bill directs the GAO to conduct a review of projects that are       over budget and delayed, as well as review of the Corps' mitigation       practices for these projects.        It provides flexibility--every State is different--to our non-Federal       sponsors with respect to financial accounting and fulfilling cost-share       obligations for projects.        It also authorizes, for the first time, a dedicated research and       development account for the Corps to spur innovation and provides       contracting flexibility in undertaking these activities.        The bill directs the Corps to support science, technology,       engineering, and math--or STEM--education and recruit individuals for       careers at the Agency.        The input of non-Federal interests is critical to successfully       solving water infrastructure challenges now and in the future. So the       bill establishes a new advisory committee for non-Federal interests to       voice their opinions on how the Corps can better meet their needs and       improve project delivery. We also preserve the integral role of non-      Federal sponsors in the project delivery process by avoiding mandates       from Washington, DC, and ensuring that the Corps continues to evaluate       a full array of solutions during the feasibility study phase.        In addition to my role as ranking member of EPW, I represent the       great State of West Virginia, where my chairman was born. I worked to       address the needs of my home State in this bill--and I will just give a       few highlights--that will benefit the lives of West Virginians.        First, the legislation advances a critical flood control project in       the city of Milton. Authorized in the 1990s, this project is a long       time coming, and I am proud to have helped move it forward in these       recent years.        The bill also works to support flood control studies for the Kanawha       River Basin and also in the city of Huntington. It continues to provide       environmental infrastructure assistance for drinking and wastewater in       our communities throughout the State. Finally, the bill will provide       additional critical support for river bank stabilization, such as those       in the Kanawha River in the capital city.        In closing, there is a lot in this bill for both sides of the aisle       and for communities across the Nation. It is a culmination of true       bipartisan, bicameral effort and represents our shared goal of       addressing our Nation's water resource needs.        I am incredibly proud of our EPW Committee as we continue to be one       of the most active, cooperative, and fruitful committees of this       Congress. And I would say as a side note, when people ask me how do we       get things done, how do we find the answer to something like permitting       reforms--you use the committee. You use the committees, like you use       our committee or another committee to find a solution and get the ideas       from both sides and hammer out the differences. That is how you get       things across the finish line.            [[Page S9743]]              Again, the chairman went through the staff, but I am going to take       the liberty of going through the staff, too, because I want to thank       them as well. They worked many long nights on this.        From Chairman Carper's staff: Mary Frances Repko, John Kane, Jordan       Baugh, Mayely Boyce, Tyler Hofmann-Reardon, Milo Goodell, and Janine       Barr.        From my staff: Adam Tomlinson, Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim       Townsend, Katherine Scarlett, and Haden Miller.        I would also like to thank the Senate Legislative Counsel Deanna       Edwards and Mark Mazzone and the U.S. Corps of Engineers' engineering       staff of Amy Klein, Dave Wethington and countless other attorneys and       technical staff. We could not have done this without them, most       certainly, and we want them to know how much we appreciate their       efforts on behalf of not just the committee, but on behalf of the       American people.        So thank you all--all of us here in this Chamber--for getting WRDA       2022 across the line. And with that, I appreciate my colleagues       supporting this legislation, and I am looking forward to the President       signing it.        I yield the floor.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, this is an exciting evening for Senator       Cantwell and me. She just recently spoke very movingly about something       that just passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. House, and that is the       bipartisan Equal Pay for Equal Team USA Act. We call it ``Equal Pay for       Equal Play.'' I want to thank her for her leadership. She has been       spectacular in the dedication that she has shown for this legislation.        I really think this is such a great, not just message, but a vision       for the future of where we see and how we respect our women athletes as       we respect our male athletes.        In addition, I would like to thank Senator Cantwell, also Senators       Lummis and Senators Klobuchar for their partnership during this       process.        I want to thank our House colleagues, Mikie Sherrill and Nancy Mace.       They advocated for this bill on the House side and spoke eloquently       this evening.        Just very briefly, I think what we saw with this dominating success       of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team really shed the light on this issue of       equal pay. I think a lot of us just assumed that, if you were playing       for Team USA, male or female, of course, you would get equal pay. But       that hasn't been the way it has been over the years.        Whether it is pay, salary, accommodations, training, all these       things, there have been great inequities here. Our Women's National       Soccer Team is one of the most successful teams competing in       international soccer today. They have won four World Cups, four Olympic       gold medals, and they are currently ranked No. 1 in the world. They are       continuing to be trailblazers.        U.S. Soccer signed a new collective bargaining agreement this year to       close the gender wage gap and achieve true equal pay. Senator Cantwell       and I were on the field with Team USA here in Washington as they       defeated the Nigerian team, and we had a ceremonial signing on the       field, and it was a wonderful evening. For me, it was very uplifting       because I had my 12-year-old granddaughter and her best friend, who are       both soccer players. As the stadium would erupt to ``Equal Pay for       Equal Play,'' I would look over, and there they were, just yelling       their lungs out: ``Equal Pay for Equal Play.''        So I am really happy today that I can take a Christmas present home       to both of them. This is a historic moment that we must use to build       off of. The bill will require the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee       to provide all athletes who represent the United States in global       amateur athletic competitions, regardless of gender, equal compensation       and benefits.        As a woman sports fan myself, but also--I say former athlete, but I       still like to do lots of sports--as a mother and a grandmother of       female athletes, I recognize that for far too long, women's sports have       been second best to men's sports. Equal pay and benefits should be the       standard for all national teams.        So in closing, this is a simple bill that fixes a major problem.        I will say it again: Equal pay for equal play. It is the combination       of a true bipartisan effort, and I am looking forward to seeing the       President sign this bill into law on behalf of my West Virginia girls       and girls everywhere.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Madam President, on December 16, 2021, the Deputy       Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration issued a       memorandum, entitled ``Information: Policy on Using Bipartisan       Infrastructure Law Resources to Build a Better America.''        I wrote a letter asking the U.S. Government Accountability Office--      GAO--to determine whether this memo was a ``rule'' and subject to the       Congressional Review Act, CRA. On December 15, 2022, I received a       reply, in which the GAO general counsel concludes that the 2021 memo       ``meets the [Administrative Procedure Act] definition of a rule and no       exception applies. When an agency rule has the effect of inducing       changes to the internal policy or operations choices of the regulated       community, that rule has a substantial impact on the rights and       obligations of non-agency parties. Thus, the Memo is a rule under CRA       and is subject to the submission requirements.''        I ask unanimous consent that the decision from GAO, dated December       15,            [[Page S9768]]            2022, be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.        The decision I am now submitting to be printed in the Congressional       Record is the original document provided by GAO to my office. I will       also provide a copy of the GAO decision to the Parliamentarian's       office. Based on Senate precedent, my understanding is that the       publication of the GAO legal opinion in today's Record will start the       ``clock'' for congressional review under provisions of the CRA.             There being no objection, the material was ordered to be            printed in the Record, as follows:                                    U.S. Government Accountability Office,                                                               Washington, DC.                                            Decision                 Matter of: Federal Highway Administration--Policy on Using                Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Resources to Build a Better                America           File: B-334032           Date: December 15, 2022                                                   DIGEST                   GAO was asked whether the Federal Highway Administration's            (FHWA) Information: Policy on Using Bipartisan Infrastructure            Law Resources to Build a Better America (Memo) is a rule for            purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The Memo sets            out FHWA's preferred projects for funding under the            Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. When an agency rule            has the effect of inducing changes to the internal policy or            operations choices of the regulated community, that rule has            a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of non-           agency parties.             CRA requires all agency rules to be submitted to Congress            and the Comptroller General before they take effect. CRA            incorporates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)            definition of a rule for this purpose with certain            exceptions. FHWA did not submit the Memo under the Act. We            conclude the Memo is a rule for purposes of CRA because it            meets the APA definition of a rule and no exceptions apply.                                                  DECISION                   On December 16, 2021, the Federal Highway Administration            (FHWA) issued a memorandum to agency officials entitled            Information: Policy on Using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law            Resources to Build a Better America (Memo). Department of            Transportation, Federal Highway Administration Memorandum,            Information: Policy on Using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law            Resources to Build a Better America (Dec. 16, 2021),            available at https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bipartisan- infrastructurelaw/building_a_better_america- policy_framework.cfm (last visited Sep. 6, 2022). We received            a congressional request for a decision as to whether the Memo            is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from            Senator Shelley Moore Capito to Comptroller General (Feb. 10,            2022). For the reasons described below, we conclude it is.             Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the            relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject            of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal            Decisions and Opinions, GA0-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:            Sept. 2006), available at https://www.gao.gov/products/ gao_06_1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to FHWA to obtain            the agency's legal views. Letter from Assistant General            Counsel, GAO, to Chief Counsel, FHWA (Feb. 22, 2022). We            received FHWA's response on April 5, 2022. Letter from Chief            Counsel, FHWA, to Assistant General Counsel, GAO (Apr. 5,            2022) (Response Letter).                                                 BACKGROUND                 FHWA Project Selection Process             States ultimately select which transportation projects will            receive FHWA-administered funding. See 23 U.S.C. Sec. 145.            These projects are approved for implementation using this            funding through a two-step process. First, states are            required to develop statewide transportation improvement            programs (STIP) which include a prioritized list of projects            the state proposes for federal funding. 23 C.F.R.            Sec. 450.218. States develop them in accordance with their            statewide transportation planning process, which must reflect            the consideration of specific planning factors. 23 C.F.R.            Sec. 450.206. Typically, only projects in an approved STIP            are eligible for FHWA-administered funding. 23 C.F.R.            Sec. 450.222. FHWA's approval is generally restricted to a            determination of whether the STIP is based on a statewide            transportation planning process that meets relevant statutory            and regulatory requirements. 23 C.F.R. Sec. 450.220.             Second, the state selects projects from the approved STIP            to implement using FHWA-administered funding. 23 C.F.R.            Sec. 450.222. To authorize the implementation of a project,            the state and FHWA must execute a project agreement. See 23            U.S.C. Sec. 106; 23 C.F.R. 630.106. The agreement can be            executed only after applicable federal requirements are            satisfied. 23 C.F.R. Sec. 630.106.           FHWA's Policy Memo             On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and            Jobs Act (IIJA) was enacted into law, providing funding for            various modes of surface transportation such as highways,            transit, and rail. See e.g. Pub. L. No. 117-58,            Sec. Sec. 11101(a)(1), 30017, 135 Stat. 429,443, 912. This            funding included about $350.7 billion for FWHA to administer,            mostly under title 23.             To aid in implementing IIJA and to announce a preferred            prioritization for projects that ``Build a Better America'',            FHWA issued the Memo. Specifically, FHWA stated:              The intent of the guidance also is to ensure that the funding and       eligibilities provided by the [IIJA] will be interpreted and       implemented, to the extent allowable under statute, to encourage States       and other funding recipients to invest in projects that upgrade the       condition of streets, highways and bridges and make them safe for all       users, while at the same time modernizing them so that the       transportation network is accessible for all users, provides people       with better choices across all modes, accommodates new and emerging       technologies, is more sustainable and resilient to a changing climate,       and is more equitable.                   Memo, at 1. To accomplish these goals, FHWA instructed            agency officials to encourage state officials and other            stakeholders to select projects that meet FHWA's priorities.            See Id. at 3 (``FHWA staff shall emphasize to our planning            and project selection and project delivery stakeholders that            the resources made available under the [IIJA] can and should            be applied to modernize all eligible streets, highways, and            bridges--not just those owned and operated by [s]tate            departments of transportation.''). In the Memo, FHWA            acknowledged states ultimately make the final decisions on            what projects get funded, but that the Memo would attempt to            influence state decisions. Id. at 6 (``Although [s]tates and            other [f]ederal-aid recipients ultimately select projects            consistent with [statute], this [Memo] will inform that            decision-making.'').           Congressional Review Act             CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight            of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a            report on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the            Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.            5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 (a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy            of the rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the            rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. Each            House of Congress is to provide the report on the rule to the            chairman and ranking member of each standing committee with            jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 (a)(1 )(C). CRA allows            Congress to review and disapprove rules issued by federal            agencies for a period of 60 days using special procedures. 5            U.S.C. 802. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, then            the new rule has no force or effect. Id.             CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative            Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551 (4), which states that            a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of            general or particular applicability and future effect            designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy            or describing the organization, procedure, or practice            requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3). CRA            excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules            of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency            management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency            organization, procedure, or practice that do not            substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency            parties. Id.             FHWA did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the            Comptroller General on the Memo. In its response to us, FHWA            stated the Memo was not subject to CRA because it restates a            preexisting statutory or regulatory requirement for            informational purposes. Response Letter, at 2. FHWA further            argued that even if it did meet the definition of a rule            under APA, the Memo falls within the CRA exception for a rule            of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not            substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency            parties. Id. For the reasons explained below, we disagree. We            find the Memo meets the definition of a rule under the APA            and that no exception applies. Thus it is subject to CRA.                                                 DISCUSSION                   At issue here is whether the Memo is a rule for purposes of            CRA. First, we must look to see if it meets the definition of            a rule under APA. We conclude it does. We next must analyze            whether any exception applies. We conclude none apply.            Therefore, we conclude the Memo is a rule for purposes of            CRA.             The Memo meets the APA definition of a rule. First, the            Memo is an agency statement, as it is a memo from senior            leadership to agency offices on actions employees should take            in implementing IIJA. See Memo, at 3 (``FHWA staff shall            emphasize to our planning and project selection and project            delivery stakeholders that the resources made available under            the [IIJA] can and should be applied to modernize all            eligible streets, highways, and bridges--not just those owned            and operated by [s]tate departments of transportation.'').            Second, it is of future effect, as it provides guidance for            projects to be funded by the Act. See Id. at 2-3 (``Projects            to be prioritized include those that maximize the existing            right-of-way for accommodation of non-motorized modes and            transit options that increase safety, accessibility, and/or            connectivity.''). Finally, it proscribes policy, as it            announces a preference for certain types of projects and            instructs agency employees to encourage funding recipients to            select these types of projects. See Id. at 2, 4-6.             FHWA argues the Memo is not a rule because it is an            internal document that does            [[Page S9769]]                 not impose a new requirement or change the underlying            federal-state relationship established in law; instead, FHWA            contends that it does nothing but restate longstanding            statutory and regulatory requirements. See Response Letter,            at 1-2. We disagree with this characterization. The Memo            instructs FHWA staff to encourage states and decision-makers            to select certain projects for funding based on FHWA's stated            preferences. See Memo, at 4-6.             We previously concluded that where an agency describes            actions the regulated community could take to ensure            compliance with the law, such statement is a rule for            purposes of CRA. See B-331171, Dec. 17, 2020. In B-331171,            the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued            a guidance document containing a step-by-step guide housing            providers could follow to ensure they complied with            applicable requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Id. at 3. We            determined that when an agency provides extra information to            aid with statutory compliance, the agency has done more than            restate the law; it has implemented law. Id. at 4-5. Here,            FHWA went beyond simply restating existing legal            requirements; it expressed a policy preference in the Memo            and took steps to implement that preference. Thus, as in B-           331171, the Memo meets the APA definition of a rule. Having            concluded the Memo meets the APA definition of a rule, we now            must decide whether any of the CRA exceptions apply. First,            the Memo is not a rule of particular applicability, as it            applies to all potential grantees for all potential projects.            Second, it is not a rule of agency management or personnel.            While the Memo is addressed to agency officials and provides            instructions to agency personnel, its main focus is the            potential projects of potential grantees and other funding            recipients. Thus, it goes beyond merely relating to agency            matters and does not qualify for the exception. This leaves            the exception for rules of agency organization, procedure, or            practice that do not substantially affect the rights or            obligations of non-agency parties.             FHWA contends the Memo falls within the exception for rules            of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not            substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency            parties because the Memo does not bind funding recipients, as            they are free to choose to fund any projects that are legally            permissible under IIJA. See Response Letter, at 2-3. While            the Memo is nonbinding, it does not qualify for the            exception.             We have determined previously that agency rules that            encourage the regulated community to change internal            operations or policies have a substantial impact on non-           agency parties and thus do not qualify for the exception. See            B-330843, Oct. 22, 2019. In B-330843, we determined that            several Federal Reserve memoranda to bank examiners outlining            matters to search for during bank examinations were rules.            Id. at 7-8. Also, as mentioned previously, we more            specifically determined that agency rules that recommend            specific actions, such as best practices the regulated            community should take, do not qualify for the exception. B-           331171 at 4-5. Here, FHWA clearly expresses a preference for            specific types of projects and emphatically states the Memo            will inform decision-making. Memo at 4-6. Similar to HUD in            B-311171, by describing its preferred projects in the Memo,            FHWA hoped to induce its regulated community, potential            funding recipients, to select those projects. Because FHWA            used the Memo to try to induce the regulated community to            change their internal priorities, the Memo had a substantial            effect and thus does not qualify for the exception.             FHWA argues agency rules that only regulate how the agency            communicates with the public do not have a substantial impact            on non-agency parties and thus qualify for the exception.            Response Letter, at 2, 4. FHWA cites our decision in B-           291906, Feb. 28, 2003, as authority for this proposition,            arguing that its Memo is similar to the agency action at            issue in that decision. Id. at 2. We disagree; the decision            does not stand for the proposition FHWA states. In that            decision, we determined a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA)            memorandum stopping agency advertisement of veterans benefit            programs qualified for the exception. Id. at 5. We came to            this conclusion because no veteran was being denied the right            to enroll in a benefit program and no enrolled veteran was            being dropped. Id. at 3. Veterans were still advised of their            benefit rights as required by statute. Id. VA never took            active steps to try and alter veterans' behavior. Any changes            in enrollment were due solely to the choices of the veterans,            as opposed to the facts here. FHWA admits the purpose of the            Memo is to get funding recipients to select projects FHWA            prefers. Response Letter, at 3. Thus the agency is taking            active steps to encourage funding recipients to alter their            behavior, and these changes would be taken at the behest of            FHWA. When an agency rule actively attempts to induce the            regulated community to take preferred steps, the rule has a            substantial impact on the regulated community and does not            qualify for the third CRA exception.             We acknowledge that states could potentially ignore the            preferences that FHWA articulated in the Memo and still            receive funding from the agency to implement the projects            they prioritize and select, provided that applicable federal            requirements have been met. However, because the Memo            specifies a goal to inform decisionmaking and goes beyond            simply restating the requirements in the law, consistent with            our case law, the Memo has a substantial impact despite the            non-binding nature of FHWA's preferences and FHWA's lack of a            direct role in the selection process. See B-331171, Dec. 17,            2020; B-330843, Oct. 22, 2019.                                                 CONCLUSION                   The Memo meets the APA definition of a rule and no            exception applies. When an agency rule has the effect of            inducing changes to the internal policy or operations choices            of the regulated community, that rule has a substantial            impact on the rights and obligations of non-agency parties.            Thus, the Memo is a rule under CRA and is subject to the            submission requirements.
