 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Teacher  Appreciation Week and honor all who inspire and motivate our children  every day.   I want to thank all the wonderful and dedicated teachers across  Colorado and the country, including my wife, Nancy, and my sister,  Cassie, who are both public schoolteachers. I have witnessed firsthand  their commitment to their students and their schools.   Being a teacher is a tough job, but one of the most important. We all  have teachers who pushed us, counseled us, or took a friend or family  member under their wing and shaped our lives.   Nowadays, too often, our teachers, in addition to teaching and  educating us, have to protect and defend us. We have had that instance  recently in Colorado.   The passion for education shown by teachers in Colorado and across  the country is amazing. I look forward to working with my colleagues to  invest in our schools, reduce class sizes, and ensure our teachers have  the resources they need to educate the next generation.                            ____________________
