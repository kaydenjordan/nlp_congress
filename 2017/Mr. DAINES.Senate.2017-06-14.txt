 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, today, June 14, 2017 marks the 240th  observance of ``Flag Day,'' a day which commemorates the adoption of  the flag of the United States by a resolution of the Second Continental  Congress in 1777. Deeply symbolic, our flag honors the sovereignty of  each of our Nation's 50 States and the great sacrifices many Americans  have made to uphold its bedrock principles of freedom and liberty. The  Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that over one million military  service members have given their lives in the line of duty under our  flag. Title 4 of United States Code, ``The Flag Code'' sets specific  requirements for the handling and display of the flag, as a sign of  respect to the symbol of our Nation.   In 1989, with a disappointing 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court held  in Texas v. Johnson that the desecration of the United States flag was  a form of free speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution.  Here, Chief Justice Rehnquist rightly observed in his dissent that  ``the flag is not simply another `idea' or `point of view' competing  for recognition in the marketplace of ideas.'' Justice Kennedy, in his  majority concurrence, recognized that many would be dismayed by the  court's decision, and himself called the result distasteful. Yet, he  explained that the court was bound to its decision according to the  provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this  decision in United States v. Eichman in 1990. It ruled, again by 5-4  vote, that as Constitutional free speech, desecration of the flag  cannot be prohibited by Federal or State statute. At the time of the  Supreme Court's ruling, 48 of the 50 States had enacted statutes  prohibiting desecration of the United States Flag.   My resolution proposes an amendment to the Constitution, establishing  Congressional authority to prohibit the desecration of the flag of the  United States. This resolution initiates the process to amend the  Constitution, which must be agreed to by two-thirds of both houses of  Congress, and ratified by three-fourths of the States. A high bar to  meet, similar legislation passed the House of Representatives in 2006,  and fell short of passage in the Senate by only one vote.   My resolution provides Congress with the authority that the Supreme  Court decided it lacked in Texas v. Johnson and United States v.  Eichman. This should remove any doubt in the mind of the Supreme Court  on the Constitutionality of acts of flag desecration. A matter which  has been long settled in the Court of public opinion.                                S.J. Res. 46         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled   (two-thirds       of each House concurring therein), That the following article       is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United       States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as       part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of       three-fourths of the several States within 7 years after the       date of its submission by the Congress:                                ``Article--         ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical       desecration of the flag of the United States.''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
