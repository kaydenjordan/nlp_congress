 Madam Speaker, today I urge the United States Senate to  pass the Protecting Our Kids Act. The Uvalde shooting in Texas is one  of many mass school shootings that will remain a forever stain on our  country. We find ourselves here again, in the wake of another  elementary school massacre, expressing condolences, sympathy, and  outrage.   As a parent to two elementary school-aged children, when my wife and  I take our daughters to school, we expect them to run to our car, with  smiles on their faces at the end of every fun-filled school day.   Once more, the House took action this week and voted to move this  forward. We worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the most basic  measures to keep our families safe from gun violence. This commonsense  bill will save lives. It makes crucial changes, raising the age for  buying an assault rifle to 21, working toward safe gun storage, and  reducing the unregulated trafficking of guns.   We are many school shootings past thoughts and prayers. Sandy Hook,  Parkland, Columbine. We need action now. Time and time again, this  Nation has failed to act.   We must pass comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation to  protect my children, to protect your children, to protect America's  children. The American people are demanding for us to act. It is time  to act now.                            ____________________
