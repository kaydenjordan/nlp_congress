 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.   Since I mission-planned the first bombing runs in Afghanistan in  early 2001, warfare has evolved. It is fascinating to think that my  military career started with dropping bombs.   One of my jobs was to flush out, bury, or kill insurgents who used  caves as places for cover. Technology was certainly in use when  utilizing GPS-guided weapons, electro-optical and laser-guided  missiles. We mensurated coordinates by using systems like raindrop and  tracked our aircrews with systems like combat track.   For us older warfighters and folks here, it was incredible then, but  today it would be like playing tank war on an original Atari.   Terrorists still use caves, but those caves could be in cyberspace.  By 2018, I was working on tracking targets through a myriad of  activities, finding gaps in vertically integrated network  infrastructures, linking proxy groups to IED resupply, perfecting  telephony analysis, computer network attack and identifying network  critical touchpoints in command and control architectures. I wasn't  just dropping bombs anymore.   Instead of executing war, our group worked to determine as many  asymmetric terrorist attack modalities as we could and then used  research and development to advance new concepts, such as algorithmic  warfare or instantaneous information sharing.   My job, in two decades, took me from bombs to algorithms.   This amendment is ill-timed and irresponsible and seems do coincide  with impeachment. This act is political, without any forethought to  what a possible AUMF would look like in this new era of asymmetric  warfare.   We have Iran on the ropes, have killed their number one terrorist and  struck their command and control hierarchy in a devastating way.   This amendment, at the bottom of page 2, states:         No Federal funds may be obligated or expended for any use       of military force in or against Iran, unless Congress has       declared war, enacted specific statutory authorization for       such use of military force after the date of the enactment of       this act that meets the requirement of the War Powers       Resolution.    Let's ensure we enact specific statutory authorization or reason way  before we remove statutory authority already in place.   Does this amendment restrict use of resources already in place if  Iran employs cyberattack, critical infrastructure attack, electronic  warfare, chemical attack, biological attack, or any other attack  modalities that terrorists like to employ?   And what if terrorist-specific modalities can be used where Iran  supports terror operations in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan,  Lebanon, Algeria, Yemen, Bahrain; is the United States then limited to  new resource allocation to defend forces?    The speed of warfare is intense. And let's make no mistake: Congress  cannot always move at the speed of warfare in a time of asymmetric  kinetic--think airplanes--or nonkinetic--think electric power  infrastructure and military communications network--attack. That is why  we have a Commander in Chief. That is why we have Article II of the  Constitution. That is why our Founders made it this way. Sometimes  military force is not war.   Of course we must preserve Article I powers. Let's approach this fix  in a way that preserves our Constitution and considers the  nongeographic threat posture we live in today.
