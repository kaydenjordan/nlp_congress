 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize CMSgt Jason  Jenkins for his dedicated service to the U.S. Air Force and the Senate  as a Legislative Defense Fellow. Jason served as a vital part of my  team in 2020. He was a trusted adviser on issues relating to the  Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the  Department of Homeland Security.   Jason's effort and reliability distinguished him as a valuable member  of my legislative team. In particular, Jason played an integral role in  the recovery of Fort Smith native and World War II combat pilot Lt.  Henry Donald Mitchell's remains, a mission 77 years in the making.   Jason took his responsibility to bring his fellow airman home very  seriously. His steadfast dedication and persistence were crucial to its  success. He worked tirelessly to ensure the United States and Austrian  officials, private landowners, and Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency  leaders coordinated and engaged to achieve the right outcome. It would  not have been possible without the efforts of Jason. He helped bring  closure and resolution to Lt. Mitchell's community and loved ones,  allowing them to close that chapter and find the comfort that been so  elusive after his remains were buried in the Fayetteville National  Cemetery.   Jason also diligently worked to help secure resources for our  servicemembers, their families, and Arkansans through his support of  the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee and the successful  passage of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. His  passion to serve veterans and their families was demonstrated through  his contributions to veteran legislation he advised on, including the  John Scott Hannon Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019.   I also want to thank Jason's wife, Jami, and his children, Mike and  Skyla, for their support of Jason's continued service to the U.S. Air  Force. As the son of an Air Force master sergeant, I understand service  to the Armed Forces is a family affair and is impossible without their  sacrifice and unconditional support. Jason's son Mike has followed in  his dad's footsteps and is currently serving in the U.S. Air Force in  London.   A special highlight during Jason's time in my office was his  promotion to chief master sergeant, a testament to his family,  unlimited potential, and passion to serve others.   Jason, thank you for your continued service to the U.S. Air Force and  for your time working in my office. It was our privilege to have you as  a part of our team. My office will always welcome you. I know that you  will be an asset to whatever future endeavors you pursue, and I wish  you and your family the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize SMSgt Carlos  Sanchez for his dedicated service to the U.S. Air Force and the Senate  as a Legislative Defense Fellow. Carlos has served as a vital part of  my team since January 2021. He has been a trusted adviser on issues  relating to the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the Department of Homeland Security.   Carlos enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2002. His continued service  is a reminder of the sacrifices necessary to maintain the opportunities  available to us as U.S. citizens.   Carlos's effort and passion to serve distinguished him as a valuable  member of my legislative team. His determination was evident and helped  lead to passage of the transformative SAVE LIVES Act, which allowed the  VA to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to all veterans and their spouses.  When preparing for a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing earlier  this year, Carlos posed a question that led to the introduction and  passage of this critical legislation.   Carlos was also instrumental in the final months of the effort that  led to the recovery of World War II combat pilot Lt. Henry Donald  Mitchell. After years of work by Lt. Mitchell's brother, Bob Mitchell,  and my office to locate and return this Fort Smith native home, Carlos  helped ensure the authorities could access and correctly identify Lt.  Mitchell.   His desire to serve his fellow airmen was demonstrated through his  work in coordinating the first visit by Chief Master Sergeant of the  Air Force JoAnne Bass to Little Rock Air Force Base. Because of that  experience, I believe the needs of our airmen and their families were  further elevated and will result in an even higher prioritizing of  getting them the resources and support needed to successfully execute  their mission.   Carlos's steadfast dedication to serve and support the people of  Arkansas has been inspirational. While in Arkansas, he spoke with and  listened to the concerns of Arkansan veterans and their families, then  worked tirelessly to ensure their concerns were heard and issues were  resolved.   We have been very fortunate during Carlos's time in my office. I also  want to thank his wife, Laura, and his daughters Sophia and Isabella,  for their support of Carlos's time in uniform. As the son of an Air  Force master sergeant, I understand service to the Armed Forces is a  family affair and is impossible without their sacrifice and  unconditional support.   Carlos, thank you for your continued service to the U.S. Air Force  and for all your heartfelt, committed work as a member of my staff. It  was our privilege to have you as a part of our team, and our office  will always welcome you. I know that you will remain an asset to our  military and veterans in addition to any other endeavors you pursue,  and I wish you and your family the best.                            ____________________
