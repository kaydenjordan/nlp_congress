 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senator Cotton will be here in a second. A  group of us are going to speak about this budget deal.   If you believe that the No. 1 job of the Federal Government is to  defend this Nation, then we have made a serious mistake in this bill.   I have heard House leaders suggest this bill fully funds the  military. For that to be true, you would have to believe that the  military is OK if you cut their budget $42 billion below inflation. The  party of Ronald Reagan would never allow inflation to reduce defense  capabilities.   This bill, the top-line number, locks in fewer ships for the Navy at  a time China is going to expand dramatically. In 2024 and 2025, we are  going to cap spending at a level that we cannot expand the Navy, and in  the same period of time, China is going to go from 310 ships over a 10- year period to 440. There is less money for the Marines, less money for  the Army, and fewer ships for the Navy at a time of great conflict.   There is not a penny in this bill to help Ukraine defeat Putin. They  are going on the offensive as I speak, and we need to send a clear  message to Putin: When it comes to your invasion of Ukraine, we are  going to support the Ukrainians to ensure your loss.   If we don't do that, then we are going to snatch defeat out of the  jaws of victory.   Senator Cotton--I am going to yield to him. He has a time problem.  But we are going to take some time here to explain to you why those of  us who believe that the No. 1 job of the Federal Government is to  defend the Nation--that that concept has been abandoned and that we are  going to insist and fight until we find a way to rectify some of this  harm. OK.   With that, I will yield to my good friend from Mississippi.    I just want to compliment Senator Cotton for reminding us  what the job in Congress is, defending the Nation, and the odd outcome  here is that at a time of growing conflict, we are reducing the Navy.   There are 296 ships in the Navy today. Under this budget, by 2025,  there will be 286. If we continue with the Biden budget, there will be  290. The Chinese Navy today is 340. By 2025, they will have 400, and by  2030 they will have 440. This budget locks in a smaller U.S. Navy at a  time the Chinese Navy is growing dramatically.   There is not a penny in this budget to help beat Putin. The Navy is  smaller. The Army is smaller. The Marine Corps is smaller. This is not  a threat-based budget. This is a budget of political compromise where  people have lost sight of what the country needs.   We need safety and security.   To my House colleagues, I can't believe you did this.   To the Speaker, I know you have got a tough job. I like you, but the  party of Ronald Reagan is dying. Don't tell me that a defense budget  that is $42 billion below inflation fully funds the military.   Don't tell me that we can confront and challenge China. Everybody in  this body is patting themselves on the back that we see China as the  most existential threat to America. You are right. We did the CHIPS  Act. We are doing things to help our economy combat China. At the  moment of decision when it came to the military, this budget is a win  for China. Please don't go home and say this is fully funded because it  is not. Please stop talking about confronting China when you are  dismantling the American Navy.   How does this end? Senator Cotton is right. We will be here until  Tuesday, until I get commitments that we are going to rectify some of  these problems. The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee,  Susan Collins, has been steadfastly in the camp of fiscal  responsibility and national security. This deal has taken the  Appropriations Committee out of the game.    The CR, which kicks in, cuts defense and increases nondefense, making  it really hard for me to believe that we are actually going to do our  appropriations job.   So what I want to do is, I want a commitment from the leaders of this  body that we are not pulling the plug on Ukraine. There is not a penny  in this bill for future efforts to help Ukraine defeat Russia, and they  are going to gain on the battlefield in the coming days.   And it is just not about Ukraine. I want a commitment that we will  have a supplemental to make us better able to deal with China. I want a  commitment that we are not going to weaken our position in the Mideast.  There is a report out today that Iran is planning to attack our troops  in Syria to drive us out.   We are expending weapons that need to be replenished. Our military is  weakening by the day. This budget that we are about to pass makes every  problem worse.   I want to end the war in Ukraine by defeating Putin. If you don't, he  keeps going and we are going to have a conflict between NATO and Russia  and our troops will be involved. And if you don't send a clear signal  now, China will see this as an opportunity to leap into Taiwan.   So to the Members of this body, we are staying here as long as it  takes to get some commitment that we are going to reverse this debacle  sooner rather than later.   With that, I will yield to my good friend from Alaska.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I yield my time to our next speaker, who  is the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, but I just want  to say one thing before she speaks.   The Chief of Naval Operations said we need 373 ships manned and 150  unmanned platforms to deal with the threats we face around the world.  We have 296 today. Under this budget deal, we will go to 286 by 2025.  What does it take to get 373? The CNO of the Navy said, to get 373  ships, you have got to spend 5 percent above inflation for a sustained  period of time. This bill is 2 percent below inflation. So we are  undercutting the ability of the Navy to build the ships we need to  defend America.   With that, I yield to Senator Collins.    I want to echo what Senator Collins just suggested. How  do you begin to turn this debacle around? You admit you have got a  problem. It is pretty hard to quit drinking if you don't admit you have  got a drinking problem.   So what she is suggesting is that we acknowledge the obvious, that  this bill, on the defense side, is inadequate to the threats we face,  that a bill that funds the Pentagon below inflation at a time of great  threat is not fully funding. She is trying to get us to wake up to the  reality that if we don't speak about defeating Putin now, then the  Ukrainians, who are on the offense, will be undercut.   I will never let this happen again, as long as I am here, to let  people negotiate behind closed doors and not tell  [[Page S1867]]  me what they are doing on defense. I blame myself for not being more  involved and more active, because in my wildest dreams I never believed  that the Republican Party would take the Biden budget that they have  attacked for a year and celebrate it as fully funding. I know who I am  dealing with now.    Here is what Reagan told the Russians: Trust but verify. I will  never, ever trust again, because you have got an ``R'' behind your  name, that you are going to be the party of Ronald Reagan. You have to  prove that to me. So, as we go forward, the game will change.   Why is she asking for this to be done? If we don't commit to an  orderly appropriations process, it gets worse for the Defense  Department.   To the people who wrote this bill, I would not let you buy me a car.   The provisions of sequestration--for lack of a better word--the  continuing resolution, if we don't do our legislative business,  increases nondefense spending and decreases defense spending. I thought  we were Republicans. Who came up with that great idea?   The top line is inadequate. The CR is devastating. And what bothers  me the most is that we would put the Department of Defense in this  position.   We are playing with the lives of men and women in the military, their  ability to defend themselves, as some chess game in Washington. Well,  this is checkers, at best.   The fact that you would punish the military because we can't do our  job as politicians is a pretty sad moment for me. But people in this  body, on my side of the aisle, have drafted a bill that would punish  the military even more if we fail to do our basic job. That cannot be  the way of the future.   So I will insist, or we will be here until Tuesday, and I will make  an amendment to avoid default for 90 days or however many days it takes  to get this right. I don't want us to default on the debt, but we are  not leaving town until we find a way to stop some of this madness. You  are not going to be able to blame me for default because I am ready to  raise the debt ceiling right now for 90 days, no strings attached, to  give us a chance to stop this insane approach to national security.   I am supposed to talk to the President of Ukraine this afternoon. I  would like to be able to tell him something: Oh, by the way, you have  done a hell of a job with the money we have given you. Not one soldier  has died. The weapons used by Ukraine have punished the Russian  military. They are weakened and bloodied.   They are about to take back territory. He is wondering, well, what  does this mean for the future? I want to try to be able to tell him  that I have got an assurance from this body that we are not going to  leave you hanging.   It is in our interest to beat Putin. I don't like war more than  anybody else, but if Putin gets away with invading Ukraine, there goes  Taiwan. And if you don't get that, you are just out of touch. They have  a chance to evict Russia from Ukrainian territory. They need more  military help, not American soldiers.   If Putin loses, it is a deterrence for China. If Putin doesn't lose,  he will keep grabbing territory until we have a war between Russia and  NATO. This is a big, big deal.   Iran is coming up with a plan, apparently, to drive us out of the  Mideast. That just came out today.   China is building. As Senator Collins said, they are going from 340  ships to 440 ships by 2030. We are going from 296 to 290. That can't be  the response to China.   You cannot say with a straight face that this military budget is a  counter to Chinese aggression, that it adequately allows us to defeat  Putin. You cannot say with a straight face that this budget represents  the threats America faces.   A military budget should be based on threats, not political deals to  avoid default. Nobody wants to default. We are not going to default.  But I am tired of having default hanging over my head as a reason to  neuter the military at a time we need it the most.   To the American public, you would suffer if we defaulted. I get it.  If this budget is the end of the discussion and we don't fix it, your  sons and daughters are going to have more war, not less. You are going  to send a signal to all the bad guys that we are all talk. And what you  will be doing is putting the world on a course of sustained conflict  rather than deterrence.   The last time people did this was in the 1930s. They wanted to  believe that Hitler wasn't serious about killing all the Jews, that  they only wanted some land, that he really didn't want to take over the  world. He wrote a book, and nobody believed him.   The Iranian Ayatollah speaks every day: I will destroy the state of  Israel; that we are infidels, and he is going to drive us out of the  region.   China openly confronts our planes--400 feet yesterday. They are  testing us every day.   The bottom line, folks, is we are not leaving until we get a path to  fix this problem. Senator Susan Collins, my good friend from Maine,  gave us that path. If you want to go home, fix it.   I yield the floor.                                 H.J. Res. 45     Mr. President, I have been informed that shortly, the  majority leader will come to the floor and announce his commitment and  the Biden commitment to do a supplemental to make sure that the damage  done by this bill is, at least, partially corrected.  [[Page S1882]]    This bill puts our military behind the eight ball. There is not one  penny in this bill for Ukrainian assistance. As I speak tonight,  Ukraine is engaged in a fight for its life. They are going on the  offensive. I have high hopes in the coming days and weeks they will  liberate part of their territory occupied by Russia.   The assistance we have provided in a bipartisan fashion with our  European allies has made all the difference in the world. We were told  after the invasion that Kyiv would fall in 4 days; but 600-and- something days later, they are still fighting. The Russian Army has  been weakened and bloodied because of the weapons we have provided. I  appreciate the bipartisan support to make sure we win a war in Ukraine  without one American soldier being involved.   If we can defeat Putin in Ukraine, that means China will, hopefully,  take notice and Putin will be stopped, because if you don't stop him in  Ukraine, he will keep going and we will be in a war between NATO and  Russia.   So I appreciate all the hard work of the staff to make a statement to  the people who are facing threats from China, from Russia, from Iran,  that we have not abandoned you. There is not a dime in this bill to  deal with the threats I think we face from China consistent with the  threat level. There is money in this bill but not enough. So I am  hoping that those who are watching this in Ukraine understand that  Senators Schumer and McConnell are going to say in a moment: We have  not abandoned you. We are going to keep helping you as you struggle to  liberate your country from the war criminal Putin.   Whether you believe we should be helping Ukraine or not, I do. People  in this body, on both sides of the aisle in the Senate, understand that  Putin's invasion is a defining moment of the 21st century. That if he  gets away with this, there goes Taiwan, and the world will begin to  crumble. The world order we created since World War II would be  jeopardized.   War crimes on an industrial scale by Putin cannot be forgiven or  forgotten. To the brave men and women in Ukraine, help is on the way.  To the people standing up to China, living in its shadow in Taiwan,  help is on the way. To the American military who is underfunded because  of this bill, help is on the way.   For 3 days, I and some others have been screaming to high heaven that  what the House did was wrong. It is right to want to control spending,  and there are some good things in this bill. But it was wrong to give a  defense number inconsistent with the threats we face.   I do believe that we are on track to right some of those wrongs. To  my colleagues, I am not the perfect--the enemy of the good. I vote on  my share of bipartisan bills and get crap for it like most of you. But  as long as I am here, I am going to speak about the need of the Federal  Government to get the defense budget right. Budgets are based on  threats, not political deals. And if you think the world is safer, you  have missed a lot. So, hopefully, in a few minutes, there will be an  announcement that puts us on a course correction to undo some of the  damage, and there will be a clear signal from both the leader and the  minority leader, Senator McConnell, that help is on the way to those  who live in the shadow of totalitarian governments and those who are on  the battlefield.   To my American citizen friends, I wish there were no war anywhere. I  wish China wasn't the way they are. I wish the Ayatollah didn't want a  nuclear weapon and would use it if he could. I wish that Putin would  not have invaded Ukraine. I wish that the world was different than it  is. But if you want peace and stability, it comes at a high price.   The good news for us is that not one American soldier has died  evicting Russia from Ukraine. The Ukrainians have fought like tigers.  It is in our national security interest to provide them the weapons and  the technology to keep this fight up. Their win is our win.   So I look forward to hearing the statement that I think is  forthcoming. It does not fix this bill totally, but it begins to march  in the right direction. To my colleagues, thank you for listening.  Thank you for working with me and others. Victory for Ukraine.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
