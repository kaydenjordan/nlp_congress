 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Today, 9 of our 15 Federal Departments and several dozen  Agencies have shuttered their doors. By doing that, they denied vital  services to millions of American citizens.   Since midnight last night, just a few days before Christmas, more  than 800,000 dedicated public servants and their families have been  told not to expect their next paycheck for the foreseeable future.   There is one reason and one reason only that our Federal Government  has shut down today and countless Americans are living with  uncertainty. That reason is President Donald J. Trump. The President is  holding the Federal Government hostage for $5 billion of from the  American taxpayer for his unnecessary, ineffective, and expensive wall  on the southern border--a wall he repeatedly promised--gave his word to  the American taxpayers--that Mexico would pay for. Now he wants  American taxpayers to dig in their pockets and pay for it.   The President's irresponsible behavior is astounding. His job, like  ours, is to keep the Federal Government operating for the hundreds of  millions of Americans who depend on government services every day, from  our national parks, to housing services for the elderly, the disabled,  our veterans, and for assistance for our Nation's farmers. In fact, 2  days ago, the President signed the farm bill into law and praised his  efforts. Today, he precipitated a shutdown that shuttered the doors to  the U.S. Department of Agriculture's field offices--the same offices  farmers rely on to understand this new law.   But the worst part of all is that this was completely avoidable. We  provided the President with several options to avoid this result. It is  a case where he cannot take yes for an answer. We offered to pass six  full-year appropriations bills and a continuing resolution for Homeland  or a continuing resolution for all the remaining bills. Either of these  options would have kept the government open. They would have provided  more than $1 billion for border security--the very thing the President  says he needs and cares most about. Plus, signing them instead of  having a needless shutdown would save taxpayers millions of dollars.   After both of these offers were rejected, the Senate passed by voice  vote a 7-week continuing resolution. This would have given us more time  to negotiate and avert this catastrophe. Democrats and Republicans came  together to pass it. The President had agreed to sign it. We finally  had a path forward. Then FOX News and the rightwing media started  criticizing it. The President's ego won out over his duties to the  country. His ego was so bruised, he reversed course and went back on  what he had agreed to.   Here we are exactly where the President wanted us to be--in the  middle of a Trump shutdown. For anyone doubting where responsibility  lies, let's recall that the President has publicly called for a  government shutdown no fewer than 25 times over the past year. Just  last week, he declared he would be proud to shut down the government  unless we capitulated to his demand. Proud? I have been here with every  President, Republican and Democratic, since President Gerald Ford. It  is one of the most reckless statements I have ever heard uttered by a  President of the United States. And now he has made good on his threat.  His pride has won out, and the Trump shutdown has begun. How long is it  going to last? Who knows? Yesterday, the President promised it would  last a long time, and then he promised us it would be a short shutdown.  Even in this, his behavior is erratic.   How did we get here? Is there a legitimate crisis precipitating this  shutdown? Is the President playing games with the lives and livelihoods  of American citizens to solve some immediate problem that threatens our  Nation? No. Of course not. In caving to the most extreme sliver of his  base, President Trump is throwing what many of us have described as a  childish tantrum because he wants money to fulfill a cynical promise he  made repeatedly on the campaign trail--more of a symbolic prize than  any sensible policy solution.   This wasteful wall--a wall he promised Mexico would pay for, not the  American taxpayers--this wasteful wall that he now wants to bill to the  American taxpayers would do more to preserve the President's ego than  it would to protect the American people. But I believe it is the  natural result of the President's years-long demonization and  vilification of immigrants, years during which the President rallied  his base with falsehoods and fantasies where vulnerable women and  children are portrayed as hordes of gang members and terrorists  invading our country. The sad reality, as Republicans and Democrats  know, is that many of these people coming to our country are fleeing  desperate situations in their home countries, and they are looking for  sanctuary. They are not coming here to perpetuate violence; they are  running from it.   Let me be clear. There is no crisis that requires us to build a 30- foot wall between us and our neighbors to the south. The President's  hateful rhetoric about a crisis on our southern border does not reflect  reality.   At the end of 2017, arrests of people attempting to enter the United  States illegally dropped to historic lows. Between 2000 and 2018,  border apprehensions fell sharply from 1.6 million in fiscal year 2000  to approximately 400,000 in fiscal year 2018. That is a 75-percent  drop. Not only do the facts on the ground not warrant spending billions  of American taxpayer dollars on a ``big beautiful wall,'' as the  President likes to call it, that is not who we are as a nation. We are  a country founded by immigrants, just as my maternal grandparents came  to Vermont from Italy, my paternal great-great-grandparents came to  Vermont from Ireland, and my wife's parents came to Vermont from the  Province of Quebec in Canada. We need to look at the immigrant founding  of our country. Then, if we want to wall ourselves off from our  neighbors, it will not only be an expensive waste of Americans'  taxpayer dollars, but it will be immoral, ineffective, and an affront  to everything this country is supposed to stand for.    To build a wall, the President wants to seize land from ranchers and  farmers in Texas and in other border States--seize lands that have been  in their families for generations. He would need to construct walls  through wildlife refuges and nature preserves, basically destroying  them. Ironically, we would end up walling ourselves off from the Rio  Grande in the process, essentially ceding the river to Mexico.   After all of that and after billions of wasted taxpayer dollars, what  would it accomplish? Would it stop people from fleeing violence in  their home countries and seeking sanctuary? No. Would it stop drug  smugglers and human traffickers from engaging in illegal activity?  Definitely no. As so many have said, show me a 30-foot wall, and I will  show you a 31-foot ladder or a tunnel.   To address these complex issues, we need real solutions, not bumper  sticker slogans, not angry tweets. Everyone agrees we need to keep our  borders safe and secure, but it has to be with smart border security,  with border security that works, with new technologies that have proven  to have worked on the border and at our ports of entry, technologies  with new air and marine assets and additional personnel who are needed.   A 30-foot wall is symbolic and unneeded. Even if we needed to build  it, what is the rush? Over the past 2 years, Congress has provided  nearly $1.7 billion to build or to replace fencing on  [[Page S8024]]  the southern border. Yet the administration has hardly spent any of  that money, and the projects it has undertaken have been handled in  such a way that they have ballooned in cost. We have given the  administration $1.7 billion, and it is now demanding more. How much of  the $1.7 billion did it spend? It spent 6 percent. Six percent of these  funds have been spent. We have recently learned that one project in the  Rio Grande Valley that was supposed to cost $445 million will now cost  American taxpayers nearly $787 million. That is a 77-percent cost  overrun with a pricetag of $31.5 million for each and every mile.   We have seen that you cannot trust the administration to be  responsible with the money we have already provided, let alone trust it  to spend responsibly the additional money the President is demanding.  Once and for all, let's put an end to this nonsense, and we have an  easy way to do it.   We could finish six of the seven appropriations bills right now while  we continue to debate these other issues. These bills are the product  of bipartisan compromise as the Republicans and Democrats have come  together. They provide billions of dollars in new resources to address  critical needs for the American people. They protect U.S. national  security. These six bills that we have already agreed on--Republicans  and Democrats--would provide much needed funding to help combat our  Nation's opioid epidemic and critical investments in infrastructure.  They would help us to rebuild our Nation's crumbling roads, bridges,  and highways. They would provide resources to protect the environment  and help ensure that the water we drink and the air we breathe is safe  and clean for this generation, for our children, and for the following  generation. They would also support key allies and national security  programs to enable the United States to be a global leader--a role that  is being increasingly challenged by China and Russia.   So I have to ask; is the President really going to hold the American  people hostage over a wall that he, time and again, has promised Mexico  will pay for? Is he really going to force hundreds of thousands of  Federal employees, including the very Agency he depends upon to carry  out his immigration enforcement policy, to work without pay over the  Christmas holiday? Is he really going to tell millions of Americans,  including his most ardent supporters, that he could care less whether  they are cut off from critical government services purely in the  service of his own vanity?   The President has, apparently, decided that fighting a symbolic fight  for a shiny object is more important than keeping our government  running for the American people. It is the height of irresponsibility.   As negotiations with Chairman Shelby and Leader McConnell continue in  good faith, I am here this weekend to continue to talk with Members of  both parties, but we are all coming to the same conclusion. We can  agree easily, Republicans and Democrats, but we can only succeed if the  President decides to do what we have done, which is to put the country  first. The President of the United States owes that to the American  people. He owes reality, not rhetoric.   I don't see another Member seeking recognition.   I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in yesterday's New York  Times about Secretary Mattis be placed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Dec. 20, 2018]            Jim Mattis Was Right--Who Will Protect America Now?                          (By the Editorial Board)         The editorial board represents the opinions of the board,       its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the       newsroom and the Op-Ed section.        Jim Mattis is stepping down as defense secretary, a day       after President Trump overruled him and other top national       security advisers by ordering the rapid withdrawal of all       2,000 American ground troops from Syria. Mr. Mattis, a       retired four-star general, said in his letter of resignation       that his views on a number of foreign policy and defense       matters were fundamentally at odds with those of the       president.        Mr. Mattis did not specifically mention the president's       seemingly impulsive decision on Syria, but he and other top       aides were clearly caught by surprise. With Mr. Mattis's       departure, the last of the original group of grounded       professionals who have, with at least partial success,       restrained Mr. Trump on foreign and defense policy are now       gone.        It was less than three months ago that John Bolton, the       national security adviser, spelled out a broader mission for       the American troops in Syria.        At the time, it sounded like an authoritative statement of       official policy. Only, as is so often the case with Donald       Trump's chaotic presidency, it apparently wasn't.        On Wednesday, Mr. Trump summarily overruled Mr. Bolton and       the rest of his national security team with his abrupt and       dangerous troop withdrawal decision. The move, detached from       any broader strategic context or any public rationale, sowed       new uncertainty about America's commitment to the Middle       East, its willingness to be a global leader and Mr. Trump's       role as commander in chief.        It appears to have been the final straw for Mr. Mattis, who       has walked a tightrope for the past two years between his       training and his conscience, and the whims of his president.       He kept his concerns mainly to himself, while slow-walking a       number of Mr. Trump's demands, like banning transgender       troops and seeking a full-dress military parade down       Pennsylvania Avenue.        Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the       Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a tweet that Mr.       Mattis's departure was ``scary.'' He called him ``an island       of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.''        Soldiers have a duty to follow their leader and carry out       lawful orders. But success depends on trusting that the       leader knows what he's doing and where he's going.        Sending conflicting orders to soldiers on the battlefield,       as Mr. Trump and his administration are doing, not only       hampers morale and undermines allied forces like the Syrian       Kurds, it could also risk getting American soldiers killed or       wounded for objectives their commanders had already       abandoned.        Even some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters were       alarmed. ``It is a major blunder,'' a Republican senator,       Marco Rubio of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ``If it isn't       reversed it will haunt this administration & America for       years to come.''        Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who       generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the       national security establishment were ``blindsided'' by the       announcement. He called for congressional hearings on the       decision.        This isn't the first time the president and his       administration have sent mixed messages. During the 2016       campaign, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw troops from Syria       and has been looking for a way do it ever since. In April, he       gave the Pentagon more time to complete the mission, which       since the Obama era has been strictly focused on finishing       off the Islamic State. Then Mr. Bolton arrived on the job and       declared that ``we're not going to leave as long as Iranian       troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian       proxies and militias.''        As late as Monday, James Jeffrey, the State Department's       Syria envoy, told the Atlantic Council that the United States       would stay in Syria until ISIS was defeated, Iranian       influence was curbed and there was a political solution to       the Syrian civil war.        But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump undercut his advisers, and       American interests, by reversing course and declaring in a       tweet, ``We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for       being there during the Trump Presidency.''        There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American       withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military       goal.        Mr. Trump's assertion that the Islamic State is defeated is       absurd. ``We have won against ISIS,'' he boasted in a video.       The ability of the terrorists to strike has been       significantly degraded and much of the territory they claimed       for their so-called caliphate has been liberated. But the       group still retains a pocket of land on the Syria-Iraq border       and has roughly 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, according to       military researchers. As Mr. Jeffrey said Monday, ``The job       is not yet done.''        No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer       than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has       thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal,       including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another       crisis that would draw the United States back into the       region.        An American withdrawal would also be a gift to Vladimir       Putin, the Russian leader, who has been working hard to       supplant American influence in the region and who, on       Thursday, enthusiastically welcomed the decision, saying,       ``Donald's right.'' Another beneficiary is Iran, which has       also expanded its regional footprint. It would certainly make       it harder for the Trump administration to implement its       policy of ratcheting up what it calls ``maximum pressure'' on       Iran.        Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish       troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to       fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey's       president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds       to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent       days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in       the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal       decision in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.  [[Page S8025]]         The American withdrawal worries Israel, anxious about       Iran's robust military presence in Syria, and Jordan, which       bears a considerable burden from Syrian refugees who fled the       fighting across the border. While Israel withheld criticism       of Mr. Trump's decision, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu       said his government would escalate the fight against Iranian-      aligned forces in Syria once the Americans leave.        Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly       vetted by a president's national security advisers. But       congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any       process was followed, and a senior White House official,       refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday,       ``The issue here is the president made a decision.''        Judging from the timing and tone of Mr. Mattis' letter of       resignation, the president made that decision alone.                           Tribute to James Mattis     Mr. President, like so many Republicans and Democrats, I  was stunned to hear that Secretary Mattis was going to be leaving.   I understand his reasons. He has said he always felt a duty to uphold  the interests and security of the United States and to uphold our  agreements with other countries for the security of democracy. The  President has disagreed with him on that. He feels otherwise. So  Secretary Mattis feels the President should be entitled to have  somebody who takes differing views.   Unfortunately, General Mattis's views are those that are the result  of decades of service to this country as a marine in combat, as a  marine commander, as a four-star general, and as one who has the strong  respect of Republicans and Democrats alike. Certainly, he has the  strong respect of those who have served in the military and who know  what it means to actually stand up for this country, not just in  rhetoric but by putting their lives on the line on the battlefield.   I will always admire General Mattis. I applaud his service to the  United States of America, and I know he is a man who can leave with his  head held high.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
