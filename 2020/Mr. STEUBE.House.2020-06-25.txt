 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to this bill and  House Democrats' completely partisan attempt at actual law enforcement  reform. They call it the Justice in Policing Act, but this legislation  would not achieve justice for anyone. Instead, it would promote anarchy  and put our law enforcement officers' lives at risk. It would end legal  protection for our officers who actually follow their training and  protocol. It would take essential weapons and protective equipment away  from our police.   In a time like today where law enforcement officers are ambushed and  targeted just because of their profession, we are going take away their  ability to receive protective equipment?   So not only do the Democrats want to take away an officer's legal  protection if they follow their training and protocol, then they want  to take away their protective vests, protective shields, and protective  vehicles they get in military transfers that physically protect our  officers from bullets--none of which has anything to do with George  Floyd's death.   How does this make any sense? I can tell you it doesn't make any  sense to the mass majority of Americans who trust that someone will be  there when they call 911.   This legislation comes from the same party who has been calling to  defund the police. Members of this very body have called to defund our  police officers and our police departments.   I have to ask my colleagues how they think that would help. Defunding  the police won't solve any problems and only poses an extraordinary  risk to our citizens who depend on society's most basic governmental  service of protecting life and property.   This is nothing more than an outburst of political emotion and a  willingness to take advantage of civil unrest.   This civil unrest is not constructive; it is anarchy. It also does  not take into account the hundreds of thousands of good police officers  risking everything to keep us safe, officers like Julian Keen, Jr.,  from my State of Florida.   Unfortunately, you will never hear about the tragic death of this  Black officer in the mainstream media. It doesn't fit the left's  narrative, so they ignore it. However, in Florida, we will never forget  Officer Keen, who was laid to rest this week, and the positive  influence that he had on our community. After the criminal who killed  him found out that he was a police officer in plain clothes, he pulled  out a gun and killed him.   So it begs the question: Who is really responsible for the flaws in  law enforcement protocols? All of these departments with all of these  problems and issues are all run by Democratic commissions and  Democratic city councils.   This is not a Federal issue. This is a Minneapolis police issue or an  Atlanta police issue or a Ferguson issue or a Chicago issue, where just  this past weekend they had one of the most violent weekends over  Father's Day weekend.    This is an issue with Democratic leadership in these cities that have  failed to keep up with standards, training, and protocol. Some of these  departments have training standards dating back to the eighties.   ``Why?'' you ask. Because their Democratic leadership has failed to  make necessary reforms in their departments.   And now it is the Federal Government's role to police local police  departments run by a Democratic city council or commission? Will those  commissions and leaders ever be held accountable?   Everyone in this Chamber wants justice for George Floyd and his  family, and they will get that in a court of law, where justice  belongs.   If the Democratic majority truly wants to reform our police  departments and if they truly want to fix the problems, then the focus  should be on the agencies with the problems and their leadership, not  passing a progressive messaging bill in an election year that they know  has no chance of becoming law.   This legislation doesn't get justice for anyone. Instead, it fails to  address the real underlying problems, while attempting to vilify our  law enforcement officers. It won't go anywhere in the Senate, and it  certainly won't go to the President's desk. So let's call it what it  is: a political messaging bill.   The longer we spend on this, the more time we waste not working on  actual, tangible solutions. Time to put  [[Page H2473]]  politics aside and work on real solutions where the problems are  actually located.                                time  1630
