 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, here is how Washington Democrats are  describing the American economy. From the White House last month:  ``robust economic progress under President Biden's leadership.''  According to President Biden himself, our economy has ``unique  strengths that we can build on,'' that it was ``providing important  breathing room for American families,'' and that it was ``strong as can  be but for inflation, but for gas and food.'' The economy is as strong  as it can be except that pesky thing: the worst inflation in more than  40 years. You almost have to laugh at that analysis.   Contrast the Democrats' spin with how working Americans are  describing our economy. From a grocery store manager in Tennessee:  ``It's just not a good situation.'' From a grandmother in Georgia:  ``The food, the gas, the bills, and the mortgage, everything. . . .  It's a lot on a family.'' Overall, a majority of Americans are  concerned their paycheck can't cover the essentials amidst inflation,  and a majority  [[Page S3709]]  disapprove of what President Biden is doing about it.   Clearly, something isn't adding up, but that isn't a new feature of  Washington Democrats' one-party control of government. In fact, missing  the mark on economic policy has been a hallmark of the Biden  administration. Last spring, they misread what it needed after a once- in-a-century pandemic and flooded the engine with trillions in liberal  spending. Then, they missed the warning signs of the runaway inflation  that that mistake brought on. Now, they are mounting a panicked  campaign to redefine the word ``recession'' before the next quarterly  GDP comes out tomorrow.   So Washington Democrats seem to think the real-world effects of their  policies--the pain Americans are feeling as they try to balance  household budgets--can just be spun away--spun away--with talking  points. Well, I can tell you there are millions of working families who  wish it were, in fact, that simple, but you know full well that it  isn't.                               Border Security    Mr. President, now on a different matter, yesterday, I met with  members of the Kentucky Narcotics Officers Association to discuss the  ongoing substance abuse crisis in my home State. These frontline  professionals have watched Kentucky pass some grim milestones in recent  years. This is one of the most horrifying consequences of the ongoing  breakdown of law and order in our country.   In 2020, overdose deaths in the Commonwealth increased nearly 50  percent from the year prior, reaching an alltime high of 1,964. Then,  last year, we broke that record again, recording 2,250 overdose  deaths--14.5 percent higher than in 2020.   Remember, as of this past January, 2 years into the pandemic,  fentanyl alone had killed more Americans aged 18 to 45 than the  coronavirus. That is not even all overdoses; that is just fentanyl  alone.   The Kentucky law enforcement officers with whom I got to visit work  every day to try to reverse these heart-wrenching trends. They have had  some success. Earlier this month, in Louisville, law enforcement seized  a full kilogram of fentanyl in Louisville. The experts say that is  enough to kill half a million people in Louisville alone. But they are  struggling to stem the cascade of narcotics pouring into our streets.  The reason for this, they told me, is pretty clear: our unsecured  borders.   Already this year, our overwhelmed Customs and Border Patrol agents  encountered more than 1.6 million illegal crossers down at the border.  That is close to the total number of encounters for the entirety of  last year. Some of these individuals were promptly detained and  deported, but many of them were booked briefly and then released into  the American heartland. Presumably, we will never hear from most of  them ever again. These are just the known encounters, to say nothing of  the 900,000 ``got-aways'' that DHS officials think have taken place  since the beginning of the last fiscal year. Put another way, a group  of people larger than the entire population in my hometown broke into  our country without interacting with border agents at all.   Alongside this human tide is an ever-increasing flood of illicit  drugs, most notably fentanyl. That drug played a role in 72 percent of  overdoses in Kentucky last year. CBP officials have seized 5,722 pounds  of the stuff this year alone. Imagine how much slipped through their  fingers and onto our streets.   Are Democrats admitting this is an emergency? Are they working  overtime to put a tourniquet on this crisis? Just the opposite.  Secretary Mayorkas jetted to a summit in Aspen earlier this month and  pronounced that ``the border is secure.'' That is our Secretary of  Homeland Security. Maybe that kind of talk plays well at a ritzy ski  resort packed with liberals. It doesn't play very well with law  enforcement and first responders in States like Kentucky who have to  deal with crime and fatal drug overdoses every single day. The far left  throws our borders open for ideological reasons, and it is the most  vulnerable communities that end up paying the deadly price.   The president of the National Border Patrol Council has directly  contradicted the Biden administration's insistence that our southern  border is in great shape. Here is what he had to say. This is the  president of the National Border Patrol Council:         [T]he cartels use illegal border crossers to facilitate       their higher value contraband, including . . . fentanyl.    In other words, more illegal immigration means more of this illegal  poison. But President Biden and Washington Democrats simply won't admit  it. Their response to the border crisis has been to issue new internal  guidance encouraging border personnel to use more politically correct  language when they are referring to criminal aliens. They would rather  police language than police the border.   Remember, the Biden administration spent taxpayer dollars going to  court, arguing they have a right to end the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy  and throw our borders open even wider. President Biden tried to cut  funding for ICE in his most recent budget.   Washington liberals say the compassionate policy is to lure desperate  people into inhumane conditions, let the drug cartels have open season,  and let Americans die as a result. That is not compassion; that is  cruelty--an abdication of duty with deadly consequences for the  American people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, over the past two decades, one man has  revolutionized law enforcement in Kentucky's Oldham County and built a  reputation as one of the Commonwealth's best sheriffs. Steve Sparrow  has served as Oldham County's sheriff since 1999 and, in his time  leading the county's police force, has brought professionalism,  dedication, and, above all, devotion to the rule of law to his  community. This year, Sheriff Sparrow is retiring from his post. I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring his career and the lasting legacy  he built in Oldham County.   Sheriff Sparrow began his career in law enforcement nearly 50 years  ago, at a time when Oldham County's population was less than a quarter  of its current size. As this burgeoning community expanded into one of  Kentucky's fastest growing counties, Sheriff Sparrow's leadership  helped Oldham County maintain its reputation for safety and  neighborliness. Under his purview, the area remains one of the most  desirable places to live in the Commonwealth.   Sheriff Sparrow didn't achieve this high level of law enforcement  efficacy by accident. As sheriff, he dedicated himself to furthering  professional training for both himself and his department. He is the  only sheriff in Oldham County history to have trained at a certified  law enforcement academy and the only Oldham County sheriff to have  graduated from the National Sheriff's Institute. He brought similar  high levels of training to his department, making Oldham County  Sheriff's Office the fifth in the Commonwealth to achieve accreditation  standards.   In recognition of Sheriff Sparrow's hard work to improve Oldham  County's police department, the Kentucky Sheriff's Association named  Sheriff Sparrow their president in both 2005 and 2012. He received  additional praise and leadership roles from Kentucky's Governor, the  Kentucky Law Enforcement Board of Directors, and the National Sheriff's  Association Board of Directors. Oldham County voters also strongly  approved of Sheriff Sparrow's performance, reelecting him to his office  six times in a row.   Leaders around the Commonwealth will be sad to see Sheriff Sparrow  leave his role. He has been one of my closest partners in the law  enforcement community, and I have been proud to lean on his expertise  to back the blue at the Federal level. Though we will all miss Sheriff  Sparrow's leadership, I know he will put his retirement to good use,  spending more time with his wife Dotty and their children and  grandchildren. On behalf of the Senate, I share our congratulations  with Sheriff Sparrow for achieving this milestone and wish him the best  in this next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
