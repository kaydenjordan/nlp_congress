 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Holocaust  Remembrance Day in memory of the 6 million Jews who were systematically  hunted down, rounded up, and murdered in cold blood by the Nazi regime  and their evil collaborators.   Millions of other innocent civilians were also targeted by the Nazis,  including people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ community,  Roma, Sinti, Slavs, and any other person deemed to be inferior by  Adolph Hitler and his coconspirators. And yet, Mr. Speaker, the anti- Semitism that fueled the Nazi's genocidal campaign sadly is still alive  and well today.   According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were 2,717 anti- Semitic incidents in the United States last year, averaging more than  seven incidents per day. That is the highest number ever recorded by  the ADL since it began tracking anti-Semitic incidents in 1979. More  than 75 years after the Holocaust, that is plainly unacceptable.   On this day, Yom HaShoah, we must recommit ourselves to rooting out  anti-Semitism wherever we find it. We must never forget the atrocities  of the Holocaust.                            ____________________
